<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="4189490c" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default">
					<p>LaLiga, Spain’s top football league, is facing a firestorm of criticism after boasting about a staggering 142% increase in anti-piracy takedown notices in early 2025 while simultaneously causing <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/laliga-seeks-charges-against-google-and-apple-execs-for-not-remotely-removing-apps-from-peoples-phones">extensive collateral damage across the internet</a>.</p>
<p>As the 2025/2026 season began on August 15, LaLiga ramped up its enforcement strategy, triggering widespread outages for entirely lawful websites, services, and platforms.</p>
<p>These disruptions are tied to a controversial anti-piracy scheme operated in partnership with telecom giant Telefónica.</p>
<p>The initiative, which enjoys judicial backing in Spain, allows LaLiga to instruct major internet service providers, including Movistar, Vodafone, Orange, and DIGI, to block IP addresses suspected of hosting unauthorized streams.</p>
<p>The fallout is that entire chunks of the internet go dark for Spanish users, often during match broadcasts.</p>
<p>LaLiga doesn’t target specific infringing content. Instead, it flags entire IP ranges, many of which are shared by thousands of unrelated domains.</p>
<p>When one site is accused of hosting pirated material, everyone else sharing that IP address gets swept up in the block.</p>
<p>The result is a digital dragnet that has ensnared companies as diverse as Amazon, Cloudflare, GitHub, Twitch, and even Google Fonts.</p>
<p><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/end-game-twitch-servers-among-hundreds-blocked-for-piracy-by-spanish-isps-250504/">TorrentFreak</a> has documented repeated weekly blocks of platforms <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/laliga-spain-internet-censorship-vercel-blocking-piracy-shield">like Vercel since early 2025</a>, while Catalonia’s own .cat domain registry has also reported service disruptions.</p>
<p>The issue became so disruptive that iXsystems, the team behind TrueNAS, a widely used open-source NAS operating system, was forced to shift its distribution model entirely. After its CDN IPs were repeatedly blocked in Spain, making critical security updates inaccessible to users, the developers resorted to distributing their software via BitTorrent.</p>
<p>“These locks have a significant collateral damage about legitimate services, which have nothing to do with football piracy,” TrueNAS noted. Their solution not only bypasses censorship but hands the bandwidth burden back to the same ISPs complicit in the blocking.</p>
<p>In TrueNAS’s official community forums, users from Spain, Italy, and France reported ongoing issues with downloads and connectivity.</p>
<p>Some turned to VPNs to circumvent the blocks, though even popular providers like Cloudflare’s free WARP service were reportedly blocked during peak match times.</p>
<p>LaLiga, meanwhile, continues to tout its enforcement record. A self-published report revealed that over 26 million takedown notices were sent in the first half of 2025 alone, more than doubling the total from all of 2024.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/A9zZxeOZndng.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a translated tweet from LaLiga reporting anti‑piracy results: it says detection of piracy in live sports reached historic numbers, a 142% increase in notifications to digital intermediaries in the first half of 2025 versus all of 2024, and a 60% reduction in piracy in the 24/25 season, above a coral‑bordered white graphic that reads NOTA INFORMATIVA and LALIGA." width="884" height="952" srcset="https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/A9zZxeOZndng.jpg 884w, https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/A9zZxeOZndng-279x300.jpg 279w, https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/A9zZxeOZndng-768x827.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 884px) 100vw, 884px"></p>
<p>Yet despite this surge, only 11% of flagged streams were actually taken offline. LaLiga’s primary targets include hosting services and infrastructure providers, where enforcement remains minimal.</p>
<p>Legal challenges to the league’s blocking strategy are piling up. Cloudflare and RootedCON have taken their grievances to Spain’s Constitutional Court after lower courts refused to curb the overreach.</p>
<p>Despite mounting pressure, there is no indication that the blanket blocking will stop. On the contrary, as the new season unfolds, users are bracing for more censorship.</p>
<p>Calls for reform are growing louder. Opponents of the regime argue that the current system punishes lawful users while failing to meaningfully curb piracy.</p>
<p>As long as courts uphold LaLiga’s authority to dictate who gets to be online during football games, entire swaths of the internet will remain at risk, collateral in a campaign that blurs the line between protection and overreach.</p>
<p>The reality is clear. LaLiga’s war on piracy has become a war on the open web.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>The University of Oxford has fallen out of the top three universities in the UK for the first time, according to <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk-university-rankings/feature-guide/article/best-good-university-guide-2026-nlg69hm5k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>The Times and The Sunday Times Good University Guide for 2026</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Both Oxford and Cambridge universities have been supplanted by Durham University, which now holds the third-place spot among the top universities in the UK.</p>



<p>Oxford and Cambridge are tied for fourth in the 2026 rankings, after falling due to their relatively poor performance in the latest National Student Survey.</p>



<p>Durham University was named The Times’s University of the Year, although the number-one ranked university in the UK remained the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) for the second year in a row.</p>



<p>Second place was held by the University of St Andrews, again for the second consecutive year.</p>



<p>While the University of St Andrews ranked very highly in student experience and teaching quality, it lost out to the LSE in graduate prospects and research quality.</p>



<p>Durham University improved by 30 places year-on-year in its students’ evaluation of teaching quality, which was the main driver in securing its third place in the overall university league table.</p>



<p>“Durham is an outstanding place to study. We ensure that every student can grow and thrive here,” said Durham University Vice-Chancellor Professor Karen O’Brien.</p>



<p>“Our loyal, engaged alumni are testament to the impressive career prospects that await our graduates.”</p>



<p>The table below shows the top 20 universities in the United Kingdom, according to The Times University Rankings 2026.</p>

		<p>Why does Space Station 14 crash with ANGLE on ARM64? 6 hours later…</p>
<p>So. I’ve been continuing work on getting ARM64 builds out for Space Station 14. The thing I was working on yesterday were launcher builds, specifically a <em>single</em> download that supports both ARM64 and x64. I’d already gotten the game client itself running natively on ARM64, and it worked perfectly fine in my dev environment. I wrote all the new launcher code, am pretty sure I got it right. Zip it up, test it on ARM64, aaand…</p>
<p>The game client crashes on Windows ARM64. Both in my VM and on Julian’s real Snapdragon X laptop.</p>
<h2 id="debugging-logs">
	<a href="#debugging-logs">
		Debugging: logs
	</a>
</h2><p>The client logs are empty. They suspiciously cut out right after SDL is initialized.</p>
<p>Of course it isn’t that easy.</p>

</p>
<p>So at first I decided to start <code>Space Station 14 Launcher.exe</code> directly through WinDbg. This is annoying because I have to go into child processes (with <code>.childdbg 1</code>) twice, and for some reason there’s a lot of waiting, but it does work…</p>
<p>The game crashes in <code>USER32!GetDC</code> on an <em>illegal instruction</em>, somewhere after SDL does <em>something</em>. I barely glanced at the disassembly but it made no sense to me, so I just assumed there’s some UB happening and didn’t think much of it. After all, <em>why would the implementation of <code>GetDC()</code> have broken assembly?</em></p>

<p>WinDbg was also unable to pull stack frames from C# code. It did, thankfully, clearly communicate <em>why</em> this was. Yep, it’s our friend&nbsp;<a href="https://slugcat.systems/post/24-11-20-why-should-you-download-more-ram/"><code>mscordaccore</code></a> again!</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="plain"><span><span>CLRDLL: Consider using ".cordll -lp &lt;path&gt;" command to specify .NET runtime directory.

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>However, my attempts to actually follow said instructions were completely fruitless, giving this error:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Why is it trying to run an <code>AMD64</code> binary? Wait is WinDbg not natively compiled for ARM64? <em>Sigh</em>. Let’s just do it without C# debugging, I can probably manage based off the SDL stack trace. So I pull <a href="https://moon.spacestation14.com/natives/SDL3/3.2.20/win-arm64/"><code>SDL3.pdb</code> from our server</a>, drop it next to <code>SDL3.dll</code>, and then use the UI to reload the symbols. And that gets us a bit further, we now have proper function names for SDL3!</p>

<p>So I double click one of the entries in the UI’s stack trace view. And the entire debugger breaks. Stack trace view goes empty. Every action I try to make causes more of these errors to be printed:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="plain"><span><span>Machine is not a possible execution machine
</span></span><span><span>Unable to get current machine context, HRESULT 0x8000FFFF
</span></span><span><span>Machine is not a possible execution machine

</span></span><span><span>Machine is not a possible execution machine
</span></span><span><span>Machine is not a possible execution machine
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now even WinDbg is broken??</p>
<p>Googling these errors gave nothing useful. One of them gave <em>not a single result</em>. After just pondering the error for a moment, I thought “wait, why is the command prompt still saying <code>ARM64EC&gt;</code>? ARM64EC is for emulation, but the active debugger processes (<code>SS14.Launcher.exe</code> and <code>SS14.Loader.exe</code>) are both native ARM64.</p>
<p>Turns out that it’s because I started <code>Space Station 14 Launcher.exe</code> directly. You see, that executable is x64 native, and its only job is to set up the .NET environment and launch the <em>actual</em> ARM64 executable. Something about <em>starting</em> the debugging session with that program causes WinDbg to get extremely confused when later looking at the child processes it spawns.</p>
<p>From this point on I just started launching <code>SS14.Launcher.exe</code> directly<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. This means I wasn’t setting up the same <code>DOTNET_ROOT</code> (because WinDbg can’t set environment variables when launching things… yes really), but this didn’t really matter. This fixed both the “Machine is not a possible execution machine” errors <em>and</em> the issues with showing C# stack traces. I guess WinDbg is compiled for ARM64 after all, and it just decided to run an x64 debug host when you start debugging an x64 application. Fair enough I guess?</p>
<h2 id="debugging-whats-sdl-doing">
	<a href="#debugging-whats-sdl-doing">
		Debugging: what’s SDL doing?
	</a>
</h2><p>After figuring out all of the above, we could <em>really</em> get started. I also opted to swap out <code>SDL3.dll</code> with a locally-built copy, so that the debugger could locate source files<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. What SDL is doing is pretty straight forward: the first time the window is shown, it clears the background with GDI commands:</p>

</picture>
</p>
<p>I mean… this is like, fine, right? I mean I don’t know much about this code, but why would this crash on ARM but not x64??? The window is valid. <code>GetDC()</code> is an extremely fundamental Win32 function call. If there was something broken with it, my OS would not be usable. What the fuck is going on?</p>
<p>The <code>if (ShouldClearWindowOnEraseBackground(data))</code> allows it to be disabled via a hint, which can be specified by environment variable. This fixes the crash… until you open a second OS window, then SDL3 calls <code>GetDC()</code> once again and <em>that</em> crashes. Not a solution.</p>
<p>So I checked the actual <code>USER32!GetDC</code> again, and this time I actually paid attention to the disassembly code instead of glossing over it. What the fuck? <code>pacibsp</code> is missing at the start. It’s loading an address for a jump that only jumps to <em>the next instruction</em>, which is <em>invalid</em>. In some runs, said instruction was instead a broken <code>x26</code>-relative <code>str</code> instruction that AV’d because the register was all zeroes.</p>
<p>At this point let’s introduce the villain. You might have noticed it in the call stack: <code>DXGI!My_GetDC</code>.</p>
<figure><img src="https://slugcat.systems/post/25-09-21-dxgi-debugging-microsoft-put-me-on-a-list/windbg_disasm_2.webp" alt="WinDbg disassembly for DXGI!MyDC. The word &amp;quot;Detour&amp;quot; is clearly visible"><figcaption>
      <p>Microsoft is detouring their <em>own code???</em></p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For those who aren’t well-versed in DirectX stuff: <em>DXGI</em> is a fundamental part of DirectX ever since DirectX 10 (Vista). For those who have never modded a game before: a <em>detour</em> is a hack that injects instructions into other functions at runtime, to do evil shit. Why the <em>hell</em> is Microsoft using this in DXGI?</p>
<h2 id="debugging-dxgi-despair">
	<a href="#debugging-dxgi-despair">
		Debugging: DXGI despair
	</a>
</h2><p>Through the debugging adventure, I ended up putting a breakpoint on every call to <code>USER32!GetDC</code>. The first few calls are fine, but then the <em>last</em> one, the one that crashes, is not.</p>
<p>At this point I got really desperate. “Asking in low-level programming Discords”-level desperate. I ended up asking for help in the <a href="https://discord.gg/directx">DirectX Discord</a> (yes, there’s an official DirectX Discord, and there’s many MS employees in there).</p>
<section aria-label="Thought" aria-role="Thought">
<p>I would like to thank Jesse Natalia from the DirectX Discord for responding swiftly to my messages in there.</p>
</section>
<p>After some back and forth there, I wanted to catch DXGI in the act. Maybe that would tell me something, I don’t know. So with a simple <code>ba w4 USER32!GetDC</code>, I put a hardware breakpoint for whenever something would <em>write</em> to <code>USER32!GetDC</code>. I did have to awkwardly “run the program for just a little bit” because <code>USER32.dll</code> isn’t loaded immediately at program startup.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<section aria-label="Thought" aria-role="Thought">
<p>While writing this blog post I realized there <em>is</em> an intelligent way to do this. It’s called <code>sxe ld USER32.dll</code>. I’ve literally written about it <a href="https://slugcat.systems/post/25-03-18-virtual-reality-projection-shenanigans/"><em>in this blog before</em></a>. Oops.</p>

</picture>
</p>
<p>Now this is very interesting. The bottom of the stack trace is quite expected: SDL creates a window, uses ANGLE’s EGL implementation for this, that does a bunch of stuff, and eventually creates a DXGI swapchain. But then what is <code>UpgradeSwapEffect</code>? And why is it installing a detour?</p>
<p>Ah, I already know what this is.</p>

Been out of the DXGI code for too long” “is this related to whatever the thing in windows 11 is that forces flip model on software (ANGLE […] create flip model swap chains when using its own swap chain management)” “Yes”">

</p>
<h2 id="optimizing-windowed-games-flip-model">
	<a href="#optimizing-windowed-games-flip-model">
		Optimizing windowed games: flip model
	</a>
</h2><p>Right. So. DirectX.</p>
<p>When you create a DirectX swapchain, you specify an “<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/dxgi/ne-dxgi-dxgi_swap_effect">effect</a>”, which falls into two categories: “bitblt” and “flip”. To make a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3ddxgi/for-best-performance--use-dxgi-flip-model#a-brief-history">long story short</a>: bitblt is the “original” one, while flip is the much more modern one added in Windows 8<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. It’s more efficient and performant, and all software should be using it. Furthermore, on modern versions of Windows and with a GPU supporting “<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/display/multiplane-overlay-support">Multiplane Overlays</a>”, flip model actually enables windowed games to be displayed with <em>zero additional latency</em> over “exclusive” fullscreen mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, many games never get updated, or they’re stuck on an ancient version. And many of these games don’t care. So in Windows 11, Microsoft added “<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/optimizations-for-windowed-games-in-windows-11-3f006843-2c7e-4ed0-9a5e-f9389e535952">Optimizations for windowed games</a>”, which forcibly enables flip model on games that are still using bitblt. Why does DXGI need to install detours for this? Probably some compatibility shit with the bitblt model. I don’t have any deep knowledge of how Win32 GDI stuff works, but it’s not hard for me to imagine there’s some interplay here they need to take care of. I can also confirm that <em>disabling</em> the feature in Windows’ settings menu fixes the crash!</p>
<p>If you’re wondering why SS14 isn’t using flip model: it’s because we can’t. We’re not creating the swapchain directly, <em>ANGLE</em> is. And ANGLE is continuing to use <code>SWAP_EFFECT_SEQUENTIAL</code>. I actually once <a href="https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox/blob/ac3cb4dc2abe970e611b944b252504e602303dfe/Robust.Client/Graphics/Clyde/GLContext/GLContextAngle.cs">experimented with SS14 managing the swapchain</a>, but this ran into some ANGLE limitations and I never got around to ironing out all the edge cases and crashes. I’d rather just spend the brain power on ditching OpenGL, rather than trying to continue working with this broken API.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>So here we are. The entire debugging story so far, you’re like, “surely Microsoft didn’t break DXGI on ARM64, huh???” But now it’s becoming plausible. There’s barely any native ARM64 Windows games, and surely none that are using bitblt swapchains. And guess what, you don’t even <em>need</em> <code>GetDC()</code> for modern DirectX games. SDL does it because it’s heavily designed for OpenGL. Most games run in x64 emulation, and that presumably works fine. Everything adds up to it being possible this just genuinely fell under the radar at Microsoft.</p>
<p>This should be pretty easy to verify in a minimal example. I cloned an <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DirectX-SDK-Samples/blob/main/C%2B%2B/Direct3D11/Tutorials/Tutorial01/Tutorial01.cpp">old DirectX SDK sample</a>, updated it to be compiled for ARM64, added some <code>GetDC()</code> calls, aaand… nope, no crash. Then I spent quite a while <em>trying various stuff</em>: comparing the swapchain creation code with that of ANGLE, changing various parameters, verifying whether the detour was being installed (it wasn’t). But eventually, I did find it.</p>
<p>It’s the filename.</p>
<p>Of course it’s the goddamn filename.</p>
<h2 id="im-on-a-list">
	<a href="#im-on-a-list">
		I’m on a list
	</a>
</h2><p><strong>It only happens when the program is called <code>SS14.Loader.exe</code>.</strong></p>
<p>The final piece of the puzzle. It didn’t happen in a dev environment because then the exe isn’t named <code>SS14.Loader.exe</code>. Microsoft only enables “Optimizations for windowed games” on a specific list of games. And guess what, <em>none</em> of those select games are on ARM64, at least until I was unfortunate enough to port mine. How did we get on the list? Who knows.</p>
<p>Microsoft put me on a list, that ships with every Windows install. And this list actually broke my game. Achievement unlocked!</p>

	<a href="#addendum-why-angle-and-about-opengl-on-windows-arm64">
		Addendum: why ANGLE, and about OpenGL on Windows ARM64
	</a>
</h2><p>Traditionally, OpenGL on Windows has been implemented by the 3 IHVs (Nvidia, AMD, Intel). If they didn’t explicitly go out of their way to add it to their drivers, you’d have no OpenGL beyond 1.0. Those new Snapdragon X devices, however, use Microsoft’s new-ish “OpenGL on D3D12” driver. It’s actually part of Mesa!</p>
<p>The problem with Space Station 14 is that said driver is broken for us, causing severe graphical artifacts and flickering. I had been aware of this for years, because the same driver is used for the GPU acceleration of WSL2, but I never bothered to report it 😬. So for the purpose of porting SS14 to ARM64 Windows, I decided to just immediately force on ANGLE on Qualcomm devices, and call it a day.</p>
<p>What I didn’t know until yesterday is that the OpenGL on D3D12 driver does not ship with Qualcomm’s drivers! <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nqpsl29bfff?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US">It’s on the Microsoft store!</a> I can even install it in my VM and get it to emulate OpenGL on top of DirectX’s software renderer (WARP), just like I had been doing with ANGLE. I’ve finally bothered to <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/13936">report the graphical issues</a>, so hopefully it gets fixed eventually. If it does get fixed, Microsoft Store distribution means it shouldn’t take too long to trickle down to users, and then we can stop enforcing ANGLE on Qualcomm devices.</p>
<p>For Space Station 14, I will say that this means I’ll be postponing official Windows ARM64 support <em>for now</em>. At least until either bug (OpenGL on D3D12 <em>or</em> ARM64 DXGI detours) are fixed. Or when I finally rewrite the renderer to drop OpenGL, that’s also an option.</p>
<h2 id="addendum-clarifications">

		Addendum: clarifications

</h2><p>(This bit added a few hours after publishing)</p>
<ul>
<li>“Why not just rename the <code>.exe</code> on ARM”: what I didn’t mention is that Steamworks does not support ARM64 Linux or Windows, at the moment. That means ARM64 builds will not be on Steam regardless, and I didn’t feel like going through even more the effort to add <em>a</em> workaround, just to improve performance for that 0.001% of people playing the game on a Snapdragon X device <em>while also downloading from our website</em>. And God forbid Microsoft updates the list later based on a bulk import of some random filenames and catches the new name too. The game already works when emulated, so I’m leaving it there until Windows is fixed.</li>

<h4>An excerpt from</h4>
<h2>They Thought They Were Free</h2>

<h3>Milton Mayer</h3>

<p><p><img src="https://press.uchicago.edu/Images/Chicago/dotclear.gif" width="420" height="2"></p></p>

<h5>But Then It Was Too Late</h5>

<p>"What no one seemed to notice," said a colleague of mine, a philologist, "was the ever widening gap, after 1933, between the government and the people. Just think how very wide this gap was to begin with, here in Germany. And it became always wider. You know, it doesn’t make people close to their government to be told that this is a people’s government, a true democracy, or to be enrolled in civilian defense, or even to vote. All this has little, really nothing, to do with <i>knowing</i> one is governing.</p>

<p>"What happened here was the gradual habituation of the people, little by little, to being governed by surprise; to receiving decisions deliberated in secret; to believing that the situation was so complicated that the government had to act on information which the people could not understand, or so dangerous that, even if the people could not understand it, it could not be released because of national security. And their sense of identification with Hitler, their trust in him, made it easier to widen this gap and reassured those who would otherwise have worried about it.</p>

<p>"This separation of government from people, this widening of the gap, took place so gradually and so insensibly, each step disguised (perhaps not even intentionally) as a temporary emergency measure or associated with true patriotic allegiance or with real social purposes. And all the crises and reforms (real reforms, too) so occupied the people that they did not see the slow motion underneath, of the whole process of government growing remoter and remoter.</p>

<p>"You will understand me when I say that my Middle High German was my life. It was all I cared about. I was a scholar, a specialist. Then, suddenly, I was plunged into all the new activity, as the university was drawn into the new situation; meetings, conferences, interviews, ceremonies, and, above all, papers to be filled out, reports, bibliographies, lists, questionnaires. And on top of that were the demands in the community, the things in which one had to, was ‘expected to’ participate that had not been there or had not been important before. It was all rigmarole, of course, but it consumed all one’s energies, coming on top of the work one really wanted to do. You can see how easy it was, then, not to think about fundamental things. One had no time."</p>

<p>"Those," I said, "are the words of my friend the baker. ‘One had no time to think. There was so much going on.’"</p>

<p>"Your friend the baker was right," said my colleague. "The dictatorship, and the whole process of its coming into being, was above all <i>diverting</i>. It provided an excuse not to think for people who did not want to think anyway. I do not speak of your ‘little men,’ your baker and so on; I speak of my colleagues and myself, learned men, mind you. Most of us did not want to think about fundamental things and never had. There was no need to. Nazism gave us some dreadful, fundamental things to think about—we were decent people—and kept us so busy with continuous changes and ‘crises’ and so fascinated, yes, fascinated, by the machinations of the ‘national enemies,’ without and within, that we had no time to think about these dreadful things that were growing, little by little, all around us. Unconsciously, I suppose, we were grateful. Who wants to think?</p>

<p>"To live in this process is absolutely not to be able to notice it—please try to believe me—unless one has a much greater degree of political awareness, acuity, than most of us had ever had occasion to develop. Each step was so small, so inconsequential, so well explained or, on occasion, ‘regretted,’ that, unless one were detached from the whole process from the beginning, unless one understood what the whole thing was in principle, what all these ‘little measures’ that no ‘patriotic German’ could resent must some day lead to, one no more saw it developing from day to day than a farmer in his field sees the corn growing. One day it is over his head.</p>

<p>"How is this to be avoided, among ordinary men, even highly educated ordinary men? Frankly, I do not know. I do not see, even now. Many, many times since it all happened I have pondered that pair of great maxims, <i>Principiis obsta</i> and <i>Finem respice</i>—‘Resist the beginnings’ and ‘Consider the end.’ But one must foresee the end in order to resist, or even see, the beginnings. One must foresee the end clearly and certainly and how is this to be done, by ordinary men or even by extraordinary men? Things <i>might</i> have. And everyone counts on that <i>might</i>.</p>

<p>"Your ‘little men,’ your Nazi friends, were not against National Socialism in principle. Men like me, who were, are the greater offenders, not because we <i>knew</i> better (that would be too much to say) but because we <i>sensed</i> better. Pastor Niemöller spoke for the thousands and thousands of men like me when he spoke (too modestly of himself) and said that, when the Nazis attacked the Communists, he was a little uneasy, but, after all, he was not a Communist, and so he did nothing; and then they attacked the Socialists, and he was a little uneasier, but, still, he was not a Socialist, and he did nothing; and then the schools, the press, the Jews, and so on, and he was always uneasier, but still he did nothing. And then they attacked the Church, and he was a Churchman, and he did something—but then it was too late."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said.</p>

<p>"You see," my colleague went on, "one doesn’t see exactly where or how to move. Believe me, this is true. Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You don’t want to act, or even talk, alone; you don’t want to ‘go out of your way to make trouble.’ Why not?—Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.</p>

<p>"Uncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it grows. Outside, in the streets, in the general community, ‘everyone’ is happy. One hears no protest, and certainly sees none. You know, in France or Italy there would be slogans against the government painted on walls and fences; in Germany, outside the great cities, perhaps, there is not even this. In the university community, in your own community, you speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, ‘It’s not so bad’ or ‘You’re seeing things’ or ‘You’re an alarmist.’</p>

<p>"And you <i>are</i> an alarmist. You are saying that <i>this</i> must lead to <i>this</i>, and you can’t prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you don’t know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have.</p>

<p>"But your friends are fewer now. Some have drifted off somewhere or submerged themselves in their work. You no longer see as many as you did at meetings or gatherings. Informal groups become smaller; attendance drops off in little organizations, and the organizations themselves wither. Now, in small gatherings of your oldest friends, you feel that you are talking to yourselves, that you are isolated from the reality of things. This weakens your confidence still further and serves as a further deterrent to—to what? It is clearer all the time that, if you are going to do anything, you must <i>make</i> an occasion to do it, and then you are obviously a troublemaker. So you wait, and you wait.</p>

<p>"But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. <i>That’s</i> the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked—if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in ’43 had come immediately after the ‘German Firm’ stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in ’33. But of course this isn’t the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.</p>

<p>"And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying ‘Jewish swine,’ collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.</p>

<p>"You have gone almost all the way yourself. Life is a continuing process, a flow, not a succession of acts and events at all. It has flowed to a new level, carrying you with it, without any effort on your part. On this new level you live, you have been living more comfortably every day, with new morals, new principles. You have accepted things you would not have accepted five years ago, a year ago, things that your father, even in Germany, could not have imagined.</p>

<p>"Suddenly it all comes down, all at once. You see what you are, what you have done, or, more accurately, what you haven’t done (for that was all that was required of most of us: that we do nothing). You remember those early meetings of your department in the university when, if one had stood, others would have stood, perhaps, but no one stood. A small matter, a matter of hiring this man or that, and you hired this one rather than that. You remember everything now, and your heart breaks. Too late. You are compromised beyond repair.</p>

<p>"What then? You must then shoot yourself. A few did. Or ‘adjust’ your principles. Many tried, and some, I suppose, succeeded; not I, however. Or learn to live the rest of your life with your shame. This last is the nearest there is, under the circumstances, to heroism: shame. Many Germans became this poor kind of hero, many more, I think, than the world knows or cares to know."</p>

<p>I said nothing. I thought of nothing to say.</p>

<p>"I can tell you," my colleague went on, "of a man in Leipzig, a judge. He was not a Nazi, except nominally, but he certainly wasn’t an anti-Nazi. He was just—a judge. In ’42 or ’43, early ’43, I think it was, a Jew was tried before him in a case involving, but only incidentally, relations with an ‘Aryan’ woman. This was ‘race injury,’ something the Party was especially anxious to punish. In the case at bar, however, the judge had the power to convict the man of a ‘nonracial’ offense and send him to an ordinary prison for a very long term, thus saving him from Party ‘processing’ which would have meant concentration camp or, more probably, deportation and death. But the man was innocent of the ‘nonracial’ charge, in the judge’s opinion, and so, as an honorable judge, he acquitted him. Of course, the Party seized the Jew as soon as he left the courtroom."</p>

<p>"And the judge?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the judge. He could not get the case off his conscience—a case, mind you, in which he had acquitted an innocent man. He thought that he should have convicted him and saved him from the Party, but how could he have convicted an innocent man? The thing preyed on him more and more, and he had to talk about it, first to his family, then to his friends, and then to acquaintances. (That’s how I heard about it.) After the ’44 <i>Putsch</i> they arrested him. After that, I don’t know."</p>

<p>I said nothing.</p>

<p>"Once the war began," my colleague continued, "resistance, protest, criticism, complaint, all carried with them a multiplied likelihood of the greatest punishment. Mere lack of enthusiasm, or failure to show it in public, was ‘defeatism.’ You assumed that there were lists of those who would be ‘dealt with’ later, after the victory. Goebbels was very clever here, too. He continually promised a ‘victory orgy’ to ‘take care of’ those who thought that their ‘treasonable attitude’ had escaped notice. And he meant it; <i>that</i> was not just propaganda. And that was enough to put an end to all uncertainty.</p>

<p>"Once the war began, the government could do anything ‘necessary’ to win it; so it was with the ‘final solution of the Jewish problem,’ which the Nazis always talked about but never dared undertake, not even the Nazis, until war and its ‘necessities’ gave them the knowledge that they could get away with it. The people abroad who thought that war against Hitler would help the Jews were wrong. And the people in Germany who, once the war had begun, still thought of complaining, protesting, resisting, were betting on Germany’s losing the war. It was a long bet. Not many made it."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>If you studied university in many parts of the Middle East, try asking yourself or any of your friends what their favorite part of university was, and a lot of them will say the dorm life, late-night conversations, or the campus freedom. Very few will tell you their favorite part was what they learned in class.</p>

<p>A few days ago, I was lazily browsing Hacker News when I came across a <a href="https://firstthings.com/math-is-erotic/#:~:text=The%20function%20universities%20have%20long%20played%20is%20less%20one%20of%20educating%20than%20of%20credentialing.">provocative</a> blog post titled “Math is Erotic.” Without going into too much detail about the contents of the post itself — which, for reference, has very little erotica — the part that really caught my attention was below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The function universities have long played is less one of educating than of credentialing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I studied Environmental Engineering in Jordan, and more than 10 years after graduating, the above resonates on a profound level with me. I assume a lot of people from the Arab world and South Asia would relate to this, too.</p>

<p>At the risk of sounding like yet another entrepreneur talking smack about university education, hear me out: the German Jordanian University, where I studied, was a conveyor belt clattering along slowly to secure jobs abroad for young Jordanians. As the name implies, engineering students were meant to spend 4 years in Jordan, and another mandatory year in Germany. It started as a joint project in 2005 between the governments of Jordan and Germany.</p>

<p>This university, mind you, is allegedly one of the best in Jordan. I had some of the highest grades in my class, but this came at the expense of learning very little about my actual courses. Getting good grades exclusively depended on your rote memorization skills the night before an exam. Not only do I remember nothing from what I studied<sup id="fnref:footnote"><a href="#fn:footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, I detested every minute of every subject I took there. Passing subjects was significantly more important than understanding them.</p>

<p>A typical Jordanian engineering student needs to serve an engineering sentence of 5 years, compared to 4 years of education in the US or 3 in England. Jordanian universities follow an archaic credit-hour system where at least a semester’s worth of useless subjects are crammed into your schedule. For example, everyone I know had to study “Military Science,” a semester-long 3-credit course with very little use outside of esoteric trivia about army hierarchy.</p>

<p>If you’re assuming that I’m implying that the system trades your time and money for empty credit hours, then you can collect your prize at the door. 21% of Jordanians are unemployed. That’s far above the global average of 4.9%. I’m sure the Ministry of Higher Education knows exactly what they’re doing, but from where I’m standing it looks like the plan is to keep people out of the workforce for as long as possible.</p>

<p>This is not to say that this specific university was not worth students’ money. Many of my peers secured jobs in Germany right after graduating. These people did their time and earned their credentials. The question remains, though: is this because of what they <strong>learned</strong> at university or because of being part of the German-Jordanian labor conveyor belt?</p>

<p>This isn’t a complaint, it’s an obituary for the education I could’ve had. My first jolt of confusion about university lectures was in 2012, during my foreign exchange year in Germany. I was in a classroom full of Environmental Engineering students who were there because they wanted to be there. I, on the other hand, was there because my dad thought engineering would be good for me. When I saw the passion with which the professor discussed fluid mechanics, and the students peppered him with genuine questions, I realized something simple but profound: people can actually be passionate about what they study, if it’s taught well and if they truly care about the subject.</p>

<p>Years later, I rediscovered what I really loved: learning for its own sake. In 2024, I came across the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/cs50">CS50 YouTube channel</a>, which is Harvard University’s introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. Even if I had no intention to learn anything about computer science, or C programming, I couldn’t stop watching it. The thought of being entertained by learning was so alien to me and yet there I was, binge-watching lectures on algorithms, memory, and bytecode.</p>

<p>Last month I spent 30 hours diving into Arduinos and following tutorials with a breadboard on my desk. Before that, I spent 8 months in Godot making small games. When I found out about Cursor, I coded a <a href="https://jaib.waliddib.com/">Pocket clone</a> after the original app <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/672924/mozilla-pocket-fakespot-shutting-down">shut down</a>. I even built a TikTok scraping API just because I could. None of this was for money. Not one single project.</p>

<p>But all of this learning came with its own kind of weight. The more I dabbled, the more I realized how much there was to learn. Each new subject made me feel both excited and lost. I would forget one topic as soon as I picked up the next, and the disparity between everything I explored left me frustrated. It was a strange sadness. The deeper I went, the further behind I felt.</p>

<p>Absolute joy turned into anger, and anger into resentment, as I wondered how different my life might have been if I’d been taught subjects I actually cared about by professors who cared too. Then I caught myself, realizing I was being melodramatic about a decade-old grievance.</p>

<p>I recently started to see learning a bit differently. I don’t need to feel guilty about learning with no end goal or finish line. My learning process is suboptimal at best, and I don’t have an Obsidian or Notion “Second Brain”.</p>

<p>Forgetting is fine. Losing track is fine. Nobody beats themselves up because they can’t recite scripts and scenes of their favorite movie or video game, so why should I remember exactly how <a href="https://www.waliddib.com/posts/godot-collision-layer-confusion/">layers work in Godot</a>?</p>

<p>What matters is that I keep finding new things to chase, new rabbit holes to fall into. The act of learning itself is such a rush, even if I find another shinier subject halfway through. I now have a new plan: acquire the financial freedom my little family needs to design my own syllabus and spend the rest of my life learning on my own terms.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://donado.co/en/articles/2025-09-16-vibe-coding-cleanup-as-a-service/">https://donado.co/en/articles/2025-09-16-vibe-coding-cleanup-as-a-service/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45320431">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> 
<p>A new service category is quietly emerging in tech: Vibe Coding cleanup. What started as LinkedIn jokes about “fixing AI messes” has become a real business opportunity. The harsh reality nobody wants to admit: <strong>most AI-generated code is production-unready</strong>, and companies are desperately hiring specialists to fix it before their technical debt spirals out of control.</p>
<h2 id="the-vibe-coding-explosion">The vibe coding explosion</h2>
<p>When Andrej Karpathy coined “vibe coding” in early 2025, he perfectly captured how developers now work: chatting with AI to generate entire functions instead of writing them. <a href="https://xygeni.io/blog/vibe-coding-trend-or-security-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The approach promises 10x productivity gains through natural language programming</a>. GitHub reports that <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/research/survey-ai-wave-grows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">92% of developers now use AI coding tools</a>, with Copilot alone generating billions of lines of code monthly.</p>
<p>But there’s a problem nobody talks about at conferences. <a href="https://www.gitclear.com/coding_on_copilot_data_shows_ais_downward_pressure_on_code_quality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitClear’s analysis of 150 million lines of code reveals AI assistance correlates with 41% more code churn</a> - code that gets reverted or rewritten within two weeks. Stanford researchers found that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03622" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developers using AI assistants produce significantly less secure code while believing it’s more secure</a>. The tools amplify bad practices: no input validation, outdated dependencies, and architectural decisions that make senior engineers weep.</p>
<h2 id="the-cleanup-economy-is-real">The cleanup economy is real</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.404media.co/the-software-engineers-paid-to-fix-vibe-coded-messes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">404 Media’s investigation reveals developers are building entire careers around fixing AI-generated code</a>. Hamid Siddiqi manages 15-20 cleanup projects simultaneously, charging premium rates to untangle what he calls “AI spaghetti” - inconsistent interfaces, redundant functions, and business logic that makes no sense. <a href="https://www.404media.co/the-software-engineers-paid-to-fix-vibe-coded-messes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Software consultancy Ulam Labs now advertises “Vibe Coding cleanup” as a core service</a>.</p>
<p>The demand is so high that <strong>VibeCodeFixers.com</strong> launched as a dedicated marketplace. Within weeks, 300 specialists signed up and dozens of projects were matched. Founder Swatantra Sohni describes a typical client: “They burned through $5,000 in OpenAI credits, have a half-working prototype they’re emotionally attached to, and need it production-ready yesterday.” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/06/a-quarter-of-startups-in-ycs-current-cohort-have-codebases-that-are-almost-entirely-ai-generated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch reports that 25% of Y Combinator’s current startup cohort has codebases that are 95% AI-generated</a>, highlighting the massive scale of this trend across Silicon Valley.</p>
<h2 id="why-ai-code-fails-at-scale">Why AI code fails at scale</h2>
<p>The fundamental issue isn’t that AI writes bad code - it’s that it writes locally optimized code without understanding system context. <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2024/06/10/generative-ai-is-not-going-to-build-your-engineering-team-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stack Overflow’s analysis shows AI excels at small, isolated tasks but fails at architectural decisions</a>. Every prompt creates technical debt: inconsistent patterns, duplicated logic, and security holes that automated scanners miss.</p>
<p><a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/cybersecurity-risks-of-ai-generated-code/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Georgetown University research shows that at least 48% of AI-generated code contains security vulnerabilities</a>. The tools leak secrets into code, suggest deprecated libraries, and create race conditions that only appear under load. Worse, developers often don’t understand the generated code well enough to spot these issues. <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-us/radar/techniques/complacency-with-ai-generated-code" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thoughtworks warns this creates “competency debt” - teams lose the ability to maintain their own systems</a> as they become dependent on AI-generated code they don’t fully understand.</p>
<h2 id="the-market-opportunity">The market opportunity</h2>
<p>The Vibe Coding cleanup market is growing rapidly, though exact numbers are hard to pin down. What we know: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-04-11-gartner-says-75-percent-of-enterprise-software-engineers-will-use-ai-code-assistants-by-2028" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gartner predicts 75% of enterprise software engineers will use AI code assistants by 2028</a>. If even a fraction of those projects need cleanup - and current data suggests most will - we’re looking at a massive emerging market.</p>
<p>The economics are compelling. Startups save weeks getting to MVP with Vibe Coding, then spend comparable time and budget on cleanup. But that’s still faster than traditional development. The specialists who can efficiently refactor AI messes command $200-400/hour rates. Some are building productized services: fixed-price cleanup packages, AI code audits, and “vibe-to-production” pipelines.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-us/radar/techniques/complacency-with-ai-generated-code" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thoughtworks reports that refactoring activity has declined while code churn increases with AI assistance</a>, with most AI-assisted projects requiring significant cleanup before production. Multiple consultancies are now hiring specifically for “AI code remediation” roles. The market is real, growing, and largely untapped.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-means-for-engineering">What this means for engineering</h2>
<p>We’re witnessing a fundamental shift in how software gets built. AI handles the initial implementation, humans handle architecture, testing, and cleanup. It’s not the future we expected, but it’s the one we’re getting.</p>
<p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/how-ai-will-change-software-engineering" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gergely Orosz argues AI tools are like “very eager junior developers” - they write code quickly but need constant supervision</a>. The difference is that AI juniors never become seniors. They’ll always need cleanup specialists.</p>
<p>This creates interesting career paths. Junior developers who master Vibe Coding cleanup can command senior salaries within two years. Senior engineers who understand both AI capabilities and limitations become invaluable. Companies that build robust cleanup processes gain competitive advantage.</p>
<h2 id="our-stance">Our stance</h2>
<p>At <strong>Donado Labs</strong>, we’ve cleaned up enough vibe-coded disasters to recognize the pattern. AI acceleration works, but only with professional cleanup built into the process. We use AI for prototyping and routine tasks, but architecture and critical logic remain human-written. Our “Vibe to Production” service takes AI prototypes and makes them enterprise-ready: proper testing, security hardening, and documentation that won’t make your successor cry.</p>
<p>The companies succeeding with AI coding aren’t the ones using it most - they’re the ones using it smartly. They prototype with AI, then invest in cleanup before technical debt compounds. They treat Vibe Coding like any other tool: powerful but dangerous without expertise.</p>
<p>Next time someone claims AI will replace programmers, ask them who’s going to clean up the code. That’s where the real opportunity lies.</p> </div></div>]]></description>

<p>To be honest, we were holding our breath for the iPhone Air. Thinner usually means flimsier, harder to fix, and more glued-down parts. But the iPhone Air proves otherwise. Apple has somehow built its thinnest iPhone ever without tanking repairability.</p>



<p>Just a few months ago, Samsung’s <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/111106/galaxy-s25-edge-teardown-what-slim-design-means-for-repair">Galaxy S25 Edge pulled off a similar trick</a> in an ultra-thin package. How’d they do it? And how’d Apple follow suit?</p>



<p>The secret: Thinner can actually be <em>more </em>repairable, with clever design.</p>



<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="2000" height="1125" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2025/09/20110240/iPhone-Air-comparison1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2025/09/20110240/iPhone-Air-comparison1.jpg 2000w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2025/09/20110240/iPhone-Air-comparison1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2025/09/20110240/iPhone-Air-comparison1-1600x900.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"><figcaption>A thin phone party! From left to right: Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge: 5.8 mm, iPhone Air: 5.64 mm, and Moto Z (the OG thin smartphone): 5.2 mm.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Clever Use of Space</h2>



<p>Apple made one huge design shift in the Air, which they teased in their keynote and we confirmed with our <a href="https://www.lumafield.com/products/neptune-industrial-x-ray-ct-scanner">Lumafield Neptune CT scanner</a>: The middle of this phone is basically just a battery with a frame around it. Apple popped the logic board up above the battery, a large part of how their design got thinner without compromising repair.</p>







<p>When we score repairability, <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/75533/how-ifixit-scores-repairability">80% of our score</a> is determined by the ease of replacing the parts that are most important and most likely to break. To figure this out, we build a model of the repair process. What’s the path you have to take to get to the battery, or to the screen? We call this the “disassembly tree.” The ideal (if unlikely) disassembly tree is flat. No parts in the way of other parts.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1920" height="1080" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/09/26143324/linear_vs_flat_disassembly_tree.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/09/26143324/linear_vs_flat_disassembly_tree.jpg 1920w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/09/26143324/linear_vs_flat_disassembly_tree-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/09/26143324/linear_vs_flat_disassembly_tree-1600x900.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"><figcaption>A linear disassembly tree on the left. A flat disassembly tree on the right. Every time you’ve got to go through another component, you risk damaging it, and repairs take more time.</figcaption></figure>



<p>A thin device often means, advantageously, a flat disassembly tree. Stacked parts are thicker than parts side-by-side. Our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8uv8fajOrc">friends over at Framework</a> have been saying this for a long time: It’s totally possible to make a thin and light device that’s also built for repair. The Framework Laptop has done this from the start, with nearly all major components accessible when you remove the cover.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2000" height="1125" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2025/09/20110552/TD_iPhone_Air_4.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2025/09/20110552/TD_iPhone_Air_4.jpg 2000w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2025/09/20110552/TD_iPhone_Air_4-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2025/09/20110552/TD_iPhone_Air_4-1600x900.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"></figure>



<p>And that’s exactly what we’re seeing in the Air. The logic board shift freed up room for the battery and helped the phone stay thin without cramming parts on top of each other. It also conveniently puts less stress on the board if the phone flexes in your pocket. It’s a smart workaround for <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/8309/iphone-6-plus-gray-flicker-touch-death">the “bendgate” problems</a> that haunted earlier slim iPhone designs. Not that the Air’s really going to be bending much, <a href="https://youtu.be/sQ56ve39l2I?si=M-OaokTdvB_LF4my&amp;t=461">as Zack’s test at Jerry Rig Everything suggests</a>.</p>



<p>(By the way, did you see we’re teaming up with Zack to bring you a toolkit that’s made for on-the-go repairs <em>and</em> durability testing?)</p>











<p>The Air trims a few extras compared to the Plus line it succeeds, losing the lower speaker and a rear camera. Like the 16e, it’s got just a single rear camera.</p>



<p>Inside, though, it packs the upgraded C1X modem, a new N1 WiFi chip, and the A19 Pro system-on-chip, all tucked into the logic board sandwich. It’s a lean, efficient setup that makes the most of limited space. This reduced complexity also contributes to quicker disassembly—fewer features, fewer parts, <em>and</em> fewer points of failure.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2000" height="1125" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2025/09/20112523/TD_iPhone_Air_18.jpg" alt="The iPhone Air camera through the back glass" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2025/09/20112523/TD_iPhone_Air_18.jpg 2000w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2025/09/20112523/TD_iPhone_Air_18-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2025/09/20112523/TD_iPhone_Air_18-1600x900.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"><figcaption>Here’s looking at you, camera (through the lens of the back glass).</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Battery Life? Eh. Battery Swaps? No Big Deal</h2>



<p>There’s been a lot of buzz about battery life on this phone. Apple said “all-day battery life,” and tech reviewers of the world, <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/iphones/iphone-air-battery-life-tested">noting the lack of watt-hour specificity</a> and immediate announcement of an add-on battery pack, said, “really now?” At 12.26 Wh, this battery is certainly smaller than recent iPhones (closest comparison being the 13 Pro’s 11.97 Wh), and that raises questions about longevity. More charging cycles usually means faster wear. Still, Apple’s efficiency tricks give it solid runtime, at least for now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But no battery lasts forever, so how difficult will swaps be? We’re relieved to see that the Air has all the greatest hits of the last few iPhone battery designs.</p>



<p>The Air’s battery is easy to find <em>and</em> accessible through the back glass thanks to Apple’s dual entry design. Even better, it’s a metal-encased battery. This thin layer of armor makes it more bend resistant and safer to replace. Even better than <em>that</em>, it’s mounted with electrically debonding adhesive strips. Hook them up to a power source and the battery lifts right out, no dangerous prying required. We used our FixHub Portable Power Station for an easy 12 V, and each strip freed after about 70 seconds.</p>



<p>Even though it’s comparably a small battery, its heft accounts for 28% of the phone’s total weight, more than any other component.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="4400" height="3400" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2025/09/20141304/iPhone-Air-weights-image2.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2025/09/20141304/iPhone-Air-weights-image2.jpg 4400w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2025/09/20141304/iPhone-Air-weights-image2-1536x1187.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2025/09/20141304/iPhone-Air-weights-image2-2048x1583.jpg 2048w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2025/09/20141304/iPhone-Air-weights-image2-1165x900.jpg 1165w" sizes="(max-width: 4400px) 100vw, 4400px"></figure>



<p>And in a fun twist, we’ve confirmed that it’s the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkr58Sa2GeY">exact same cell found in Apple’s MagSafe battery pack</a>. You can swap between them and the phone still boots up just fine. Like a rear-mounted spare tire on an SUV, an iPhone Air with a MagSafe battery pack is ready for an on-the-go swap, if you will. Granted it’ll take a <em>bit</em> more than a tire iron to make it happen.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2000" height="1500" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2025/09/20110644/TD_iPhone_Air_10.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2025/09/20110644/TD_iPhone_Air_10.jpg 2000w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2025/09/20110644/TD_iPhone_Air_10-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2025/09/20110644/TD_iPhone_Air_10-1200x900.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"><figcaption>Here’s our iPhone Air running off a MagSafe battery. (They’re so similar that we labeled the original so we wouldn’t mix them up!)</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Modular Port, but How About Parts to Back It Up?</h2>



<p>How about other likely-to-fail parts? USB-C ports are among the most common failure points in modern phones. Ports tend to collect moisture, <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/887805/Is+it+possible+to+repair+the+usb-c+port">which can cause corrosion</a>, and no one is immune to pocket lint. Not to mention the standard <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/866227/Can+I+fix+my+charging+port+if+the+metal+part+fell+off+and+won%E2%80%99t+charge">port problems</a> caused by mechanical wear and tear.</p>



<p>Now, to be clear, if your phone stops charging consistently, you shouldn’t jump straight to replacing the port. Every time you stick a charge cable into the port, you’re jamming pocket lint against the back. <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/How+to+Clean+your+iPhone's+Lightning+Port/164631">Give your charge port a cleanout</a> before you replace it.</p>

<p>But when you <em>do</em> need to replace an Air charging port, you’ll be glad to know it’s decently modular, following the trend of the last few iPhone models. It’s a tedious process, with delicate flex cables, adhesive, and hard-to-reach screws, but it’s still feasible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interestingly, the modularity of the USB-C port doesn’t seem to be a serviceability choice. Apple won’t do USB-C repairs in-house and they don’t sell replacement ports for iPhones. Of course that won’t stop us from <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/products/iphone-15-charge-port">selling the parts </a>as soon as we can get them—and regardless of intent, this modularity is nice to have.</p>



<p>Third-party parts manufacturers may take a bit to catch up, since this is a brand new architecture for the housing of the USB port. Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/introducing-iphone-air-a-powerful-new-iphone-with-a-breakthrough-design/">reportedly used 3D printing</a> to shrink the housing to fit the slim frame of the 6.5mm iPhone Air.</p>



<p>Apple says this process <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/introducing-iphone-air-a-powerful-new-iphone-with-a-breakthrough-design/">reduced material usage by 33%</a> compared to conventional forging processes. Granted, the USB-C port is <em>already</em> tiny. But this isn’t the only place they’re using it: The <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/introducing-apple-watch-ultra-3/">Apple Watch Ultra 3</a> uses the same titanium-printing process in its case.</p>



<p>We took a close look at the titanium material in the USB-C port, with our <a href="https://evidentscientific.com/en/products/digital/dsx2000?creative=730937434724&amp;keyword=digital%20measuring%20microscope&amp;matchtype=p&amp;network=g&amp;device=c&amp;campaignid=19866316739&amp;adgroupid=154049756384&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=19866316739&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD_Nf2eell8e2HIcJUsGyF1JazaUz&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwobnGBhBNEiwAu2mpFFfOB-BP9lYhVwApHpUts5qX2K4EzcdftRn6Kei09GYOwYlIpFRYshoC0I4QAvD_BwE">Evident DSX2000 microscope</a>. </p>

<p>We tapped in some friends in the additive manufacturing industry, who said it wasn’t <em>quite</em> like any metal 3D printing they’d seen before. Their best guess is that Apple’s using a binder or aerosol jet process in addition to some after-printing machining. This aligns with a <a href="https://www.patentlyapple.com/2023/08/apple-inherited-a-3d-printing-patent-back-in-2015-and-today-were-learning-that-apple-is-testing-the-use-of-3d-printers-for-a.html">binder jetting patent Apple inherited back in 2015</a> when they acquired Metaio. Whatever the exact process, the result is some truly impressive titanium manipulation.</p>



<p>(If you’re a metal 3D printing expert and want to give us your thoughts in the comments, we’d love to hear from you!)</p>



<h2>How Strong Is Thin?</h2>



<p>Titanium may have retired from the rest of the iPhone line (possibly for <a href="https://www.efeso.com/knowledge/insight/the-impact-of-the-russia-ukraine-conflict-on-the-aerospace-supply-chain-which-are-the-options-to-replace-russian-titanium">geopolitical more than technical reasons</a>) but it’s back as the backbone of this slim smartphone. This tough metal is a good choice, but it’s only as strong as its weak points. Our empty-frame bend test snapped the Air at its plastic antenna passthroughs—a necessity if you want your phone to phone properly. CT scans make it clear: Apple reinforced the center section, but the top and bottom remain vulnerable.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2000" height="1125" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2025/09/20111924/TD_iPhone_Air_52.jpg" alt="Many of the components of the iPhone Air piled into the broken frame" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2025/09/20111924/TD_iPhone_Air_52.jpg 2000w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2025/09/20111924/TD_iPhone_Air_52-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2025/09/20111924/TD_iPhone_Air_52-1600x900.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"><figcaption>If you take off the screen and remove the internal components, it’s possible to break this phone by hand. Makes for a great photo op! But chances are it won’t do that in regular use.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Of course, the center is where the phone is most likely to bend, and so far testing hasn’t given any indication of undue flexibility. Will that design affect the durability of the phone? We doubt we’ll see instances of Airs snapping at the ends, but only time will tell.</p>



<h2>The Verdict: A 7 out of 10 Repairability Score</h2>



<p>At 6.5 mm, the Air is a hair thinner than Samsung’s Galaxy S25 Edge, yet it manages to keep modular parts and early battery access. Apple’s dual entry design makes battery swaps simple and keeps the fancy OLED out of harm’s way. Electrically debonding adhesive makes battery replacements a lot more consistent than traditional or stretch-release adhesive, and most other major components are simple to access and remove. Apple also kept their best-in-class clipped- and screwed-in screen and back glass architecture, enabling quick reassembly without requiring special adhesive.</p>



<p>Combined with Apple’s continued commitment to day-one repair manuals, the iPhone Air earns a <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Wiki/Provisional_Repairability_Scores">provisional</a> 7 out of 10 repairability score. (We’re waiting on Apple to make good on their parts availability commitment as well as final results on our parts pairing tests. Their recent track record’s pretty good, though.)</p>

<p>Apple has proved that thin doesn’t have to mean unfixable. The iPhone Air is slimmer than any iPhone before it, but its layout and design tradeoffs make repairs <em>more</em> approachable, not less. It still has limits, but the design shows that good engineering can make even the slimmest devices last longer in the real world. Successful field test for your new foldable, Apple. We’re onto you!</p>

<p>Amazon revealed at its annual Accelerate seller conference in Seattle that it is shutting down its long-running “commingling” program — a move that drew louder applause from sellers than any other update of the morning.</p>



<p>The decision marks the end of a controversial practice in which Amazon pooled identical items from different sellers under one barcode. The system, intended to speed deliveries and save warehouse space, had also allowed counterfeit or expired goods to be mixed in with authentic ones, according to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/on-amazon-pooled-merchandise-opens-door-to-knockoffs-1399852852?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAiZbYLm-LvlaASayqYTmvMWfb-qdRGHHKlm3_5BIn7U53VG944J9C3Qyus3G6I%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68caf984&amp;gaa_sig=t6Otz2sjG7ZW-9cLpvqEPESE3o13I9rccCZaqNEWHVdMhpBVKHC-i7qpYOuZ4Plp-8EB8f5VMm-xmMbY_tE7-g%3D%3D">The Wall Street Journal</a>. For years, brands complained that commingling made it difficult to trace problems back to specific sellers and left their reputations vulnerable when customers received knockoffs. In 2013, Johnson &amp; Johnson temporarily pulled many of its consumer products from Amazon, arguing the retailer wasn’t doing enough to curb third-party sales of damaged or expired goods.</p>
<div id="piano-cta">


<p>By ending commingling, Amazon is signaling a stronger commitment to protecting brands on its marketplace, while further distancing itself from resellers. The announcement underscores the company’s ongoing strategy to prioritize trusted brand relationships — evident in moves like its revived <a href="https://www.modernretail.co/operations/amazon-is-working-directly-with-nike-to-source-their-products-according-to-an-email-to-sellers/">wholesale partnership with Nike</a> — while responding to mounting seller and consumer frustration over counterfeit risks.</p>



<p>During Wednesday’s presentation in Seattle, Amazon executives said the economics of commingling no longer worked. With the company’s logistics network now capable of storing products closer to customers, the speed advantage of pooled inventory has diminished. At the same time, Amazon estimated brand owners spent $600 million in the past year alone through re-stickering products, the process of placing new labels or barcodes over existing ones on products.</p>



<p>“Most products can now achieve the fast shipping speeds customers love without commingling,” Nadya Dhalla, director of Supply Chain by Amazon, said from the stage. “By ending commingling, these resources can now be reinvested in growing your business.”</p>



<p>Ben Donovan, insights lead at Marketplace Pulse, said the announcement was “one of the more significant” steps Amazon has taken in years to support brands. “It signals a continued shift away from resellers towards brand owners,” Donovan said. “It is certainly becoming a tougher environment for resellers on Amazon.”</p>



<p>The decision aligns with Amazon’s recent emphasis on direct partnerships with household names. In May, Amazon resumed <a href="https://www.modernretail.co/operations/amazon-is-working-directly-with-nike-to-source-their-products-according-to-an-email-to-sellers/">working with Nike</a> to source products directly, ending years of separation after Nike pulled out in 2019. That move restricted the ability of independent resellers to list certain Nike items on Amazon, Modern Retail reported at the time. And industry analysts saw it as part of a broader effort by the e-commerce giant to court major brands while tightening oversight of who can sell their goods.</p>





<p>The end of commingling coincided with Amazon’s heavy promotion of a new <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/seller-assistant-agentic-ai">AI-powered seller assistant</a> described as “agentic.” Amazon touted its new seller assistant several times over the course of the 90-minute presentation. Amazon pitched the tool as able to resolve support tickets, optimize storage to help avoid fees and recommend operational improvements across a seller’s business. Yet despite the fanfare around AI, it was the decision to sunset commingling — a little-known policy to most consumers — that seemed to resonate most with sellers.</p>



<p>Amazon said commingling will be phased out across its supply chain later this year.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<article>
	
	

	<p>This is just some of what I’ve been pondering recently - particularly in terms of how we ended up with such overly-granular dependency trees.</p>

<p>I think we’ve ended up with many libraries in our ecosystem which are edge-case-first, the opposite to what I’d expect. I’ll give a few examples and some thoughts around this, mostly in the hope we can start to trim some of it away.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>I believe a lot of the questionably small libraries hiding in our deep dependency trees are a result of over-engineering for inputs and edge cases we’ve probably never seen.</p>

<p>For example, say we’re building a <code>clamp</code> function:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>clamp</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>,</span> <span>min</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>,</span> <span>max</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>):</span> <span>number</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>min</span><span>(</span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>max</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>,</span> <span>min</span><span>),</span> <span>max</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Pretty simple!</p>

<p>What if someone passes nonsensical ranges? Let’s handle that.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>clamp</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>,</span> <span>min</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>,</span> <span>max</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>):</span> <span>number</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>min</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>max</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>min must be less than or equal to max</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>min</span><span>(</span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>max</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>,</span> <span>min</span><span>),</span> <span>max</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>This is probably as far as I’d go.</strong> But let’s over-engineer - what if someone passes a number-like string?</p>

<div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>clamp</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>min</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>max</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>string</span><span>):</span> <span>number</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>typeof</span> <span>value</span> <span>===</span> <span>'</span><span>string</span><span>'</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>Number</span><span>.</span><span>isNaN</span><span>(</span><span>Number</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>value must be a number or a number-like string</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>typeof</span> <span>min</span> <span>===</span> <span>'</span><span>string</span><span>'</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>Number</span><span>.</span><span>isNaN</span><span>(</span><span>Number</span><span>(</span><span>min</span><span>)))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>min must be a number or a number-like string</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>typeof</span> <span>max</span> <span>===</span> <span>'</span><span>string</span><span>'</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>Number</span><span>.</span><span>isNaN</span><span>(</span><span>Number</span><span>(</span><span>max</span><span>)))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>max must be a number or a number-like string</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>Number</span><span>(</span><span>min</span><span>)</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>Number</span><span>(</span><span>max</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>min must be less than or equal to max</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>min</span><span>(</span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>max</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>,</span> <span>min</span><span>),</span> <span>max</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>At this point, it seems clear to me we’ve just poorly designed our function. It solely exists to clamp numbers, so why would we accept strings?</p>

<p>But hey, let’s go further! What if other libraries also want to accept such loose inputs? Let’s extract this into a separate library:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>isNumber</span> <span>from</span> <span>'</span><span>is-number</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>clamp</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>min</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>max</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>string</span><span>):</span> <span>number</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>isNumber</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>value must be a number or a number-like string</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>isNumber</span><span>(</span><span>min</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>min must be a number or a number-like string</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>isNumber</span><span>(</span><span>max</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>max must be a number or a number-like string</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>Number</span><span>(</span><span>min</span><span>)</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>Number</span><span>(</span><span>max</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>min must be less than or equal to max</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>min</span><span>(</span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>max</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>,</span> <span>min</span><span>),</span> <span>max</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Whoops!</strong> We’ve just created the infamous <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-number"><code>is-number</code></a> library!</p>

<h2 id="how-it-should-be">How it should be</h2>

<p>This, in my opinion, is poor technical design we’ve all ended up dealing with over the years. Carrying the baggage of these overly-granular libraries that exist to handle edge cases we’ve probably never encountered.</p>

<p>I think it should have been:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>clamp</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>,</span> <span>min</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>,</span> <span>max</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>):</span> <span>number</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>min</span><span>(</span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>max</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>,</span> <span>min</span><span>),</span> <span>max</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><em>Maybe</em> with some <code>min &lt;= max</code> validation, but even that is debatable. At this point, you may as well inline the <code>Math.min(Math.max(...))</code> expression instead of using a dependency.</p>

<p><strong>We should be able to define our functions to accept the inputs they are designed for, and not try to handle every possible edge case.</strong></p>

<p>There are two things at play here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Data types</li>
  <li>Values</li>
</ul>

<p>A well designed library would assume the right <strong>data types</strong> have been passed in, but may validate that the <strong>values</strong> make sense (e.g. <code>min</code> is less than or equal to <code>max</code>).</p>

<p>These over-engineered libraries have decided to implement <em>both</em> at runtime - essentially run-time type checking and value validation. One could argue that this is just a result of building in the pre-TypeScript era, but that still doesn’t justify the overly specific <em>value validation</em> (e.g. the real <code>is-number</code> also checks that it is finite).</p>

<h2 id="what-we-shouldnt-do">What we shouldn’t do</h2>

<p>We shouldn’t build edge-case-first libraries, i.e. those which solve for edge cases we have yet to encounter or are unlikely to ever encounter.</p>

<h2 id="example-is-arrayish-76m-downloadsweek">Example: <code>is-arrayish</code> (76M downloads/week)</h2>

<p>The <code>is-arrayish</code> library determines if a value is an <code>Array</code> or behaves like one.</p>

<p>There will be some edge cases where this matters a lot, where we want to accept something we can index into but don’t care if it is a real <code>Array</code> or not.</p>

<p>However, the common use case clearly will not be that and we could’ve just used <code>Array.isArray()</code> all along.</p>

<h2 id="example-is-number-90m-downloadsweek">Example: <code>is-number</code> (90M downloads/week)</h2>

<p>The <code>is-number</code> library determines if a value is a positive, finite number or number-like string (maybe we should name it <code>is-positive-finite-number</code> to be more accurate).</p>

<p>Again, there will be edge cases where we want to deal with number-like strings or we want to validate that a number is within a range (e.g. finite).</p>

<p>The common use case will not be this. The common use case will be that we want to check <code>typeof n === 'number'</code> and be done with it.</p>

<p>For those edge cases where we want to <em>additionally</em> validate what kind of number it is, we could use a library (but one which exists for the validation, not for the type check).</p>

<h2 id="example-pascalcase-97m-downloadsweek">Example: <code>pascalcase</code> (9.7M downloads/week)</h2>

<p>The <code>pascalcase</code> library transforms text to PascalCase.</p>

<p>It has 1 dependency (<code>camelcase</code>) and accepts a variety of input types:</p>

<ul>
  <li>strings</li>
  <li>null</li>
  <li>undefined</li>
  <li>arrays of strings</li>
  <li>functions</li>
  <li>arbitrary objects with <code>toString</code> methods</li>
</ul>

<p>In reality, almost every user will be passing a <code>string</code>.</p>

<h2 id="example-is-regexp-10m-downloadsweek">Example: <code>is-regexp</code> (10M downloads/week)</h2>

<p>The <code>is-regexp</code> library checks if a value is a <code>RegExp</code> object, and supports cross-realm values.</p>

<p>In reality, almost every user will be passing a <code>RegExp</code> object, and not one from another realm.</p>

<p>For context, cross-realm values can happen when you retrieve a value from an <code>iframe</code> or VM for example:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>iframe</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>iframe</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>iframe</span><span>.</span><span>contentWindow</span><span>.</span><span>RegExp</span> <span>===</span> <span>RegExp</span><span>;</span> <span>// false</span>

<span>const</span> <span>iframeRegex</span> <span>=</span> <span>iframe</span><span>.</span><span>contentWindow</span><span>.</span><span>someRegexp</span><span>;</span>

<span>iframeRegex</span> <span>instanceof</span> <span>RegExp</span><span>;</span> <span>// false</span>
<span>isRegex</span><span>(</span><span>iframeRegex</span><span>);</span> <span>// true</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is indeed useful, and I do support this myself in chai (which I maintain). However, this is an edge case most libraries don’t need to care about.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-should-do">What we should do</h2>

<p>We should build libraries which solve the common use case and make assumptions about the input types they will be given.</p>

<h2 id="example-scule-18m-downloadsweek">Example: scule (1.8M downloads/week)</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/scule">scule</a> is a library for transforming casing of text (e.g. camel case, etc).</p>

<p>It only accepts inputs it is designed for (strings and arrays of strings) and has zero dependencies.</p>

<p>In most of the functions it exports, it assumes valid input data types.</p>

<h2 id="example-dlv-149m-downloadsweek">Example: dlv (14.9M downloads/week)</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/dlv">dlv</a> is a library for deep property access.</p>

<p>It only accepts strings and arrays of strings as the path to access, and assumes this (i.e. does no validation).</p>

<h2 id="validation-is-important">Validation is important</h2>

<p>Validation is important, and I want to be clear that I’m not saying we should stop validating our data.</p>

<p>However, we should usually be validating the data in the project that owns it (e.g. at the app level), and not in every library that later consumes it as input.</p>

<p>Deep dependencies applying validation like this actually shift the burden from where it belongs (at data boundaries) to deep in the dependency tree.</p>

<p>Often at this point, it is invisible to the consumer of the library.</p>

<p>How many people are passing values into <code>is-number</code> (via other libraries), not realising it will prevent them from using negative numbers and <code>Infinity</code>?</p>

<h2 id="a-note-on-overly-granular-libraries">A note on overly-granular libraries</h2>

<p>This post isn’t about overly-granular libraries in general, but I’d like to briefly mention them for visibility.</p>

<p>An overly-granular library is one where someone took a useful library and split it up into an almost atomic-level of granularity.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>shebang-regex</code> - 2LOC, does the same as <code>startsWith('#!')</code>, <strong>86M downloads/week</strong></li>
  <li><code>is-whitespace</code> - 7LOC, checks if a string is only whitespace, <strong>1M downloads/week</strong></li>
  <li><code>is-npm</code> - 8LOC, checks <code>npm_config_user_agent</code> or <code>npm_package_json</code> are set, <strong>7M downloads/week</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This is a personal preference some maintainers clearly prefer. The thought seems to be that by having atomic libraries, you can easily build your next library mostly from the existing building blocks you have.</p>

<p>I don’t really agree with this and think downloading a package for <code>#!</code> 86 million times a week is a bit much.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-be-done-about-this">What can be done about this?</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://e18e.dev/">e18e</a> community is already tackling a lot of this by contributing performance improvements across the ecosystem, including removing and replacing dependencies with more modern, performant ones.</p>

<p>Through these efforts, there’s already a useful <a href="https://e18e.dev/guide/replacements.html">list of replacements</a> and an <a href="https://github.com/es-tooling/eslint-plugin-depend/">ESLint plugin</a>.</p>

<h2 id="as-a-maintainer">As a maintainer</h2>

<p>If you’re maintaining a library, it would be worth reviewing your dependencies to see if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Any are replaceable by native functionality these days (e.g. <code>Array.isArray</code>)</li>
  <li>Any are replaceable by smaller, less granular and/or more performant alternatives (e.g. <code>scule</code> instead of <code>pascalcase</code>)</li>
  <li>Any are redundant if you make more assumptions about input types</li>
</ul>

<p>Tools like <a href="https://npmgraph.js.org/">npmgraph</a> can help you visualise your dependency tree to make this task easier.</p>

<p>Also, being stricter around input types will allow you to reduce a lot of code and dependencies.</p>

<p>If you can assume the data being passed in is the correct type, you can leave validation up to the consumer.</p>

<h2 id="as-a-user">As a user</h2>

<p>Keep a close eye on your dependencies (both deep and direct), and what alternatives are available to your direct dependencies.</p>

<p>Often, it is easy to stick with a dependency from long ago and forget to re-visit it one day in case there is a better way. Many of these packages are possible natively, or have more modern alternatives.</p>

<p>Useful tools:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://npmgraph.js.org/">npmgraph</a> for visualising your dependency tree</li>
  <li><a href="https://node-modules.dev/">node-modules.dev</a> for visualising your dependencies and lots of useful meta data</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/dependabot-quickstart-guide">Dependabot</a> for keeping your dependencies up to date</li>
</ul>

<p>On the topic of data, it is also worth ensuring validation happens at data boundaries rather than being delegated to various dependencies. Try to validate the type and value up front, before passing into dependencies.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Most of these libraries exist to handle edge cases that do certainly exist. However, <strong>we are all paying the cost of that rather than only those who need to support those edge cases</strong>.</p>

<p>This is the wrong way around. Libraries should implement the main use case, and alternatives (or plugins) can exist to provide the edge cases the minority needs.</p>

<p>We should all be more aware of what is in our dependency tree, and should push for more concise, lighter libraries.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>The question “Will coding be taken over entirely by AI?” has been asked to death already, and people keep trying to answer it. I’m not sure there’s anything truly new to say, but I want to share my own observations.</p>
<p>The early narrative was that companies would need fewer seniors, and juniors together with AI could produce quality code. At least that’s what I kept seeing. But now, partly because AI hasn’t quite lived up to the hype, it looks like what companies actually need is not <strong>junior + AI</strong>, but <strong>senior + AI</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>Let’s look at where AI is good and where it falls short in coding.</p>
<p><strong>Where it helps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cranking out boilerplate and scaffolding</li>
<li>Automating repetitive routines</li>
<li>Trying out different implementations</li>
<li>Validating things quickly thanks to fast iteration</li>
<li>Shipping features fast, as long as you know what you want</li>
</ul>
<p>And who benefits most from that? Obviously seniors. In the hands of a junior, these things are harder to turn into real value. Still possible, but much tougher.</p>
<p><strong>Where it backfires:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Code review</strong>: AI can’t really reason. Reviews can be useful, but once edge cases pop up (and they do a lot more in AI-generated code), you’re left needing a senior anyway.</li>
<li><strong>Bad prompts</strong>: Who writes good prompts? The people who actually understand what they’re building. If someone lacks the knowledge, they might still get “okay-ish” results, but with no proper checks in place it just leads to bugs and headaches.</li>
<li><strong>Architecture</strong>: Without solid architecture, software quickly loses value. Today AI can’t truly design good architecture; it feels like it might, but this kind of reasoning still requires humans. Projects that start with weak architecture end up drowning in technical debt.</li>
<li><strong>Code quality</strong>: Choosing the right abstractions, applying design patterns properly, keeping things clean and context-appropriate. AI still struggles here.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: Think of it like a house without doors, or with broken locks. Security holes pop up more often with junior + AI combinations. Sure, security bugs exist everywhere, but at least with seniors you have some level of awareness and caution.</li>
<li><strong>Wrong learning</strong>: If someone can’t really evaluate the code, they may not realize what’s wrong with what AI produces. Inside a company that can mean producing damage instead of value.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are more examples, but the main point is this: AI is not really a threat to senior developers yet. It may even be the opposite. And this is not about criticizing juniors. It is about not throwing them into risky situations with unrealistic expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Where we should use AI:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fast prototyping</strong>: Perfect for trying out an idea quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Speeding up routines</strong>: The most important use. Automate the things you already know well and repeat often.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-disciplinary work</strong>: Filling gaps in your knowledge, suggesting useful methods or libraries, helping connect the dots when multiple domains collide.</li>
<li><strong>Function tests</strong>: Simple, repetitive, low-risk code you can easily double-check.</li>
</ul>
<p>From my perspective, that is the current state of things. We still have to read every line AI writes. It is far from perfect. No awareness. Reasoning is imitation. It is non-deterministic, which is why we rely on deterministic things like tests. But then, are you really going to trust the AI to write the tests that verify its own code?</p>
<p>It reminds me of something I tweeted: there was a prompt making AI say “I don’t know” when it didn’t know. My take was: <em>“If such AI says ‘I don’t know,’ you can’t be sure it knows that either.”</em></p>
<p>Of course, the junior + AI pairing was tempting. It looked cheaper, and it fed the fear that “AI will take our jobs.” But when you compare software to other professions, the field still shows signs of immaturity. In construction, architects design. In software, even the architects are still laying bricks by writing code. Our roles are still not specialized or merit-driven enough, and cost-cutting dominates. That devalues the work and burns people out.</p>
<p>So instead of democratizing coding, AI right now has mostly concentrated power in the hands of experts. Expectations did not quite match reality. We will see what happens next. I am optimistic about AI’s future, but in the short run we should probably reset our expectations before they warp any further.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Having no swap doesn't avoid this.</li><li>You can achieve better swap behaviour under memory pressure and prevent thrashing by utilising <code>memory.low</code> and friends in cgroup v2.</li></ol><hr><p>As part of my work improving kernel memory management and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikZ8_mRotT4">cgroup v2</a>, I've been talking to a lot of engineers about attitudes towards memory, especially around application behaviour under pressure and operating system heuristics used under the hood for memory management.</p><p>A repeated topic in these discussions has been swap. Swap is a hotly contested and poorly understood topic, even by those who have been working with Linux for many years. Many see it as useless or actively harmful: a relic of a time where memory was scarce, and disks were a necessary evil to provide much-needed space for paging. This is a statement that I still see being batted around with relative frequency in recent years, and I've had many discussions with colleagues, friends, and industry peers to help them understand why swap is still a useful concept on modern computers with significantly more physical memory available than in the past.</p><p>There's also a lot of misunderstanding about the purpose of swap – many people just see it as a kind of "slow extra memory" for use in emergencies, but don't understand how it can contribute during normal load to the healthy operation of an operating system as a whole.</p><p>Many of us have heard most of the usual tropes about memory: "<a href="https://www.linuxatemyram.com/">Linux uses too much memory</a>", "<a href="https://superuser.com/a/111510/98210">swap should be double your physical memory size</a>", and the like. While these are either trivial to dispel, or discussion around them has become more nuanced in recent years, the myth of "useless" swap is much more grounded in heuristics and arcana rather than something that can be explained by simple analogy, and requires somewhat more understanding of memory management to reason about.</p><p>This post is mostly aimed at those who administer Linux systems and are interested in hearing the counterpoints to running with undersized/no swap or running with <code>vm.swappiness</code> set to 0.</p><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>It's hard to talk about why having swap and swapping out pages are good things in normal operation without a shared understanding of some of the basic underlying mechanisms at play in Linux memory management, so let's make sure we're on the same page.</p><h3 id="types-of-memory">Types of memory</h3><p>There are many different types of memory in Linux, and each type has its own properties. Understanding the nuances of these is key to understanding why swap is important.</p><p>For example, there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_(computer_memory)"><em>pages</em> ("blocks" of memory, typically 4k)</a> responsible for holding the code for each process being run on your computer. There are also pages responsible for caching data and metadata related to files accessed by those programs in order to speed up future access. These are part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_cache">page cache</a>, and I will refer to them as <em>file</em> memory.</p><p>There are also pages which are responsible for the memory allocations made inside that code, for example, when new memory that has been allocated with <code>malloc</code> is written to, or when using <code>mmap</code>'s <code>MAP_ANONYMOUS</code> flag. These are "anonymous" pages – so called because they are not backed by anything – and I will refer to them as <em>anon</em> memory.</p><p>There are other types of memory too – shared memory, slab memory, kernel stack memory, buffers, and the like – but anonymous memory and file memory are the most well known and easy to understand ones, so I will use these in my examples, although they apply equally to these types too.</p><h3 id="reclaimableunreclaimable-memory">Reclaimable/unreclaimable memory</h3><p>One of the most fundamental questions when thinking about a particular type of memory is whether it is able to be reclaimed or not. "Reclaim" here means that the system can, without losing data, purge pages of that type from physical memory.</p><p>For some page types, this is typically fairly trivial. For example, in the case of <em>clean</em> (unmodified) page cache memory, we're simply caching something that we have on disk for performance, so we can drop the page without having to do any special operations.</p><p>For some page types, this is possible, but not trivial. For example, in the case of <em>dirty</em> (modified) page cache memory, we can't just drop the page, because the disk doesn't have our modifications yet. As such we either need to deny reclamation or first get our changes back to disk before we can drop this memory.</p><p>For some page types, this is not possible. For example, in the case of the anonymous pages mentioned previously, they only exist in memory and in no other backing store, so they have to be kept there.</p><h2 id="on-the-nature-of-swap">On the nature of swap</h2><p>If you look for descriptions of the purpose of swap on Linux, you'll inevitably find many people talking about it as if it is merely an extension of the physical RAM for use in emergencies. For example, here is a random post I got as one of the top results from typing "what is swap" in Google:</p><blockquote><p>Swap is essentially emergency memory; a space set aside for times when your system temporarily needs more physical memory than you have available in RAM. It's considered "bad" in the sense that it's slow and inefficient, and if your system constantly needs to use swap then it obviously doesn't have enough memory. […] If you have enough RAM to handle all of your needs, and don't expect to ever max it out, then you should be perfectly safe running without a swap space.</p></blockquote><p>To be clear, I don't blame the poster of this comment at all for the content of their post – this is accepted as "common knowledge" by a lot of Linux sysadmins and is probably one of the most likely things that you will hear from one if you ask them to talk about swap. It is unfortunately also, however, a misunderstanding of the purpose and use of swap, especially on modern systems.</p><p>Above, I talked about reclamation for anonymous pages being "not possible", as anonymous pages by their nature have no backing store to fall back to when being purged from memory – as such, their reclamation would result in complete data loss for those pages. What if we could create such a store for these pages, though?</p><p>Well, this is precisely what swap is for. Swap is a storage area for these seemingly "unreclaimable" pages that allows us to page them out to a storage device on demand. This means that they can now be considered as equally eligible for reclaim as their more trivially reclaimable friends, like clean file pages, allowing more efficient use of available physical memory.</p><p><strong>Swap is primarily a mechanism for equality of reclamation, not for emergency "extra memory". Swap is not what makes your application slow – entering overall memory contention is what makes your application slow.</strong></p><p>So in what situations under this "equality of reclamation" scenario would we legitimately choose to reclaim anonymous pages? Here are, abstractly, some not uncommon scenarios:</p><ol><li>During initialisation, a long-running program may allocate and use many pages. These pages may also be used as part of shutdown/cleanup, but are not needed once the program is "started" (in an application-specific sense). This is fairly common for daemons which have significant dependencies to initialise.</li><li>During the program's normal operation, we may allocate memory which is only used rarely. It may make more sense for overall system performance to require a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_fault#Types">major fault</a> to page these in from disk on demand, instead using the memory for something else that's more important.</li></ol><h2 id="examining-what-happens-withwithout-swap">Examining what happens with/without swap</h2><p>Let's look at typical situations, and how they perform with and without swap present. I talk about metrics around "memory contention" in my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikZ8_mRotT4">talk on cgroup v2</a>.</p><h3 id="under-nolow-memory-contention">Under no/low memory contention</h3><ul><li><strong>With swap:</strong> We can choose to swap out rarely-used anonymous memory that may only be used during a small part of the process lifecycle, allowing us to use this memory to improve cache hit rate, or do other optimisations.</li><li><strong>Without swap:</strong> We cannot swap out rarely-used anonymous memory, as it's locked in memory. While this may not immediately present as a problem, on some workloads this may represent a non-trivial drop in performance due to stale, anonymous pages taking space away from more important use.</li></ul><h3 id="under-moderatehigh-memory-contention">Under moderate/high memory contention</h3><ul><li><strong>With swap:</strong> All memory types have an equal possibility of being reclaimed. This means we have a better chance to be able to reclaim pages successfully – that is, we can reclaim pages that are not quickly faulted back in again (thrashing).</li><li><strong>Without swap:</strong> Anonymous pages are locked into memory as they have nowhere to go. The chance of successful long-term page reclamation is lower, as we have only some types of memory eligible to be reclaimed at all. The risk of page thrashing is higher. The casual reader might think that this would still be better as it might avoid having to do disk I/O, but this isn't true – we simply transfer the disk I/O of swapping to dropping hot page caches and dropping code segments we need soon.</li></ul><h3 id="under-temporary-spikes-in-memory-usage">Under temporary spikes in memory usage</h3><ul><li><strong>With swap:</strong> We're more resilient to temporary spikes, but in cases of severe memory starvation, the period from memory thrashing beginning to the OOM killer may be prolonged. We have more visibility into the instigators of memory pressure and can act on them more reasonably, and can perform a controlled intervention.</li><li><strong>Without swap:</strong> The OOM killer is triggered more quickly as anonymous pages are locked into memory and cannot be reclaimed. We're more likely to thrash on memory, but the time between thrashing and OOMing is reduced. Depending on your application, this may be better or worse. For example, a queue-based application may desire this quick transfer from thrashing to killing. That said, this is still too late to be really useful – the OOM killer is only invoked at moments of severe starvation, and relying on this method for such behaviour would be better replaced with more opportunistic killing of processes as memory contention is reached in the first place.</li></ul><h3 id="okay-so-i-want-system-swap-but-how-can-i-tune-it-for-individual-applications">Okay, so I want system swap, but how can I tune it for individual applications?</h3><p>You didn't think you'd get through this entire post without me plugging cgroup v2, did you? ;-)</p><p>Obviously, it's hard for a generic heuristic algorithm to be right all the time, so it's important for you to be able to give guidance to the kernel. Historically the only tuning you could do was at the system level, using <code>vm.swappiness</code>. This has two problems: <code>vm.swappiness</code> is incredibly hard to reason about because it only feeds in as a small part of a larger heuristic system, and it also is system-wide instead of being granular to a smaller set of processes.</p><p>You can also use <code>mlock</code> to lock pages into memory, but this requires either modifying program code, fun with <code>LD_PRELOAD</code>, or doing horrible things with a debugger at runtime. In VM-based languages this also doesn't work very well, since you generally have no control over allocation and end up having to <code>mlockall</code>, which has no precision towards the pages you actually care about.</p><p>cgroup v2 has a tunable per-cgroup in the form of <code>memory.low</code>, which allows us to tell the kernel to prefer other applications for reclaim below a certain threshold of memory used. This allows us to not prevent the kernel from swapping out parts of our application, but prefer to reclaim from other applications under memory contention. Under normal conditions, the kernel's swap logic is generally pretty good, and allowing it to swap out pages opportunistically generally increases system performance. Swap thrash under heavy memory contention is not ideal, but it's more a property of simply running out of memory entirely than a problem with the swapper. In these situations, you typically want to fail fast by self-killing non-critical processes when memory pressure starts to build up.</p><p>You can not simply rely on the OOM killer for this. The OOM killer is only invoked in situations of dire failure when we've <em>already</em> entered a state where the system is severely unhealthy and may well have been so for a while. You need to opportunistically handle the situation yourself before ever thinking about the OOM killer.</p><p>Determination of memory pressure is somewhat difficult using traditional Linux memory counters, though. We have some things which seem somewhat related, but are merely tangential – memory usage, page scans, etc – and from these metrics alone it's very hard to tell an efficient memory configuration from one that's trending towards memory contention. There is a group of us at Facebook, spearheaded by <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commits?author=hnaz">Johannes</a>, working on developing new metrics that expose memory pressure more easily that should help with this in future. If you're interested in hearing more about this, <a href="https://youtu.be/ikZ8_mRotT4?t=2145">I go into detail about one metric being considered in my talk on cgroup v2</a>.</p><h2 id="tuning">Tuning</h2><h3 id="how-much-swap-do-i-need-then">How much swap do I need, then?</h3><p>In general, the minimum amount of swap space required for optimal memory management depends on the number of anonymous pages pinned into memory that are rarely reaccessed by an application, and the value of reclaiming those anonymous pages. The latter is mostly a question of which pages are no longer purged to make way for these infrequently accessed anonymous pages.</p><p>If you have a bunch of disk space and a recent (4.0+) kernel, more swap is almost always better than less. In older kernels <code>kswapd</code>, one of the kernel processes responsible for managing swap, was historically very overeager to swap out memory aggressively the more swap you had. In recent times, swapping behaviour when a large amount of swap space is available has been significantly improved. If you're running kernel 4.0+, having a larger swap on a modern kernel should not result in overzealous swapping. As such, if you have the space, having a swap size of a few GB keeps your options open on modern kernels.</p><p>If you're more constrained with disk space, then the answer really depends on the tradeoffs you have to make, and the nature of the environment. Ideally you should have enough swap to make your system operate optimally at normal and peak (memory) load. What I'd recommend is setting up a few testing systems with 2-3GB of swap or more, and monitoring what happens over the course of a week or so under varying (memory) load conditions. As long as you haven't encountered severe memory starvation during that week – in which case the test will not have been very useful – you will probably end up with some number of MB of swap occupied. As such, it's probably worth having at least that much swap available, in addition to a little buffer for changing workloads. <code>atop</code> in logging mode can also show you which applications are having their pages swapped out in the <code>SWAPSZ</code> column, so if you don't already use it on your servers to log historic server state you probably want to set it up on these test machines with logging mode as part of this experiment. This also tells you <em>when</em> your application started swapping out pages, which you can tie to log events or other key data.</p><p>Another thing worth considering is the nature of the swap medium. Swap reads tend to be highly random, since we can't reliably predict which pages will be refaulted and when. On an SSD this doesn't matter much, but on spinning disks, random I/O is extremely expensive since it requires physical movement to achieve. On the other hand, refaulting of file pages is likely less random, since files related to the operation of a single application at runtime tend to be less fragmented. This might mean that on a spinning disk you may want to bias more towards reclaiming file pages instead of swapping out anonymous pages, but again, you need to test and evaluate how this balances out for your workload.</p><p>For laptop/desktop users who want to hibernate to swap, this also needs to be taken into account – in this case your swap file should be at least your physical RAM size.</p><h3 id="what-should-my-swappiness-setting-be">What should my swappiness setting be?</h3><p>First, it's important to understand what <code>vm.swappiness</code> does. <code>vm.swappiness</code> is a sysctl that biases memory reclaim either towards reclamation of anonymous pages, or towards file pages. It does this using two different attributes: <code>file_prio</code> (our willingness to reclaim file pages) and <code>anon_prio</code> (our willingness to reclaim anonymous pages). <code>vm.swappiness</code> plays into this, as it becomes the default value for <code>anon_prio</code>, and it also is subtracted from the default value of 200 for <code>file_prio</code>, which means for a value of <code>vm.swappiness = 50</code>, the outcome is that <code>anon_prio</code> is 50, and <code>file_prio</code> is 150 (the exact numbers don't matter as much as their relative weight compared to the other).</p><p>This means that, in general, <strong>vm.swappiness is simply a ratio of how costly reclaiming and refaulting anonymous memory is compared to file memory for your hardware and workload</strong>. The lower the value, the more you tell the kernel that infrequently accessed anonymous pages are expensive to swap out and in on your hardware. The higher the value, the more you tell the kernel that the cost of swapping anonymous pages and file pages is similar on your hardware. The memory management subsystem will still try to mostly decide whether it swaps file or anonymous pages based on how hot the memory is, but swappiness tips the cost calculation either more towards swapping or more towards dropping filesystem caches when it could go either way. On SSDs these are basically as expensive as each other, so setting <code>vm.swappiness = 100</code> (full equality) may work well. On spinning disks, swapping may be significantly more expensive since swapping in general requires random reads, so you may want to bias more towards a lower value.</p><p>The reality is that most people don't really have a feeling about which their hardware demands, so it's non-trivial to tune this value based on instinct alone – this is something that you need to test using different values. You can also spend time evaluating the memory composition of your system and core applications and their behaviour under mild memory reclamation.</p><p>When talking about <code>vm.swappiness</code>, an extremely important change to consider from recent(ish) times is <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git/patch/?id=fe35004fbf9eaf67482b074a2e032abb9c89b1dd">this change to vmscan by Satoru Moriya in 2012</a>, which changes the way that <code>vm.swappiness = 0</code> is handled quite significantly.</p><p>Essentially, the patch makes it so that we are extremely biased against scanning (and thus reclaiming) any anonymous pages at all with <code>vm.swappiness = 0</code>, unless we are already encountering severe memory contention. As mentioned previously in this post, that's generally not what you want, since this prevents equality of reclamation prior to extreme memory pressure occurring, which may actually <em>lead</em> to this extreme memory pressure in the first place. <code>vm.swappiness = 1</code> is the lowest you can go without invoking the special casing for anonymous page scanning implemented in that patch.</p><p>The kernel default here is <code>vm.swappiness = 60</code>. This value is generally not too bad for most workloads, but it's hard to have a general default that suits all workloads. As such, a valuable extension to the tuning mentioned in the "how much swap do I need" section above would be to test these systems with differing values for vm.swappiness, and monitor your application and system metrics under heavy (memory) load. Some time in the near future, once we have a decent implementation of <a href="https://youtu.be/ikZ8_mRotT4?t=2145">refault detection</a> in the kernel, you'll also be able to determine this somewhat workload-agnostically by looking at cgroup v2's page refaulting metrics.</p><h3 id="update-as-of-2019-07-memory-pressure-metrics-in-kernel-420">Update as of 2019-07: memory pressure metrics in kernel 4.20+</h3><p>The refault metrics mentioned as in development earlier are now in the kernel from 4.20 onwards and can be enabled with <code>CONFIG_PSI=y</code>. See my talk at SREcon at around the 25:05 mark:</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/beefUhRH5lU"></iframe></p><h2 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h2><ul><li>Swap is a useful tool to allow equality of reclamation of memory pages, but its purpose is frequently misunderstood, leading to its negative perception across the industry.

		<p>WeAct Display FS is an inexpensive 0.96-inch USB display dongle designed to add an information display or a tiny secondary display to your computer or SBC.</p><p>We’ve seen this type of information display with products such as the <a href="https://www.cnx-software.com/2022/04/29/turing-smart-screen-a-low-cost-3-5-inch-usb-type-c-information-display/">Turing Smart Screen</a>, a larger 3.5-inch color display, or small OLEDs integrated into cases such as the <a href="https://www.cnx-software.com/2025/06/29/pironman-5-max-review-a-fancy-raspberry-pi-5-tower-pc-enclosure-with-dual-m-2-pci-sockets-for-ssd-and-or-ai-accelerator/">Pironman 5 Max</a> to disable text. The WeAct Display FS V1 may be tiny, but it’s also a full-color 160×80 resolution display that can be customized with software provided by WeAct.</p><figure id="attachment_157624" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-157624"><a href="https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WeAct-DISPLAY-FS-V1-0.96-inch-USB-information-display.jpg"><img decoding="async" title="WeAct DISPLAY FS V1 0.96 inch USB information display" src="https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WeAct-DISPLAY-FS-V1-0.96-inch-USB-information-display-720x648.jpg" alt="WeAct DISPLAY FS V1 0.96 inch USB information display" width="720" height="648" srcset="https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WeAct-DISPLAY-FS-V1-0.96-inch-USB-information-display-720x648.jpg 720w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WeAct-DISPLAY-FS-V1-0.96-inch-USB-information-display-1200x1080.jpg 1200w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WeAct-DISPLAY-FS-V1-0.96-inch-USB-information-display-278x250.jpg 278w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WeAct-DISPLAY-FS-V1-0.96-inch-USB-information-display-768x691.jpg 768w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WeAct-DISPLAY-FS-V1-0.96-inch-USB-information-display.jpg 1404w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-157624">Text and image on display for illustration only.

The first one is the <a href="https://github.com/WeActStudio/WeActStudio.SystemMonitor">WeAct Studio System Monitor</a> based on a fork of <a href="https://github.com/mathoudebine/turing-smart-screen-python">Matthieu Houdebine’s Turing Smart Screen Python project</a>. This allows users to create UIs/themes with text, images, weather, and other features… WeAct says the little device only works on Windows, but the open-source project is supposed to also work on macOS, Linux (including Raspberry Pi OS), and essentially any operating system with support for Python 3.9+.</p><figure id="attachment_157620" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-157620"><a href="https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WeAct-Studio-System-Monitor.webp"><img decoding="async" title="WeAct Studio System Monitor" src="https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WeAct-Studio-System-Monitor-720x384.webp" alt="WeAct Studio System Monitor" width="720" height="384" srcset="https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WeAct-Studio-System-Monitor-720x384.webp 720w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WeAct-Studio-System-Monitor-1200x640.webp 1200w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WeAct-Studio-System-Monitor-300x160.webp 300w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WeAct-Studio-System-Monitor-768x410.webp 768w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WeAct-Studio-System-Monitor.webp 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-eio="l" data-old-src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAtAAAAGAAQAAAACsSmhbAAAAAnRSTlMAAHaTzTgAAAA4SURBVHja7cExAQAAAMIg+6e2xS5gAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQO6IgAAB5pdQTgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==" data-src="https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WeAct-Studio-System-Monitor-720x384.webp" data-srcset="https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WeAct-Studio-System-Monitor-720x384.webp 720w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WeAct-Studio-System-Monitor-1200x640.webp 1200w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WeAct-Studio-System-Monitor-300x160.webp 300w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WeAct-Studio-System-Monitor-768x410.webp 768w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WeAct-Studio-System-Monitor.webp 1500w"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-157620">WeAct Studio System Monitor</figcaption></figure>
<p>The second program is called <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/weact-studio-screen-projection/">WeAct Studio Screen Projection</a>, and as I understand it, it emulates an actual display, so you could move any window/program to the USB display.&nbsp; I’m just not sure how a desktop OS like Windows will handle a tiny 160×80 “monitor”… I suppose it could be used to play a full-screen YouTube video or display photos for whatever reason. That one only works on Windows, and there’s no source code.</p><figure id="attachment_157621" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-157621"><a href="https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WeAct-Studio-Screen-Projection.webp"><img decoding="async" title="WeAct Studio Screen Projection" src="https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WeAct-Studio-Screen-Projection-720x384.webp" alt="WeAct Studio Screen Projection" width="720" height="384" srcset="https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WeAct-Studio-Screen-Projection-720x384.webp 720w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WeAct-Studio-Screen-Projection-1200x640.webp 1200w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WeAct-Studio-Screen-Projection-300x160.webp 300w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WeAct-Studio-Screen-Projection-768x410.webp 768w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WeAct-Studio-Screen-Projection.webp 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-eio="l" data-old-src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAtAAAAGAAQAAAACsSmhbAAAAAnRSTlMAAHaTzTgAAAA4SURBVHja7cExAQAAAMIg+6e2xS5gAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQO6IgAAB5pdQTgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==" data-src="https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WeAct-Studio-Screen-Projection-720x384.webp" data-srcset="https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WeAct-Studio-Screen-Projection-720x384.webp 720w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WeAct-Studio-Screen-Projection-1200x640.webp 1200w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WeAct-Studio-Screen-Projection-300x160.webp 300w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WeAct-Studio-Screen-Projection-768x410.webp 768w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WeAct-Studio-Screen-Projection.webp 1500w"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-157621">WeAct Studio Screen Projection</figcaption></figure>
