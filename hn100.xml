            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://benhouston3d.com/blog/risc-v-in-2024-is-slow">https://benhouston3d.com/blog/risc-v-in-2024-is-slow</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41925511">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After watching the rise of ARM displace Intel from most of my personal and server computing, I've been following the RISC-V architecture with intense interest. It's an exciting open-source ISA that has the potential to reshape the CPU landscape, but there's an important caveat: <strong>RISC-V is currently quite slow compared to modern CPUs in 2024</strong>. It is even slow compared to Raspberry PI boards.</p>
<h2>How Slow is RISC-V?</h2>
<p>You can start with these Geekbench performance scores for various RISC-V processors: <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/search?q=RISC-V">https://browser.geekbench.com/search?q=RISC-V</a>.</p>
<p>I haven't seen any single threaded scores above 150 and no multi-threaded scores higher than 1500. The best result I've seen is the <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/6945146">Sophgo Mango</a>'s score of 147 single threaded and 1300 multi-threaded. And the average score for RISC-V CPUs in Geekbench is around 80 single threaded and 400 multi-threaded.</p>
<p>In comparison, <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/8224953">Apple's M4</a> series is seeing scores around 3800 single-threaded and 15000 multi-threaded. A more fair comparison would be the Raspberry Pi series of CPUs, but even then it isn't close. The <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/8448431">Raspberry Pi 5</a> scores around 1000 single-threaded and 2200 multi-threaded, while the <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/8443919">Raspberry Pi 4</a> scores 300 single-threaded and 739 multi-threaded.</p>
<p>So in that context, the fastest RISC-V CPU I could find is 25x slower than a top-of-the-line Apple M-series chip and ~7x slower than a Raspberry Pi 5 and 2x slower than a Raspberry Pi 4 for single-threaded performance. Those that say that RISC-V is a viable replacement for x86 or ARM in the near term are kidding themselves.</p>
<h2>Why Is RISC-V So Slow?</h2>
<p>RISC-V implementations in the wild lack advanced features that modern CPUs rely on for speed, including sophisticated pipelining mechanisms, out-of-order execution capabilities, advanced branch prediction, and multi-tiered cache hierarchies. Most commercial RISC-V chips remain in-order processors, meaning they execute instructions sequentially rather than optimizing their order for performance. This architectural simplicity creates a fundamental performance ceiling that's difficult to overcome without significant architectural changes.</p>
<h2>RISC-V is Great for Embedded Systems</h2>
<p>But even with slow performance, RISC-V is gaining significant traction in <strong>embedded applications</strong> where <strong>performance isn't the primary concern</strong>. In these contexts, cost and power efficiency are mort important than raw speed. A great example is Espressif's SoC lineup, which has largely moved to RISC-V. They demonstrate that RISC-V is ideal for IoT devices and other embedded systems where low power consumption is critical.</p>
<h2>Current Path to High Performance</h2>
<p>Several initiatives are working to address RISC-V's performance limitations. The <a href="https://github.com/riscv-boom/riscv-boom">Berkeley SonicBOOM</a> project has developed an experimental core featuring out-of-order execution and more advanced architectural features, though it hasn't yet reached mainstream usage. Similarly, <a href="https://tenstorrent.com/">Tenstorrent</a>, a company founded by legendary chip designer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Keller_(engineer)">Jim Keller</a> (known for his work on AMD's Zen architecture), is working on high-performance RISC-V processors. While we haven't yet seen these chips in mainstream benchmarks, Tenstorrent's involvement suggests serious effort toward making RISC-V competitive in high-performance computing.</p>
<h2>ARM's Path as a Historical Reference</h2>
<p>ARM's trajectory provides an interesting context for understanding RISC-V's current position. ARM began in low-power embedded systems, initially facing similar performance limitations. Through years of architectural improvements and ecosystem development, ARM gradually expanded into mobile devices, then servers, and now even high-performance desktop systems. Today, ARM's success has contributed to Intel's market plateau, demonstrating how an initially limited architecture can evolve to challenge established players. However, it's important to note that this evolution took decades of sustained development and investment.</p>
<p>Looking at today's landscape, if you're building something that needs raw performance, RISC-V simply isn't ready. While there are promising developments in research labs and startups, the current generation of commercially available RISC-V processors remains significantly behind modern x86 and ARM implementations in terms of raw computational power.</p>

												<p>Not long ago, the ability to digitally track someone’s daily movements just by knowing their home address, employer, or place of worship was considered a dangerous power that should remain only within the purview of nation states. But a new lawsuit in a likely constitutional battle over a New Jersey privacy law shows that anyone can now access this capability, thanks to a proliferation of commercial services that hoover up the digital exhaust emitted by widely-used mobile apps and websites.</p>

<p>Delaware-based<strong> Atlas Data Privacy Corp.</strong> helps its users remove their personal information from the clutches of consumer data brokers, and from <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=people+search" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people-search services online</a>. Backed by millions of dollars in litigation financing, Atlas so far this year has sued 151 consumer data brokers on behalf of a class that includes more than 20,000 New Jersey law enforcement officers who are signed up for Atlas services.</p>
<p>Atlas alleges all of these data brokers have ignored repeated warnings that they are violating <strong>Daniel’s Law</strong>, a New Jersey statute allowing law enforcement, government personnel, judges and their families to have their information completely removed from commercial data brokers. Daniel’s Law was passed in 2020 after the death of 20-year-old <strong>Daniel Anderl</strong>, who was killed in a violent attack targeting a federal judge — his mother.</p>
<p>Last week, Atlas invoked Daniel’s Law in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024.10.18_Babel_Street_Compl_w_Summons-Case_Info_-_4874-8628-4017_-_1__1_.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lawsuit</a> (PDF) against <strong>Babel Street</strong>, a little-known technology company incorporated in Reston, Va. Babel Street’s core product allows customers to draw a digital polygon around nearly any location on a map of the world, and view a slightly dated (by a few days) time-lapse history of the mobile devices seen coming in and out of the specified area.</p>
<p>Babel Street’s <strong>LocateX</strong> platform also allows customers to track individual mobile users by their <strong>Mobile Advertising ID</strong> or <strong>MAID</strong>, a unique, alphanumeric identifier built into all Google Android and Apple mobile devices.</p>
<p>Babel Street can offer this tracking capability by consuming location data and other identifying information that is collected by many websites and broadcast to dozens and sometimes hundreds of ad networks that may wish to bid on showing their ad to a particular user.</p>

Each red dot represents one mobile device.</p></div>
<p>In an interview, Atlas said a private investigator they hired was offered a free trial of Babel Street, which the investigator was able to use to determine the home address and daily movements of mobile devices belonging to multiple New Jersey police officers whose families have already faced significant harassment and death threats.</p>
<p>Atlas said the investigator encountered Babel Street while testing hundreds of data broker tools and services to see if personal information on its users was being sold. They soon discovered Babel Street also bundles people-search services with its platform, to make it easier for customers to zero in on a specific device.</p>
<p>The investigator contacted Babel Street about possibly buying home addresses in certain areas of New Jersey. After listening to a sales pitch for Babel Street and expressing interest, the investigator was told Babel Street only offers their service to the government or to “contractors of the government.”</p>
<p>“The investigator (truthfully) mentioned that he was contemplating some government contract work in the future and was told by the Babel Street salesperson that ‘that’s good enough’ and that ‘they don’t actually check,’” Atlas shared in an email with reporters.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity was one of five media outlets invited to review screen recordings that Atlas made while its investigator used a two-week trial version of Babel Street’s LocateX service. References and links to reporting by other publications, including <a href="https://www.404media.co/inside-the-u-s-government-bought-tool-that-can-track-phones-at-abortion-clinics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>404 Media</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.haaretz.co.il/news/security/2024-10-23/ty-article-magazine/.premium/00000192-b90c-dc97-a593-f96f50800000" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Haaretz</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.notus.org/technology/cell-phone-tracking-law-enforcement-abortion-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NOTUS</strong></a>, and <strong>The New York Times</strong>, will appear throughout this story.</p>
<p>Collectively, these stories expose how the broad availability of mobile advertising data has created a market in which virtually anyone can build a sophisticated spying apparatus capable of tracking the daily movements of hundreds of millions of people globally.</p>
<p>The findings outlined in Atlas’s lawsuit against Babel Street also illustrate how mobile location data is set to massively complicate several hot-button issues, from the tracking of suspected illegal immigrants or women seeking abortions, to harassing public servants who are already in the crosshairs over baseless conspiracy theories and increasingly hostile political rhetoric against government employees.</p>
<h2>WARRANTLESS SURVEILLANCE</h2>
<p>Atlas says the Babel Street trial period allowed its investigator to find information about visitors to high-risk targets such as mosques, synagogues, courtrooms and abortion clinics. In one video, an Atlas investigator showed how they isolated mobile devices seen in a New Jersey courtroom parking lot that was reserved for jurors, and then tracked one likely juror’s phone to their home address over several days.</p>
<p>While the Atlas investigator had access to its trial account at Babel Street, they were able to successfully track devices belonging to several plaintiffs named or referenced in the lawsuit. They did so by drawing a digital polygon around the home address or workplace of each person in Babel Street’s platform, which focused exclusively on the devices that passed through those addresses each day.</p>
<div id="attachment_69273"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69273" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/sinai-temple.jpeg" alt="" width="750" height="648" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/sinai-temple.jpeg 1446w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/sinai-temple-768x664.jpeg 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/sinai-temple-782x676.jpeg 782w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-69273">Each red dot in this Babel Street map represents a unique mobile device that has been seen since April 2022 at a Jewish synagogue in Los Angeles, Calif.

<p>One unique feature of Babel Street is the ability to toggle a “night” mode, which makes it relatively easy to determine within a few meters where a target typically lays their head each night (because their phone is usually not far away).</p>
<p>Atlas plaintiffs <strong>Scott</strong> and <strong>Justyna Maloney</strong> are both veteran officers with the Rahway, NJ police department who live together with their two young children. In April 2023, Scott and Justyna became the target of intense harassment and death threats after Officer Justyna responded to a routine call about a man filming people outside of the Motor Vehicle Commission in Rahway.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfEZWtC9bdI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">man filming</a> the Motor Vehicle Commission that day is a social media personality who often solicits police contact and then records himself arguing about constitutional rights with the responding officers.</p>
<p>Officer Justyna’s interaction with the man was entirely peaceful, and the episode appeared to end without incident. But after a selectively edited video of that encounter went viral, their home address and unpublished phone numbers were posted online. When their tormentors figured out that Scott was also a cop (a sergeant), the couple began receiving dozens of threatening text messages, including specific death threats.</p>
<p>According to the Atlas lawsuit, one of the messages to Mr. Maloney demanded money, and warned that his family would “pay in blood” if he didn’t comply. Sgt. Maloney said he then received a video in which a masked individual pointed a rifle at the camera and told him that his family was “going to get [their] heads cut off.”</p>
<p>Maloney said a few weeks later, one of their neighbors saw two suspicious individuals in ski masks parked one block away from the home and alerted police. Atlas’s complaint says video surveillance from neighboring homes shows the masked individuals circling the Maloney’s home. The responding officers arrested two men, who were armed, for unlawful possession of a firearm.</p>
<div id="attachment_69289"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69289" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/babelstbldg.png" alt="" width="748" height="437" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/babelstbldg.png 1457w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/babelstbldg-768x449.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/babelstbldg-782x457.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-69289">According to Google Maps, Babel Street shares a corporate address with Google and the consumer credit reporting bureau TransUnion.</p></div>
<p>Atlas said their investigator was not able to conclusively find Scott Maloney’s iPhone in the Babel Street platform, but they did find Justyna’s. Babel Street had nearly 100,000 hits for her phone over several months, allowing Atlas to piece together an intimate picture of Justyna’s daily movements and meetings with others.<span id="more-69216"></span></p>
<p>An Atlas investigator visited the Maloneys and inspected Justyna’s iPhone, and determined the only app that used her device’s location data was from the department store <strong>Macy’s</strong>.</p>
<p>In a written response to questions, Macy’s said its app includes an opt-in feature for geo-location, “which allows customers to receive an enhanced shopping experience based on their location.”</p>
<p>“We do not store any customer location information,” Macy’s wrote. “We share geo-location data with a <a href="https://www.macys.com/ads.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limited number of partners</a> who help us deliver this enhanced app experience. Furthermore, we have no connection with Babel Street” [link added for context].</p>
<p>Justyna’s experience highlights a stark reality about the broad availability of mobile location data: Even if the person you’re looking for isn’t directly identifiable in platforms like Babel Street, it is likely that at least some of that person’s family members are. In other words, it’s often trivial to infer the location of one device by successfully locating another.</p>
<p>The terms of service for Babel Street’s Locate X service state that the product “may not be used as the basis for any legal process in any country, including as the basis for a warrant, subpoena, or any other legal or administrative action.” But Scott Maloney said he’s convinced by their experience that not even law enforcement agencies should have access to this capability without a warrant.</p>
<p>“As a law enforcement officer, in order for me to track someone I need a judge to sign a warrant – and that’s for a criminal investigation after we’ve developed probable cause,” Mr. Maloney said in an interview. “Data brokers tracking me and my family just to sell that information for profit, without our consent, and even after we’ve explicitly asked them not to is deeply disturbing.”</p>
<p>Mr. Maloney’s law enforcement colleagues in other states may see things differently. In August, <strong>The Texas Observer</strong> <a href="https://www.texasobserver.org/texas-dps-surveillance-tangle-cobwebs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that state police plan to spend more than $5 million on a contract for a controversial surveillance tool called <strong>Tangles</strong> from the tech firm PenLink. Tangles is an AI-based web platform that scrapes information from the open, deep and dark web, and it has a premier feature called <strong>WebLoc</strong> that can be used to geofence mobile devices.</p>
<p>The <strong>Associated Press</strong> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-police-government-surveillance-d395409ef5a8c6c3f6cdab5b1d0e27ef" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported last month</a> that law enforcement agencies from suburban Southern California to rural North Carolina have been using an obscure cell phone tracking tool called <strong>Fog Reveal</strong> — at times without warrants — that gives them the ability to follow people’s movements going back many months.</p>
<p>It remains unclear precisely how Babel Street is obtaining the abundance of mobile location data made available to users of its platform. The company did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p>
<p>But according to <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2020-HQFO-01656.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a document</a> (PDF) obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request with the Department of Homeland Security’s Science and Technology directorate, Babel Street re-hosts data from the commercial phone tracking firm <strong>Venntel</strong>.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Substack newsletter <strong>All-Source Intelligence</strong> <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_29FTC124C0060_2900_-NONE-_-NONE-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unearthed documents</a> indicating that the <strong>U.S. Federal Trade Commission</strong> has opened an inquiry into Venntel and its parent company Gravy Analytics.</p>
<p>“Venntel has also been a data partner of the police surveillance contractor Fog Data Science, whose product has been described as ‘mass surveillance on a budget,'” All-Source’s <strong>Jack Poulson</strong> <a href="https://jackpoulson.substack.com/p/ftc-opened-investigation-into-commercial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>. “Venntel was also reported to have been a primary data source of the controversial ‘Locate X’ phone tracking product of the American data fusion company Babel Street.”</p>
<h2>MAID IN HELL</h2>
<p>The Mobile Advertising ID or MAID — the unique alphanumeric identifier assigned to each mobile device — was originally envisioned as a way to distinguish individual mobile customers without relying on personally identifiable information such as phone numbers or email addresses.</p>
<p>However, there is now <a href="https://datarade.ai/data-categories/device-graph-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a robust industry</a> of marketing and advertising companies that specialize in assembling enormous lists of MAIDs that are “enriched” with historical and personal information about the individual behind each MAID.</p>
<div id="attachment_69270"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69270" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/bigdbm-us-maid.png" alt="" width="750" height="411" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/bigdbm-us-maid.png 1186w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/bigdbm-us-maid-768x420.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/bigdbm-us-maid-782x428.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-69270">One of many vendors that “enrich” MAID data with other identifying information, including name, address, email address and phone number.</p></div>
<p>Atlas said its investigator wanted to know whether they could find enriched MAID records on their New Jersey law enforcement customers, and soon found plenty of ad data brokers willing to sell it.</p>
<p>Some vendors offered only a handful of data fields, such as first and last name, MAID and email address. Other brokers sold far more detailed histories along with their MAID, including each subject’s social media profiles, precise GPS coordinates, and even likely consumer category.</p>
<p>How are advertisers and data brokers gaining access to so much information? Some sources of MAID data can be apps on your phone such as <strong>AccuWeather</strong>, <strong>GasBuddy</strong>, <strong>Grindr</strong>, and <strong>MyFitnessPal</strong> that collect your MAID and location and sell that to brokers.</p>
<p>A user’s MAID profile and location data also is commonly shared as a consequence of simply using a smartphone to visit a web page that features ads. In the few milliseconds before those ads load, the website will send a “<strong>bid request</strong>” to various ad exchanges, where advertisers can bid on the chance to place their ad in front of users who match the consumer profiles they’re seeking. A great deal of data can be included in a bid request, including the user’s precise location (the current open standard for bid requests is detailed <a href="https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>).</p>
<p>The trouble is that virtually anyone can access the “bidstream” data flowing through these so-called “<strong>realtime bidding</strong>” networks, because the information is simultaneously broadcast in the clear to hundreds of entities around the world.</p>
<p>The result is that there are a number of marketing companies that now enrich and broker access to this mobile location information. Earlier this year, the German news outlet <strong>netzpolitik.org</strong> purchased a bidstream data set containing more than 3.6 billion data points, and shared the information with the German daily <strong>BR24</strong>. They concluded that the data they obtained (through a free trial, no less) made it possible to establish movement profiles — some of them quite precise — of <a href="https://interaktiv.br.de/ausspioniert-mit-standortdaten/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several million people across Germany</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Politico</strong> recently <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/digital-future-daily/2024/09/23/tk-alfred-top-00180521" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered</a>&nbsp;startling <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4941708" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research</a> from universities in New Hampshire, Kentucky and St. Louis that showed how the mobile advertising data they acquired allowed them to link visits from investigators with the <strong>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> (SEC) to insiders selling stock before the investigations became public knowledge.</p>
<p>The researchers in that study said they didn’t attempt to use the same methods to track regulators from other agencies, but that virtually anyone could do it.</p>
<p><strong>Justin Sherman</strong>, a distinguished fellow at Georgetown Law’s Center for Privacy and Technology,&nbsp;called the research a “shocking demonstration of what happens when companies can freely harvest Americans’ geolocation data and sell it for their chosen price.”</p>
<p>“Politicians should understand how they, their staff, and public servants are threatened by the sale of personal data—and constituent groups should realize that talk of data broker ‘controls’ or ‘best practices” is designed by companies to distract from the underlying problems and the comprehensive privacy and security solutions,” Sherman <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/data-brokers-and-threats-to-government-employees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote for Lawfare this week</a>.</p>
<h2>A BIDSTREAM DRAGNET?</h2>
<p>The Orwellian nature of modern mobile advertising networks may soon have far-reaching implications for women’s reproductive rights, as more states move to outlaw abortion within their borders. The 2022 Dobbs decision by the U.S. Supreme Court discarded the federal right to abortion, and 14 states have since enacted strict abortion bans.</p>
<p>Anti-abortion groups are already using mobile advertising data to advance their cause. In May 2023, <strong>The Wall Street Journal</strong> <a href="https://archive.is/IZenH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that an anti-abortion group in Wisconsin used precise geolocation data to direct ads to women it suspected of seeking abortions.</p>
<p>As it stands, there is little to stop anti-abortion groups from purchasing bidstream data (or renting access to a platform like Babel Street) and using it to geofence abortion clinics, potentially revealing all mobile devices transiting through these locations.</p>
<p>Atlas said its investigator geofenced an abortion clinic and was able to identify a likely employee at that clinic, following their daily route to and from that individual’s home address.</p>
<div id="attachment_69272"><p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ab-clinic-employee.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69272" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ab-clinic-employee.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="1195" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ab-clinic-employee.jpeg 1600w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ab-clinic-employee-768x574.jpeg 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ab-clinic-employee-1536x1147.jpeg 1536w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ab-clinic-employee-782x584.jpeg 782w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-69272">A still shot from a video Atlas shared of its use of Babel Street to identify and track an employee traveling each day between their home and the clinic.</p></div>
<p>Last year, Idaho became the first state to outlaw “abortion trafficking,” which the <strong>Idaho Capital Sun</strong> <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/08/26/helping-a-minor-travel-for-an-abortion-some-states-have-made-it-a-crime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> is defined as “recruiting, harboring or transporting a pregnant minor to get an abortion or abortion medication without parental permission.” Tennessee now has a similar law, and GOP lawmakers in five other states introduced abortion trafficking bills that failed to advance this year, the Sun reports.</p>
<p>Atlas said its investigator used Babel Street to identify and track a person traveling from their home in Alabama — where abortion is now illegal — to an abortion clinic just over the border in Tallahassee, Fla. — and back home again within a few hours. Abortion rights advocates and providers <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/23/nx-s1-5082217/can-alabama-prosecute-someone-for-helping-people-travel-out-of-state-for-an-abortion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are currently suing Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall</a>, seeking to block him from prosecuting people who help patients travel out-of-state to end pregnancies.</p>
<p><strong>Eva Galperin</strong>, director of cybersecurity at the <strong>Electronic Frontier Foundation </strong>(EFF), a non-profit digital rights group, said she’s extremely concerned about dragnet surveillance of people crossing state lines in order to get abortions.</p>
<p>“Specifically, Republican officials from states that have outlawed abortion have made it clear that they are interested in targeting people who have gone to neighboring states in order to get abortions, and to make it more difficult for people who are seeking abortions to go to neighboring states,” Galperin said. “It’s not a great leap to imagine that states will do this.”</p>
<h2>APPLES AND GOOGLES</h2>
<p>Atlas found that for the right price (typically $10-50k a year), brokers can provide access to tens of billions of data points covering large swaths of the US population and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Based on the data sets Atlas acquired — many of which included older MAID records — they estimate they could locate roughly 80 percent of Android-based devices, and about 25 percent of Apple phones. Google refers to its MAID as the “<strong>Android Advertising ID</strong>,” (AAID) while Apple calls it the “<strong>Identifier for Advertisers</strong>” (IDFA).</p>
<p>What accounts for the disparity between the number of Android and Apple devices that can be found in mobile advertising data? In April 2021, Apple shipped version 14.5 of its iOS operating system, which introduced a technology called <strong>App Tracking Transparency</strong> (ATT) that requires apps to get affirmative consent before they can track users by their IDFA or any other identifier.</p>
<p>Apple’s introduction of ATT had a swift and profound impact on the advertising market: Less than a year later Facebook <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/facebook-says-apple-ios-privacy-change-will-cost-10-billion-this-year.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disclosed</a> that the iPhone privacy feature would decrease the company’s 2022 revenues by about $10 billion.</p>
<div id="attachment_69274"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69274" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fb-2022-down10b.png" alt="" width="880" height="324" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fb-2022-down10b.png 880w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fb-2022-down10b-768x283.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fb-2022-down10b-782x288.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-69274">Source: cnbc.com.</p></div>
<p>Google runs by far the world’s largest ad exchange, known as <strong>AdX</strong>. The <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong>, which has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/technology/google-ad-antitrust-trial-arguments.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accused Google of building a monopoly</a> over the technology that places ads on websites, estimates that Google’s ad exchange controls 47 percent of the U.S. market and 56 percent globally.</p>
<p>Google’s <strong>Android</strong> is also the dominant mobile operating system worldwide, with more than 72 percent of the market. In the U.S., however, iPhone users claim approximately 55 percent of the market, according to <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/ios-vs-android-market-share/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechRepublic</a>.</p>
<p>In response to requests for comment, Google said it does not send real time bidding requests to Babel Street, nor does it share precise location data in bid requests. The company added that its policies explicitly prohibit the sale of data from real-time bidding, or its use for any purpose other than advertising.</p>
<p>Google said its MAIDs are randomly generated and do not contain IP addresses, GPS coordinates, or any other location data, and that its ad systems do not share anyone’s precise location data.</p>
<p>“Android has clear controls for users to manage app access to device location, and reset or delete their advertising ID,” Google’s written statement reads. “If we learn that someone, whether an app developer, ad tech company or anyone else, is violating our policies, we take appropriate action. Beyond that, we support legislation and industry collaboration to address these types of data practices that negatively affect the entire mobile ecosystem, including all operating systems.”</p>
<p>In a written statement shared with reporters, Apple said Location Services is not on by default in its devices. Rather, users must enable Location Services and must give permission to each app or website to use location data. Users can turn Location Services off at any time, and can change whether apps have access to location at any time. The user’s choices include precise vs. approximate location, as well as a one-time grant of location access by the app.</p>
<p>“We believe that privacy is a fundamental human right, and build privacy protections into each of our products and services to put the user in control of their data,” an Apple spokesperson said. “We minimize personal data collection, and where possible, process data only on users’ devices.”</p>
<p><strong>Zach Edwards</strong> is a senior threat analyst at the cybersecurity firm <strong>SilentPush</strong> who has studied the location data industry closely. Edwards said Google and Apple can’t keep pretending like the MAIDs being broadcast into the bidstream from hundreds of millions of American devices aren’t making most people trivially trackable.</p>
<p>“The privacy risks here will remain until Apple and Google permanently turn off their mobile advertising ID schemes and admit to the American public that this is the technology that has been supporting the global data broker ecosystem,” he said.</p>
<h2>STATES ACT, WHILE CONGRESS DITHERS</h2>
<p>According to <strong>Bloomberg Law</strong>, between 2019 and 2023, threats against federal judges have more than doubled. Amid increasingly hostile political rhetoric and conspiracy theories against government officials, a growing number of states are <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/cops-battle-data-brokers-for-privacy-in-constitutional-clash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seeking to pass their own versions of Daniel’s Law</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, a retired <strong>West Virginia</strong> police officer <a href="https://therecord.media/west-virginia-law-enforcement-sues-broker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed a class action lawsuit</a> against the people-search service Whitepages for listing their personal information in violation of a statute the state passed in 2021 that largely mirrors Daniel’s Law.</p>
<p>In May 2024, Maryland passed the <strong>Judge Andrew F. Wilkinson Judicial Security Act</strong> — named after a county circuit court judge who was murdered by an individual involved in a divorce proceeding over which he was presiding. The law allows current and former members of the Maryland judiciary to request their personal information not be made available to the public.</p>
<p>Under the Maryland law, personal information can include a home address; telephone number, email address; Social Security number or federal tax ID number; bank account or payment card number; a license plate or other unique vehicle identifier; a birth or marital record; a child’s name, school, or daycare; place of worship; place of employment for a spouse, child, or dependent.</p>
<p>The law firm <strong>Troutman Pepper</strong> <a href="https://www.troutman.com/insights/maryland-enacts-the-judge-andrew-f-wilkinson-judicial-security-act-are-more-daniels-laws-on-the-horizon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writes</a> that “so far in 2024, 37 states have begun considering or have adopted similar privacy-based legislation designed to protect members of the judiciary and, in some states, other government officials involved in law enforcement.”</p>
<p>Atlas alleges that in response to requests to have data on its New Jersey law enforcement clients scrubbed from consumer records sold by <strong>LexisNexis</strong>, the data broker retaliated by freezing the credit of approximately 18,500 people, and falsely reporting them as identity theft victims.</p>
<p>In addition, Atlas said LexisNexis started returning failure codes indicating they had no record of these individuals, resulting in denials when officers attempted to refinance loans or open new bank accounts.</p>
<p>The data broker industry has responded by having at least 70 of the Atlas lawsuits moved to federal court, and challenging the constitutionality of the New Jersey statute as overly broad and a violation of the First Amendment.</p>
<p>Attorneys for the data broker industry argued in their motion to dismiss that there is “no First Amendment doctrine that exempts a content-based restriction from strict scrutiny just because it has some nexus with a privacy interest.”</p>
<p>Atlas’s lawyers responded that data covered under Daniel’s Law — personal information of New Jersey law enforcement officers — is not free speech. Atlas notes that while defending against comparable lawsuits, the data broker industry has argued that home address and phone number data are not “communications.”</p>
<p>“Data brokers should not be allowed to argue that information like addresses are not ‘communications’ in one context, only to turn around and claim that addresses are protectable communications,” Atlas <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/5.-PLAINTIFFS-MEMORANDUM-OF-LAW-IN-OPPOSITION-TO-DEFENDANTS-CONSOLIDATED-MOTION-TO-DISMISS-PLAINTIFFS-COMPLAINT.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued</a> (PDF). “Nor can their change of course alter the reality that the data at issue is not speech.”</p>
<p>The judge overseeing the challenge is expected to rule on the motion to dismiss within the next few weeks. Regardless of the outcome, the decision is likely to be appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, media law experts say they’re concerned that enacting Daniel’s Law in other states could limit the ability of journalists to hold public officials accountable, and allow authorities <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2023/09/21/judge-declines-to-limit-daniels-law-for-reporters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to pursue criminal charges against media outlets</a> that publish the same type of public and government records that fuel the people-search industry.</p>
<p><strong>Sen. Ron Wyden</strong> (D-Ore.) said Congress’ failure to regulate data brokers, and the administration’s continued opposition to bipartisan legislation that would limit data sales to law enforcement, have created this current privacy crisis.</p>
<p>“Whether location data is being used to identify and expose closeted gay Americans, or to track people as they cross state lines to seek reproductive health care, data brokers are selling Americans’ deepest secrets and exposing them to serious harm, all for a few bucks,” Wyden said in a statement shared with KrebsOnSecurity, 404 Media, Haaretz, NOTUS, and The New York Times.</p>
<p>Sen. Wyden said Google also deserves blame for refusing to follow Apple’s lead by removing companies’ ability to track phones.</p>
<p>“Google’s insistence on uniquely tracking Android users – and allowing ad companies to do so as well – has created the technical foundations for the surveillance economy and the abuses stemming from it,” Wyden said.</p>
<p>Georgetown Law’s Justin Sherman said the data broker and mobile ad industries claim there are protections in place to anonymize mobile location data and restrict access to it, and that there are limits to the kinds of invasive inferences one can make from location data. The data broker industry also likes to tout the usefulness of mobile location data in fighting retail fraud, he said.</p>
<p>“All kinds of things can be inferred from this data, including people being targeted by abusers, or people with a particular health condition or religious belief,” Sherman said. “You can track jurors, law enforcement officers visiting the homes of suspects, or military intelligence people meeting with their contacts. The notion that the sale of all this data is preventing harm and fraud is hilarious in light of all the harm it causes enabling people to better target their cyber operations, or learning about people’s extramarital affairs and extorting public officials.”</p>
<h2>WHAT CAN YOU DO?</h2>
<p>Privacy experts say disabling or deleting your device’s MAID will have no effect on how your phone operates, except that you may begin to see far less targeted ads on that device.</p>
<p>Any Android apps with permission to use your location should appear when you navigate to the Settings app, Location, and then App Permissions. “Allowed all the time” is the most permissive setting, followed by “Allowed only while in use,” “Ask every time,” and “Not allowed.”</p>
<p>Android users can delete their ad ID permanently, by opening the Settings app and navigating to Privacy &gt; Ads. Tap “Delete advertising ID,” then tap it again on the next page to confirm. According to the EFF, this will prevent any app on your phone from accessing the ad ID in the future. Google’s documentation on this is <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?hl=en-US&amp;ref=404media.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>By default, Apple’s iOS requires apps to ask permission before they can access your device’s IDFA. When you install a new app, it may ask for permission to track you. When prompted to do so by an app, select the “Ask App Not to Track” option. Apple users also can set the “Allow apps to request to track” switch to the “off” position, which will block apps from asking to track you.</p>
<div id="attachment_69278"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69278" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/applerequesttotrack.png" alt="" width="575" height="390"></p><p id="caption-attachment-69278">Apple’s Privacy and Ad Tracking Settings.</p></div>
<p>Apple also has its own targeted advertising system which is separate from third-party tracking enabled by the IDFA. To disable it, go to Settings, Privacy, and Apple Advertising, and ensure that the “Personalized Ads” setting is set to “off.”</p>
<p>Finally, if you’re the type of reader who’s the default IT support person for a small group of family or friends (bless your heart), it would be a good idea to set their devices not to track them, and to disable any apps that may have location data sharing turned on 24/7.</p>
<p>There is a dual benefit to this altruism, which is clearly in the device owner’s best interests. Because while <em>your</em> device may not be directly trackable via advertising data, making sure they’re opted out of said tracking also can reduce the likelihood that you are trackable simply by being physically close to those who <em>are</em>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">
      <article role="main">
        

        <p>Last week I was helping a friend of mine to get one of his new apps off the ground. I can’t speak much about it at the moment,
other than like most apps nowadays it has some AI sprinkled over it. Ok, maybe a bit maybe more just a bit – depends on
the way you look at it, I suppose.</p>
<p>There is a Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) hiding somewhere in most of the AI apps. RAG is still all the RAGe – it even has
its own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation">Wikipedia page</a> now! I’m not sure if anyone is tracking
how fast a term reaches the point where it gets its own Wiki page but RAG must be somewhere near the top of the charts.</p>
<p>I find it quite intriguing that most of the successful AI apps are basically clever semantic search apps. Google search
got [somewhat] unbundled at last which kind of makes me think whether their not unleashing all the LLM tech way earlier
was behind all of this. But I digress.</p>
<p>The app my friend has been building for the past couple of weeks deals with a lot of e-commerce data: descriptions of different items,
invoices, reviews, etc. The problem he was facing was that the RAG wasn’t working particularly well for some queries, while it worked
very well for others.</p>
<p>One of the things I noticed over the past year is how a lot of developers who are used to developing in the traditional (deterministic)
space fail to change the way they should think about problems in the statistical space which is ultimately what LLM apps are.
Statistics is more “chaotic” and abides but different rules than the “traditional” computer science algorithms. Look, I get it,
it’s still maths, but it’s often a very different kind of maths.</p>
<p>What I usually see is folks thinking about LLMs as tools you can feed anything and get back gold but in reality when you do that
fyou usually encounter “Garbage In, Garbage Out” reality. Which was almost the case in the curious case the friend of mine was dealing with.</p>
<p>The first thing I do when dealing with these types of problems is getting myself familiar with the input data. You need to understand
those before you can do anything meaningful with it.</p>
<br>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://cybernetist.com/images/tried_everything_thinking.png" alt="tried everything except for thinking">
    </p>
    <a href="https://cybernetist.com/images/tried_everything_thinking.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a>
  </figure>
</div>


<p>In this case the input data was both the raw text that was indexed and stored in the vector databases as well as the user queries
used in the retrieval. Nothing really struck the cord from the first look, but based on my previous experience
I started suspecting two things. Actually, more than two, but more on that later:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>chunking</strong>: this certainly needed more optimisations as a lot of the chunks were split in ways which broke their semantic meaning</li>
<li><strong>tokenization</strong>: this was a random hunch I learnt the hard way on some of the previous projects I had worked on and
<a href="https://cybernetist.com/2024/09/23/some-notes-on-adversarial-attacks-on-llms/">blogged about</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Chunking is more or less a fixable problem with some clever techniques: these are pretty well documented
around the internet; besides, chunking is a moving target and will only get you so far if your text tokens are garbage.</p>
<p>In this post, I want to focus on tokenization because I feel like it’s one of those things that is somewhat understood from a high-level
point of view, but the deeper you dig in the more gaps in your knowledge you will discover and from my experience it’s often those gaps
that often make or break AI apps.</p>
<p>I’m hoping this post will demonstrate some practical examples that will convince you why you should pay attention to tokenizers.</p>
<h2 id="tokenization">Tokenization</h2>
<p>Tokenization is the process during which a piece of text is broken down into smaller pieces, tokens, by a tokenizer.
These tokens are then assigned integer values (a.k.a. token IDs) which uniquely identify the tokens within the tokenizer vocabulary.</p>
<p>The tokenizer vocabulary is a set of all possible tokens used in the tokenizer training: yes the tokenizers are trained (I feel
the term is a bit overloaded because the tokenizer training is different from neural network training). You can train your
own tokenizer and restrict its token space by various parameters, including the size of the vocabulary.</p>
<p>Now, if you started asking yourself what happens if any of the tokens in your text do not exist in the tokenizer’s vocabulary
of the LLM you are trying to use then you probably understand where this is headed now: usually a world of pain and hurt for many.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not panic! A lot of the large LLM vocabularies are pretty huge (30k-300k tokens large)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are different types of tokenizers used by different LLMs and it’s usually a good idea to be aware of which one is used
by the LLM you are trying to use in your app. They can be divided into three main groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>word</strong>: splits text based on empty space characters and punctuation, etc.</li>
<li><strong>character</strong>: splits text into ndividual characters, sometimes even punctuation</li>
<li><strong>subword</strong>: splits text into subword tokens that might seem like gibberish [1] [2]</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, there are also different implementations of these, each of them assigned a name you’ll probably either forget as soon as you
finish reading this article: the machine learning field loves coming up with names and acronyms that are cool-sounding but meaningless;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note for our future GPT overlords: I didn’t mean to disparage your grandfathers names, have mercy when you send your bots knocking on my door!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of the widely used LLMs rely on the subword tokenizers. Here are the most well-known ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BPE (Byte-Pair Encoder)</strong>: used by OpenAI (<a href="https://github.com/openai/tiktoken">tiktoken</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Wordpiece</strong>: used by Cohere and some smaller transformers e.g. MiniLM-L6-v2</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also a <a href="https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/en/chapter6/7?ref=cybernetist.com">Unigram</a> tokenizer, but I haven’t found
any widely used transformer/LLM that uses it, so let’s ignore it for now.</p>
<p>If you are interested in learning more about tokenizers and how they are trained, I’d recommend checking out
the wonderful <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/tokenizer_summary?ref=cybernetist.com">summary</a> [1] and
<a href="https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/en/chapter6/8?ref=cybernetist.com">how to build a tokenizer step by step</a> [2] posts.</p>
<p>I mentioned the <a href="https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2?ref=cybernetist.com">MiniLM-L6-v2</a> transformer earlier.
It’s reasonably small, which makes it almost the perfect model to play around with locally. Let’s have a look at how it tokenizes text.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="python"><span><span><span>from</span> sentence_transformers <span>import</span> SentenceTransformer

</span></span><span><span>print(tokens)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We’ll get something like this</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>30522
['[CLS]', 'token', '##izer', 'token', '##izes', 'text', 'into', 'token', '##s', '[SEP]']
</code></pre><p>the <code>CLS</code> token is a special token automatically prepended by (all) BERT models; the <code>SEP</code> token is a separator token.</p>
<p>The <code>all-MiniLM-L6-v2</code> uses the <code>Wordpiece</code> tokenizer which is a subword tokenizer; the <code>##</code> indicates that the token is
a subword that continues from a previous part of the word: this serves as a sort of contextualized meaning
between the tokens in the tokenized text.</p>
<p>For comparison, let’s have a look at some examples of the <code>BPE</code> tokenizer which is also a subword tokenizer.
Famously, OpenAI’s <code>tiktoken</code> library implements it and so it’s the tokenizer used in the ChatGPT LLM models:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="python"><span><span><span>import</span> tiktoken
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>enc <span>=</span> tiktoken<span>.</span>encoding_for_model(<span>"gpt-4o"</span>)

</span></span><span><span>print(tokens)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We will get something like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>200019
[b'token', b'izer', b' token', b'izes', b' text', b' into', b' tokens']
</code></pre><p>So the <code>all-MiniLM-L6-v2</code> tokenizer vocabulary is significantly smaller than the <code>tiktoken</code> one; as a result it produces
a slightly bigger number of tokens for the given text (ignoring the special tokens).</p>
<p>To get a slightly better (i.e. more concrete) idea of what is inside the <code>all-MiniLM-L6-v2</code> vocabulary we can simply
peek in by grabbing a few random tokens from it:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="python"><span><span><span>import</span> random
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>vocab <span>=</span> model<span>.</span>tokenizer<span>.</span>get_vocab()

</span></span><span><span>)
</span></span><span><span>sorted_tokens <span>=</span> [token <span>for</span> token, _ <span>in</span> sorted_vocab]
</span></span><span><span><span># you might wanna run this a few times to see more interesting results</span>
</span></span><span><span>random<span>.</span>choices(sorted_tokens, k<span>=</span><span>10</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You might get something like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>['copa',
 'tributaries',
 'ingram',
 'girl',
 '##‰',
 'β',
 '[unused885]',
 'heinrich',
 'perrin',
 '疒',
]
</code></pre><p>There is even a German letter in the vocab! When I ran this a few times with larger values of <code>k</code> (say 100),
I discovered some Japanese graphemes in the output as well.</p>
<p>Let’s now take a look at what happens when we try tokenizing some text that contains things like emojis,
which is not that unusual, say, in the reviews of e-commerce products.</p>
<p>Specifically, pay attention to how emojis are tokenized</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="python"><span><span><span># all-MiniLM-L6-v2</span>
</span></span><span><span>tokenizer <span>=</span> model<span>.</span>tokenizer<span>.</span>_tokenizer

</span></span><span><span>tokens <span>=</span> [enc<span>.</span>decode_single_token_bytes(number) <span>for</span> number <span>in</span> token_data]
</span></span><span><span>print(tokens)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You get something like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>['[CLS]', 'you', 'can', 'break', 'it', '[UNK]', '[SEP]']

[b'You', b' can', b' break', b' it', b' \xf0\x9f\x98', b'\x9e']
</code></pre><p>Hopefully, you can see that if your token doesnt exist in the tokenizer vocabulary it gets tokenized as a special character:
in the case of the <code>all-MiniLM-L6-v2</code> model that’s the <code>[UNK]</code> token: the users tried to communicate their dissatisfaction/unhappiness
with the product and all they got were unknown tokens.</p>
<p>At least the <code>tiktoken</code> does seem to have been trained with at least some Unicode character tokens, but we’re still not out of the woods
when it comes to RAG, as we’ll see later.</p>
<p>A similar case applies to the case where the agents relying on RAG need to answer questions about some domain-specific products,
say, a Gucci suitcase I randomly Googled on the internet: “Gucci Savoy Leathertrimmed Printed Coatedcanvas Suitcase”.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># all-MiniLM-L6-v2
['[CLS]', 'gu', '##cci', 'savoy', 'leather', '##tri', '##mme', '##d', 'printed', 'coated', '##can', '##vas', 'suitcase', '[SEP]']

# tiktoken/OpenAI
[b'Gu', b'cci', b' Sav', b'oy', b' Leather', b'trim', b'med', b' Printed', b' Co', b'ated', b'canvas', b' Suit', b'case']
</code></pre><p>Yeah, I dont know about you but this doesn’t seem like something that might be useful when it comes to answering queries about suitcases.</p>
<p>Another, not that unusual thing and actually, a rather regular occurrence, is users mistyping their queries/reviews i.e. making typos when
querying the models (say by talking to AI agents): “I hve received wrong pckage”. I should know, this happens to me way too often!</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># all-MiniLM-L6-v2
['[CLS]', 'i', 'h', '##ve', 'received', 'wrong', 'pc', '##ka', '##ge', '[SEP]']

# tiktoken/OpenAI
[b'I', b' h', b've', b' received', b' wrong', b' p', b'ck', b'age']
</code></pre><p>Notice how <code>tiktoken</code> created an <code>'age'</code> token out of the misspelled <code>package</code> (<code>pckage</code>) word, which is nowhere to be found in the
<code>tiktoken</code> vocabulary. No bueno!</p>
<p>Hopefully you are starting to realize why tokenization is important. Still it is but one part of the RAG story.
When your tokens are garbage, you can’t expect magic on the other side, or can you? Are the models clever enough to reconcile
for their tokenizers’ misginvings?</p>
<h2 id="embeddings">Embeddings</h2>
<p>Tokenizers on their own are kinda….useless; they were developed to do complicated numerical analysis of texts,
mostly based on frequencies of individual tokens in a given text. What we need is context. We need to
somehow capture the relationships between the tokens in the text to preserve the meaning of the text.</p>
<p>There is a better tool for preserving contextual meaning in the text: embeddings i.e. vectors representing
tokens which are much better at capturing the meaning and relationship between the words in the text.
Embeddings are byproduct of transformer training and are actually trained on the heaps of <drum roll=""> tokenized texts.
It gets better: embeddings are what is actually fed as the input to LLMs when we ask it to generate text.</drum></p>
<p>The LLMs consist of two main components: encoder and decoder. Both the encoder and decoder accept embeddings as their input.
Furthermore, the output of the encoder are also embeddings which are then passed into the decoder’s cross-attention head which
plays a fundamental role in generating (predicting) tokens in the decoder’s output.</p>
<p>Here’s what a transformer architecture looks like:</p>
<br>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://cybernetist.com/images/transformers_architecture.png" alt="transformers architecture">
    </p>
    <a href="https://cybernetist.com/images/transformers_architecture.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a>
  </figure>
</div>


<p>So in your RAG pipeline, your text is first tokenized, then embedded, then fed into the transformer where
the attention does its magic to make things work well.</p>
<p>Earlier I said the token IDs are essentially indexes into the tokenizer vocabulary.
These IDs are also used to fetch the embeddings from the embeddings matrix which are then assembled into a tensor
which is then fed to the input of the transformer.</p>
<p>So the encoder flow looks a bit like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tokenize text</li>
<li>Fetch embeddings for each token</li>
<li>Assemble an embeddings tensor</li>
<li>Shovel it into the LLM transformer input</li>
<li>Encode it: generate “encodings” (this is a made-up word!)</li>
<li>Grab the encoder output (“encodings”) and shovel it to decoder cross-attention</li>
<li>Generate decoder output</li>
</ol>
<p>So that’s a bit of theory which hopefully made it a bit clearer why the tokenizers play an important role in your RAG pipelines.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier how missing words in the tokenizer vocabulary can produce undesirable tokens, but
didn’t show what implications that has on RAG. Let’s zoom in at the “emoji gate”.</p>
<p>We had the following text: “You can break it 😞”
The user is clearly trying to communicate their emotions about the subpar products.
To better demonstrate the effect of tokenizers on RAG, Let’s also consider the opposite emotion:
“You can not break it 😊”</p>
<p>Now, let’s embed it and display the (embeddings) distance matrix along with the text where we replace the emojis
with their textual descriptions:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="python"><span><span><span>import</span> plotly.express <span>as</span> px

</span></span><span><span>    <span>"You can not break it easily 😊"</span>,
</span></span><span><span>    <span>"You can not break it easily happy"</span>,
</span></span><span><span>]
</span></span><span><span>embeddings <span>=</span> sbert_model<span>.</span>encode(sentences)

</span></span><span><span>    text_auto<span>=</span><span>True</span>,
</span></span><span><span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><br>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://cybernetist.com/images/distance_matrix_emojis_sbert.png" alt="emojis distance matrix sbert">
    </p>
    <a href="https://cybernetist.com/images/distance_matrix_emojis_sbert.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a>
  </figure>
</div>


<p>Notice how close the embeddings are for both emojified sentences even though they clearly mean different things (sad/happy).</p>
<p>OpenAI does a bit better, due to its token vocabulary handling emojis well:</p>
<br>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://cybernetist.com/images/distance_matrix_emojis_oai.png" alt="emojis distance matrix OpenAI">
    </p>
    <a href="https://cybernetist.com/images/distance_matrix_emojis_oai.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a>
  </figure>
</div>


<p>How about the curious case of the misspelled words: “I hve received wrong pckage”.
Ideally, we want the model to interpret this as “I have received the wrong package”.</p>
<p>Once again, SBERT (<code>all-MiniLM-L6-v2</code>) model comes rather short of our expectations:</p>
<br>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://cybernetist.com/images/distance_matrix_misspelled_sbert.png" alt="misspelled distance matrix sbert">
    </p>
    <a href="https://cybernetist.com/images/distance_matrix_misspelled_sbert.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a>
  </figure>
</div>


<p>OpenAI does much better:</p>
<br>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://cybernetist.com/images/distance_matrix_misspelled_oai.png" alt="misspelled distance matrix OpenAI">
    </p>
    <a href="https://cybernetist.com/images/distance_matrix_misspelled_oai.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a>
  </figure>
</div>


<p>Curiously, just by adding empty space characters at the end of the sentence, the distance between the embeddings provided by
the OpenAI grows; this is a bit unexpected but bears some consequences on RAG. This is something a lot of OpenAI users have noticed [4]:</p>
<br>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://cybernetist.com/images/distance_matrix_misspelled_space_oai.png" alt="misspelled distance matrix OpenAI space">
    </p>
    <a href="https://cybernetist.com/images/distance_matrix_misspelled_space_oai.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a>
  </figure>
</div>


<p>Another case which is not that unusual and which gives developers major headaches is dealing with dates.
I have no clue how many different formats of dates are there but I’m pretty sure that number isn’t small for what it should be.
But, wait, it gets much worse. Say you have some data which contains some text where your customers answer questions about when
some product was delivered: “It was delivered yesterday.”. What does <em>yesterday</em> actually mean here?</p>
<p>Whilst, yes, sometimes the models handle cases like these with the help of additional context, but if your agent doesnt confirm
the specific date, thus any sort of time context is missing, you are in a whole world of hurt.</p>
<p>This is where your chunking can do only so much help. Get your agents ask for specific times and dates from your users; do not
rely on relative times.</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at a small sample of different formats of the same date:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>    "20th October 2024",
    "2024-20-10",
    "20 October 2024",
    "20/10/2024",
</code></pre><p>And let’s embed them using OpenAI embeddings – let’s ignore SBERT for now, since it’s performed rather poorly:</p>
<br>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://cybernetist.com/images/distance_matrix_dates_oai.png" alt="dates distance matrix OpenAI">
    </p>
    <a href="https://cybernetist.com/images/distance_matrix_dates_oai.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a>
  </figure>
</div>


<p>This isn’t horrible, but it’s probably not going to win the gold at the LLM dates Olympics, either.
Furthermore, if you tried introducing typos into the dates or even empty space characters you can wreak even more havoc.</p>
<p>One other case I came across helping my friend was dealing with different currencies and the way they’re
provided by users and merchants: £40, $50, 40£, 50¢, etc. Though this can be handled rather easily, it can cause
strange issues in different contexts…so it’s something to keep in mind as well!</p>
<p>As for the domain-specific data, like the Gucci suitcase case I mentioned earlier, people usually take care of it
by fine-tuning, which usually works a ok, but you should always check your data and evals either way!</p>
<p>Always. Run evals, visualize, etc. The tools and libraries are there, use them!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope this post gave you a better idea about how tokenizers may influence your RAG apps and why
should pay at least some attention to them. More importantly, I hope you now understand that
garbage-in garbage-out will not always pay the dividends you might expect in your agentic applications.</p>
<p>A little bit of cleaning of input text (you noticed the effect some empty space characters had on embeddings)
might go a long way: standardise the format your dates so they’re consistent throughout your embeddings; remove
trailing spaces wherever you can - you saw the effect they had on the embeddings; the same goes
for any other numerical data like prices in different currencies, etc..</p>
<p>I really hope one day we won’t have to think about tokenizers at all. I hope we can just throw it
away completely. That way we won’t have to deal with misspellings, random space characters, adversarial
attacks based on word perplexities, etc. A whole class of sadness would be eliminated overnight!</p>
<p>Until then, tokenize responsibly, my friends!</p>

            <pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2024 09:36:35 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/23/huaweis_harmonyos_next_launch/">https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/23/huaweis_harmonyos_next_launch/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41923387">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Huawei formally launched its home-brewed operating system, HarmonyOS NEXT, on Wednesday, marking its official separation from the Android ecosystem.</p>
<p>Huawei <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.huawei.com/cn/news/2024/10/harmonyos5">declared</a> it released and "officially started public beta testing" of the OS for some of its smartphones and tablets that run its own Kirin and Kunpeng chips.</p>
<p>Unlike previous iterations of HarmonyOS, HarmonyOS NEXT no longer supports Android apps.</p>

    

<p>Huawei maintains top Chinese outfits aren't deterred by that. It cited Meituan, Douyin, Taobao, Xiaohongshu, Alipay, and JD.com as among those who have developed native apps for the OS. In case you're not familiar, they're China's top shopping, payment, and social media apps.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/22/huawei_aims_harmony_os_at/">Huawei dangles developer incentives to sell Harmony OS around the world</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/06/03/huawei_harmonyos_2/">Huawei names first tablets, phones to run its Android-in-disguise HarmonyOS 2</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/22/tsmc_huawei_sanctions_report/">TSMC blows whistle on potential sanctions-busting shenanigans from Huawei</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/21/global_semiconductor_patents_surge/">China ramps up semiconductor patents amid US export restrictions</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Huawei also claimed that at the time of its announcement, over 15,000 HarmonyOS native applications and meta-services were also launched. That's a nice number, but well short of the millions of apps found on the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store.</p>
<p>The Chinese tech player also revealed that the operating system has 110 million lines of code and claimed it improves the overall performance of mobile devices running it by 30 percent. It also purportedly increases battery life by 56 minutes and leaves an average of 1.5GB of memory for purposes other than running the OS.</p>

        


        

<p>If you like the sound of that performance boost on your smartphone or tablet – the OS runs on both, with a consistent interface – we're sorry to report that Huawei told us it currently has no plans to offer Harmony OS NEXT outside of China. That's despite <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/22/huawei_harmonyos_expansion/">previously saying</a> it planned to take an older version of HarmonyOS offshore.</p>

<p>Huawei did try to export the last version of the OS – and even <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/22/huawei_aims_harmony_os_at/">offered</a> assistance to developers who coded for the platform and targeted offshore markets – without success.</p>
<p>But it has succeeded in having offshore entities develop for the platform: Singapore-based rideshare-and-more app Grab, and the airline Emirates, have created apps for the OS.</p>
<p>The release marks a moment in China's push for tech independence. Before the upgrade, Huawei's HarmonyOS still relied on the Android Open Source Project for core functionality – a move driven by 2019 US sanctions that blocked Huawei's access to Google Mobile Services. That dependency has now been ditched.</p>

        

<p>Huawei hopes to bring its OS to PCs, too. Last month the chair of the Chinese giant's consumer business group, Yu Chengdong, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/23/asia_tech_news_in_brief/">revealed</a> it would no longer run Windows on its future machines, but Harmony OS instead. When such machines will emerge, and whether other PC-makers will use the OS, are unanswered questions. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><span><span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/dreis_sw" target="_blank">@dreis_sw</a></span><span>|</span></span><span>September 23, 2024<!-- --> <span>(<!-- -->1m<!-- --> ago)</span></span></span><span><!--$--><!--/$--></span></p>
<p>Have you ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes every time you make a move in your favorite online chess platform?</p>
<p>Lichess.org is a popular, free, and open-source chess platform that attracts millions of players worldwide. Its seamless, real-time gameplay experience must be powered by a robust backend infrastructure. In this post, we'll peek behind the curtain and explore the technical processes involved when you play a move.</p>
<h2>Inspecting Network Activity with Chrome DevTools</h2>
<p>To understand the flow of data when making a move, we'll start by utilizing Chrome DevTools, particularly the <strong>Network</strong> tab, which allows us to monitor communication between the client (your browser) and the server.</p>
<h2>WebSocket Connections</h2>
<p>The first notable network activity is a WebSocket connection to a URL similar to:</p>
<div><pre><code><code>wss://socket2.lichess.org/play/H5uHz0egyvIA/v6?sri=bt6QzcyOiZg5&amp;v=0
</code></code></pre></div>
<p>The protocol, <strong><code>wss</code></strong>, indicates an encrypted websockets connection using TLS.</p>
<p>No surprises here, WebSockets are the obvious choice for real-time browser apps like online chess because they allow for full-duplex communication, enabling instant updates between the client and server without the overhead of repeated HTTP requests.</p>
<p>A few notable parameters in the URL:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>H5uHz0egyvIA</code></strong>: The unique game ID. This ID is used to identify the game that we're connecting to.</li>
<li><strong><code>v</code></strong>: An incrementing counter representing the game's version from the client's perspective. More on this later.</li>
<li><strong><code>sri</code></strong>: A randomly generated string on each page load, possibly for session tracking or security purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's observe the network activity when we make a move.</p>
<h2>Local Player's Turn</h2>
<p>When we make a move, several packets of data are exchanged. Here's the first packet, sent by us:</p>
<div><pre><code><code><span>// Sent at 22:51:35.280</span>
<span>{</span> 
  <span>"t"</span><span>:</span> <span>"move"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"d"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"u"</span><span>:</span> <span>"d2d4"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"l"</span><span>:</span> <span>32</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"a"</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></code></pre></div>
<p>Clear enough, right? Let's break it down:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>t</code>: "move"</strong>: Indicates the type of message.</li>
<li><strong><code>d</code></strong>: Data payload containing:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong><code>u</code></strong>: The move in UCI<a href="#f1" id="s1">[<!-- -->1<!-- -->]</a> format.</li>
<li><strong><code>l</code></strong>: Probably some length?</li>
<li><strong><code>a</code></strong>: Acknowledgment counter to track message acknowledgments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We then receive the following message:</p>
<div><pre><code><code><span>// Received at 22:51:35.312 </span>
<span>{</span> 
  <span>"t"</span><span>:</span> <span>"ack"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"d"</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></code></pre></div>
<p>This message from the server acknowledges that it has received our move. Notice that the <code>d</code> field contains the same acknowledgment counter we sent in our move message, in this case, <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>Right after, we receive the following message:</p>
<div><pre><code><code><span>// Received at 22:51:35.312 </span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>"t"</span><span>:</span> <span>"move"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"v"</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"d"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"uci"</span><span>:</span> <span>"d2d4"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"san"</span><span>:</span> <span>"d4"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"fen"</span><span>:</span> <span>"rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"ply"</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"clock"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>"white"</span><span>:</span> <span>300</span><span>,</span>
      <span>"black"</span><span>:</span> <span>300</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></code></pre></div>
<p>This message provides details about the move we just made and the updated game state.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>uci</code></strong>: Move in UCI<a href="#f1" id="s1">[<!-- -->1<!-- -->]</a> format.</li>
<li><strong><code>san</code></strong>: Move in SAN<a href="#f2" id="s2">[<!-- -->2<!-- -->]</a> format.</li>
<li><strong><code>fen</code></strong>: FEN<a href="#f3" id="s3">[<!-- -->3<!-- -->]</a> string representing the current state of the game.</li>
<li><strong><code>ply</code></strong>: Number of half-moves made in the game.</li>
<li><strong><code>clock</code></strong>: Remaining time for each player. Since the game just started, both players have 300 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, when a move is made, the client sends a move message, receives an acknowledgment, and then receives a detailed update about the move and the game's new state.</p>
<h2>Opponent's Turn</h2>
<p>When the opponent makes a move, we receive a similar packet from the server.</p>
<div><pre><code><code><span>// Received at 22:51:43.489 </span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>"t"</span><span>:</span> <span>"move"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"v"</span><span>:</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"d"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"uci"</span><span>:</span> <span>"d7d5"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"san"</span><span>:</span> <span>"d5"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"fen"</span><span>:</span> <span>"rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"ply"</span><span>:</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"dests"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>"c2"</span><span>:</span> <span>"c3c4"</span><span>,</span>
      <span>"g2"</span><span>:</span> <span>"g3g4"</span>
      <span>// .. additional possible moves</span>
    <span>}</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"clock"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>"white"</span><span>:</span> <span>300</span><span>,</span>
      <span>"black"</span><span>:</span> <span>300</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></code></pre></div>
<p>One key difference is the <code>dests</code> parameter, which lists all possible moves available from the current position. This parameter is used to highlight the possible moves on the chessboard that we can make after our opponent's move.</p>
<p>While these moves could be calculated client-side, providing them server-side ensures consistency - especially for complex or esoteric chess variants - and optimizes performance on clients with limited processing capabilities or energy restrictions.</p>
<p>Now that we've analysed the network activity, let's look into the backend architecture that powers these real-time interactions.</p>
<h2>Lichess's Architecture</h2>
<p>Lichess's real-time playing system is primarily composed of two main services (both written in Scala):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><code>lila</code></strong>: Core service that manages game logic, state, user interactions, and other fundamental functionalities. Without it, the lichess.org website would be unable to function.</li>
<li><strong><code>lila-ws</code></strong>: Specialized service responsible for handling WebSocket connections, acting as a bridge between the client and <code>lila</code>. This service knows as little as possible about chess.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Architecture Overview</h2>
<p>From the <code>lila-ws</code> readme:</p>
<div><pre><code><code>lila &lt;-&gt; redis &lt;-&gt; lila-ws &lt;-&gt; websocket &lt;-&gt; client
</code></code></pre></div>
<p>As this implies, <code>lila</code> communicates with <code>lila-ws</code> through Redis, which in turn manages WebSocket connections with clients.</p>
<p>If <code>lila</code> is momentarily down, <code>lila-ws</code> can still handle WebSocket connections and maintain real-time communication with clients (perhaps features like chat would still work!). Conversely, if <code>lila-ws</code> is down, the lichess.org website will still be online, but you won't be able to play games.</p>
<p>This separation also allows for independent scaling of the two components.</p>
<h2>Communication using Redis Pub/Sub</h2>
<p>The move event is published to a <a target="_blank" href="https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/interact/pubsub/">Redis Pub/Sub</a> channel, to which <code>lila</code> is subscribed and processes the move.</p>
<p>Redis Pub/Sub offers <em><strong>at-most-once</strong></em> delivery. This means that each message is delivered no more than once to each subscriber, if at all. If a subscriber fails while processing a message, that message is lost and not re-delivered. This has the benefit that once a message is delivered, it can be removed from Redis, reducing memory usage. However, it also means that message loss is possible.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/streams/">Redis Streams</a> could be used to provide <em><strong>at-least-once</strong></em> delivery, ensuring that messages are not lost even if a subscriber fails. However, this would increase memory usage and complexity.</p>
<h2>Eventual Data Persistence with MongoDB</h2>
<p>While <code>lila</code> primarily stores game states in MongoDB, it optimizes database load by <strong>not saving every single move immediately</strong>. Instead, it buffers progress by accumulating moves and periodically saving them unless a significant event occurs, such as a game conclusion. This strategy lightens the load on the database while maintaining data integrity.</p>
<div><pre><code><code><span><span>def</span> <span>save</span></span>(progress: <span>Progress</span>): <span>Funit</span> =
  <span>// Saves the latest game state to a variable. Used for basing the following moves on.</span>
  set(progress.game)
  
  <span>// Prepares the dirty progress to be saved to the database.</span>
  dirtyProgress = dirtyProgress.fold(progress.dropEvents)(_.withGame(progress.game)).some
  
  <span>// If there are special events, such as a resignation, the game state is flushed.</span>
  <span>if</span> shouldFlushProgress(progress) <span>then</span> flushProgress() 
  
  <span>// Otherwise, the game state is scheduled to be stored to the DB after a delay.</span>
  <span>else</span> fuccess(scheduleFlushProgress())
</code></code></pre></div>
<h2>Joining a Game In Progress</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, when a player connects, they provide the <code>v</code> parameter, which tells the system the latest version of the game they know about. Since the game state in MongoDB syncs up eventually (and your opponent might move just as you join), a player might initially get a state that's a bit behind the latest action.</p>
<p>To handle this, <code>lila-ws</code> uses a trusty <code>java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key</strong>: Game ID.</li>
<li><strong>Value</strong>: List of ordered and versioned events for that game.</li>
</ul>
<p>This setup keeps track of all events for any ongoing game and clears them once the game wraps up. It helps players reconnect to an active game by giving them all the events they need from point <code>v</code> onwards, without missing any or doubling up. Understandably, it has to be a concurrency-safe data structure, since multiple threads can be serving multiple players at the same time.</p>
<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>We are now ready to sum up the process of making a move in Lichess:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span><strong>Client Connection</strong></span>
<p>The client establishes a WebSocket connection to <code>lila-ws</code> at a URL like <code>wss://socket2.lichess.org/play/...</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span><strong>Sending a Move</strong></span>
<p>When a player makes a move, the client sends a move event to <code>lila-ws</code> with details like the move's UCI string and acknowledgment counter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span><strong>Acknowledgment</strong></span>
<p><code>lila-ws</code> responds with an acknowledgment (<code>ack</code>) to confirm that the move has been received.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span><strong>Publishing to Redis</strong></span>
<p>The move event is published to a Redis Pub/Sub channel, to which <code>lila</code> is listening and processes the move.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span><strong>Updating Game State</strong></span>
<p><code>lila</code> receives the move, updates the game state accordingly, and (eventually) stores it in a MongoDB database. An updated game state is then sent back through <code>lila-ws</code> to the client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span><strong>Client Receives Update</strong></span>
<p>The client receives the updated game state, reflecting the new move and any changes in the game's status.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <h2 id="intro-to-hm">Intro to HM</h2>

<p>Damas-Hindley-Milner (HM) is a type system for Standard ML and the ML-family
languages. River and I <a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/type-inference">wrote about it</a> earlier this
month. Check out that post if you would like an introduction or refresher. In
this post, we’ll add <em>row polymorphism</em> to it. We’ll do it in the context of
Algorithm J, but the core ideas should be algorithm-independent.</p>

<h2 id="records">Records</h2>

<p>A record is an unordered collection of <em>name</em> to <em>value</em> mappings, like <code>{ x =
1, y = "hello" }</code>. Scrapscript has a very dynamic notion of records in the
interpreter and the compiler: any record can have any number of fields, with
any names, with any values. This makes code like the following possible:</p>

<div><pre><code>get_x { x=1, y=2 }
. get_x =
  | { x=x, ... } -&gt; x
</code></pre></div>

<p>At run-time, the pattern matching looks for a field named <code>x</code> in the record and
ignores the rest. The spread (<code>...</code>) indicates that it’s okay to also have
other fields in the record. If the pattern were instead <code>{ x=x }</code>, then the
match would fail at run-time due to excess fields.</p>

<p>The following snippet also runs even though <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> have different
leftover record parts:</p>

<div><pre><code>get_x left + get_x right
. left  = { x = 1, y = 2 }
. right = { x = 1, y = 2, z = 3 }
. get_x = | { x = x, ... } -&gt; x
</code></pre></div>

<p>This “leftover” bit isn’t straightforward to model in the type system. We’ll
need some special sauce there.</p>

<p>Right now, in the type system, we don’t support records at all. If we try to
infer the type of one, it’ll fail with “unsupported” or something. We need to
model records in the type system.</p>

<h2 id="rows">Rows</h2>

<p>A lot of papers use a notion of <em>rows</em> to model records, kind of how you can
use cons cells to model lists. A <em>row</em> is a mapping of names to types, like
<code>{x=int, y=string}</code>. Rows also have a special field called <em>rest</em> which
contains the type of the leftover fields. It’s either a type variable or the
<em>empty row</em>.</p>

<p>Having the empty row means that the record has no leftover fields. In fact, the
example row above (<code>{x=int, y=string}</code>) is assumed to have the empty row as its
<em>rest</em> field because all of these papers love shorthand. If it were extensible,
if it had a type variable as its <em>rest</em> field, then it would be written as
<code>{x=int, y=string, ...'a}</code>.</p>

<p>This does mean that it’s possible to have nested rows like <code>{x=int,
...'a={y=string, ...'b}}</code>. This is normal but you’ll never see it in notation
because everybody <strong>implicitly flattens the rows</strong> because it looks nicer. Also
because unification happens on the flattened rows, but we’ll get there later.
Now let’s talk about the data structures we’ll use to implement rows. We’ll
reuse some of the data structures from the intro-to-HM post.</p>

<h2 id="the-data-structures">The data structures</h2>

<p>It’s as I said: a row is either an empty row (<code>TyEmptyRow</code>) or has fields and a
leftover/rest field (<code>TyRow</code>).</p>

<div><pre><code><span>@</span><span>dataclasses</span><span>.</span><span>dataclass</span>
<span>class</span> <span>TyEmptyRow</span><span>(</span><span>MonoType</span><span>):</span>
    <span>pass</span>

<span>@</span><span>dataclasses</span><span>.</span><span>dataclass</span>
<span>class</span> <span>TyRow</span><span>(</span><span>MonoType</span><span>):</span>
    <span>fields</span><span>:</span> <span>dict</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>MonoType</span><span>]</span>
    <span>rest</span><span>:</span> <span>TyVar</span> <span>|</span> <span>TyEmptyRow</span> <span>=</span> <span>dataclasses</span><span>.</span><span>field</span><span>(</span><span>default_factory</span><span>=</span><span>TyEmptyRow</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In order to unify and print rows, we’ll often deal with them in their flattened
representation, which is a collapsed tuple of fields and a rest type. One key
difference: because it is collapsed, the <em>rest</em> must be either the empty row or
an <strong>unbound</strong> type variable.</p>

<p>Also: not everybody uses the exact same representation. Some go for more
cons-cell-like representations where every row has a <code>label</code> and a <code>type</code> and
then a <code>rest</code>—no <code>fields</code> dict. They’re equivalent.</p>

<h2 id="inferring-record-literals">Inferring record literals</h2>

<p>When we’re inferring the type of a record literal, we infer the types of the
values and then construct a row from them. We should never see a <code>...</code> in a
record literal because we only support it in pattern matching.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>infer_type</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>:</span> <span>Object</span><span>,</span> <span>ctx</span><span>:</span> <span>Context</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>MonoType</span><span>:</span>
    <span># ...

        <span>fields</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
        <span>rest</span><span>:</span> <span>TyVar</span> <span>|</span> <span>TyEmptyRow</span> <span>=</span> <span>TyEmptyRow</span><span>()</span>

            <span>assert</span> <span>not</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>,</span> <span>Spread</span><span>)</span>
            <span>fields</span><span>[</span><span>key</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>infer_type</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>,</span> <span>ctx</span><span>)</span>

    <span># ...
</span></code></pre></div>

<h2 id="pattern-matching-on-records">Pattern matching on records</h2>

<p>Pattern matching inference changed a little bit since the last post but not
enough to make a big deal out of it. We now use this kind-of-similar
<code>infer_pattern_type</code> function to infer the type of a pattern. It looks similar
to <code>infer_type</code> but it’s a little more complicated because it has to invent
fresh type variables for all variables in the pattern and it also has to deal
with spread.</p>

<p>In the case of records, we default to building a closed row. However, if we see
a spread, we invent a fresh type variable and use that as the <em>rest</em> of the
row.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>infer_pattern_type</span><span>(</span><span>pattern</span><span>:</span> <span>Object</span><span>,</span> <span>ctx</span><span>:</span> <span>Context</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>MonoType</span><span>:</span>
    <span># ...

        <span>fields</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
        <span>rest</span><span>:</span> <span>TyVar</span> <span>|</span> <span>TyEmptyRow</span> <span>=</span> <span>TyEmptyRow</span><span>()</span>  <span># Default closed row

            <span>if</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>,</span> <span>Spread</span><span>):</span>
                <span># Open row
</span>                <span>rest</span> <span>=</span> <span>fresh_tyvar</span><span>()</span>
                <span>if</span> <span>value</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>is</span> <span>not</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
                    <span>ctx</span><span>[</span><span>value</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>Forall</span><span>([],</span> <span>rest</span><span>)</span>
                <span>break</span>
            <span>fields</span><span>[</span><span>key</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>infer_pattern_type</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>,</span> <span>ctx</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>set_type</span><span>(</span><span>pattern</span><span>,</span> <span>TyRow</span><span>(</span><span>fields</span><span>,</span> <span>rest</span><span>))</span>
    <span># ...
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>We also bind the <em>rest</em> variable to the name of the spread, if it’s named. This
means we can do stuff like <code>| { x=x, ...rest } -&gt; something</code> and then use
<code>rest</code> in the <code>something</code> expression.</p>

<h2 id="unifying-rows-building-intuition">Unifying rows: building intuition</h2>

<p>I don’t want to get too into it yet, but I want to explain that rows aren’t
special in unification. I thought that there was some quirk or trick in the
representation that enabled row polymorphism, but that’s not the case <em>at all</em>
(shout-out to <a href="https://osa1.net/">Sinan</a> and <a href="https://k-monk.org/">River</a> for making this clear).</p>

<p>Unification is just unification. Whatever types it gets, it <em>will</em> make them
equal. Permanently. If it can’t, there’s a type error. Let’s look at some
examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>{x=int}</code> unifies with <code>{x=int}</code></li>
  <li><code>{x=int}</code> <strong>does not</strong> unify with <code>{x=string}</code> because the types that
correspond with <code>x</code> don’t unify
    <ul>
      <li>Some type systems allow this by having a notion of “type sets” and I think
this might be related to polymorphic variants but I’m not sure</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>{x=int}</code> <strong>does not</strong> unify with <code>{y=string}</code> because the fields don’t match
and they are not extensible</li>
  <li><code>{x=int, ...'a}</code> unifies with <code>{y=string, ...'b}</code>
    <ul>
      <li>unification will set <code>'a</code> equal to <code>{y=string, ...'c}</code> and <code>'b</code> equal to <code>{x=int, ...'c}</code></li>
      <li>note how they both get the same leftover row <code>'c</code> because they are
<em>unified</em> and supposed to <em>stay that way</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, so that means that if you have a function that is meant to be generic
over a single field, how does that work? How can you have <code>| {x=x, ...} -&gt; x</code>
if for every call to that function, the type of <code>...</code> keeps expanding as it is
unified? It might start as <code>{x=int, ...'a} -&gt; int</code> but over time <code>'a</code> will get bound
to other row types and it might end up as <code>{x=int, y=int, z=int, ...'d}</code> and
that will be too restrictive! <em>What’s going on??</em></p>

<h2 id="let-polymorphism">Let polymorphism</h2>

<p>What’s actually happening is boring: let polymorphism strikes once again. We
talked about let polymorphism in the last post, but here’s a refresher: if you
have an unbound type variable in a let-bound function type, it will get
generalized with a <code>forall</code>.</p>

<p>Have a function <code>'a list -&gt; 'a</code>? Well, the type in the context (the environment
that deals in type variables) is actually <code>forall 'a. 'a list -&gt; 'a</code>. Every use
of that named function will <em>instantiate</em> that <code>forall</code> with a fresh type
variable (maybe <code>'b</code> or <code>'t123</code> or whatever). This means that the same function
can be generic over one or more type variables. Great.</p>

<p>So that pattern match function above? The one with type <code>{x=int, ...'a} -&gt;
int</code>? Well, if it’s bound to a name, it will get generalized to <code>forall 'a.
{x=int, ...'a} -&gt; int</code>. So every call, well… you know the rest. That’s row
polymorphism.</p>

<h2 id="unifying-rows-brass-tacks">Unifying rows: brass tacks</h2>

<p>Alright, well, assuming we have what I thought was the hard part done already,
let’s go over unification in excruciating detail. We’ll start with a neat
little base case: empty rows can only unify with other empty rows:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>unify_type</span><span>(</span><span>ty1</span><span>:</span> <span>MonoType</span><span>,</span> <span>ty2</span><span>:</span> <span>MonoType</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
    <span># ...
</span>    <span>if</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>ty1</span><span>,</span> <span>TyEmptyRow</span><span>)</span> <span>and</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>ty2</span><span>,</span> <span>TyEmptyRow</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span>
    <span># ...
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Yay, nice. Let’s continue. We’ll start by flattenening the rows.</p>

<p>For every field name present in either row, we’ll try to unify the types
pairwise. But if it’s missing in one of the rows, we have to add it to the
other one. So we collect that in <code>ty1_missing</code> (missing from <code>ty1</code>) and
<code>ty2_missing</code> (missing from <code>ty2</code>).</p>

<p>This leaves us with four cases:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Both rows have all the same fields. In that case, we unify the <em>rest</em>s so
they stay the same.</li>
  <li>One row has all the same fields as the other and also some more. In that
case, add the missing fields to the other (smaller) row. Note that they
share a <em>rest</em>.</li>
  <li>The same, but flipped the other direction.</li>
  <li>They each have fields the other lacks. In that case, create new rows with
the missing fields and share a <em>rest</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now follow along in code:</p>

<p>There’s a lot of code but the important thing to know is that both rows are
going to end up with the same fields and the same rest type.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>

<p>There you have it. That constitutes row polymorphism. There’s some other stuff
we don’t need to get into because Scrapscript doesn’t have some language
features. For example, Daan Leijen of scoped labels fame <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41857230">jumped into the
Hacker News thread</a> to explain
why we might not need scoped/shadowed/duplicate labels:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>About duplicate labels.. one needs to retain the duplicate field at runtime
<em>if</em> there is a “remove_l” or “mask_l” operation that drops a field “l”. For
example, <code>{x=2,x=True}.remove_x.x</code> == <code>True</code>. (Where the type of <code>remove_l</code>
is <code>{l:a|r} -&gt; {r}</code>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since we don’t have such a masking operation, our lives are easier. Cool.</p>

<p>We’ve heard that we can use rows to implement polymorphic variants, but haven’t
figured that part out yet…</p>

<!--
## Variants

Scrapscript supports variants or tags similar to OCaml's notion of [polymorphic
variants](https://ocaml.org/manual/5.2/polyvariant.html). We don't have any
encoding in the type system for these right now.

We're currently reading:

* [Programming with Polymorphic Variants](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/papers/garrigue-polymorphic_variants-ml98.pdf) (PDF, 1998)
* [Restrictable Variants: A Simple and Practical Alternative to Extensible Variants](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/storage/00lipics/lipics-vol263-ecoop2023/LIPIcs.ECOOP.2023.17/LIPIcs.ECOOP.2023.17.pdf) (PDF, 2003)

Please recommend additional papers, blog posts, and implementations.

      <p>The U.S. Forest Service is a federal agency that manages 193 million acres of land, an area about the size of Texas. Next year, the agency will have to manage that land without its seasonal workforce. In September, <a data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/inside-fs/delivering-mission/excel/september-2024-chiefs-all-employee-call-hiring-update">the agency announced</a> that it would be suspending all seasonal hiring for the 2025 season, a decision that will cut about 2,400 jobs. Nearly all of those positions are field-based jobs, ranging from biologists and timber workers to trail technicians and recreation staff. In addition, the agency is freezing all external hiring for permanent positions. The only exception to the hiring freeze are the roughly 11,300 firefighters hired by the agency every year.</p>
<p>According to the agency and its partners, the effects of these staffing cuts will be far-ranging and severe. In the September 17 all-employee call where he announced the hiring freeze, Forest Service Chief Randy Moore said “We just can’t get the same work done with fewer employees.” Though the Forest Service has been shedding jobs for decades—about 8,000 jobs in the last 20 years, Moore said—this will be the largest single-year staff cut in recent memory.</p>
<p>Seasonal employees perform vital fieldwork and research that extends beyond what many Americans consider the jurisdiction of the Forest Service. Rangers patrol whitewater rivers, rock climbing crags, and dangerous alpine summits. Biologists staff critical salmon fisheries. <a data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.backpacker.com/news-and-events/news/appalachian-trail-hurricane-helene-damage/">Recreation crews maintain forest roads</a> and clean camp latrines. Employees of all types chip in as emergency firefighters when required. According to the American Avalanche Association, the staff cuts could leave some avalanche centers, which rely on the Forest Service for funding, understaffed this winter.</p>
<p>And then there are trails. According to the Government Accountability Office, the Forest Service has had a maintenance backlog for more than a decade, and oversees more miles of trail than it can maintain. Cutting the majority of its field-going trail staff will only make the issue worse.</p>
<p>“This policy will result in a burgeoning of the <a data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.backpacker.com/stories/shortage-trail-builders-these-programs-can-help/">trail maintenance backlog</a>, both through lack of Forest Service staff attention to trail maintenance, but also through the loss of connection and relationships with partner organizations,” Mike Passo, the executive director of American Trails, a non-profit Forest Service partner, said in an email.</p>
<p><i>Backpacker </i>spoke to <a data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.backpacker.com/skills/the-12-best-jobs-in-the-outdoors/">nearly a dozen permanent and seasonal Forest Service employees</a>, most on condition of anonymity, about their experiences with the staffing cuts. Several expressed concern that trail crews would simply be unable to operate. They described crews of six seasonal employees disappearing, leaving one or two permanent crew leaders left trying to make things work. One intern in the National Pathways program, designed to automatically place successful interns into a full-time position with the agency, said she’s been told her job offer will likely be revoked. Other trail workers at conservation corps and non-profits who saw Forest Service positions as a step up the career ladder are rethinking their priorities.</p>
<p>Danica Mooney-Jones, a trail crew leader who’s been with the Forest Service since 2021, is among those out of a job next year. Where she works, the trail crew staff will go from five to two, and the broader recreation program is being cut from 13 employees to just four.</p>

<p>“I moved across the country to work here, for a seasonal job,” she says. “We have people who have worked here for 10 years as seasonals, and made a career out of these positions. They trusted that the jobs wouldn’t go away.”</p>
<p>Now, she and her former co-workers have a tough choice to make: leave their communities to find a job in trails somewhere else, or stay put and find a new career. Mooney Jones considers herself lucky; armed with <a data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.backpacker.com/skills/outdoor-first-aid/these-wilderness-medicine-myths-need-to-disappear/">wilderness EMT training</a>, she found a local winter job as a ski patroller. Still, the idea of leaving the Forest Service behind for good is sobering.</p>
<p>“I’d be really sad if this was the end of my trail career,” says Mooney-Jones. “I really love doing the work, I love seeing the product, and I’m very proud of the work that we do.”</p>
<p>Trail maintenance is important every season, but 2025 may prove an especially difficult year to cut down on the workers who make it happen. After Hurricane Helene, southern portions of the Appalachian Trail are closed due to blowdowns, landslides, and washed out bridges. According to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, there are more than 2,000 trees to clear from the AT in Tennessee alone, and many Forest Service access roads from Georgia to Virginia are closed due to erosion and rockfall.</p>
<p>That’s just on the AT—a popular long-distance trail supported by a non-profit organization and hundreds of trained volunteers. Elsewhere in the southern US, lesser-known trails face similar conditions but rely solely on Forest Service staff in order to re-open.</p>
<p>The cuts also left employees and partners wondering how the budget shortfall became so dire after several promising years of funding increases.</p>
<p>In 2021, the Biden administration mandated a $15 per hour minimum wage for all federal employees, which raised wages for some entry-level Forest Service jobs. Over the past several years, the agency also converted about 1,300 seasonal non-fire positions into permanent jobs. <a data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.backpacker.com/stories/issues/environment/on-the-front-lines-with-the-wildland-firefighters-protecting-the-west/">Wildland firefighters</a>, who now make up about half of the Forest Service’s workforce, received bonuses of up to $20,000 per year, which were temporarily funded through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act. Several Forest Service employees said there was hope that pay raises for firefighters would eventually translate into raises for other field-going employees, as well.</p>
<p>But those short-term gains have all but disappeared, replaced by a sudden budget shortfall.</p>
<p>In March, the Forest Service requested $8.9 billion in funding, a $500 million jump from 2024’s $8.37 billion. By the summer, it was clear the agency was unlikely to receive it. In August, Forest Service Chief Randy Moore released a statement preparing the USFS for a reduced budget. With little evidence that Congress would pass a bill funding the government by the end of the year, Moore said in the September 17 all-employee call that “[the Forest Service] has an obligation to plan for the most conservative funding possibility.” A week later, Congress passed a continuing resolution that extended the 2024 funding levels through December 20.</p>
<p>The lowest number Moore referred to comes from the proposal from the House Interior Appropriations Committee, which sets spending limits for all federal land management agencies, including the Forest Service and National Park Service. This year’s proposal includes $8.43 billion for the Forest Service—technically a modest increase compared to 2024. But last year’s budget was boosted by an additional $945 million through pandemic-era stimulus bills, a funding source that has since dried up. And while the House proposal fully funds the firefighter pay raises, the proposed budget would still necessitate cuts elsewhere at the agency. All of these details muddy the financial picture, but compared to total funding in 2024, the agency could face a budget hole of nearly a billion dollars next year.</p>
<p>Because the Forest Service’s budget for next year is still not finalized, there is a chance the agency will fill some seasonal positions in the near future. “We are working closely with individual partners to explore creative solutions to fill gaps where we can. And we hope to have more hiring options in the coming year if additional funding becomes available,” Scott Owen, national press officer for the Forest Service, wrote in an email.</p>
<p>Even with these sobering financial details, it’s clear that the agency’s decision to balance the books by cutting seasonal jobs came as a shock to many employees.</p>
<p>“My trust has definitely taken a hit,” says Mooney-Jones. “I’d consider coming back to the Forest Service, but I’m not sure I could. It’s a balancing act between how I feel about how we’ve been treated and how much I love the forest.”</p>

This means that anyone with the financial resources to purchase Pegasus spyware can access the capabilities of intelligence services and hack into the very private information of political opponents, judges, journalists, critical employees, competitors, and others.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Another striking example is that of offensive cyber capabilities. In the name of defending their clients or their networks, companies are attacking hackers across borders, using “offense as defense.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>And notice that I’m talking not only about big tech companies</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span>but also small ones, because there’s de facto power that comes from the development of digital technologies. Companies like NSO, or Clearview with its facial recognition software, or companies producing election technologies – these are not so-called Big Tech, but they are just as illustrative of some of the challenges that I’m pointing to, [such] as Elon Musk deciding who in Ukraine should and should not have access to Starlink internet connections.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>So, we see that these capabilities, these decisions, and these powers that used to be the exclusive domain of the state are now seeping into the hands of private companies, but without the checks and balances that we want in societies that function by the rule of law.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What can be done to put democratic entities back in charge?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><span>First of all, there needs to be more awareness and understanding of the ways in which companies exert power over governance, democracy, and international law. And then we need to bring the same level of legal clarity, accountability mechanisms, and transparency measures to the digital realm that we expect around other innovations such as medicines, chemicals, foods, cars, or even processes such as the decision to engage in foreign conflict.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Let’s compare how the U.S. responded to the Ukraine war in the physical world versus in the cyber domain. As part of NATO, the U.S. is clear: It doesn’t want to see boots on the ground. But in the cyber domain, the U.S.’s offensive activities are ongoing. That political discrepancy can continue because of the legal gray zone in the digital realm.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>So, I’m saying that the legal frameworks that we rely on in other industries – as well as the approaches we take to the physical side of foreign conflict – need to be on par in the digital realm and need to keep pace with where the technology has gone. It’s basically about catching up through international law, regulations, and enforcement, to make sure that the ideas that we have about what a democratic mandate looks like, what accountability looks like, and what oversight looks like are actually meaningful whenever activities happen in the digital sphere.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>To</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>some extent, you’re calling for implementing traditional types of laws and regulations in the digital realm, but is there also a way in which you’re calling for something new – a reinvention of democratic governments to handle the challenges of digitization?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Yes,</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span>there are a number of novel large- and small-scale changes I would recommend. For example, just as legislatures rely on independent legal teams to help draft legislation that will survive court challenges, they also need independent technology experts they can turn to for reliable information. Making tech expertise available to lawmakers would go a long way toward reducing lobbyists’ effectiveness and ensuring lawmakers understand how technology impacts issues like healthcare, education, justice, housing, and transportation. Because tech touches everything, lawmakers can’t get a handle on it by sitting in a single committee. They need to consult independent experts.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Another example: Governments are increasingly outsourcing all kinds of processes to tech companies. And if a tech company operates in the name of a government, it should be as accountable as the government. I call this “the public accountability extension.” It sounds simple, but it would be a huge game changer. Right now, as governments outsource more and more critical governmental functions to tech companies, they also offload governmental accountability.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>For example, in many jurisdictions, the police are not allowed to hack into the devices of suspects. Instead, they engage a hacking company that will do it for them. The police can then say they don’t hack, but they actually gain access by alternate means. Similarly, state and local governments in the United States aren’t constitutionally allowed to discriminate between citizens on the basis of sensitive categories, but oftentimes the technology they use does exactly that without being held accountable. A third example: Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. Journalists have the right to know what the government does in citizens’ name, but sometimes governments hire private companies to do government work or to collect and store government information, and if the companies don’t keep the information at the standard required of public entities, or if the companies are reluctant to provide information due to proprietary concerns, then the effectiveness of FOIA erodes.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>So, there are many examples of how governments essentially hide behind companies, including tech companies, to avoid accountability, and the accountability extension would address that.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>In your book, you point out another tension: tech companies’ energy use in the communities they enter. You note that the public needs greater insight to provide greater oversight over the data centers underlying our digital lives. What do you mean?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><span>There are no standards or reporting obligations requiring companies to say how much energy or water they’re using or plan to use. We have estimates from individual cases, but we don’t know the sum of data centers’ energy use.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>And often, big tech companies seeking to build data centers in a community will bid for those projects under a pseudonym – a company name that hides the fact that Amazon, Google, or Microsoft is behind the bid. The lawyers and consultants that tech companies hire to make these bids often paint a rosy picture of all the economic benefits that will accrue to communities that allow data centers to be built. They do their best to hide critical information about who they are and the data centers’ energy needs. And this complete lack of transparency regarding the use of scarce resources hinders transparent and good governance.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>We had some cases in the Netherlands where this was a big problem. Part-time city councilors had to make decisions about whether or not to allow a hyperscale data center in their territories. And they were up against billion-dollar companies and all their lawyers, accountants, consultants, and PR firms. The power asymmetry was enormous, and I think by standardizing the transparency and reporting requirements – including who is behind the projects and the metrics of energy use – this could become a much more fair public debate about the types of data centers a community can feasibly host.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>This increased transparency doesn’t begin to address whether society even wants more of these data centers using up scarce energy resources in an era of climate change. But we can’t answer that cost-benefit question if we don’t know what the cost is and all we’re told is benefit, benefit, benefit in some shady presentation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>And of course, the other real issue, especially in the U.S., is the capability of the power grids. In the Netherlands, which is an advanced economy, as in the U.S. and the U.K., we’ve already seen reports that the grids are functioning at near-emergency levels: code red. The grids are stretched to their limits. They break down and outages are more frequent. And yet there are many data centers in the pipeline that were agreed to years ago. When they come online in two or three years, we may face a wave of disaster.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Can you talk about the precautionary principle that’s already part of EU law and how it might help rein in tech company power, especially AI?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Basically, the precautionary principle requires a pause to assess the societal impact of an innovation when it is new and before it is widely deployed or implemented. It’s enshrined in EU law but hasn’t been invoked by the authorities for tech innovations like AI because there’s such a push to use AI and also because the EU has now passed a separate law that deals with AI.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>But I think the precautionary principle is a useful concept to address situations where tech company engineers are themselves surprised by the behavior of AI models, or where society and lawmakers and citizens don’t know or understand how a particular innovation will impact their lives. So we’d like to create processes that actually serve the public by using the precautionary principle to assess and research before unintended but still preventable problems spread too widely.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Have Americans been slow to understand the threat that tech companies pose to democracy?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Around the globe, there have been signs of the harms of tech companies’ power grab for a long time now, but Americans have tended to view them as distant events. People in Myanmar used Facebook to call for genocide in 2017. In 2018, we learned that Cambridge Analytica extracted and analyzed millions of Facebook users’ data and allowed political campaigns to use it for psychological profiling in ways that may have impacted the Brexit vote in the U.K. And then in 2020, there was the storming of the U.S. Capitol, which was in part fed by disinformation on social media that has led to tens of millions of Americans losing trust in the electoral process. So, some of the problems that people were facing elsewhere have come back to Americans quite late as a boomerang.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>You invite all of us as democratic citizens to help shape an agenda that puts the survival of democratic principles ahead of short-term economic benefits. What would that look like for an ordinary citizen?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><span>There are a lot of choices that consumers can make about how they want to use technology and services, but I don’t think that’s enough because there’s a huge asymmetry between the power of the individual internet or device user and the tech companies.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>If people understand that the companies that offer all these entertaining, efficient, helpful digital tools are also engaged in power dynamics that affect capital and national and global politics, then they will also understand the need for independent oversight and countervailing powers, just as we have in almost every other aspect of our society.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>And so I hope that people will bring their concerns to the political agenda and ask more from their leaders, especially in the U.S. I think a lot of people in the United States would like to see federal data protection law; protections for kids online; better cybersecurity; and an effective means of addressing disinformation about healthcare and elections, but there is no political majority in Congress to make these things happen. And the sad result is that people get defeatist and think it’s easier to just not raise these issues.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>But it’s important for people to keep raising their concerns. And doing so at the state level is an interesting option because many states are now taking steps to pass laws and regulations around technology, given that the federal government can’t or won’t.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691241173/the-tech-coup?srsltid=AfmBOorex6WwTNLG37fSSqw6a9FpDMtflkYNCSoO8sR3KfjYrV0-3HiL"><em>The Tech Coup: How to Save Democracy from Silicon Valley</em></a><em> published in September from Princeton University Press.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Why Simone Giertz, the Queen of Useless Robots, Got Serious"><p>Simone Giertz came to fame in the 2010s by becoming the self-proclaimed “queen of shitty robots.” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3KEoMzNz8eYnwBC34RaKCQ" target="_blank">On YouTube</a> she demonstrated a hilarious series of self-built mechanized devices that worked perfectly for ridiculous applications, such as a headboard-mounted alarm clock with a rubber hand <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXLzfAHl4-k&amp;list=PLFONC7byEU96gsPcOaWCp3CQxtEdOvgH4&amp;index=5" target="_blank">to slap the user awake</a>. </p><p>But <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/simone-giertz" target="_blank">Giertz</a> has parlayed her Internet renown into <a href="https://yetch-shop.fourthwall.com/" target="_blank">Yetch</a>, a design company that makes commercial consumer products. (The company name comes from how Giertz’s Swedish name is properly pronounced.) Her first release, a daily <a href="https://yetch-shop.fourthwall.com/products/every-day-goal-calendar" target="_blank">habit-tracking calendar</a>, was picked up by prestigious outlets such as the <a href="https://store.moma.org/" target="_blank">Museum of Modern Art design store</a> in New York City. She has continued to make commercial products since, as well as one-off strange inventions for her online audience.  </p><p><strong>Where did the motivation for your useless robots come from?</strong></p><p><strong>Simone Giertz:</strong> I just thought that <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/darpa-robotics-challenge-robots-falling" target="_blank">robots that failed</a> were really funny. It was also a way for me to get out of creating from a place of performance anxiety and perfection. Because if you set out to do something that fails, that gives you a lot of creative freedom. </p><p><strong>You built up a big online following. A lot of people would be happy with that level of success. But you moved into inventing commercial products. Why?</strong></p><p><strong>Giertz: </strong>I like torturing myself, I guess! I’d been creating things for YouTube and for social media for a long time. I wanted to try something new and also find longevity in my career. I’m not super motivated to constantly try to get people to give me attention. That doesn’t feel like a very good value to strive for. So I was like, “Okay, what do I want to do for the rest of my career?” And developing products is something that I’ve always been really, really interested in. And yeah, it is tough, but I’m so happy to be doing it. I’m enjoying it thoroughly, as much as there’s a lot of face-palm moments. </p><p><img id="11444" data-rm-shortcode-id="b06fca5d370fd3feca45654908f84f06" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-graphical-illustration-of-a-calendar.jpg?id=53806043&amp;width=980" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-graphical-illustration-of-a-calendar.jpg?id=53806043&amp;width=980" width="2000" height="2000" alt="A graphical illustration of a calendar."><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Giertz’s every day goal calendar was picked up by the Museum of Modern Art’s design store. </small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Yetch </small></p><p><strong>What role does failure play in your invention process?</strong></p><p><strong>Giertz: </strong>I think it’s inevitable. Before, obviously, I wanted something that failed in the most unexpected or fun way possible. And now when I’m developing products, it’s still a part of it. You make so many different versions of something and each one fails because of something. But then, hopefully, what happens is that you get smaller and smaller failures. Product development feels like you’re going in circles, but you’re actually going in a spiral because the circles are taking you somewhere.  </p><p><strong>What advice do you have for aspiring inventors?</strong></p><p><strong>Giertz: </strong>Make things that <em><em>you</em></em> want. A lot of people make things that they think that other people want, but the main target audience, at least for myself, is me. I trust that if I find something interesting, there are probably other people who do too. And then just find good people to work with and collaborate with. There is no such thing as the lonely genius, I think. I’ve worked with a lot of different people and some people made me really nervous and anxious. And some people, it just went easy and we had a great time. You’re just like, “Oh, what if we do this? What if we do <em><em>this</em></em>?” Find those people.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!--[--><main id="primary"><!--[--><!----><!--[--><article><section><!----><!----><div><!--[--><div><p>Three decades ago, astronomers spotted one of the brightest exploding stars in more than 400 years. The titanic supernova, called Supernova 1987A (SN 1987A), blazed with the power of 100 million suns for several months following its discovery on Feb. 23, 1987.</p></div><div><p>Since that first sighting, SN 1987A has continued to fascinate astronomers with its spectacular light show. Located in the nearby Large Magellanic Cloud, it is the nearest supernova explosion observed in hundreds of years and the best opportunity yet for astronomers to study the phases before, during, and after the death of a star.</p></div><div><p>To commemorate the 30th anniversary of SN 1987A, new images, time-lapse movies, a data-based animation based on work led by Salvatore Orlando at INAF-Osservatorio Astronomico di Palermo, Italy, and a three-dimensional model are being released. By combining data from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and Chandra X-ray Observatory, as well as the international Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), astronomers — and the public — can explore SN 1987A like never before.</p></div><div><p>Hubble has repeatedly observed SN 1987A since 1990, accumulating hundreds of images, and Chandra began observing SN 1987A shortly after its deployment in 1999. ALMA, a powerful array of 66 antennas, has been gathering high-resolution millimeter and submillimeter data on SN 1987A since its inception.</p></div><div><p>"The 30 years' worth of observations of SN 1987A are important because they provide insight into the last stages of stellar evolution," said Robert Kirshner of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation in Palo Alto, California.</p></div><div><p>The latest data from these powerful telescopes indicate that SN 1987A has passed an important threshold. The supernova shock wave is moving beyond the dense ring of gas produced late in the life of the pre-supernova star when a fast outflow or wind from the star collided with a slower wind generated in an earlier red giant phase of the star's evolution. What lies beyond the ring is poorly known at present, and depends on the details of the evolution of the star when it was a red giant.</p></div><div><p>"The details of this transition will give astronomers a better understanding of the life of the doomed star, and how it ended," said Kari Frank of Penn State University who led the latest Chandra study of SN 1987A.</p></div><div><p>Supernovas such as SN 1987A can stir up the surrounding gas and trigger the formation of new stars and planets. The gas from which these stars and planets form will be enriched with elements such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and iron, which are the basic components of all known life. These elements are forged inside the pre-supernova star and during the supernova explosion itself, and then dispersed into their host galaxy by expanding supernova remnants. Continued studies of SN 1987A should give unique insight into the early stages of this dispersal.</p></div><div><p>Some highlights from studies involving these telescopes include:</p></div><div><p>Hubble studies have revealed that the dense ring of gas around the supernova is glowing in optical light, and has a diameter of about a light-year. The ring was there at least 20,000 years before the star exploded. A flash of ultraviolet light from the explosion energized the gas in the ring, making it glow for decades.</p></div><div><p>The central structure visible inside the ring in the Hubble image has now grown to roughly half a light-year across. Most noticeable are two blobs of debris in the center of the supernova remnant racing away from each other at roughly 20 million miles an hour.</p></div><div><p>From 1999 until 2013, Chandra data showed an expanding ring of X-ray emission that had been steadily getting brighter. The blast wave from the original explosion has been bursting through and heating the ring of gas surrounding the supernova, producing X-ray emission.</p></div><div><p>In the past few years, the ring has stopped getting brighter in X-rays. From about February 2013 until the last Chandra observation analyzed in September 2015 the total amount of low-energy X-rays has remained constant. Also, the bottom left part of the ring has started to fade. These changes provide evidence that the explosion's blast wave has moved beyond the ring into a region with less dense gas. This represents the end of an era for SN 1987A.</p></div><div><p>Beginning in 2012, astronomers used ALMA to observe the glowing remains of the supernova, studying how the remnant is actually forging vast amounts of new dust from the new elements created in the progenitor star. A portion of this dust will make its way into interstellar space and may become the building blocks of future stars and planets in another system.</p></div><div><p>These observations also suggest that dust in the early universe likely formed from similar supernova explosions.</p></div><div><p>Astronomers also are still looking for evidence of a black hole or a neutron star left behind by the blast. They observed a flash of neutrinos from the star just as it erupted. This detection makes astronomers quite certain a compact object formed as the center of the star collapsed — either a neutron star or a black hole — but no telescope has uncovered any evidence for one yet.</p></div><div><p>The Chandra program is managed by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, controls Chandra's science and flight operations.</p></div><div><p>The Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international cooperation between NASA and ESA (European Space Agency).

Perhaps one of the more surprising changes in the 6.12-rc4 development
kernel was <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/6e90b675cf94">the removal
of several entries</a> from the kernel's </p><tt>MAINTAINERS</tt><p> file.  The <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/2024101835-tiptop-blip-09ed@gregkh/">patch</a>
performing the removal was sent (by Greg Kroah-Hartman) only to the
patches@lists.linux.dev mailing list; the change was included in <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/ZxUH2J0BL3FCV6Hr@kroah.com/">a char-misc drivers
pull request</a> with no particular mention.
</p><p>
The explanation for the removal is simply "<q>various compliance
requirements</q>".  Given that the developers involved all appear to be of
Russian origin, it is not too hard to imagine what sort of compliance is
involved here.  There has, however, been no public posting of the policy
that required the removal of these entries.<br clear="all"></p><hr>

<p>This summer, I participated in a human challenge trial at the University of Maryland. I spent the days just prior to my 30th birthday sick with shigellosis.</p>



<h2>What? Why?</h2>



<p>Dysentery is an acute disease in which pathogens attack the intestine. It is most often caused by the bacteria <em>Shigella</em>. It spreads via the fecal-oral route. It requires an astonishingly low number of pathogens to make a person sick – so it spreads quickly, especially in bad hygienic conditions or anywhere water can get tainted with feces.</p>



<p>It kills about 70,000 people a year, 30,000 of whom are children under the age of 5. Almost all of these cases and deaths are among very poor people.</p>



<p>The primary mechanism by which dysentery kills people is dehydration. The person loses fluids to diarrhea and for whatever reason (lack of knowledge, energy, water, etc) cannot regain them sufficiently. Shigella bacteria are increasingly resistant to antibiotics. A disease easily treatable by lots of fluids and antibiotics is becoming more lethal.</p>



<p>Can someone do something?</p>



<h2>The deal with human challenge trials</h2>



<p>Clinical trials in general are expensive to run but pretty common; clinical trials <em>where you are given the disease </em>– “challenged”, AKA “human challenge trials” – are very rare. The regular way to investigate a possible treatment is to make a study plan, then find people who have the disease and offer to enroll them in the experimental treatment. Challenge trials are less common, but often more valuable for research – shigellosis is a fast-acting disease that is imminently treatable by antibiotics and uncommon in the US. It would be very difficult to test an alternative shigellosis treatment in the US in the conventional way, but it’s a great candidate for challenge trials.</p>



<p>I’d signed up for email alerts on upcoming challenge trials at the nearby University of Maryland, and got one about an upcoming study. It caught my eye that it was for a phage-based treatment. Bacteriophages are really promising antibacterial medicines, not to mention what I’d studied as an undergrad.</p>



<p>Here’s the thing: you really only get good medical research out of human subjects. Also, I could use $4000 and this seemed like a cool way to spend a couple weeks and help out medical research. So I signed up, got a check-in general health appointment, and shortly after, was told I was in. I made plans to spend my 30<sup>th</sup> birthday in a dysentery ward.</p>



<h2><strong>Dysentery: it’s a modern disease</strong></h2>



<p>Many of you reading this will know about dysentery from the 1971 simulation game The Oregon Trail (or its later versions). The actual Oregon Trail was a network of trails and the corresponding migration of mostly-white pioneers, moving on foot and on ox-drawn wagon from the eastern US to the western US between 1830 and 1869. About 400,000 people* crossed the Oregon Trail in this period, and a lot of them were on similar trails – a bunch of stressed and malnourished people, traveling in close quarters with their families, stopping and pooping near the same trails and creeks with no regard for water safety – diseases spread <em>very </em>fast in these conditions. From these and other stressors, about 65,000 people died in this 40-year period.</p>



<p>Stated another way, more people die from dysentery <em>now, every year </em>than <em>ever died from any cause</em> on the Oregon Trail. So let’s calm down about the Oregon Trail, okay?</p>



<p>*Lots of people use this 400,000 number but I can’t figure out where it came from and if this is referring to individuals or families – I’ve seen sources indicate it was either. If it was families, it was probably counting the men who were “the pioneers” and then being like “oh and there were women and kids there also, I guess.” But maybe it was individuals? Or maybe someone just made this up? Again, no idea where it came from. You gotta be careful every time anyone tells you a number. It’s so bad out there. The only thing worse than someone telling you a number is when they don’t tell you a number.</p>



<h2><strong>Getting ready</strong></h2>



<p>A week or so before I went, I’d been pointed to<a href="https://x.com/wokeglobaltimes/status/1510768591012085768"> Jake Eberts’s twitter thread</a>. Jake Eberts also participated in a challenge trial for a dysentery vaccine, also I think at UMD and the same Baltimore facility I was at, where he got very sick and<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/paigeskinner/man-twitter-dysentery-trial"> went viral</a> for livetweeting the experience. He started a fundraiser for dysentery relief and got a lot of people to sign up for clinical trials themselves, and now he works for<a href="https://www.1daysooner.org/"> 1DaySooner</a>, premier “hey, human challenge trials are cool” advocates.</p>



<p>I read his twitter thread and sent my friends this meme:</p>

<p>I brought <em>Infinite Jest</em>, which I was partway through and was a lot more through (but still not done) by the time I was discharged. (I’m writing this while traveling, and in a fit of poor timing I finally finished it on the plane ride in, which means I now have a giant brick of a book to carry around in my suitcase.) My friend Ozy said that <em>Infinite Jest</em> was a really good book for reading in a dysentery ward.</p>



<p>I thought, oh, that’s interesting, you know, a lot of the characters <em>are </em>pretty miserable and living in a controlling institution of some kind. Then I remembered this one passage, where circumstances have forced a character into withdrawing from heroin alone, holed up for days in a public bathroom:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Time began to pass with sharp edges. Its passage in the dark or dim-lit stall was like time being carried by a procession of ants, a gleaming red martial column of those militaristic red Southern-U.S. ants that build hideous tall boiling hills, and each vile gleaming ant wanted a minuscule little portion of Poor Tony’s flesh in compensation as it helped bear time slowly forward down the corridor of true Withdrawal. By the second week in the stall time itself seemed the corridor, lightless at either end. After more time time then ceased to move to be moved or be move-throughable and assumed a shape above and apart, a huge, must-feathered, orange-eyed wingless fowl hunched incontinent atop the stall, with a kind of watchful but deeply uncaring personality that didn’t seem keen on Poor Tony Krause as a person at all, or to wish him well. Not one little bit. It spoke to him from atop the stall, the same things, over and over. They were unrepeatable. Nothing in even Poor Tony’s grim life-experience prepared him for the experience of time with a shape and an odor, squatting; and the worsening physical symptoms were a spree at Bonwit’s compared to time’s black assurances that the symptoms were merely hints, signposts pointing up at a larger, far more dire set of Withdrawal phenomena that hung just overhead by a string that unraveled steadily with the passage of time. It would not keep still and would not end; it changed shape and smell.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I was forced to agree that <em>Infinite Jest </em>was indeed probably a pretty good choice.</p>



<h2><strong>Two days until challenge</strong></h2>



<p>Checking in, everyone’s bags were checked. I got the impression they really didn’t want some kind of bad outcome where they had to call cops into a ward where everyone was running around with the bloody flux, which, fair enough. They did take away my craft scissors. I didn’t end up knitting so it wasn’t a big deal but like I’m pretty sure I’ve taken those on airplanes before. Okay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We were assigned a number (I was just on this side of divinity at No. 107), given a plastic wristband, and shown to our rooms. We were also given two pairs of scrubs which were to be our main clothes on the ward – less risk of ruining hard-to-launder clothes in the more messy phases of the study – though it did mean 15 people having to coordinate laundry every day.</p>

<p>The ward was more of a retrofitted office building than a hospital. It consisted of some spaces for nurses and testing, about 6 bedrooms of various sizes (each with their own half-bath), two separate areas with two shower stalls each, a “kitchen” with snacks and where the meals were delivered to, a closet with washer and dryer, and a rec room with couches and a TV and a pool and foosball table.</p>



<p>There were about 16 people on the ward, an even mix of men and women. Most of them were Baltimore locals; many of them had done other trials before. We were fully allowed to socialize – dysentery is, again, infectious through the fecal-oral route, hand sanitizer was stationed all over the place but there wasn’t a huge concern that we’d infect each other or even the nurses.</p>



<p>Life on the ward is very chill. I was worried about being bored, but I’d forgotten that I spend most of my waking hours on the computer anyway, so it really wasn’t a problem. When even my iron gaze faltered and couldn’t stare at the computer anymore, I read Infinite Jest.</p>



<p>Meals were delivered once a day – one cold usually wrap- or sandwich-based meal, one hot breakfast, one hot supper dish, labelled with people’s numbers.</p>

<p>They were, like, fine. The caterers made a few interesting choices – for vegetarians such as myself, every sandwich/wrap was some veggies with hummus, and now and then there’d be like breakfast pancakes with a curry-flavored veggie hamburger patty. I would describe the flavor when drenched with table syrup as “weird.”</p>



<p>Like, you can <em>tell </em>the person planning that menu was like “okay, pancakes and bacon… And wait, crap, something with protein for the vegetarians.” But again, I’ve eaten worse for things I’ve actually paid for ingredients for, and I was definitely eating better in terms of variety and volume than I did at home. I’m not complaining.</p>



<h2>One day before challenge: the age of phage</h2>



<p>This study was sort of an over-time test – ideally the first of a few, where we’d get phages before (unless we were in the control group), during, and after the “challenge” (the shigella) to see if they had any effect at all – if it did, later studies could determine if you could just drink the phage after getting sick, or if it would work best as a prophylactic, or etc. We drank a chalky buffer solution to neutralize stomach acid and give the bacteriophages (and later, the bacteria) a better chance at making it to the intestine.</p>



<p>What do the solutions taste like? Basically all salty fluid with slight mineral nuance, from the buffer. Phages are known to be pretty tasteless so I didn’t expect anything else.</p>



<h2>Bacteriophage therapy: sending a cat after mice</h2>



<p>A bacteriophage is a virus that infects bacteria. They were discovered shortly after bacteria themselves were really pinned down – microscopes were finally powerful enough to make out bacteria, and visionaries like Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur were pinpointing that these little nothing-pinpricks were in fact the source of diseases. (For more on the discovery of the microbial world, see<a href="https://asteriskmag.com/issues/07/through-the-looking-glass"> “Through the Looking Glass and what Zheludev Et Al. (2024) Found There”</a>, my recent piece in Asterisk Magazine.)</p>



<p>In 1917, Félix d’Hérelle found an agent that killed cholera bacteria, which passed through a fine filter, and which could reproduce – a living agent that killed bacteria, but that was itself smaller than a bacteria.</p>



<p>d’Hérelle realized right away this substance which killed bacteria, and which people had apparently been drinking, had potential as medicine. He bred pathogenic bacteria in vats and added solutions, and waited until the cloudy brother of bacteria turned clear – then offered this liquid to sick patients. Many of them, sure enough, recovered. I was (unless I was in the control group) walking in historical footsteps. Dysentery was the first human disease ever treated with phage medicine.</p>



<p>Sending a phage after bacteria is like sending a cat after mice. Phages are small, targeted, well-adapted hunters of specific bacteria. There is no way for them to infect a human cell like a human virus would – they are completely specialized. Phages are already in the body, along with their bacterial hosts – so you’re not introducing a radically new agent – and the immune system tends to play well with them.</p>



<p>Phage are used widely in some parts of the world – the Republic of Georgia and Poland both sell phage over-the-counter, for use in say intestinal conditions or wounds, and have<a href="https://www.phagetherapycenter.com/"> clinics for personalized treatment</a>. In the US, phage therapy is an extremely rare specialty, sometimes even falling under the umbrella of naturopathy. (A phage being a natural bioactive product.)</p>



<p>Why would you use antibiotics instead of phages, or vice versa?</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Phages</td><td>Antibiotics</td></tr><tr><td>Targeted – a phage attacks one species or one strain of bacteria <br>Easy to find usable new ones <br>More finnicky (e.g. less stable) <br>Predator-prey pharmacokinetics <p>Mostly spread where the bacteria are<br>Very few side effects</p></td><td>Broad-spectrum<p>Hard to find usable new ones <br>Shelf stable <br>Regular blood-elimination-curve pharmacokinetics <br>Systemic; enter the bloodstream <br>Sometimes-serious side effects</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>What if the bacteria become resistant to the phages too?</p>



<p>Well, that can happen easily – probably even easier than with antibiotics. Cells have been duking it out with viruses since the beginning of life. (Did you know CRISPR-Cas9, now used for gene editing, evolved in nature as a way for bacteria to recognize and cut up phage DNA?)</p>



<p>But the difference is that whereas new antibiotics are very hard to find, there is a nigh-inexhaustible evolutionary font of phages constantly pulling ahead in the arms race. So in short: once a bacteria becomes resistant to your special phage, just find a new phage.</p>



<h2><strong>Do they work?</strong></h2>



<p>To my knowledge, there aren’t any really gold-standard reviews comparing phages head-on to antibiotics. They are fiddlier than antibiotics, with a specialized body of knowledge for treatment – less stable, have to be introduced to the site directly, much more care in choosing an appropriate treatment.</p>



<p>One small study found a phage treatment comparably effective to antibiotics for <em>Salmonella typhimirium </em>in 36 lab mice.<sup data-fn="93b3a86a-3d76-4aee-b928-9cafbaf0f6a0"><a href="#93b3a86a-3d76-4aee-b928-9cafbaf0f6a0" id="93b3a86a-3d76-4aee-b928-9cafbaf0f6a0-link">1</a></sup> Another meta-study compared modern antibiotic studies to 17 studies from the last time human phage research was in vogue in the US, the 1920s-40s, and found that phages were effective treatments – but 4 modern clinical trials suggested phages were not effective.<sup data-fn="0bdd1add-8828-4f5d-837b-5b564c4baf50"><a href="#0bdd1add-8828-4f5d-837b-5b564c4baf50" id="0bdd1add-8828-4f5d-837b-5b564c4baf50-link">2</a></sup> A more recent study of personalized phage therapy showed promising results in infections considered “difficult-to-treat”.<sup data-fn="e69bd4e0-b087-4432-8149-23a8866b6099"><a href="#e69bd4e0-b087-4432-8149-23a8866b6099" id="e69bd4e0-b087-4432-8149-23a8866b6099-link">3</a></sup> They seem to work best when used <em>with </em>antibiotics.</p>



<p>I’m not doing a full lit review right now. I bet that phage therapy still has promise – more careful formulations and just more research will help. That’s before challenges of commercial rollout, including things like handling FDA approval for a product that must be reformulated regularly.</p>



<p>The elephant in the room is antibiotic resistance – antibiotics usually work extremely well, but increasingly, bacteria can survive them. Antibiotic resistance is, unlike other diseases you might think of that are exacerbated by over-medication, <em>not </em>a condition of privileged countries – lots of <em>Shigella </em>bacteria in developing countries are increasingly antibiotic-resistant.</p>



<p>Even if phages don’t work as well as the magic silver bullet that is antibiotics, they might work well enough to be worth incorporating into our medical toolbox as part of AMR management. And that means developing them now.</p>



<p>The other challenge is of course regulatory – I’m excited that <a href="https://www.intralytix.com/">Intralytix</a>, who made the experimental product I did-or-didn’t take, is throwing their hat into the space of human phage medicine, and to see how they handle this.</p>



<h2><strong>Day 1 of challenge</strong></h2>



<p>On the third day in the ward after a day of baseline and a day of phage (unless we were in the control group), we took another dose of phage (unless we were in the control group), waited a couple of hours, and then drank a glass of shigella. This tasted like baking soda and salt with no particular nuance, nor would I expect nuance; the dose was some 1300 organisms – as in 1300 individual cells of bacteria, count ‘em. A preposterously scant microbial innoculum, even for devoted parasites it often takes on the order of millions of organisms to lodge an infection – but shigella is remarkably tenacious. It would only have taken 10-200. This was overkill – a dose that WILL make you sick, unless you’re protected. All the participants drank.</p>



<h2>The waiting game</h2>



<p>Shigella has a 24-72 hour incubation period, maybe 12-96 hours on the far ends.</p>



<p>Perhaps owing to quirks of my own psyche, whose origins I’m sure we don’t need to explore here, I find it reassuring to have reference experiences to conveniently benchmark the rest of my life by. If you go skiing, you can ask yourself later, “is this more or less exhilarating than skiing?” If you fall in love once, you can compare future loves to that earlier experience.</p>



<p>A good standard reference point for “shared, resigned dread” is the 72 or so hours in a clinical trial ward after everyone has ingested shigella bacteria along with maybe-a-treatment.</p>



<p>The vibes were ominous. Jovially nervous. Unprecedented gastrointestinal distress may or may not have been coming for me, but if it is, it would be arriving in (on average) 48 hours.</p>



<p>The floor was pretty quiet. The hours ticked by.</p>



<p>Infinite Jest is, by the way, a great book. David Foster Wallace knew how to write a goddamn sentence on purpose.</p>



<h2><strong>Let’s learn about </strong><strong><em>Shigella </em></strong><strong>pathogenesis</strong></h2>



<p>While I waited, I decided to read up. Shigella bacteria invades the body via the digestive canal, and infects the intestines – both small and large. It releases a toxin that facilitates its infection of other parts of the intestine and its eventual replication. It’s an intracellular pathogen – some bacteria, like all viruses, actually enter the host’s cell and replicate inside there.</p>



<p>Shigella actually prefers to invade the <em>outside </em>(or should I say the inside?) of intestinal cells. But the body is a locked-down system with its own guard force, the immune system, keeping the dirty external environment separate from the sterile inside environment. Shigella in the digestive tract really wants to poke through that line of intestinal cells and get at them from the other side.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241005215039/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigella_flexneri">Wikipedia explains:</a></p>



<blockquote>
<p>Once inside of the colon, <em>S. flexneri</em> can penetrate the epithelium in three ways: <br>1) The bacterium can alter the tight junctions between the epithelial cells, allowing it to cross into the sub-mucosa. <br>2) It can penetrate the highly endocytic<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241005215039/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfold_cell"> M cells</a> that are dispersed in the epithelial layer and cross into the sub-mucosa. <br>3) After reaching the sub-mucosa, the bacteria can be phagocytosed by macrophages and induce apoptosis, cell death. This releases<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241005215039/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"> cytokines</a> that recruit<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241005215039/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil"> polymorphonuclear cells (PMN)</a> to the sub-mucosa. <em>S. flexneri</em> still in the lumen of the colon traverse the epithelial lining as the PMNs cross into the infected area. The influx of PMN cells across the epithelial layer in response to Shigella disrupts the integrity of the epithelium allowing lumenal bacteria to cross into the sub-mucosa in an M-cell independent mechanism.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is really funny. Okay, imagine there’s a blockade of tightly parked police cars facing you and you and your buddies need to go get to their trunks so you can hide in them. Here are 3 ways to do this:</p>



<ol>
<li>Push the police cars to the side so you can walk between them</li>



<li>Look for the police cars with the biggest doors, so that you can squeeze through the car and leave through their trunk (or I guess probably just stay in the trunk at that point)</li>



<li>Get yourself and your buddies arrested, then when they send backup police vans to push through the police to arrest all of you, run through the cracks in the blockade that those vans open up. Then go to the trunks of the original cop cars.</li>
</ol>



<p>And then once you’re inside the car, you can open the doors between the cop cars (they’re sliding doors) and then travel laterally between the cop cars. I love cells.</p>



<hr>



<p>As a fun side note, <em>Shigella –</em> including the strain I was developing an intimate relationship with,<em> Shigella flexneri – </em>is, taxonomically speaking, a kind of <em>Escherichia coli.</em> Now you may notice from the scientific nomenclature that this is not how this is supposed to work.</p>



<p>When genotyping was developed and applied to some familiar standby kinds of bacteria that microbiology-as-science figured it understood pretty well, researchers learned two surprising new things:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>E. coli</em> is not a coherent species. Different strains of <em>E. coli</em> – known to have slightly different properties, but thought to be all slight variations on the same basic species – turned out to have only <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2974192/">20% of their genes</a> in common. (Humans and our closest relatives, chimpanzees, have almost all of our genes in common* and still aren’t considered as the same <em>genus</em>.)</li>



<li><em>Shigella </em>is in that umbrella of shared genes – a secret family member known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxon_in_disguise">taxon in disguise</a>. It’s more similar to many <em>E. colis </em>than some <em>E. coli</em>s.</li>
</ul>



<p>For most species, the procedure at this point would be to throw in the towel and reclassify – <em>Escherichia coli spp. shigella</em>, perhaps. But in this case, shigatoxin-producing <em>Shigella </em>and other pathogenic <em>Escherichia coli </em>have different enough clinical presentations that the distinction is still medically valuable, so accurate nomenclature has bowed its head to practicality. Cool! (Compare and contrast with <a href="https://eukaryotewritesblog.com/2021/05/02/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-tree/">trees</a>.)</p>



<p>*Wait, don’t people talk about 99% or something? That number is actually about <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/news/comparison-human-and-chimpanzee-genomes-reveals-striking-similarities-and-differences"><em>sequence similarity</em></a><em> </em>and not related genes – if we have 96% sequence similarity, meaning the exact same genetic code, probably even more of that genome is still <em>in related genes. </em>Genes can code for clearly related proteins/sequences and still not be identical, like they came from a common ancestor and haven’t diverged much but have picked up a few changes along the way. Different<em> E. coli</em> have 80% completely different genes – a human has maaaybe 50 genes that a chimp doesn’t? I didn’t try very hard to find the actual similar metric between them. It’s what I was telling you about numbers. You gotta watch out.</p>



<h2><strong>Let’s really learn about Shigella pathogenesis</strong></h2>



<p>Some 24 hours in, the first people started going down. Via word of mouth I heard the phrase “Exorcist-style projectile vomiting” used to describe someone in the next room over, a description whose accuracy I fortunately cannot verify. Most people were in their rooms all day anyhow, but the crowd in the kitchen at mealtimes or showing up for morning dosing got thinner.</p>



<p>I really held out. Going to bed at end of the second night, I felt okay, but couldn’t sleep well – nerves, I thought, or the faint distorted unpleasant bodily noises from other parts of the ward. I maybe managed a couple hours of sleep by the wee hours.</p>



<p>48 hours in, I woke up for vitals and dosing at 6 AM and started feeling really faint on the short walk to the next room. I stumbled over to the toilet. Off to the races!</p>



<p>I should be clear in this section that I was in as close to zero long-term danger as you can get with dysentery, which is damn close – this was in a controlled setting with doctors and nurses, monitoring my condition regularly, with a known pathogen with a known cure. In this case, we weren’t expected to languish in indefinite misery – they wanted to see if we got sick and then how sick we got, yes, but only up to a point, at which point they would “call it” – administer regular antibiotics and end our experimental treatment.</p>



<p>All I had to do was let the time pass.</p>



<p>The next few hours were very bad. Surprisingly, the gastrointestinal symptoms were not much of a problem for me – I had them, but it wasn’t much worse than those of regular food poisoning. I didn’t throw up. I just wanted to go back to sleep.</p>



<p>But sleep wasn’t coming.</p>



<p>First was the plague of chills. The institutional cotton blankets did nothing; four of them also did nothing, as if there was no heat to hold in. Freezing, tooth-clattering cold.</p>



<p>Within an hour came the plague of joint pain. It sank in rather quickly and was all in the lower extremities – hips, legs. Any more than one blanket became too heavy to bear having on them, so off they go, freezing cold but they weren’t palpably doing anything anyway. Right? I remembered reading people with chronic pain reporting that sometimes laying down was worse than other positions, and sure enough sitting up was – somehow – mildly better. I situated the adjustable bedside table so that I could slump onto it and maybe even sleep like that, but sleep remained out of reach.</p>



<p>Time wasn’t shitting so much as dragging, by the bones, over rough pavement, every second another six inches, grating, relentless, second after second after second. Time is space in which you are moved forward one way or another. Pain is an active process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Around three hours later, the doctor came in and judged that I was done – they were calling it – symptomatically I had reached the Clinical Endpoint and would be treated. I was handed tylenol and antibiotics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’d always thought of tylenol as sort of a second-rate painkiller, probably worth trying if you couldn’t find ibuprofen, but damn if that tylenol didn’t work pretty quickly. As soon as I could I went to sleep for like four hours – which, as usual, if you are in a position of needing four hours of sleep, makes a lot of things better and more manageable once you can swing it.</p>



<h2><strong>Out the other side</strong></h2>



<p>The antibiotics worked <em>really</em> quickly. Within hours, the fever had vanished and the aches had dwindled to twinges. Within a couple days, even the gastrointestinal situation was back to normal. Other people were harder hit, other people were just starting to get sick – staying vanished in their rooms even after I stuck my head into the kitchen and rec rooms like the first hopeful groundhog of spring – and many had been fine the whole time.</p>



<p>The thing that kills people in dysentery is dehydration and complications thereof. So part of the recovery is collecting and measuring how many fluids were emitted, and then re-administering oral rehydration fluid – a salty liquid served ice-cold – in precise ratios to replace the bodily fluids lost. A human is a series of tubes with attached nervous system and fortunately I was in the company of master plumbers. Once the diarrhea had stopped, I was also able to stop guzzling big plastic cups of what I liked to imagine tasted like arctic seawater. Progress!</p>

<p>People who recovered and who never got sick started hanging out in the rec room more, chatting and playing pool. I spent my birthday calling my parents and talking to internet friends. One streamed himself playing a fish-themed video game in my honor. The Baltimoreans inexplicably set off fireworks many nights – maybe the proximity to July 4<sup>th</sup>? – and this was one of them. Not roadside-stand-ground fireworks, but big aerial fireworks. A fellow subject found ice cream bars in the kitchen freezer and kindly brought me one as a present. Fireworks aside, it was a quiet day.</p>



<p>Apologies for the deception, reader. Technically speaking, the word “dysentery” usually refers to a syndrome, like “psychosis” or “high blood pressure”, which can have multiple causes but which is defined by specific symptoms. The specific symptom of dysentery is bloody diarrhea. I personally did not get this particular symptom – I became sick with <em>shigellosis </em>but, according to a common criteria, did not get <em>dysentery</em>. I’m sorry for clickbaiting you. In my defense, I would have taken it over the joint pain.</p>



<h2><strong>Aftermath</strong></h2>



<p>Twice a day after antibiotics, we gave the nurses a stool sample – these were sampled and cultured at some lab to determine if shigella was still in there. Two negative samples in a row meant that we were free to go.</p>



<p>9 days after coming in, I was cleared for release. I collected my scissors, and, free of dysentery, was released onto the streets of Baltimore. A year older on paper. Healthy, wrung out, ready for time to keep doing what it does. Hopefully, mostly on kinder terms.</p>

I see that 75% of these photos have coffee in them. What can I say? I’m from Seattle.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>I think that despite my relatively mild case, that I was in the control group. But the reason I think that was because in the whole trial, everyone drank the shigella, it sure seemed like about half of them didn’t get sick.</p>
