            <span>Abstract:</span>  For the first time in the world, we succeeded in synthesizing the
room-temperature superconductor ($T_c \ge 400$ K, 127$^\circ$C) working at
ambient pressure with a modified lead-apatite (LK-99) structure. The
superconductivity of LK-99 is proved with the Critical temperature ($T_c$),
Zero-resistivity, Critical current ($I_c$), Critical magnetic field ($H_c$),
and the Meissner effect. The superconductivity of LK-99 originates from minute
structural distortion by a slight volume shrinkage (0.48 %), not by external
factors such as temperature and pressure. The shrinkage is caused by Cu$^{2+}$
substitution of Pb$^{2+}$(2) ions in the insulating network of Pb(2)-phosphate
and it generates the stress. It concurrently transfers to Pb(1) of the
cylindrical column resulting in distortion of the cylindrical column interface,
which creates superconducting quantum wells (SQWs) in the interface. The heat
capacity results indicated that the new model is suitable for explaining the
superconductivity of LK-99. The unique structure of LK-99 that allows the
minute distorted structure to be maintained in the interfaces is the most
important factor that LK-99 maintains and exhibits superconductivity at room
temperatures and ambient pressure.

				<p>Dear Timmy,</p>
<p>As I shared at our last family meeting, current economic conditions have forced family leadership to make many difficult decisions. I myself have reduced my golf outings to every other week, and you, undoubtedly, noticed that your mother’s car is no longer the current model year. Unfortunately, even these deep cuts, painful as they are, have not been enough. After much deliberation, we feel the best course of action is to eliminate the redundancies in our family. Consequently, your family membership has been terminated, effective immediately.</p>
<p>I know this may come as a shock. But, while your mother and I have enjoyed seeing you grow these last six years, the family must remain focused on our strategic initiatives if we are to remain competitive against the Joneses. We have weathered storms in the past; I am confident that we will make it through this one.</p>
<p>To help you through this transition, we are pleased to offer you a severance package with 80% of your allowance for the next three months. We will also extend the option of purchasing the family health insurance for the rest of the calendar year. Enclosed with this letter is a list of adoption agencies to help you in your search for a new family.</p>
<p>I ask that you refrain from discussing your termination with any social contacts made through your membership in the family. You are also reminded not to damage or steal any family property on your way out of the house (this includes, but is not limited to, games, toys, and electronics). Failure to comply may result in your severance being terminated early or withheld entirely.</p>
<p>On a personal note, your mother and I want you to know how wonderful we feel to have been able to give you life.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Robert and Sue Smith</p>
<p>P.S. Your (former) sister will be contacting you to schedule an exit interview. Please be open and honest. Your feedback is the best way for us to improve!</p>

However, a trend in the EWSs within a limited period of observation could be a random fluctuation within steady-state statistics. Thus, for a robust assessment of the shutdown, it is necessary to establish a statistical confidence level for the change above the natural fluctuations. This is not easily done given only one, the observed realization of the approach to the transition. Here we establish such a measure of the confidence for the variance and autocorrelation and demonstrate that variance is the more reliable of the two. A further contribution is an estimator of not only whether a transition is approaching but also the time when the critical transition is expected to occur. The strategy is to infer the evolution of the AMOC solely on observed changes in mean, variance and autocorrelation. The typical choice of control parameter is the flux of freshwater into the North Atlantic. River runoff, Greenland ice melt and export from the Arctic Ocean are not well constrained<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 28" title="Yang, Q. et al.

All we assume here is that the AMOC is in an equilibrium state prior to a change toward the transition. The simplest uninformed assumption is that the change is sufficiently slow and that the control parameter approaches the (unknown) critical value linearly with time. This assumption is confirmed by a close fit of the estimated model&nbsp;to the observed AMOC fingerprint. Although we make no explicit assumptions, the primary driver of climate change, the logarithm of the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, does, in fact, increase close to linearly with time in the industrial period<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 29" title="Keeling, C.

The model assumes that observation <i>x</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> follows some distribution function <span>\({F}_{i,\hat{\theta }}\)</span> for the estimated parameter values <span>\(\hat{\theta }\)</span>. If this is true, then <span>\({u}_{i}={F}_{i,\hat{\theta }}({x}_{i})\)</span> is uniformly distributed on (0, 1). Transforming these residuals back to a standard normal distribution provides standard normally distributed residuals if the model is true. Thus, a normal quantile-quantile plot reveals the model fit. The points should fall close to a straight line. The reason for making the detour around the uniform residuals is twofold. First, since the data is not stationary, each observation follows its own distribution, and residuals cannot be directly combined. Second, since the model is stochastic, standard residuals are not well-defined, and observations should be evaluated according to their entire distribution, not only the distance to the mean.</p><h3 id="Sec10">Noise-induced tipping</h3><p>The drift term in Eq.

		<p>Technical analysis is a part of finance that studies price moves to guide investment decisions.
A lot of investors seem skeptical of the use of past price data, which leads to technical analysis often being perceived as similar to astrology.
In this article, I will try to see if it can provide an edge to long-term investors and if it beats reading the horoscope.</p>

<h2 id="moving-average-crossover">Moving Average Crossover</h2>

<p>There are hundreds of different technical analysis strategies and indicators out there.
For this article, I decided to pick what seemed to be one of the simplest: SMA crossovers.</p>

<p>Simple Moving Averages (SMA) are, as the name suggests, just an average of past closing prices.
The SMA Crossover strategy uses two moving averages, a “fast” one (50 days) and a “slow” one (200 days), and compares them to decide on buying or selling an asset.
If the fast SMA is above the slow one, we should buy and hold the stock, and if this condition inverts, we should sell.
It is a heuristic around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum_(finance)">momentum</a>, which is the idea that if an asset price starts rising, we can jump on the bandwagon and hope it will continue its trajectory.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="https://alicegg.tech/assets/2023-07-25-technical-analysis/sma_illu.jpg" alt="The strategy would have for example indicated to buy and hold between June 2009 and June 2010" width="100%">
</figure>

<p>I have backtested an SMA crossover strategy on the <a href="https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/funds/spdr-sp-500-etf-trust-spy">SPY ETF</a>, one of the most traded passive investment funds in the world.
My backtest makes the following assumptions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>we do not pay any transaction fees</li>
  <li>we will obtain exactly the close price when buying or selling</li>
  <li>dividends received while holding stocks are immediately reinvested</li>
  <li>cash yields no interests</li>
</ul>

<figure>
	<img src="https://alicegg.tech/assets/2023-07-25-technical-analysis/sma.jpg" alt="The result of both backtests, showing similar performance for the SMA and buy and hold strategies" width="100%">
</figure>

<p>While someone who would have bought 10.000$ of SPY in July 1998 and continuously held the stock would have ended up with 52.030$ in June 2023 (6.78% annualized),
an investor using the SMA crossover strategy would have made ended up with 49.127$. (6.54%).
Even without accounting for transaction costs, the SMA crossover strategy doesn’t provide a significant over-performance to simply buying and holding over a long period.</p>

<p>Does this mean that this strategy is completely useless?</p>

<p>Actually no, a closer look at the data will show that the SMA crossover strategy allows investors to avoid extended drawdowns, like the 2008 crisis.
This significantly reduces the risk taken by investors: the yearly standard deviation of the SMA crossover strategy is only 13%, against 19% for the buy and hold strategy.
Since returns didn’t decrease as much as risk, this leads to high risk-adjusted returns, as measured by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_ratio">Sharpe ratio</a>: 0.43 for passive investing vs 0.53 for SMA crossovers.</p>

<h2 id="but-what-about-astrology">But what about astrology?</h2>

<p>Of course, the subject of this article wasn’t to compare technical analysis to buy and hold, but to astrology.
I was surprised to learn that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_astrology">financial astrology</a> was actually a thing and that there were also a lot of astrology-related strategies out there.
I decided to implement a strategy based on <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/timing-solutions-for/9781118339206/xhtml/sec64.html">lunar cycles</a> since it was one of the clearest about when to buy and when to sell.</p>

<p>The strategy goes as follows: we purchase SPY on a new moon, and re-sell it on the next full moon.
And repeat that every lunar month.</p>

</figure>

<p>Clearly, it fails at beating SMA crossovers.
Or at doing basically anything, an investor using the moon phase strategy starting with 10.000$ would end up with only 11.110$ and a Sharpe ratio of only 0.09.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Similarly to <a href="https://alicegg.tech/2023/03/09/shannon-demon.html">diversification</a>, simple technical analysis strategies can be used to minimize investment risk, without necessarily reducing profits by the same amount.
There’s however no guarantee that a strategy that worked in the past will continue working in the future.
It is also likely that there exist smarter momentum indicators than moving averages, but you’ll have to do your own backtests for those.</p>

              <p>In the <a href="https://blog.spatial.chat/missing-piece-of-the-remote-work-tech-stack/">previous</a> post, we shared the reasons for the deception of a universal remote work environment. Many creative collaborations happen outside the scheduled interactions, and collocation speeds up the collaboration exchange. In real life, collaboration often happens spontaneously and informally, and working in close physical proximity can facilitate this exchange. That motivates some <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/05/05/openai-ceo-sam-altman-remote-work-mistake-return-to-office/">leaders</a> believe that remote work can result in a loss of creativity.</p><p>The covid-19 pandemic has drastically changed the landscape of work in the tech industry. Many companies have had to quickly transition to remote work, which has presented a unique set of challenges. Companies have had to adjust to new communication protocols, manage distributed teams, and ensure secure remote access to data and applications. To fully understand the impact of remote work, it is necessary to look beyond the surface level and examine how the remote environment has become entrenched over time.</p><h2 id="unraveling-5-year-hiring-patterns-and-insights">Unraveling 5-Year Hiring Patterns and Insights</h2><p>We decided to start with a tech market and examine the reaction to the post-Covid era, delve into the data, and extract insights that shed light on the changing preferences of remote work within the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HackerNews community</a>. We analyzed thousands of job listings at Ask HN: <code>Who is hiring?</code> section to better understand the preferences of candidates and the requirements of the employees. We analyzed the data from 2018 to June 2023</p><p>Based on the data, we can observe the following trends:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.spatial.chat/content/images/2023/07/image-4.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="640" srcset="https://blog.spatial.chat/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/image-4.png 600w, https://blog.spatial.chat/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/image-4.png 1000w, https://blog.spatial.chat/content/images/size/w1600/2023/07/image-4.png 1600w, https://blog.spatial.chat/content/images/size/w2400/2023/07/image-4.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>In 2018, approximately 23% of job listings on HackerNews were for remote work positions.

This suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a surge in remote work across various industries, also influenced the HackerNews community's preferences. May was the first month the number of remote work outperformed the onsite positions, and the trend remained strong until thees days.</p><div><p>There was no single month where number of onsite position was greater than remote.</p></div><figure><img src="https://blog.spatial.chat/content/images/2023/07/image-5.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="638" srcset="https://blog.spatial.chat/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/image-5.png 600w, https://blog.spatial.chat/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/image-5.png 1000w, https://blog.spatial.chat/content/images/size/w1600/2023/07/image-5.png 1600w, https://blog.spatial.chat/content/images/size/w2400/2023/07/image-5.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Continuing the upward trend, in 2021, the percentage of remote work positions climbed to 79% of all job listings on HackerNews.

However the data presents a slight decline in the percentage of remote work positions within the HackerNews community. On average, only 70% of job postings were remote, marking a decrease compared to previous years. The trend reached its lowest point in May, with remote work positions comprising just 57% of job listings.</p><p>In addition to remote work preferences, another crucial aspect of the job market within the HackerNews community is the prevalence of location-specific or citizenship requirements. </p><h2 id="location-restricted-remote-work-trends">Location-Restricted Remote Work Trends</h2><p>While remote work offers the flexibility to work from anywhere, certain positions and industries may still necessitate candidates to be based in specific locations or possess specific citizenship qualifications. Understanding the dynamics of these requirements is essential for professionals seeking job opportunities and employers looking to attract suitable candidates.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.spatial.chat/content/images/2023/07/image-12.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="534" srcset="https://blog.spatial.chat/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/image-12.png 600w, https://blog.spatial.chat/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/image-12.png 1000w, https://blog.spatial.chat/content/images/size/w1600/2023/07/image-12.png 1600w, https://blog.spatial.chat/content/images/size/w2400/2023/07/image-12.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The percentage of job descriptions with location-specific or citizenship requirements within the HackerNews community has steadily increased from 16% in 2018 to 37% in 2023 (up to June). This trend highlights a growing emphasis on hiring individuals who can be physically present in specific locations or possess the required citizenship, indicating a sustained demand for candidates with specific geographical qualifications.</p><p>The increase in job descriptions with location-specific or citizenship requirements within the HackerNews community can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, it is likely driven by companies adhering to legal obligations, especially those with government contracts or restrictions on hiring non-residential full-time employees due to jurisdictional limitations. Additionally, concerns about preserving company culture may prompt organizations to prioritize candidates who can be physically present in a specific location or possess specific citizenship, ensuring a cohesive organizational environment.</p><p>It is worth noting that the initial adopters of remote work were likely companies that had the ability to hire globally, as the supply of remote workers was relatively limited at that time. These companies recognized the benefits of accessing a larger talent pool and offering remote work options, which allowed them to attract skilled professionals from different parts of the world.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the majority of location requirements correspond to the United States, followed by Canada and the European Union (EU). </p><p>Indeed, the migration trend away from expensive cities is not limited to specific regions but has been observed across the United States.As the concept of work becomes increasingly decoupled from traditional office spaces, individuals are finding the freedom to reside in locations farther away from urban centers or explore new regions. Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, remote work had already facilitated a notable <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/06/17/upshot/17migration-patterns-movers.html?ref=drorpoleg.com">migration of employees away from the most expensive cities</a>:</p><div><p>In the years 2018 and 2019, approximately 40,000 remote workers relocated from the New York metropolitan area, while 20,000 departed from San Francisco.</p></div><p>While some may eventually return, a significant majority of these individuals are expected to establish permanent residences in their new locations. </p><h2 id="which-programming-languages-are-popular-for-remote-work">Which programming languages are popular for remote work?</h2><p>At the end we'd love to analyse the remote preferences of the programming language requirements in job positions:</p><ol><li>React, Python, and Java are the most frequently mentioned programming languages in job postings within the HackerNews community, with high total job counts for each language.</li><li>The programming languages with the highest percentage of remote jobs out of all jobs that require the language / skills are TypeScript (70%), Postgres (61%), GraphQL (62%), and React (60%).

            July 25th, 2023</p><!-- .entry-meta -->
        <p>When building a new thing, a good first step is to build a thing that <i>does nothing</i>. That way, you at least know you are starting from a good place. If I’m building a component that performs an action, I’ll probably do it in these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Step zero is to write a standalone program to perform the action. This ensures that the action is even possible.</li>
<li>Once I have working code to perform the action, I write a component that <i>doesn’t</i> perform an action. That at least makes sure I know how to build a component.</li>
<li>Next, I register the component for the action, but have the <code>Invoke</code> method merely print the message “Yay!” to the debugger without doing anything else. This makes sure I know how to get the component to run at the proper time.</li>
<li>Next, I fill in the <code>Invoke</code> method with enough code to identify what action to perform and which object to perform it on, print that information to the debugger, and return without actually performing the action. This makes sure I can identify which action is supposed to be done.</li>
<li>Finally, I fill in the rest of the <code>Invoke</code> method to perform the action on the desired object. For this, I can copy/paste the already-debugged code from step zero.</li>
</ul>
<p>Too often, I see relatively inexperienced developers dive in and start writing a big complex thing: Then they can’t even get it to compile because it’s so big and complex. They ask for help, saying, “I’m having trouble with this one line of code,” but as you study what they have written, you realize that this one line of code is hardly the problem. The program hasn’t even gotten to the point where it can comprehend the possibility of executing that line of code. I mutter to myself, “How did you let it get this bad?”</p>
<p>Start with something that does nothing. Make sure you can do nothing successfully. Only then should you start making changes so it starts doing something. That way, you know that any problems you have are related to your attempts to do something.</p>

<span itemprop="caption">Much is still being learned about long Covid.&nbsp; </span>

</p>
</div>
<p>A scientific review of the world's research into long Covid&nbsp;carried out by a team of leading UK researchers has led&nbsp;them to declare the burden of the post-infection condition&nbsp;"so large as to be unfathomable".&nbsp;</p>
<p>Immunologist and researcher from London's Imperial College&nbsp;professor Danny Altmann, who led the review team, talked with <em>Saturday Morning</em>'s Kim Hill about the&nbsp;findings and the implications of the disease on people's lives and on the larger scale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-023-00904-7">review was published in <em>Nature</em></a>, and said that if <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/checkpoint/audio/2018836174/long-covid-experts-warn-against-exercising-too-soon-after-virus">10 percent of acute infections</a> lead to persistent symptoms&nbsp;(as earlier studies have concluded could be the case), up to 400 million people could be in need of support for long Covid worldwide. &nbsp;</p>


<p>While the <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/checkpoint/audio/2018875235/long-covid-up-to-300k-nzers-may-have-post-viral-illness">Australian government has allocated $50m for long Covid research</a>,&nbsp;in New Zealand&nbsp;there has been zero investment for bio-medical long Covid research to understand and treat the condition.</p>
<p>Symptoms of long Covid range from the profoundly disabling to 'merely' upsetting. Those with long Covid frequently display a core set of symptoms, Altmann says, including breathlessness, fatigue, wheeze, post-exertional malaise and brain fog.&nbsp;</p>
<div itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">

</p>
</div>
<p>But about 200 other symptoms are also associated with the disease, and can come and go, including word-finding difficulties, insomnia, skin rashes and new allergies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Research has found signs of damage in long Covid patients' hearts, lungs, brains and nervous systems, and signs of disease in their immune systems.</p>
<p>Scientific reviews take a big picture in-depth look at the diverse research and studies that have already been carried out on a topic - in this case long Covid - to give an authoritative collective overviews of findings from the medical and scientific community.</p>
<p>"My job in writing that review was to try and stand back from it and take a really long hard look at the hard data and the hard evidence and the hard numbers and try and put together a kind of consensus that I thought would be useful to build a core agenda moving forward, that would be useful to people," Altmann says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He is also the coauthor of a book that came out last year called the <em>Long Covid Handbook.&nbsp;</em></p>
<h4><strong>Comparing before and after</strong></h4>
<p>Altmann explains how one study drawn on in the review was able to capture 'before' workups of people who later displayed brain and nervous system damage after being affected by long Covid, as the researchers used data already collected on people taking part in a large longitudinal cohort study, the UK Biobank study - some of who had later gone on to develop long Covid.</p>
<p>Extensive MRIs, medical exams and cognitive tests were done on this group over the years, so 'before and after' data could be compared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That's where some of the most scary answers come from," Altmann says, "because some parts of their brain had shrunk as a consequence of the Covid, and their scores on cognitive tests had also come down as a consequence of the Covid.</p>
<p>"So I'm sorry to be so scary - but that's how we know."</p>
<p>His team created a 'hypothesis table' of the current theories about how long Covid affects patients' bodies.</p>
<p>Some leading ideas being studied include autoimmune disease (when the body's immune system attacks the body's own proteins), inflammation, blood clotting abnormalities, organ damage, viral persistence (where a reservoir of the virus remains in the body), blood clotting abnormalities, and difficulty with gas exchange and oxygenating the blood.</p>
<p>More than one disease mechanism can be true, Altmann says: "They don't have to be mutually exclusive".</p>
<p>In one theory scientists believe the virus could remain insidiously in many of the tissues in the body, particularly those tissues that have that have the <a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-the-ace2-receptor-how-is-it-connected-to-coronavirus-and-why-might-it-be-key-to-treating-covid-19-the-experts-explain-136928">ACE2 receptor which the virus latches on to</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So it can get into the heart and the lungs and the liver, and the olfactory lobe - the part of the brain to do with smelling and tasting, and it can do damage there - the type of thing you'd be able to see on an MRI.</p>
<p>"And I think that's part of the answer, but not the whole answer," Altmann says.</p>
<h4><strong>Post-exertion malaise&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>One significant symptom of long Covid, known as PEM or 'post-exertional malaise' was the sometimes incapacitating exhaustion experienced by sufferers after even a small amount of exercise such as standing for a sound check, which could leave them as worn out as if they'd just run a marathon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PEM can require a surprising amount of time to recover from after just a small amount of physical effort, Altmann says, describing a friend who frequently had to take himself away to a quiet place to rest to recover before doing anything more.</p>
<p>And it is difficult for people who have not experienced the disease or mixed closely with those who had&nbsp;to "appreciate the scale of the thing they're talking about".</p>
<p>In casual social conversations about long Covid, he found many people who were not familiar with the disease flippantly compared it to not feeling as young as you once did, or finding a challenge like riding a bike more difficult than you might have when you were fitter. But that was missing the enormity of the effects to many sufferers, Altmann's findings showed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We're talking about previously young fit healthy people who do exert themselves for five or ten minutes doing something... and have to kind of rest up for the rest of the weekend because they're absolutely shattered - they feel like they've run a marathon."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And there's some studies around suggesting that that's to do with impaired gas exchange, impaired oxygen uptake across the lungs. But this is a real thing - people are absolutely shattered," he says.&nbsp;</p>

<span itemprop="caption">Vaccinations have made a difference, Altmann says.&nbsp; </span>
<span>Photo: <span itemprop="copyrightHolder">123rf</span></span>
</p>
</div>
<p>The research showed Covid-19 vaccinations are effective and important in reducing the chances of getting long Covid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The vaccinations have been amazing and miraculous, and have worked terribly well and got the planet out of a terrible fix. Otherwise who knows where we'd be now in terms of our mortality and our misery and our economies - they've worked very well, Altmann says.</p>
<p>"The best way to not get<em> long</em> Covid is to not get Covid, and the best way to not get Covid is to be well vaccinated and boosted and have a good level of antibodies to stop the virus getting in.</p>
<p>"And yet we know perfectly well that there were many people who were vaccinated who did get breakthrough infections and some of those have gone on to get long Covid, but we know that in those breakthrough cases in the vaccinated people, your chance of long Covid is further reduced perhaps by another 50 percent.</p>
<p>"So it doesn't get you off the hook completely, but it certainly helps your odds."</p>
<h4>
<strong>Few choices for patients with condition</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Asked if he ever contracted long Covid how he would he treat himself, Altmann says the choices currently facing patients are sparse.</p>
<p>"I think it speaks to how many long Covid sufferers there are, and how absolutely desperate they are and how impatient they have become, that medicine is being kind of served out on social media platforms ... and people are doing some quite scary things.</p>
<p>"What I would be doing now is going to see my doctor and being quite a difficult, demanding patient," he says.</p>
<p>A challenging climate of misconceptions about long Covid&nbsp;meant the researchers themselves had even encountered scientists suggesting long Covid was not a worthy cause to be studied. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But, Altmann said education is the answer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>"If your doctor isn't helpful change doctors, educate them, take in the papers to show them.</p>
<p>"We certainly are in a very difficult and desperate situation at the moment where - I certainly feel it, that a lot of long Covid patients around the world feel that there's almost a kind of conspiracy in the medical profession of people who know the treatments and are for some reason withholding the treatments.</p>
<p>"The answer is, we've done an awful lot of work but we don't really know even the full list of which drugs we'd put into a clinical trial tomorrow, given the chance. So we just need a little bit more work and a little bit more time - which isn't a very satisfying or pleasing answer."</p>
<p>More work is desperately needed on the wider topic of viral persistence in medicine, he says. In the case of long Covid, this is the idea that 'reservoirs' of the coronavirus might remain in the body after the acute phase of the disease, and cause ongoing disease.</p>
<p>The theory is Altmann's favourite as it potentially offers low-hanging fruit: "Because if you think about it, in terms of potential treatments ...if we were really good at identifying the people who have got a problem because they can't clear the virus and have a persistent reservoir, surely we could just come in with the appropriate antivirals or the appropriate monoclonal antibodies and make them better."</p>
<p>However, the challenge there lies in identifying the people who might have a viral reservoir affecting them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gold standard to test for viruses lurking in the body is with a gut biopsy, but "it wouldn't be ethical to go around taking out bits of people's guts to have a look," Altmann says. So new ways to test this would need to be worked out.</p>

<span itemprop="caption">Chronic fatigue syndrome has been compared to long Covid.&nbsp; </span>
<span>Photo: <span itemprop="copyrightHolder">123RF</span></span>
</p>
</div>
<h4><strong>Links to chronic fatigue considered</strong></h4>
<p>Another disease&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/what-you-need-to-know/456714/is-long-covid-a-new-type-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome">noted for similarities</a>&nbsp;with long Covid is ME/CFS - myalgic encephalomyelitis, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"They are terribly similar. And it's really helpful and illuminating to join up those discussions," Altmann says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Almost every time I go on TV or radio I get a certain amount of comment from people in the ME/CFS community, really quite angry with me, and saying 'well you've jumped on the bandwagon now, but where have you been the last 20 years? Nobody's heard us, nobody's listened to us, nobody's researched on us'.</p>
<p>"My answer is - firstly an apology on the part of the medical community, because yeah, nobody was prepared to fund that research, nobody was that interested, nobody had the wherewithall to look at it with it.</p>
<p>"And, now I think we're at a kind of Rosetta Stone moment where understanding one can illuminate the other in a bi-directional way, because so many things that were discussed over the years in ME/CFS are almost certainly relevant for long Covid and vice versa."</p>
<p>The two diseases have many similar physical signs and reported symptoms, including post-exertional malaise (PEM).</p>
<p>"Some of the blood biomarkers that we talk about are the same in both of them, some of the gut microbiome changes that we talk about are the same in both of them, and the symptom list is massively overlapping," Altmann says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A diagnostic test would be a good first step, and several groups are carrying out research around finding one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We're working really really hard on that, and so are some other groups. That would help in so many ways, both for recognition for those patients, for proper coding of their patients in their electronic healthcare records and access to the correct clinical care pathways, it also means that if we can count them and code them then we can make proper healthcare budgeting provision and all of the things that we've been talking about.</p>
<p>"If we stop dismissing it as 'self-reported' and it's test-reported then we can actually get them into clinical trials and actually test out some of our ideas."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some similarities have been drawn between long Covid and multiple sclerosis (MS), another disease with a specific pattern of fatigue associated with it.</p>
<p>As an immunologist, Altmann says his specialty area is autoimmunity, which is central to understanding the disease process at work in MS. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But in long Covid, "We and other people have tried hard to understand how big a part that plays in long Covid, and for the moment it's still complex," he says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"When we and other people look at the blood of people with long Covid we find lots of different autoimmune patterns in terms of the auto-antibodies that they have in their blood."</p>
<p>However, the research is still not clear enough to say "confidently" how those markers relate to the symptoms of long Covid - "what those [autoimmune patterns] are doing in the disease".&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Long Covid is really enormous and causing real global misery, and there are some big underlying themes in terms of what we think the mechanisms are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"There are so many schools of thought out there."&nbsp;</p>
<div itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">

</p>
</div>
<h4>
<strong>Not everyone affected the same</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Different patients experience different symptoms from a diverse set of symptoms associated with long Covid, which could mean potential treatments might only relate to a particular sub-group and "one drug or antiviral treatment might be asking too much".</p>
<p>"Some people may be helped by antivirals and some by anti-coagulation treatment, and some by specific auto-immune suppression.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You can imagine if we take all of those different people and stick them in the same pot and try and treat them the same we might never disentangle the answers at all and might not help them very well, so we need to do it carefully and logically."</p>
<p>People can develop long Covid after even the mildest of Covid infections, they can develop long Covid after being infected with any of the different strains of the Covid-19 virus, and long Covid can first develop in people after they experience a re-infection with Covid, Altmann says. &nbsp;</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/programmes/the-detail/story/2018804693/political-moves-pushing-the-path-of-covid-19">'Freedom Day' in the UK in 2021</a>, when many measures to control the spread of Covid were relaxed, the number of people with long Covid still continued to climb significantly, Altmann says.</p>
<p>"We went almost straight into the Omicron wave and then the Omicron subvariants, and in a population with a so-called mild variant circulating and a population who was double or triple vaccinated we have acquired an extra 700,000 people into our long Covid burden just from that period ... it's added massively to our long Covid burden at a time when we weren't even counting or caring, which sounds very cruel to me."</p>
<p>It is still too early in our collective experience of long Covid to know if people who get it will recover. So far the research shows that "some things for some people get better, and yet a lot of it is very stubbornly the same and doesn't get better very fast," Altmann says.</p>
<p>However, there is one potential crystal ball to give us some insight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of similarities between the virus that causes Covid-19 and the SARS-CoV-1 virus - the disease that caused SARS outbreaks in 2003 and 2004 - as part of his research, Altmann talked with consultants who had treated SARS patients earlier, to find about their long-term outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One wrote up and presented their findings: "It was one of the most devastating things I'd read on the subject," Altmann says.</p>
<p>"I think it ended with the words: 'In conclusion, none of my patients ever fully recovered, most of them never went back to full time employment, many of them never got their old jobs back.'</p>
<p>"So to me it doesn't sound like a thing that goes away fast."</p>
<p>Some long Covid patients feel they have been treated as collateral in the unfolding of the Covid-19 pandemic, and have been forgotten about.</p>
<p>"You don't want to go around in a permanent state of outrage, do you? But yes, I do feel outraged for them," Altmann says.</p>
<p>As a result of what his team discovered in their research, he says they now had a strong drive to help pursue the problem, and not just out of academic interest: "This is really about a race to the finish line to get some drugs into clinical trials that could actually make some people better.</p>
<p>"As immunologists we feel that we've got quite a good box of goodies to offer people. If you think of immunology and modern medicine, lots of things have benefited enormously from that kind of research - if you think about cancer immunotherapy or treatment for autoimmune diseases like arthritis or multiple sclerosis, that's all come from really super immunology research," he says.</p>
<p>"So we feel that if we could only nudge this stuff over the line we could maybe make a difference for people."</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://httptoolkit.com/blog/apple-private-access-tokens-attestation/">https://httptoolkit.com/blog/apple-private-access-tokens-attestation/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36862494">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There's been a lot of concern recently about the <a href="https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity">Web Environment Integrity</a> proposal, developed by a selection of authors from Google, and apparently being prototyped in Chromium.</p>
<p>There's good reason for anger here (though I'm not sure yelling at people on GitHub is necessarily the best outlet). This proposal amounts to attestation on the web, limiting access to features or entire sites based on whether the client is approved by a trusted issuer. In practice, that will mean Apple, Microsoft &amp; Google.</p>
<p>Of course, Google isn't the first to think of this, but in fact they're not even the first to ship it. Apple already developed &amp; deployed an extremely similar system last year, now integrated into MacOS 13, iOS 16 &amp; Safari, called "<a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=huqjyh7k">Private Access Tokens</a>":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Private Access Tokens are powerful tools that prove when HTTP requests are coming from legitimate devices without disclosing someone's identity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The focus here is primarily on removing captchas, and as such it's been integrated into Cloudflare (discussed <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/eliminating-captchas-on-iphones-and-macs-using-new-standard/">here</a>) and Fastly (<a href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/private-access-tokens-stepping-into-the-privacy-respecting-captcha-less">here</a>) as a mechanism for recognizing 'real' clients without needing other captcha mechanisms.</p>
<p>Fundamentally though, it's exactly the same concept: a way that web servers can demand your device prove it is a sufficiently 'legitimate' device before browsing the web.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-private-access-tokens-work"><a href="#how-do-private-access-tokens-work" aria-label="how do private access tokens work permalink"></a>How do Private Access Tokens work?</h2>
<p>The mechanism is a fairly simple exchange over HTTP, handled by built-in browser APIs, which in turn integrate with operating system components to confirm that the browser &amp; OS are 'legitimate' (the exact definition of that is left to the attester - i.e. Apple).</p>
<p>The flow looks like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>A browser makes an HTTP request from a web server.</li>
<li>
<p>The web server refuses the request, and returns an HTTP 401 response with a <code>PrivateToken</code> challenge:</p>
<div data-language="text">
      <pre><code>HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate:
    PrivateToken challenge=&lt;base64 challenge data&gt;,
        token-key=&lt;base64 public-key&gt;</code></pre>
      </div>
<p><em>(Newlines added for readability)</em></p>
</li>
<li>The browser recognizes this, and sends parts of the challenge, in addition to verified details of your device provided by the OS, to an attester (e.g. Apple).</li>
<li>The attester verifies your device is real &amp; unmodified (depends on the device, but both Android &amp; iOS have existing ways to check this) and works with a token issuer (somebody trusted by the origin &amp; that trusts the attester, e.g. Cloudflare/Fastly) to return a signed token, proving that your device has been verified as legitimate.</li>
<li>
<p>The browser resends the request, with the signed token in their <code>Authorization</code> header:</p>
<div data-language="text">
      <pre><code>GET /protected-content HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Authorization: PrivateToken token=&lt;signed token&gt;</code></pre>
      </div>
</li>
<li>The server now knows that the client has been verified by a trusted provider (but nothing more) and can treat the client differently on that basis.</li>
</ol>
<p>This all happens on Apple devices today when using Safari, any time a service using this (such as Fastly &amp; Cloudflare) is concerned about the legitimacy of your requests.</p>
<p>The privacy protections in here appear fairly strong (I'm not an expert on this, but that's a very clear goal of the proposal and the separation of the origin/issuer/attester flow) but the core issue from Web Environment Integrity remains: your treatment on the web depends on whether Apple says your device, OS &amp; browser configuration are legitimate &amp; acceptable.</p>
<h2 id="how-bad-is-this"><a href="#how-bad-is-this" aria-label="how bad is this permalink"></a>How bad is this?</h2>
<p>This feature is largely bad for the web and the industry generally, like all attestation (see below).</p>
<p>That said, it's not as dangerous as the Google proposal, simply because Safari isn't the dominant browser. Right now, Safari has around 20% market share in browsers (25% on mobile, and 15% on desktop), while Chrome is comfortably above 60% everywhere, with Chromium more generally (Brave, Edge, Opera, Samsung Internet, etc) about 10% above that.</p>
<p>With Safari providing this, it can be used by some providers, but nobody can block or behave differently with unattested clients. Similarly, Safari can't usefully use this to tighten the screws on users - while they could refuse to attest old OS versions or browsers, it wouldn't make a significant impact on users (they might see statistically more CAPTCHAs, but little else).</p>
<p>Chrome's usage is a larger concern. With 70+% of web clients using Chromium, this would become a major part of the web very quickly. With both Web Environment Integrity &amp; Private Access Tokens, 90% of web clients would potentially be attested, and the "oh, you're not attested, let's treat you suspiciously" pressure could ramp up quickly.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-attestation-bad-generally"><a href="#why-is-attestation-bad-generally" aria-label="why is attestation bad generally permalink"></a>Why is attestation bad generally?</h2>
<p>This has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/googles-web-integrity-api-sounds-like-drm-for-the-web/">covered</a> <a href="https://gabrielsieben.tech/2022/07/29/remote-assertion-is-coming-back-how-much-freedom-will-it-take/">extensively</a> elsewhere, so I won't dig into it too deeply, but as a quick summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attestation means you can only use approved clients, which is terrible for competition and innovation (sorry, it's now impossible to make a new browser or OS!) particularly for open-source, community &amp; smaller indie efforts that are consistently excluded from these mechanisms. If attestation was around in the days of IE6, it would've been a major roadblock in the rise of Firefox &amp; Chrome.</li>
<li>Attestation blocks users' control of their own devices, by design. A key goal is that users using modified software should not be attested as legitimate. I would like to be able to browse the web on my rooted Android phone please. There's no way any fully user-modifiable OS or hardware can ever be attested in the way these proposals intend.</li>
<li>Attestation opens dangerous doors that allow the approved providers to freely tighten the rules later. "Sorry, we only attest devices during their 2 year official support window", and "Sorry, we don't attest browsers with ad-block extensions installed" are both perfectly plausible and thoroughly problematic next steps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Proponents would argue that none of this applies to the Web Environment Integrity proposal, as it suggests 'holdbacks', i.e. refusing attestation a small percentage of times to make blocking based on attestation impossible. I suspect business pressures will make that unworkable in practice (there's already <a href="https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/issues/5">strong industry pushback</a> from a closely involved F5 / Shape Security representative) and it's notable that Google's existing Android Play Integrity attestation does <em>not</em> do this.</p>
<p>Free usage of different clients &amp; servers on the web is what has built the open web, and is a large part of why it's so successful. Attestation breaks this by design.</p>
<p>All of this has already played out on Android, where you technically <em>can</em> create and run your OS, and Android distributions like <a href="https://lineageos.org/">LineageOS</a> are perfectly functional, but attestation features mean that this implies the constant risk of key apps (like your bank!) blocking you as suspicious.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, attestation is anti-competitive. Blocking competition between different Android versions is already problematic. Blocking competition for both browsers &amp; OSs on the web would be catastrophic.</p>
<h2 id="shit"><a href="#shit" aria-label="shit permalink"></a>Shit</h2>
<p>Quite.</p>
<p>If you're concerned about all this, you might also be interested in the <a href="https://github.com/antifraudcg/proposals/issues">other proposals</a> from the Anti-Fraud Community Group, discussing various other potential web 'features' along the same lines.</p>
<p>Fraud &amp; bots on the web are a real problem, and discussion on ways to defend against that is totally reasonable, and often very valuable! It's a hard problem. That said, this has to be carefully balanced against the health of the web itself. Blocking competition, hamstringing open-source and the open web, and removing all user control over their own devices is not a reasonable tradeoff.</p>

LLMs are predicted to both create immeasurable wealth for society as well as potentially compete with (or deprecate?) knowledge workers. While bond markets are trying to read the tea leaves on future Fed rate hikes, equity markets are bullish on all things AI. Many companies are rapidly adopting some form of AI play in order to appease shareholder FOMO. A large percentage of YC cohort members are, unsurprisingly, generative AI startups now. All the “MAANG”s (whatever they are called these days) seem to have some form of giant LLM they are building now. It’s as though crypto was forgotten overnight; the public imagination appears singularly captivated with what possibilities AI may usher forth. </span></span></p><p><span><span>The madness of crowds aside, it is worth reflecting on what we concretely know about LLMs at this point in time and how these insights sparked the latest AI fervor. This will help put into perspective the relevance of current research efforts and the possibilities that abound.</span></span></p><h2 id="block-f707d2def7494b129f38a0f8cf72c3f5"><span id="f707d2def7494b129f38a0f8cf72c3f5"></span><span><span>What We Mean By “LLM”</span></span></h2><p><span><span>When people say “Large Language Models”, they typically are referring to a type of deep learning architecture called a Transformer.

This allows for faster training times (i.e. the whole sequence in parallel) and larger model parameter sizes. Transformers were once considered “large” when they were ~ 100MM+ parameters; today, published models are </span><span><strong>~500B-1T parameters</strong></span><span> in size. Anecdotally, several papers have reported a major inflection point in Transformer behavior around ~</span><span><strong>100B+</strong></span><span> parameters. (Note: these models are generally too large to fit into a single GPU and require the model to be broken apart and distributed across multiple nodes).</span></span></p><div id="block-fd7c5af78fd946f7b25873b190a09312"><p><span><span></span><img alt="From Jay Alammar’s popular " srcset="https://willthompson.name/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.super.so%2Fd0376c53-81de-4b6c-b0fb-0a16f4ae9da5%2Fimages%2Fb1fe8e95-631d-4c6a-9cde-edb751bfcf96%2FUntitled.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=80 1x, https://willthompson.name/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.super.so%2Fd0376c53-81de-4b6c-b0fb-0a16f4ae9da5%2Fimages%2Fb1fe8e95-631d-4c6a-9cde-edb751bfcf96%2FUntitled.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=80 2x" src="https://willthompson.name/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.super.so%2Fd0376c53-81de-4b6c-b0fb-0a16f4ae9da5%2Fimages%2Fb1fe8e95-631d-4c6a-9cde-edb751bfcf96%2FUntitled.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=80" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" loading="lazy" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p><figcaption><span><span>From Jay Alammar’s popular </span><span><a href="http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“The Illustrated Transformer”</a></span><span> blog post.  A context window is used to read in K tokens simultaneously in order to understand the relative meaning of words in a sentence. This is opposed to the RNN (see above), which technically can be thought as having an infinite context window (an observation by Karpathy), although each word must be processed serially. RNNs have a history of requiring more clever architecture tweaks to overcome their innate inability to connect long-term dependencies in a sentence, which is actually where the original (hierarchical) attention mechanism was born out of necessity.</span></span></figcaption></div><p><span><span>Transformers can be generally categorized into one of three categories: “</span><span><strong>encoder only</strong></span><span>” (a la </span><span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BERT</a></span><span>); “</span><span><strong>decoder only</strong></span><span>” (a la </span><span><a href="https://openai.com/gpt-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPT</a></span><span>); and having an “</span><span><strong>encoder-decoder</strong></span><span>” architecture (a la </span><span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">T5</a></span><span>).

Instruction Fine-Tuning  🎛️</span></span></h2><p><span><span>The first step to improving the output of a generative model logically seems to be teach it to follow instructions better. </span></span></p><p><span><span>To that end, the authors culminated a series of prompts via submissions to their playground API from real users (i.e. tackle the cold-start problem) as well as a mixture of prompting tasks of their own devise. Using a rigorous selection process,  labelers were hired to produce high-quality outputs that were aligned with </span><span><u>Anthropic’s 3 Laws</u></span><span>: helpful, honest and harmless</span><span><strong> (HHH</strong></span><span>, or maybe </span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_H" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Triple H</a></span><span>?</span><span><strong>). </strong></span></span></p><p><span><span>Using these gold-standard labels, they fine-tuned a GPT model to learn these outputs. This is what they call “</span><span><strong>Supervised Fine-tuning</strong></span><span>” (SFT).</span></span></p><h2 id="block-44942fd81c604e8fa5b14272b008ba0b"><span id="44942fd81c604e8fa5b14272b008ba0b"></span><span><span>2. RLHF 💎</span></span></h2><p><span><span>Now what about teaching an LLM to produce outputs that embody a set of values?</span></span></p><p><span><span>While the public perception of OpenAI is predominantly tied to GPT* models, a non-trivial percentage of their efforts has been focused on attacking </span><span><a href="https://openai.com/blog/our-approach-to-alignment-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the alignment problem</a></span><span>. Their solution to this problem, thus far, has been what they call </span><span><strong>Reinforcement Learning via Human Feedback  (RLHF) </strong></span><span>(note: this is expected to not work in the case of </span><span><a href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-superalignment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">superalignment</a></span><span>, or teaching systems smarter than ourselves our values). </span></span></p><p><span><span>Teaching an LLM a set of human values is a challenging modeling task. Traditional loss functions usually measure the model’s internal belief about the probability the data belongs to the correct label (i.e. cross entropy). But human values are more complex; they are hard to encapsulate within a single label . Rather than </span><span><em>explicitly</em></span><span> labeling data, it might be easier for a human to read two or more LLM outputs and encode their preferences through </span><span><em>comparison</em></span><span>. An AI system can then </span><span><strong>implicitly</strong></span><span> learn these preferences by learning to correctly rank a set of options. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Along these lines, RLHF seeks to teach an AI system a set of preferences by learning a </span><span><strong>reward function/model </strong></span><span>through interacting with a human and gaining their input. </span></span></p><p><span><span>This reward model is then used to </span><span><strong>guide the LLM</strong></span><span> to produce higher-valued outputs through </span><span><strong>reinforcement learning. </strong></span><span> At each step, the reward model takes an input and output and returns a “preferability” number; the LLM seeks to narrow the difference between the “optimal” preference and it’s current output over many interactions. This is used to train the LLM to produce a set of outputs that are “aligned” with the values of the labelers/modelers/etc (for a decent primer on RLHF, check out HuggingFace’s blog </span><span><a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a></span><span>).</span></span></p><div id="block-fa3ffdbc02a343628c2a55f38013926e"><p><span><span></span><img alt="Labeler output rankings.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                
                <p>Go programmers have the good fortune of excellent testing and benchmarking
tooling built into the standard library - in the <tt>testing</tt> package. However,
<em>benchmarking is hard</em>. This isn't Go specific; it's just one of those things
experienced developers learn over time.</p>
<p>This post lists some common benchmarking pitfalls Go programmers run into. It
assumes basic familiarity with writing Go benchmarks; consult the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/testing">testing
package documentation</a> if needed. While these
pitfalls are presented in Go, they exist in any programming language or
environment, so the lessons learned here are widely applicable.</p>
<div id="benchmarking-the-wrong-thing">
<h2>Benchmarking the wrong thing</h2>
<p>Let's say we want to benchmark the new sorting functionality available in the
<tt>slices</tt> package starting with Go 1.21 <a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a>. Consider the following
benchmark:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>N</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>100</span><span>_000</span><span></span>

<span>func</span><span> </span><span>BenchmarkSortIntsWrong</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span>testing</span><span>.</span><span>B</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>

<span>  </span><span>b</span><span>.</span><span>ResetTimer</span><span>()</span><span></span>

<span>  </span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span>.</span><span>N</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span>++</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>slices</span><span>.</span><span>Sort</span><span>(</span><span>ints</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>

<span>func</span><span> </span><span>makeRandomInts</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>[]</span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>ints</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>make</span><span>([]</span><span>int</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>n</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span> </span><span>n</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span>++</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>ints</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>rand</span><span>.</span><span>Intn</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>ints</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>Why is this benchmark wrong? Because it's not really testing what you think it's
testing. <tt>slices.Sort</tt> sorts a slice <em>in-place</em>. After the first iteration,
the <tt>ints</tt> slice is already sorted, so all subsequent iterations "sort"
a sorted slice. This is not what we want to measure <a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-reference-2">[2]</a>. The
right measurement would create a new random slice for each iteration:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>func</span><span> </span><span>BenchmarkSortInts</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span>testing</span><span>.</span><span>B</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span>.</span><span>N</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span>++</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>b</span><span>.</span><span>StopTimer</span><span>()</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>ints</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>makeRandomInts</span><span>(</span><span>N</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>b</span><span>.</span><span>StartTimer</span><span>()</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>slices</span><span>.</span><span>Sort</span><span>(</span><span>ints</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>On my machine, the second benchmark is almost 100x slower; this makes sense,
because it actually sorts something on each iteration.</p>
</div>
<div id="forgetting-to-reset-the-timer">
<h2>Forgetting to reset the timer</h2>
<p>Note how the benchmarks mentioned above are careful to reset or stop/start
the benchmarking timer around certain operations. This is on purpose, because
the benchmark scaffold measures the run-time of the entire <tt>Benchmark*</tt>
function, executing it many times and dividing the total execution time by
<tt>b.N</tt> (much more details on this process later in the post).</p>
<p>Try it! Remove the <tt>b.StopTimer()</tt> and <tt>b.StartTimer()</tt> calls from the
benchmarking loop in <tt>BenchmarkSortInts</tt> and compare the results - you'll
notice the benchmark now reports noticeably slower per-op execution time
because creating the slices of random integers also happens <tt>b.N</tt> times.</p>
<p>This can throw results off significantly in some cases. Even if we use the
same technique to benchmark two approaches, the errors don't necessarily cancel
out. Due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">Amdahl's law</a> we
can easily report the wrong speed-up when not isolating the computation we
care about.</p>
</div>
<div id="fooled-by-the-compiler">
<h2>Fooled by the compiler</h2>
<p>The trickiest benchmarking pitfall is dealing with compiler optimizations
thwarting our results. The Go compiler doesn't give <tt>Benchmark*</tt> functions
any preferential treatment and will try to optimize them and their contents
just as it would any other Go code <a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-reference-3">[3]</a>. This produces wrong results and it's
not even easy to know they are wrong! Consider this benchmark:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>func</span><span> </span><span>isCond</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span> </span><span>byte</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>bool</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>

<span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>

<span>func</span><span> </span><span>BenchmarkIsCondWrong</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span>testing</span><span>.</span><span>B</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span>.</span><span>N</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span>++</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>isCond</span><span>(</span><span>201</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>We're trying to benchmark the <tt>isCond</tt> function, but the compiler is
fooling us (at least in recent Go versions):</p>
<div><pre><span></span>BenchmarkIsCondWrong-8        1000000000     0.2401 ns/op
</pre></div>
<p>Sub-nanosecond operation times are always a bit suspect, although not entirely
out of the question given the simplicity of the <tt>isCond</tt> function. There are
two serious errors here, however:</p>
<ol>
<li>We use a constant input to <tt>isCond</tt>; since <tt>isCond</tt> is a simple function
that is likely to be inlined into the benchmark function, the compiler can
theoretically constant-propagate its input through its contents and replace
the code with the compile-time computed answer.</li>
<li>Even if we used a non-constant for the input, the result of <tt>isCond</tt> is
unused, so the compiler may optimize it away.</li>
</ol>
<p>And in fact, in this example the contents of the benchmark loop are optimized
away entirely; looking at the disassembly, we see this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>    JMP     BenchmarkIsCondWrong_pc7
BenchmarkIsCondWrong_pc4:
    INCQ    CX
BenchmarkIsCondWrong_pc7:
    CMPQ    416(AX), CX
    JGT     BenchmarkIsCondWrong_pc4
    RET
</pre></div>
<p><tt>CX</tt> holds <tt>i</tt>, and <tt>416(AX)</tt> accesses <tt>b.N</tt>. This is just an empty
loop! Now the 0.24 nanoseconds per iteration make sense <a href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-reference-4">[4]</a>.</p>
<p>Here's an even more confounding manifestation of the same problem:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>func</span><span> </span><span>countCond</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span> </span><span>[]</span><span>byte</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>

</pre></div>
<p>Now there are certainly no constant propagation issues, and the result of
<tt>isCond</tt> is clearly used inside <tt>countCond</tt>. But we've committed the same
error! While the result of <tt>isCond</tt> is used, the result of <tt>countCond</tt> is
not, and therefore the compiler will do something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inline <tt>isCond</tt> into <tt>countCond</tt></li>
<li>Inline <tt>countCond</tt> into the benchmark function</li>
<li>Realize that the loop body in <tt>coundCond</tt> isn't producing side effects or
any result used outside it</li>
<li>Hollow out the loop body in <tt>countCond</tt>, leaving only an empty loop</li>
</ul>
<p>This process results in confusing benchmark results because the loop
remains in place, and thus if we grow the input, the benchmarked execution
time will grow accordingly! One of the oldest tricks in the benchmarking book is
to change the input size and observe how the run-time is affected; if it's not
moving, something is wrong. If it's growing roughly in line with the asymptotic
complexity of the code under test, it's at least passing a simple smoke test.
But in this case the heuristic fails due to the specific optimizations
performed.</p>
<div id="keeping-compiler-optimizations-in-benchmarks-under-control">
<h3>Keeping compiler optimizations in benchmarks under control</h3>
<p>There are two main techniques in Go to thwart compiler optimizations where we
don't want them.</p>
<p>The first is using the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/runtime#KeepAlive">runtime.KeepAlive</a>
function. Originally introduced for fine-grained control of finalizers, it's
also useful as a very-low-overhead way to tell the compiler "I really need this
value, even if you can prove I do not". Here's how we can fix our <tt>countCond</tt>
benchmark with its help:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>func</span><span> </span><span>BenchmarkCountKeepAlive</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span>testing</span><span>.</span><span>B</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>inp</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>getInputContents</span><span>()</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>b</span><span>.</span><span>ResetTimer</span><span>()</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>result</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span>.</span><span>N</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span>++</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>result</span><span> </span><span>+=</span><span> </span><span>countCond</span><span>(</span><span>inp</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>runtime</span><span>.</span><span>KeepAlive</span><span>(</span><span>result</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>Running the benchmark makes it clear that there's more work going into each
iteration now:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>BenchmarkCountWrong-8                 12481       95911 ns/op
BenchmarkCountKeepAlive-8              4143      285527 ns/op
</pre></div>
<p>Another way is without needing a special function, but is slightly more
dangerous; we can use a global exported value to collect the result:</p>

</pre></div>
<p>Even though our benchmark doesn't use <tt>Sink</tt>, it's very difficult for the
compiler to eliminate because it's a package-level exported value that can be
used pretty much anywhere in the program. I did say it's slightly more
dangerous, though, because theoretically the compiler <em>could</em> prove it's
redundant using more sophisticated cross-package analysis.</p>
<p>Which brings us the to ultimate point: when in doubt, always double check the
assembly generated for the benchmark function, and ensure that the compiler
wasn't too clever.</p>

<h3>Ongoing work in the Go standard library</h3>
<p>Addressing the issue of compiler optimizations in benchmarks is something the Go
team is interested in. There are currently two active proposals in discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/61179">Issue 61179</a>: adding a
low-overhead "keep this value" function in the <tt>testing</tt> package; this would
be similar to <tt>runtime.KeepAlive</tt>, but more targeted at benchmarks with
a better name and clearer guarantees.</li>
<li>A more ambitious proposal in <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/61515">issue 61515</a> discusses changing the main
benchmarking API of the <tt>testing</tt> package to facilitate safer benchmarking.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="misusing-b-n">
<h2>Misusing <tt>b.N</tt></h2>
<p>There are at least two common ways to misuse the benchmark repetition indicator
<tt>b.N</tt>. Here's the first, completely forgetting the loop:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>"crypto/rand"</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>"testing"</span><span></span>
<span>)</span><span></span>

<span>  </span><span>rand</span><span>.</span><span>Prime</span><span>(</span><span>rand</span><span>.</span><span>Reader</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>200</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>From proper measurements, the <tt>crypto/rand.Prime</tt> invocation with length 200
should take around 1 ms on my machine, but this benchmark reports impossibly
low times - fractions of a nanosecond.</p>
<p>The second is trickier:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>func</span><span> </span><span>BenchmarkRandPrimeWrongUseI</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span>testing</span><span>.</span><span>B</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span>.</span><span>N</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span>++</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>rand</span><span>.</span><span>Prime</span><span>(</span><span>rand</span><span>.</span><span>Reader</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>Note how it's using <tt>i</tt> in each iteration (and thus indirectly <tt>b.N</tt>). On my
machine, this benchmark <strong>doesn't terminate</strong>; what gives?</p>
<p>To understand what's going on here, we should first discuss how benchmarking in
Go works in a bit more detail. The benchmarking harness invokes our benchmark
functions several times. How many? This can be
determined by flags like <tt><span>-benchtime</span></tt>, but the default is for one second.
How does the harness know how many repetitions to pass to our benchmark function
in order to get 1s of execution time? By trying it with low repetitions first,
measuring how long it takes, and then running with increasingly high repetitions
until the intended duration is reached <a href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-reference-5">[5]</a>.</p>
<p>There are some nuances to the process: e.g. the number of repetitions doesn't
grow too fast between attempts (at most 100x, as of Go 1.21), and it is capped
at 1 billion. The key point is that it uses the execution time from the
previous attempt to determine how many repetitions to run next.</p>
<p>With these insights in mind, let's examine the two misuses shown above.</p>
<ol>
<li>Forgetting to loop until <tt>b.N</tt>. Each benchmark invocation only performs the
tested operations once. No matter how many times the benchmark harness
repeats the benchmark with increasing <tt>b.N</tt>, the function takes a
millisecond to run! Therefore, eventually the benchmark harness hits its
<tt>N</tt> limit of a billion invocations, and divides the execution time (1 ms)
by this <tt>N</tt> to get a nonsensical result.</li>
<li>Using the value of <tt>b.N</tt> for something other than "how many times to
repeat the benchmark". <tt>rand.Prime</tt> is very fast when its input length
is small, but gets pretty slow for large inputs. The harness starts by
running the function once to get its bearings, and then 100 times. For size
100 the run-time of <tt>rand.Prime</tt> is moderate, so the next time the harness
can increase <tt>b.N</tt> by another factor of 100. But for higher inputs,
<tt>rand.Prime</tt> also takes much longer. We end up with a quadratic run-time
explosion! Our benchmark function isn't literally hanging - it <em>will</em> finish
eventually, but it may take long minutes or hours.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's worth mentioning that the proposal in <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/61515">issue 61515</a> would address this problem as
well, by exposing a benchmarking API that would be much harder to misuse in this
way. Another proposal that may affect this is <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/61405">add range over int</a>, which will permit us to write
<tt>for range b.N</tt> to iterate exactly <tt>b.N</tt> times, without an explicit
iteration variable.</p>

<details>
<summary>Command Explanation</summary>
Let's break down the command:
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>find samples -type f -exec file --mime-type {} \;</code>: This part uses the <code>find</code> command to locate all files (<code>-type f</code>) within the "samples" folder and its subdirectories. For each file, it executes the <code>file --mime-type</code> command to determine the file's MIME type. This outputs a line like "samples/ship.ans: text/plain".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>grep -v -e "image/png" -e "image/svg"</code>: This filters out any lines containing the MIME types "image/png" or "image/svg", effectively excluding PNG and SVG files. <code>-v</code> means "invert the match", so it will only output lines that don't match the given patterns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>cut -d: -f1</code>: This extracts only the file paths from the output of the <code>file</code> command, removing the MIME type information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>sort</code>: This sorts the file paths alphabetically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>xargs -I{} sh -c 'echo "File: {}"; cat "{}"; echo "\n-----------------------\n"'</code>: Finally, this executes the <code>sh -c</code> command for each file, echoing the filename, catting its content, and adding a separator line.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">This command will sort and display the content of all non-PNG files within the "samples" folder and its subdirectories. Remember to run this command in the directory where the "samples" folder is located.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Known Issues</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Undo/Redo doesn't work inside the Text tool's textbox. <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> will delete the textbox. (Also note that the Text tool works differently from MS Paint; it will overwrite characters and the cursor can move freely, which makes it better for ASCII art, but worse for prose.)</li>
<li>The Text tool's cursor doesn't blink.</li>
<li>The selection box border appears inside instead of outside (and lacks dashes). For the text box, I hid the border because it was too visually confusing, but it should also have an outer border.</li>
<li>Pressing both mouse buttons stops the current tool, but doesn't undo the current action. Also Pick Color can't be cancelled (with <kbd>Esc</kbd> or by pressing both mouse buttons), since it samples the color continuously.</li>
<li>Due to limitations of the terminal, shortcuts using <kbd>Shift</kbd> or <kbd>Alt</kbd> might not work. Menus are not keyboard navigable, because I can't detect <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>, etc.</li>
<li>The Zoom submenu flickers as it opens, and may not always open in the right place.</li>
<li>The canvas flickers when zooming in with the Magnifier tool.</li>
<li>Some languages don't display correctly.</li>
<li>Large files can make the program very slow, as can magnifying the canvas. There is a 500 KB limit when opening files to prevent it from freezing.</li>
<li>Free-Form Select stamping/finalizing is incorrect when the selection is off-screen to the left or top.</li>
<li>The status bar description can be left blank when selecting a menu item. (I think the <code>Leave</code> event can come after closing, once the mouse moves.)</li>
<li>Menu items like Copy/Cut/Paste are not grayed out when inapplicable. Only unimplemented items are grayed out.</li>
<li>ANSI files (.ans) are treated as UTF-8 when saving and loading, rather than CP437 or Windows-1252 or any other encodings. Unicode is nice and modern terminals support it, but it's not the standard for ANSI files. There isn't really a standard for ANSI files.</li>
<li>ANSI files are loaded with a white background. This may make sense as a default for text files, but ANSI files either draw a background or assume a black background, being designed for terminals.</li>
<li>Hitting Enter in View Bitmap mode may trigger a menu item while exiting the mode. Menu items ought to be disabled when hidden, and View Bitmap should also prevent the key event from taking other actions if possible.</li>
<li>Airbrush is continuous in space instead of time. It should keep spraying while the mouse stays still.</li>
<li>Error messages may not show up when opening a file fails. I'm not sure how to reproduce this, so if you run into this, do let me know.</li>
<li>Edit Colors dialog
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Focus ring shows even while grid is not focused</li>
<li>Can show two cells as selected, instead of one across both grids</li>
<li>Custom colors order X/Y is different from MS Paint</li>
<li>Pressing enter in color grid should select color and close</li>
<li>Selection ring is hard to see in dark mode</li>
<li>Focus ring is invisible on a black color cell</li>
<li>When dragging on the color field or luminosity slider, the cursor can be seen to jump back to earlier places where the mouse was, before settling at the current position. (This may only be visible when the program is running slowly, such while debugging. I haven't observed this on the canvas, so maybe it has something to do with the dialog being on a separate layer.)</li>
<li>When opening the Edit Colors dialog, it may immediately close, if the mouse lines up with the "OK" or "Cancel" buttons. (This doesn't seem to currently happen, but I haven't knowingly fixed it. A git bisect turned up a bogus commit, possibly due to reproducing the behavior being unreliable. It also seems like it might depend on the specific layout of the dialog, which changed during development, and maybe even the terminal size.)</li>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Compatibility</h2>
<p dir="auto">Python 3.10 or later is required.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Linux</h3>
<p dir="auto">Tested on Ubuntu 22, with GNOME Terminal, and VS Code's integrated terminal.</p>
<p dir="auto">GNOME Terminal works best, with crisp triangles used for icons in dialogs, emoji support, and true color support.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">macOS</h3>
<p dir="auto">Tested on OSX 10.14 (Mojave), with iTerm2, and VS Code's integrated terminal.</p>
<p dir="auto">In VS Code, Free-Form Select shows as tofu (a missing character symbol).</p>
<p dir="auto">The default Terminal has missing characters, causing misalignment of everything to the right of them, plus borders are not rendered nicely, giving it a sort of <em>frayed fabric</em> look, and it's limited to 256 colors.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Windows</h3>
<p dir="auto">Textual Paint works with the new <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/terminal/install" rel="nofollow">Windows Terminal</a>.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Pasting in Windows Terminal</h4>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/11267" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/microsoft/terminal/issues/11267/hovercard"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> does not work</a> to paste by default, but <strong>Edit &gt; Paste</strong> does work.
You can unbind <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> to fix this:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Open Windows Terminal's Settings (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd>)</li>
<li>Click "Open JSON file"</li>
<li>Disable the paste binding by adding <code>//</code> to the beginning of the lines:
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="// {
//     &quot;command&quot;: &quot;paste&quot;,
//     &quot;keys&quot;: &quot;ctrl+v&quot;
// },"><pre><span>// {</span>
<span>//     "command": "paste",</span>
<span>//     "keys": "ctrl+v"</span>
<span>// },</span></pre></div>
</li>
<li>Save the file, and the behavior should update immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Alternatively, you can use the Actions tab of the Settings UI to remove the binding for <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you're wondering why <em>removing</em> the Paste binding fixes it, it's because Textual Paint needs to receive the literal <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> key presses in order to trigger its own Paste command.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Powershell Problems</h4>
<p dir="auto">Running in Powershell, you may run into a bug where the powershell prompt becomes active at the same time as the TUI.
Moving the mouse will redraw parts of the TUI, and it becomes hard to click on things, but still possible.
Commands can be entered, and the output will be interwoven with the TUI, including if you run a second instance of the program, in which case the two instances will vie for the screen.
If this happens, I would recommend first messing around with it, since it's a fun glitch, then opening a new tab in Windows Terminal with the <strong>Command Prompt profile</strong>, available in the new tab dropdown menu.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Windows Console</h4>
<p dir="auto">Textual Paint will <strong>not</strong> work properly with the old Windows console (<code>conhost.exe</code>), which lacks emoji/Unicode support and true color support.
This program is commonly thought of as the "Command Prompt", but the Command Prompt (<code>cmd.exe</code>) is actually a <em>shell</em> (like <code>bash</code>) that can run in either the old console or the new Windows Terminal, which are both <em>terminal emulators</em>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">VS Code</h3>
<p dir="auto">Note that VS Code's integrated terminal tries to fix the contrast of text, including in the canvas, which is entirely inappropriate for an ANSI art editor, as it obscures the colors, and can indeed <em>harm</em> the contrast of the resulting document, by tricking you into thinking there's more contrast than there actually is.</p>
<p dir="auto">To disable this, you can add this to your settings.json:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="&quot;terminal.integrated.minimumContrastRatio&quot;: 1"><pre><span>"terminal.integrated.minimumContrastRatio"</span>: <span>1</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">If this doesn't work, try increasing it to 1.1.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Development</h2>
<p dir="auto">Recommended: first, create a virtual environment:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python -m venv .venv
# The activate script is in different places on different systems:
# Linux/macOS:
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate"><pre>python -m venv .venv
<span><span>#</span> The activate script is in different places on different systems:</span>
<span><span>#</span> Linux/macOS:</span>
<span>source</span> .venv/bin/activate
<span><span>#</span> Windows:</span>
.venv<span>\S</span>cripts<span>\a</span>ctivate</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Install Textual and other dependencies:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="pip install -r requirements.txt"><pre>pip install -r requirements.txt</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Run the app via Textual's CLI for live-reloading CSS support, and enable other development features:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="textual run --dev &quot;src.textual_paint.paint --clear-screen --inspect-layout --restart-on-changes&quot;"><pre>textual run --dev <span><span>"</span>src.textual_paint.paint --clear-screen --inspect-layout --restart-on-changes<span>"</span></span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Or run more basically:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python -m src.textual_paint.paint"><pre>python -m src.textual_paint.paint</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Or install the CLI globally*:</p>

<p dir="auto">Then run:</p>

<p dir="auto">*If you use a virtual environment, it will only install within that environment.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>--clear-screen</code> is useful for development, because it's sometimes jarring or perplexing to see error messages that have actually been fixed, when exiting the program.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>--inspect-layout</code> enables a DOM inspector accessible with F12, which I built. It also lets you apply a rainbow highlight and labels to all ancestors under the mouse with middle click, but this is mostly obsolete/redundant with the DOM inspector now. The labels affect the layout, so you can also hold Ctrl to only colorize, and you can remember how the colors correspond to the labels, to build a mental model of the layout.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>--restart-on-changes</code> automatically restarts the program when any Python files change. This works by the program restarting itself directly. (Programs like <code>modd</code> or <code>nodemon</code> that run your program in a subprocess don't work well with a TUI's escape sequences.)</p>
<p dir="auto">There are also launch tasks configured for VS Code, so you can run the program from the Run and Debug panel.
Note that it runs slower in VS Code's debugger.</p>
<p dir="auto">To see logs, run <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/guide/devtools/#console" rel="nofollow"><code>textual console</code></a> and then run the program via <code>textual run --dev</code>.
This also makes it run slower.</p>
<p dir="auto">Often it's useful to exclude events with <code>textual console -x EVENT</code>.</p>
<details>
<summary>Testing file save/load roundtrip</summary>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">There are at this point lots of files that will change if you run this, so don't worry about it. Some are generated files, so they naturally change somewhat. The <code>0x0.ans</code> file saves as 1x1, due to the minimum size. <code>pathological_character_grid.svg</code> was free-handed with Inkscape, so naturally changes somewhat when re-saving. There may be actual problems, but they're hard to spot in the noise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">To test file encoding, run <code>textual run --dev "src.textual_paint.paint --recode-samples"</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">If there are differences in the ANSI files, you can set up a special diff like this:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git config --local &quot;diff.cat-show-all.textconv&quot; &quot;cat --show-all&quot;"><pre>git config --local <span><span>"</span>diff.cat-show-all.textconv<span>"</span></span> <span><span>"</span>cat --show-all<span>"</span></span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">but you should check that <code>cat --show-all samples/2x2.ans</code> works on your system first.
Also, note that it might not work with your Git GUI of choice; you may need to use the command line.</p>

            <p>As Elixir's Machine Learning (ML) ecosystem grows, many Elixir enthusiasts who wish to adopt the new machine learning libraries in their projects are stuck at a crossroads of wanting to move away from their existing ML stack (typically Python) while not having a clear path of how to do so. I would like to take some time to talk to WHY I believe now is a good time to start porting over Machine Learning code into Elixir, and HOW I went about doing just this for two libraries I wrote: <a href="https://github.com/acalejos/exgboost?ref=thestackcanary.com">EXGBoost</a> (from Python XGBoost) and <a href="https://github.com/acalejos/mockingjay?ref=thestackcanary.com">Mockingjay</a> (from Python Hummingbird).</p>
<h2 id="why-is-python-not-sufficient">Why is Python not Sufficient?</h2>
<p>There's a common saying in programming languages that no language is perfect, but that different languages are suited for different jobs. Languages such as C, Rust, and now even Zig are known for their targeting systems development, while languages such as C++, C#, and Java are more commonly used for application development, and obviously there are the web languages such as JavaScript/TypeScript, PHP, Ruby (on Rails), and more. There are gradations to these rules of course, but more often than not there are good reasons that languages tend to exist within the confines of particular use cases. </p>
<p> Languages such as Elixir and Go tend to be used in large distributed systems because they place an emphasis on having great support for common concurrency patterns, which can come at the cost of supporting other domains. Go, for example, has barely (if any?) support for machine learning libraries, but it's also not trying to cater to that as a target domain. For a long time,e the same could have been said about Elixir, but over the past two or so years, there has been a massive concerted push from the Elixir community to not only have support for machine learning, but to push the envelope with the maintaining state of the art libraries that are beginning to compete with the other dominant machine learning languages - namely Python. </p>
<p>Python has long been the gold standard in the realm of machine learning. The breadth of libraries and the low entry barrier makes Python a great language to work with, but it does create a bit of a bottleneck. Any application that wishes to integrate machine learning has historically had only a couple of options: have a Python component or reach into the underlying libraries that power much of the Python libraries directly. Despite all the good parts of Python I mentioned before, speed and support for concurrency are not on that list. Elixir-Nx is striving to give another option - an option that can take advantage of the native distributed support that Elixir and the BEAM VM have to offer. Nx's <code>Nx.Serving</code> construct is a drop-in solution for serving distributed machine-learning models. </p>
<h2 id="how-to-proceed">How to Proceed</h2>
<p>Sean Moriarity, the co-creator of Nx, creator of Axon, and author of <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/smelixir/machine-learning-in-elixir/?ref=thestackcanary.com">Machine Learning in Elixir</a>, has talked many times about how the initial creation of Nx and Axon involved hours upon hours of reading source code from reference implementations of libraries in Python and C++, namely the Tensorflow source code. While I was writing <a href="https://github.com/acalejos/exgboost?ref=thestackcanary.com">EXGBoost</a> and <a href="https://github.com/acalejos/mockingjay?ref=thestackcanary.com">Mockingjay</a>, much of my time, especially towards the beginning, was spent referencing the Python and C++ implementations of the original libraries.  This builds a great fundamental understanding of the libraries as well as taught me how to identify patterns in Python and C++ and identify the Elixir pattern that could express the same ideas. This skill is invaluable, and the better I got at it the faster I could write. Below is a summary and key takeaways from my process of porting Python / PyTorch to Elixir / Nx. </p>
<h2 id="workflow-overview">Workflow Overview</h2>
<p>Before I get to the examples from the code bases, I would like to briefly explain the high-level cyclical workflow I established while working on this effort, and what I would recommend to anyone pursuing a similar endeavor. </p>
<h3 id="understand-the-macro-system">Understand the Macro System</h3>
<p> Much like how there's a common strategy to reading comprehension which involves reading through the entire document once to get a high-level understanding and then doing subsequent shorter reads to gain more in-depth understanding with the added context of the entire piece, you can consider doing the same when reading code. My first step was to follow the logical flow from the call of <code>hummingbird.ml.convert</code> to the final result. You can use tools such as function tracers and callgraph generators to accelerate this part of the process, or manually trace depending on the extent of the codebase. I felt in my case that it was manageable to trace myself. </p>
<h3 id="read-the-documentation">Read the Documentation</h3>
<p>Once you have a general understanding of the flow and process of the original system, you can start referring to the documentation for some additional context. In my case, this lead me to the academic paper <a href="https://scnakandala.github.io/papers/TR_2020_Hummingbird.pdf?ref=thestackcanary.com"><em>Taming Model Serving Complexity, Performance and Cost: A Compilation to Tensor Computations Approach</em></a><em>, </em>which was the underlying ground work and basis for their implementation. I could write a whole other blog post about the process of transcribing algorithms and code from academic papers and pseudocode, but for now just know that these are some of the most important pieces you can refer to while re-implementing or porting over a piece of source code. </p>
<h3 id="read-the-source-code-in-detail">Read the Source Code in Detail</h3>
<p>This is the point in which you want to disambiguate the higher-level ideas from the first step and really gain a fine, high-resolution understanding of what is happening. There might even be some points in which you need to deconflict the source code with its documentation and/or paper reference. In those cases, the source code almost always wins, and if not, then you likely have a bug report you can file. If you see things you don't fully understand, you don't necessarily need to address it here, but you should make note of it and keep it in mind while working in case new details help resolve it. </p>
<h3 id="implement-the-new-code">Implement the New Code</h3>
<p>At this point, you should feel comfortable enough to start implementing the code. I found this to be a very iterative process, meaning I would think I had a grasp on something, then would start working on implementing it, then would realize I did not understand it as well as I had thought and would work my way back through the previous steps. </p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<h2 id="class-vs-behaviour">Class vs. Behaviour</h2>
<p>As a result of the reading and comprehension I did of the Hummingbird code base, I realized fairly early on that my library was going to have some key differences. One of the main reasons for these differences was the fact that the Hummingbird code base was built as a retroactive library that needed to cater to existing APIs that existed throughout the Python ecosystem. They chose to only add support for converting decision trees according to the SKLearn API. I, conversely, chose to write Mockingjay in such a way that it would be incumbent upon the authors of decision tree libraries to implement a protocol to interface with Mockingjay's <code>convert</code> function. This difference meant that I could establish a <code>Mockingjay.Tree</code> data structure that I would use throughout my library, rather than having to reconstruct tree features from various other APIs as is done in Hummingbird. </p>
<p>Next, Hummingbird approaches its pipeline in a very-object oriented manner, as makes sense when using Python. Here' we are focusing on the implementation of the three decision tree conversion strategies: GEMM, Tree Traversal, and PErfect Tree Traversal.  It implements the following base class for tree conversions as well as Pytorch networks. </p>
<div><p>💡</p><p dir="ltr"><span> Since they're inheriting from </span><code><span>torch.nn.model</span></code><span> they must also implement the </span><code><span>forward</span></code><span> method.</span></p></div>
<pre><code>class AbstracTreeImpl(PhysicalOperator):
    """
    Abstract class definig the basic structure for tree-base models.
    """

    def __init__(self, logical_operator, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(logical_operator, **kwargs)

    @abstractmethod
    def aggregation(self, x):

        Returns:

        """
        pass

class AbstractPyTorchTreeImpl(AbstracTreeImpl, torch.nn.Module):
    """
    Abstract class definig the basic structure for tree-base models implemented in PyTorch.
    """

    def __init__(
        self, logical_operator, tree_parameters, n_features, classes, n_classes, decision_cond="&lt;=", extra_config={}, **kwargs
    ):

            n_classes: The total number of used classes
            decision_cond: The condition of the decision nodes in the x &lt;cond&gt; threshold order. Default '&lt;='. Values can be &lt;=, &lt;, &gt;=, &gt;
        """
        super(AbstractPyTorchTreeImpl, self).__init__(logical_operator, **kwargs)</code></pre>
<p>They then proceed to inherit from these base classes and have different classes for each of the three decision tree strategies as well as their gradient-boosted counterparts, leaving them with three classes for each strategies (1 base class per strategy, 1 for ensemble implementations, and 1 for normal impementations) and nine total classes. </p>
<p>I chose to approach this using a <code>behaviour</code></p>
<pre><code>defmodule Mockingjay.Strategy do
  @moduledoc false
  @type t :: Nx.Container.t()

  @callback init(data :: any(), opts :: Keyword.t()) :: term()
  @callback forward(x :: Nx.Container.t(), term()) :: Nx.Tensor.t()
  ...
end</code></pre>
<p><code>forward</code> will perform setup functionality depending on the strategy and return the parameters that will need to be passed to <code>forward</code> later on. This allows for a very simple top-level api. The whole top-level <code>mockingjay.ex</code> file can fit here:</p>
<pre><code>  def convert(data, opts \\ []) do
    {strategy, opts} = Keyword.pop(opts, :strategy, :auto)

    strategy =
      case strategy do
        :gemm -&gt;
          Mockingjay.Strategies.GEMM

        :tree_traversal -&gt;
          Mockingjay.Strategies.TreeTraversal

        :perfect_tree_traversal -&gt;
          Mockingjay.Strategies.PerfectTreeTraversal

        :auto -&gt;
          Mockingjay.Strategy.get_strategy(data, opts)

        _ -&gt;
          raise ArgumentError,
                "strategy must be one of :gemm, :tree_traversal, :perfect_tree_traversal, or :auto"
      end

    {post_transform, opts} = Keyword.pop(opts, :post_transform, nil)
    state = strategy.init(data, opts)

    fn data -&gt;
      result = strategy.forward(data, state)
      {_, n_trees, n_classes} = Nx.shape(result)

      result
      |&gt; aggregate(n_trees, n_classes)
      |&gt; post_transform(post_transform, n_classes)
    end
  end  </code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the use of a behaviour here allows a strategy-agnostic approach to generating a prediction pipeline. In the object-oriented implementation, each class implements <code>init</code>, <code>forward</code>, <code>aggregate</code>, and <code>post_transform</code>. We get the same result from a functional pipeline approach, where each step generates the needed information as input parameters for the next step. So, instead of storing intermediate results as object properties or values in an object's <strong><code>__dict__</code></strong>, we just pass them along in the pipeline. I would argue this creates a much simpler and easier to follow implementation (but I am also quite biased).</p>
<h2 id="pytorch-to-nx">PyTorch to Nx </h2>
<p>For these examples, we will be looking at porting the implementations of the <code>forward</code> function for the three conversion strategies from Python to Nx.</p>
<h4 id="gemm">GEMM</h4>
<p>Next, let's look at the <code>forward</code> function implementation for GEMM, one of the three conversion strategies. In Hummingbird, they implemented the <code>forward</code> step in the base class for each strategy. So given three GEMM classes with the signatures of <code>GEMMTreeImpl(AbstractPyTorchTreeImpl)</code>, <code>GEMMDecisionTreeImpl(GEMMTreeImpl)</code>, and <code>GEMMGBDTImpl(GEMMTreeImpl)</code>, the <code>forward</code> function is defined in the <code>GEMMTreeImpl</code> class, since both ensemble and non-ensemble decision tree models share the same forward step. </p>
<pre><code>def forward(self, x):
      x = x.t()
      x = self.decision_cond(torch.mm(self.weight_1, x), self.bias_1)
      x = x.view(self.n_trees, self.hidden_one_size, -1)
      x = x.float()

      x = torch.matmul(self.weight_2, x)

      x = x.view(self.n_trees * self.hidden_two_size, -1) == self.bias_2
      x = x.view(self.n_trees, self.hidden_two_size, -1)
      if self.tree_op_precision_dtype == "float32":
          x = x.float()
      else:
          x = x.double()

      x = torch.matmul(self.weight_3, x)
      x = x.view(self.n_trees, self.hidden_three_size, -1)</code></pre>
<p>Now, here is the Nx implementation:</p>
<pre><code>@impl true
  deftransform forward(x, {arg, opts}) do
    opts =
      Keyword.validate!(opts, [
        :condition,
        :n_trees,
        :n_classes,
        :max_decision_nodes,
        :max_leaf_nodes,
        :n_weak_learner_classes,
        :custom_forward
      ])

    _forward(x, arg, opts)
  end

  defnp _forward(x, arg, opts \\ []) do
    %{mat_A: mat_A, mat_B: mat_B, mat_C: mat_C, mat_D: mat_D, mat_E: mat_E} = arg

    condition = opts[:condition]
    n_trees = opts[:n_trees]
    n_classes = opts[:n_classes]
    max_decision_nodes = opts[:max_decision_nodes]
    max_leaf_nodes = opts[:max_leaf_nodes]
    n_weak_learner_classes = opts[:n_weak_learner_classes]

    mat_A
    |&gt; Nx.dot([1], x, [1])
    |&gt; condition.(mat_B)
    |&gt; Nx.reshape({n_trees, max_decision_nodes, :auto})
    |&gt; then(&amp;Nx.dot(mat_C, [2], [0], &amp;1, [1], [0]))
    |&gt; Nx.reshape({n_trees * max_leaf_nodes, :auto})
    |&gt; Nx.equal(mat_D)
    |&gt; Nx.reshape({n_trees, max_leaf_nodes, :auto})
    |&gt; then(&amp;Nx.dot(mat_E, [2], [0], &amp;1, [1], [0]))
    |&gt; Nx.reshape({n_trees, n_weak_learner_classes, :auto})
    |&gt; Nx.transpose()
    |&gt; Nx.reshape({:auto, n_trees, n_classes})
  end
</code></pre>
<p>Do not be distracted by the length of this code snippet, as much of the lines are taken up by validating arguments. Let's look at a more stripped-down version without that:</p>
<pre><code>@impl true
  deftransform forward(x, {arg, opts}) do
    _forward(x, arg, opts)
  end

  defnp _forward(x, arg, opts \\ []) do
    mat_A
    |&gt; Nx.dot([1], x, [1])
    |&gt; condition.(mat_B)
    |&gt; Nx.reshape({n_trees, max_decision_nodes, :auto})
    |&gt; then(&amp;Nx.dot(mat_C, [2], [0], &amp;1, [1], [0]))
    |&gt; Nx.reshape({n_trees * max_leaf_nodes, :auto})
    |&gt; Nx.equal(mat_D)
    |&gt; Nx.reshape({n_trees, max_leaf_nodes, :auto})
    |&gt; then(&amp;Nx.dot(mat_E, [2], [0], &amp;1, [1], [0]))
    |&gt; Nx.reshape({n_trees, n_weak_learner_classes, :auto})
    |&gt; Nx.transpose()
    |&gt; Nx.reshape({:auto, n_trees, n_classes})
  end
</code></pre>
<p>Let's take a look at some obvious difference:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>Nx</code> code does not have to transpose in the first step since <code>Nx.dot/4</code> allows you to specify the contracting axes.</li>
<li>You can use <code>Nx.dot/6</code> to get the same behavior as <code>torch.matmul</code>
<ul>
<li><code>torch.matmul</code> does a lot of wizardry with broadcasting to make this instance work</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We use functions such as <code>Nx.equal</code> to fit into the pipeline rather than using the <code>==</code> oeprator (which would work outside of a pipeline)</li>
<li><code>torch.view</code> is equivalent to <code>Nx.reshape</code></li>
<li><code>Nx</code> uses the <code>:auto</code> atom to where <code>torch</code> uses <code>-1</code> to reference infering the sie of an axis</li>
</ul>

<p>Outside of these differences, the code translates fairly easily. Let's take a look at a bit of a more complex instance.</p>
<h4 id="tree-traversal">Tree Traversal</h4>
<p>Here is the Python implementation:</p>
<pre><code>def _expand_indexes(self, batch_size):
        indexes = self.nodes_offset
        indexes = indexes.expand(batch_size, self.num_trees)
        return indexes.reshape(-1)

def forward(self, x):
        indexes = self.nodes_offset
        indexes = indexes.expand(batch_size, self.num_trees).reshape(-1)

        for _ in range(self.max_tree_depth):
            tree_nodes = indexes
            feature_nodes = torch.index_select(self.features, 0, tree_nodes).view(-1, self.num_trees)
            feature_values = torch.gather(x, 1, feature_nodes)

            thresholds = torch.index_select(self.thresholds, 0, indexes).view(-1, self.num_trees)
            lefts = torch.index_select(self.lefts, 0, indexes).view(-1, self.num_trees)
            rights = torch.index_select(self.rights, 0, indexes).view(-1, self.num_trees)

            indexes = torch.where(self.decision_cond(feature_values, thresholds), lefts, rights).long()
            indexes = indexes + self.nodes_offset
            indexes = indexes.view(-1)

        output = torch.index_select(self.values, 0, indexes).view(-1, self.num_trees, self.n_classes)</code></pre>
<p>And here is the Nx implementation:</p>
<pre><code>defn _forward(x, features, lefts, rights, thresholds, nodes_offset, values, opts \\ []) do
    max_tree_depth = opts[:max_tree_depth]
    num_trees = opts[:num_trees]
    n_classes = opts[:n_classes]
    condition = opts[:condition]
    unroll = opts[:unroll]

    batch_size = Nx.axis_size(x, 0)

    indices =
      nodes_offset
      |&gt; Nx.broadcast({batch_size, num_trees})
      |&gt; Nx.reshape({:auto})

    {indices, _} =
      while {tree_nodes = indices, {features, lefts, rights, thresholds, nodes_offset, x}},
            _ &lt;- 1..max_tree_depth,
            unroll: unroll do
        feature_nodes = Nx.take(features, tree_nodes) |&gt; Nx.reshape({:auto, num_trees})
        feature_values = Nx.take_along_axis(x, feature_nodes, axis: 1)
        local_thresholds = Nx.take(thresholds, tree_nodes) |&gt; Nx.reshape({:auto, num_trees})
        local_lefts = Nx.take(lefts, tree_nodes) |&gt; Nx.reshape({:auto, num_trees})
        local_rights = Nx.take(rights, tree_nodes) |&gt; Nx.reshape({:auto, num_trees})

        result =
          Nx.select(
            condition.(feature_values, local_thresholds),
            local_lefts,
            local_rights
          )
          |&gt; Nx.add(nodes_offset)
          |&gt; Nx.reshape({:auto})

        {result, {features, lefts, rights, thresholds, nodes_offset, x}}
      end

    values
    |&gt; Nx.take(indices)
    |&gt; Nx.reshape({:auto, num_trees, n_classes})
  end</code></pre>
<p>Here there are some much more striking differences, namely the use of <code>Nx</code>'s <code>while</code> expression compared to a <code>for</code> loop in Python. We use <code>while</code> in this case since it can achieve the same purpose as the Python <code>for</code> loop and it is supported by <code>Nx</code> within a <code>defn</code> expression. Otherwise, we might have to perform some of the calculations within a <code>deftransform</code>, as we will see in the next example.  Another obvious difference is that in the Nx implementation, we have to pass the required variables around throughout these operation, whereas Python can use stored class attributes. </p>
<p>Still, the conversion is quite straightforward. I hope you are beginning to see that this is not an impossible effort, and can be accomplished given you have a firm understanding of the source material.</p>
<h4 id="perfect-tree-traversal">Perfect Tree Traversal</h4>
<p>Lastly, let's look at the last conversion strategy. Yet again, this conversion is even slightly more complex, but hopefully seeing this example will help you in your case:</p>
<pre><code>def forward(self, x):
        prev_indices = (self.decision_cond(torch.index_select(x, 1, self.root_nodes), self.root_biases)).long()
        prev_indices = prev_indices + self.tree_indices
        prev_indices = prev_indices.view(-1)

        factor = 2
        for nodes, biases in zip(self.nodes, self.biases):
            gather_indices = torch.index_select(nodes, 0, prev_indices).view(-1, self.num_trees)
            features = torch.gather(x, 1, gather_indices).view(-1)
            prev_indices = (
                factor * prev_indices + self.decision_cond(features, torch.index_select(biases, 0, prev_indices)).long()
            )

        output = torch.index_select(self.leaf_nodes, 0, prev_indices).view(-1, self.num_trees, self.n_classes)
</code></pre>
<p>And the Elixir implementation:</p>
<pre><code>defnp _forward(
          x,
          root_features,
          root_thresholds,
          features,
          thresholds,
          values,
          indices,
          opts \\ []
        ) do
    prev_indices =
      x
      |&gt; Nx.take(root_features, axis: 1)
      |&gt; opts[:condition].(root_thresholds)
      |&gt; Nx.add(indices)
      |&gt; Nx.reshape({:auto})
      |&gt; forward_reduce_features(x, features, thresholds, opts)

    Nx.take(values, prev_indices)
    |&gt; Nx.reshape({:auto, opts[:num_trees], opts[:n_classes]})
  end

  deftransformp forward_reduce_features(prev_indices, x, features, thresholds, opts \\ []) do
    Enum.zip_reduce(
      Tuple.to_list(features),
      Tuple.to_list(thresholds),
      prev_indices,
      fn nodes, biases, acc -&gt;
        gather_indices = nodes |&gt; Nx.take(acc) |&gt; Nx.reshape({:auto, opts[:num_trees]})
        features = Nx.take_along_axis(x, gather_indices, axis: 1) |&gt; Nx.reshape({:auto})

        acc
        |&gt; Nx.multiply(@factor)
        |&gt; Nx.add(opts[:condition].(features, Nx.take(biases, acc)))
      end
    )
  end</code></pre>
<p>You can see that in this case, we have a function defined in a <code>deftransform</code> within our <code>forward</code> pipeline. Why is this so? Well, when writing definitions within <code>defn</code> you forfeit the use of the default Elixir kernel for the <code>Nx.Kernel</code> module. If you want full access to all of the normal Elixir modules, you need to use a <code>deftransform</code>. We needed to use <code>Enum.zip_reduce</code> in this instance (rather than <code>Nx</code>'s <code>while</code> like before) since the <code>features</code> and <code>thresholds</code> lists are not of uniform shape. Their shape represents the length of a given depth of a binary tree, so they will be a nested list of lengths <code>[1,2,4,8...]</code>. This is an optimization as opposed to normal <code>TreeTraversal</code>, but required a bit of a different approach as opposed to the Python implementation which took advantage of <code>torch.nn.ParameterList</code> to build out the same lists. You might also notice the use of <code>Tuple.to_list</code> on lines 25 and 26. This was required since we needed <code>features</code> and <code>thresholds</code> to be stored in <code>Nx.container</code>'s when passed into the <code>deftransform</code>, and <code>Tuple</code> implements the <code>Nx.Container</code> protocol, while lists do not. Even still, given that knowledge of the intricacies of <code>defn</code> and <code>deftransform</code>, the final ported solution is very similar to the reference solution.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this post, I tried to accomplish several things at once, and perhaps that lead to a cluttered article, but I felt the need to address all of these points at once. I do not mean to suggest that Machine Learning has no place in Python or that Python will not continue to be the most dominant player in Machine Learning, but that I think some healthy competition is a good thing, and that perhaps Python does have some shortcomings that might give other languages valid reasons to coexist in the space. </p>
<p>Next, I wanted to address some specifics as to what Elixir has to offer to the machine learning space. I think it is uniquely positioned to be quite competitive considering the large community push to support more and more libraries, as well as the large application development community that can benefit from an in-house solution.</p>
<p>Lastly, I wanted to share some practical tips for those looking to move on from Python to Elixir, but feeling somewhat helpless in the process. I think that Sean Moriarity's book that I mentioned at the beginning of this article is an invaluable resource and great step in the education of machine learning for Elixir developers, but it can nonetheless feel daunting to seemingly throw out existing working solutions for new-fangled, perhaps not as well respected solutions. I hope I showed how anybody can approach this problem, and any existing Elixir developer can be a machine learning developer going forward. The ground work has been laid, and the tools are available. Thank you for reading (especially if you made it to the end)!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    	  
<p>Todd Rundgren, <em>Babylon 5</em>, <em>The X-Files</em>, <em>SeaQuest DSV</em>, and even those demo videos – NewTek’s Video Toaster has plenty of 90s nostalgia behind it. But it also demonstrates workflow features in switching, titling, and animation that could easily inspire streamers today.</p>



<p>Hang on, I was about to start with an intro, but – frankly, I can’t do any better than this Yorkshire Television-produced CITV show Bad Influence!, the answer to the question “what if Computer Chronicles were <em>not</em> made by complete dorks who were apparently trapped in a low-budget PBS studio?” <em>Please</em> read the rest of this article imagining the voices of these two presenters.</p>



<p>“But first have a look at this!” “<em>The AMIIIIGA??!”</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="How CGI was done on TV shows with low cost Amiga! (Babylon 5)" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vO5DYSjyQJA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>That video is doubly significant as it coincides with the native edition of LightWave3D. Also, way to not underestimate your audience or talk down. (Of course you recognize a Vorlon spacecraft already!)</p>



<p>So, a very brief history of the Video Toaster. NewTek founder Tim Jenison loved Vermeer and designed the first edition, with Brad Carvey (who also worked on <em>Men In Black</em> VFX) building the prototype. Announced in 1987, the first edition was a US$2399 Amiga add-on – an insanely low price given six-digit costs of broadcast rigs at the time. (Even in 2023 dollars, that’s only $5,470.53, or roughly the price of a set of Apple Pro wheels and a video cable or whatever.) You would need an Amiga 2000, but even that was not a wildly expensive machine at the time.</p>



<p>Oh yeah, bonus – the Amiga’s system clock ran conveniently at double the NTSC color carrier frequency for easy sync. And the Amiga’s innovative on-board graphics chipset helped, too.</p>



<p>The Video Toaster was a complete bundle: a full-sized card to add video connections, a real-time four-channel video switcher, a bundled LightWave 3D modeling / rendering / animation package, frame buffer-based effects, character generation, overlays, animated transitions – the works. It was the 90s, so you’d need some video tape recorders and a controller since all this beauty would be going to video tape. But this more than any other invention democratized visual effects and made them mainstream not just for high-budget films, but for television, as well. (And keep in mind that Steve Jobs at the time was still trying to sell Pixar’s Image Computer, with complete rigs running more into the six-digit territory again.)</p>



<p>Eventually, you could buy complete ready-to-play rigs for around US$5000, the likes of NBC popularized usage, Wil Wheaton (yeah, <em>that</em> Wil Wheaton) signed on as a technology evangelist and consultant, and LightWave 3D had a life of its own as a standalone system.</p>



<p>Ars Technica’s Jeremy Reimer wrote a beautiful history of the Amiga and dedicated a chapter to the Video Toaster:</p>



<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/03/a-history-of-the-amiga-part-9-the-video-toaster/">A history of the Amiga, part 9: The Video Toaster</a></p>



<p>Want some video artifacts of this age? Oh, does YouTube ever have you covered.</p>



<p>First, for peak 90s, you’ve got to have Todd Rundgren’s “Change Myself” video, which definitely seems like it was just a Video Toaster demo more than something with a … concept. (Clocks. A stop light. Todd as a leaf and a crude boat sail. A chess board. Uh, sperm? Did someone just try to literally interpret every line?)</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="NewTek - Video Toaster Demo - Todd Rundgren &quot;Change Myself&quot;" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ee8MlDm01Fk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>How did it come together? Well, actually, we can ask 1991 Todd Rundgren for the accurate answer to that at SIGGRAPH, which awesomely was hosted by Pasadena’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="1991 - Todd Rundgren Details How He Created His Groundbreaking 'Change Myself' Music Video" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jhs24mL8Lx0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Amiga’s own promo videos are wonderful 90s ephemera on their own, even if they seem to have been directed by straight teenage boys. (“I want jet planes, and some girls in swimsuits, and UFOs, and skateboards, and football!”) Wil Wheaton, Penn Jillette, and Tony Hawk all make the 1994 video.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Then there’s this wonderful launch video, with a voice that is both somehow dramatically epic and … like way sexier than you’d expect. (<em>Toaster Paint</em>. <em>Oh yeah.</em>) It does do a great job of explaining the technological capabilities and their implications in simple terms. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Honestly, jokes aside, how is this demo video so much better than the corporate snooze-fest of the new Apple, Google, and Microsoft presentations? It’s like everyone had their souls removed through their nose sometime in the early 2000s. Let’s fix this, people.</p>



<p>NewTek is also famous for their long-time spokeperson and technology evangelist, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiki_Stockhammer">Kiki Stockhammer</a>. Kiki also had a driving role inside the company, and is legendary for her ability to deliver product pitches even off-script. She’s probably one of the greatest tech spokespeople of all time. She’s still doing this sort of work today (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iIGXVnPMPE">recent video</a>), and basically <em>any</em> of us working tech ought to follow her and take some notes. Also – here’s one thing Steve Jobs never did. It’s actually her silhouette in the Video Toaster’s transitions, as this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUrj-h3GejA">behind-the-scenes shoot proves</a>. She’s the literal face (and shadow) of Video Toaster through its whole history.</p>



<p>She has enough of a fanbase that there’s even this extended-length documentary, with some, uh, kinda questionable camera work for the host (the dude who is <em>not</em> Stockhammer), but let’s do this!</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Kiki Stockhammer: The Original E-Girl" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iufe0RmHIqQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Here’s the story in her own words, in a 2022 talk:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Stockhammer at the  Amiwest Show 2022" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6iIGXVnPMPE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>But look – the Video Toaster is good enough that people are using it now. Here’s a walkthrough from March 2020 (ooh, good timing, you’re about to be doing a lot of streaming).</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="NewTek Video Toaster General Overview Demo on Commodore Amiga" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6yFdaCmRkBk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>I think my favorite Video Toaster-produced video is this 1993 one hosted by Wil Wheaton himself:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Beyond The Edge Hosted by Wil Wheaton. Video by NewTek for their Video Toaster for Commodore Amiga" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KGuuXGYFmY0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>And then there’s <em>Babylon 5</em>. Those effects looked a little crude, then really crude, and now… kind of weirdly cool and artistic and ahead of their time. (The show’s approach to real-physics spacecraft maneuvers and modeling came to influence later TV like the 2000s reboot of <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>, which also used LightWave 3D. There is even a Babylon 5 station model tucked into an early scene in the escaping fleet.)</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The Amiga didn’t last past the pilot (see intro here, complete with <em>very</em> different Stewart Copeland music), but LightWave 3D did. A 1997 interview with coproducer George Johnsen details their rig. Before I start a 90s-style Amiga-versus-Mac-versus-PC argument, yeah, they used basically every platform available at the time. </p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Are Macintoshes used in the production?</em></p>



<p>Even though the Joe uses “another” platform, the show actually uses many! Macs have been essential to the creation of the show from the beginning. Even farther back, the Amiga and the Newtek Toaster were employed.</p>



<p>Currently we use Pentiums and Alphas for animation, Macs for Editing, Matte paintings and Compositing, and SGI’s for Compositing and titling. If that isn’t platform independent, I don’t know what is! The arsenal looks like the following-</p>



<p>Alphas for design stations serving 5 animators and one animation assistant (housekeeping and slate specialist). Most of these stations run Lightwave and a couple add Softimage. VERY plug-in hungry. PVR’s on every station, with calibrated component NTSC (darn it, I hates ntsc) right beside.</p>



<p>P6’s in quad enclosures for part of the renderstack, and Alphas for the rest, backed up 2x per day to an optical jukebox.Todd Rund</p>



<p>Completed shots output to a DDR post rendering and get integrated into the show.</p>



<p>Shots to composite go to the Macs running After Effects, or the SGI running Flint, depending on the type of comp being done, and then to the DDR (8 minutes capacity on the SGI).</p>



<p>Boy it sure sounds easy! The only problem is, we have a killer schedule and very picky producers, and ESPECIALLY picky viewers! 🙂</p>



<p>It is, however, a bunch of fun!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Actually using the tool was of course far less glamorous, as Computer Chronicles demonstrated in an early demo in 1988. But it’s still stunning, even there:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Amiga Video Toaster - Computer Chronicles (1988) | Early Computer Video Editing &amp; Video Production" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7qCYr0fPqCI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>But these easy switching, transition, and titling tools – even if the aesthetic is dated now – could sure come in handy in 2020s software. I do hope developers look back at some of the analog-era stuff. We’ve lost a lot of the directness and immediacy of some of the hardware and software of the time. (I hated VHS for its never-ending degradation, but wow, was it easy to use a physical jog wheel on a two-deck controller – for one example. And of course, people still use Edirol-now-Roland V4s.)</p>



<p>OBS, I’m looking at you.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Tons of musicians are now using trackers and other Amiga-era music tools who never had access to them – or weren’t even born yet – in the 90s. So maybe it’s time for some of the visual ideas of the Amiga to get a reboot, too.</p>



<p>For more on that musical history, see the last CDM Amiga flashback:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>And yeah, I never get tired of watching Andy Warhol and Debbie Harry at the 1985 debut of the platform:</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Oh, and one more bonus – speaking of Wil Wheaton, here he is telling a little girl how to deal with being called a nerd. (I’m… guessing if you’re at this point in <em>this</em> article, this is probably relevant.)</p>



<figure><p>

          <p dir="auto">Mozilla opposes this proposal because it contradicts our principles and vision for the Web.</p>
<p dir="auto">Any browser, server, or publisher that implements common standards is <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/webvision/full/#openness" rel="nofollow">automatically part of the Web</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Standards themselves aim to avoid assumptions about the underlying hardware or software that might restrict where they can be deployed. This means that no single party decides which form-factors, devices, operating systems, and browsers may access the Web. It gives people more choices, and thus more avenues to overcome personal obstacles to access. Choices in assistive technology, localization, form-factor, and price, combined with thoughtful design of the standards themselves, all permit a wildly diverse group of people to reach the same Web.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Mechanisms that attempt to restrict these choices are harmful to the openness of the Web ecosystem and are not good for users.</p>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, the use cases listed depend on the ability to “detect non-human traffic” which as described would likely obstruct many existing uses of the Web such as assistive technologies, automatic testing, and archiving &amp; search engine spiders. These depend on tools being able to receive content intended for humans, and then transform, test, index, and summarize that content for humans. The safeguards in the proposal (e.g., “holdback”, or randomly failing to produce an attestation) are unlikely to be effective, and are inadequate to address these concerns.</p>
<p dir="auto">Detecting fraud and invalid traffic is a challenging problem that we're interested in helping address. However this proposal does not explain how it will make practical progress on the listed use cases, and there are clear downsides to adopting it.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>For 20 years,</span> the only way to really communicate privately was to use a widely hated piece of software called Pretty Good Privacy. The software, known as PGP, aimed to make secure communication accessible to the lay user, but it was so poorly designed that even Edward Snowden messed up his first attempt to use PGP to email a friend of Laura Poitras. It also required its users to think like engineers, which included participating in exceptionally nerdy activities like attending real-life “key-signing parties” to verify your identity to other users. Though anyone could technically use PGP, the barrier to entry was so high that only about 50,000 people used it at its peak, meaning that privacy itself was out of reach for most.</p><p>These days, to talk to a friend securely, all you have to do is download a free app. For a certain set, that app will be Signal. Snowden and Elon Musk have recommended it; it’s been name-dropped on big-budget shows like <em>House of Cards, Mr. Robot,</em> and <em>Euphoria,</em> and its users include journalists, members of the White House, NBA players, Black Lives Matters activists, and celebrities trying to get their hands on Ozempic. Its founder has been profiled by <em>The New Yorker</em> and appeared on Joe Rogan’s podcast. A tiny organization with virtually no marketing budget has become synonymous with digital privacy in the public imagination.</p><p>Technology can be deeply shaped by the personal inclinations of a founder. Facebook’s light-fingeredness with user data is inseparable from its roots in Zuckerberg’s dorm room as an app for ranking women by their looks; Apple’s minimalist design was influenced by Jobs’ time spent practicing Zen Buddhism. Signal is no different. During its formative years, the charismatic face of Signal was Moxie Marlinspike, a dreadlocked anarchist who spent his time sailing around the world, living in punk houses, and serving free food to the unhoused. He led every aspect of Signal’s development for almost a decade, <a data-offer-url="https://signal.org/blog/new-year-new-ceo/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://signal.org/blog/new-year-new-ceo/&quot;}" href="https://signal.org/blog/new-year-new-ceo/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">at one point complaining</a>, &nbsp;“I was writing all the Android code, was writing all of the server code, was the only person on call for the service, was facilitating all product development, and was managing everyone. I couldn’t ever leave cell service.”</p><p>In the field of cryptography, Marlinspike is considered the driving force behind bringing end-to-end encryption—the technology underlying Signal—to the real world. In 2017, Marlinspike and his collaborator, Trevor Perrin, received the Levchin Prize, a prominent prize for cryptographers, for their work on the Signal Protocol. Afterward, Dan Boneh, the Stanford professor who chaired the award committee, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/10/26/taking-back-our-privacy">commented</a> that he wasn’t sure that end-to-end encryption would have become widespread without Marlinspike’s work. At the very least, “it would have taken many more decades,” he said.</p><p>The motivations that led to end-to-end encryption going mainstream lie far out on the political fringe. The original impetus for Marlinspike’s entry into cryptography, around 2007, was to challenge existing power structures, particularly the injustice of how (as he put it) “Internet insecurity is used by people I don’t like against people I do: the government against the people.” But sticking to anarchism would imply an almost certain defeat. As Marlinspike once <a data-offer-url="https://moxie.org/stories/promise-defeat/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://moxie.org/stories/promise-defeat/&quot;}" href="https://moxie.org/stories/promise-defeat/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">noted</a>, the “trail of ideas that disappears into the horizon behind me is completely and utterly mined over with failures … Anarchists are best known for their failures.”</p><p>For an idealistic engineer to succeed, he will have to build something that is useful to many. So there has also been an unusually pragmatic bent to Signal’s approach. Indeed, in many interviews, Marlinspike has taken a mainstream stance, insisting that “Signal is just trying to bring normality to the internet.” Signal’s success depends on maintaining its principled anarchist commitments while finding a wide-ranging appeal to the masses, two goals that might seem at odds. Examining how the app navigates this tension can help us understand what might come next in Signal’s new quest to reach “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23409716/signal-encryption-messaging-sms-meredith-whittaker-imessage-whatsapp-china">everyone on the planet.</a>”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>Released after WhatsApp</span> &nbsp;set the standards for messaging, Signal’s problem has always been how to keep up with its competition—a fine dance between mimicry (so as to seem familiar to new users) and innovation (to poach users from its competitors). Signal started off by copying WhatsApp's user experience, while at the same time pioneering end-to-end encryption, a feature that WhatsApp turned around and copied from Signal. Throughout this evolutionary dance, Signal has managed to maintain an unusual focus on the autonomy of the individual, a wariness of state authority, and an aversion to making money, characteristics that are recognizably anarchist.</p><p>Because a small fringe of cypherpunks, Marlinspike included, came to see cryptography as a way to remedy the imbalance of power between the individual and the state, Signal focused on getting end-to-end encryption on messages and calls absolutely right. With Signal, no one can read your messages. Amazon can’t, the US government can’t, Signal can’t. The same is true for voice calls and metadata: A user’s address book and group chat titles are just as safe. Signal knows basically nothing about you, other than your phone number (which is not mapped to your username), the time you created your account, and the time you last used the app. Your data can’t be sold to others or cause ads to follow you around on the internet. Using Signal is just like talking with your friend in the kitchen.</p><p>Because Signal is committed to retaining as little metadata as possible, that makes it hard for it to implement new features that are standard to other apps. Signal is essentially footing the cost of this commitment in engineer-hours, since implementing popular features like group chats, address books, and stickers all required doing novel research in cryptography. That Signal built them anyway is a testament to its desire for mass appeal.</p><p>Signal also pioneered features that gave individuals more autonomy over their information, such as disappearing messages (which WhatsApp later adopted) and a feature that let users blur faces in a photo (which it rapidly rolled out to support the Black Lives Matter protests). At the same time, Signal has garnered users' trust because its code is open source, so that security researchers can verify that its end-to-end encryption is as strong as the organization claims.</p><p>For the ordinary user, though, individual autonomy and privacy may not be as important. On WhatsApp, users accept that it will be very hard to figure out what exactly the app knows about you and who it might be shared with. Users’ information is governed by an ever-shifting labyrinth of grudging caveats and clauses like “we will share your transaction data and IP address with Facebook” and “we can’t see your precise location, but we’ll still try to estimate it as best as we can” and “we <em>will</em> find out if you click on a WhatsApp share button on the web.” WhatsApp is also closed-source, so its code can’t be audited. If using Signal is like talking in a friend’s kitchen, using WhatsApp is like meeting at a very loud bar—your conversation is safe, but you’re exposed, and you’ll have to pay for your place.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>If you’re not an anarchist, you may be less worried about a shadowy state and more worried about actual people you know. People in your community might be harassing you in a group chat, an abusive ex might be searching your chats for old photos to leak, or your child might have gotten access to your unlocked phone. WhatsApp’s features better support a threat model that is sensitive to interpersonal social dynamics: You can leave groups silently, block screenshots for view-once messages, and lock specific chats. WhatsApp can even view the text of end-to-end encrypted messages that have been reported by a user for moderation, whereas Signal has no moderation at all.</p><p>Idealists have called centralization one of the main ills of the internet because it locks users into walled gardens controlled by authoritarian companies. In a great stroke of pragmatism, Signal chose to be centralized anyway. Other encrypted-messaging apps like Matrix offer a federated model akin to email, in which users across different servers can still communicate through a shared protocol. (Someone on Gmail can still email someone on Yahoo, whereas someone on Facebook Messenger can’t contact someone on Signal.) This federated approach more closely mirrors anarchy; it could theoretically be better, because there would be no single point of failure and no single service provider for a government to pressure. But federated software creates a proliferation of different clients and servers for the same protocol, making it hard to upgrade. Users are already used to centralized apps that behave like Facebook or Twitter, and email has already become centralized into a few main service providers. It turns out that being authoritarian is important for maintaining a consistent user experience and a trusted brand, and for rolling out software updates quickly. Even anarchism has its limits.</p><p><span>What Signal has</span> accomplished so far is impressive. But users famously judge software not on how much it can do, but on how much it can’t. In that spirit, it’s time to complain.</p><p>Because of Signal’s small team, limited funding, and the challenges of implementing features under end-to-end encryption, the app bafflingly lacks a number of important features. It doesn’t have encrypted backups for iOS; messages can only be transferred between phones. If you lose your iPhone, you lose all your Signal chat history.</p><p>Signal also doesn’t do a good job serving some of its core users. Activists and organizers deal with huge amounts of messages that involve many people and threads, but Signal’s interface lacks ways to organize all this information. These power users’ group chats become so unwieldy that they migrate to Slack, losing the end-to-end encryption that brought them to Signal in the first place. It’s common to try and make multiple group chats between the same people to manage all their threads. When users are hacking “desire paths” into your interface to create a new feature, or leaving because of the lack of the feature, that’s a strong hint that something is missing.</p><p>WhatsApp and Telegram, on the other hand, are leading the way on defining how group chats can scale up. WhatsApp “communities” gather different private group chats in one place, better mimicking the organization of a neighborhood or school that may be discussing several things at once. Telegram’s social media “channel” features are better for broadcasting info en masse, though Telegram’s lack of moderation has been blamed for attracting the kind of fringe crowd that has been banned from all other platforms.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>It's no exaggeration</span> to say that small features in a chat app encode different visions of how society should be organized. If the first reacji in the palette was a thumbs down rather than a heart, maybe we would all be more negative, cautious people. What kind of social vision did Signal arise from?</p><p>“Looking back, I and everyone I knew was looking for that secret world hidden in this one,” Marlinspike admitted in a 2016 <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/07/meet-moxie-marlinspike-anarchist-bringing-encryption-us/">interview</a>. A key text in anarchist theory describes the idea of a “temporary autonomous zone,” a place of short-term freedom where people can experiment with new ways to live together outside the confines of current social norms. Originally coined to describe “pirate utopias” that may be apocryphal, the term has <a data-offer-url="https://www.documentjournal.com/2020/08/better-living-through-anarchy-tracking-the-rise-of-the-temporary-autonomous-zone/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.documentjournal.com/2020/08/better-living-through-anarchy-tracking-the-rise-of-the-temporary-autonomous-zone/&quot;}" href="https://www.documentjournal.com/2020/08/better-living-through-anarchy-tracking-the-rise-of-the-temporary-autonomous-zone/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">since been used</a> to understand the life and afterlife of real-world DIY spaces like communes, raves, seasteads, and protests. And Signal is, unmistakably, a temporary autonomous zone that Marlinspike has spent almost a decade building.</p><p>Because temporary autonomous zones create spaces for the radical urges that society represses, they keep life in the daytime more stable. They can sometimes make money in the way that nightclubs and festivals do. But temporary autonomous zones are temporary for a reason. Over and over, zone denizens make the same mistake: They can’t figure out how to interact productively with the wider society. The zone often runs out of money because it exists in a world where people need to pay rent. Success is elusive; when a temporary autonomous zone becomes compelling enough to threaten daytime stability, it may be violently repressed. Or the attractive freedoms offered by the zone may be taken up in a milder form by the wider society, and eventually the zone ceases to exist because its existence has pressured wider society to be a little more like it. What kind of end might Signal come to?</p><p>There are reasons to think that Signal may not be around for very long. The nonprofit’s blog, meant to convince us of the elite nature of its engineers, has the unintentional effect of conveying the incredible difficulty of building any new software feature under end-to-end encryption. Its team numbers roughly 40; Marlinspike has just <a data-offer-url="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1669374296785928193" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1669374296785928193&quot;}" href="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1669374296785928193" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">left the organization</a>. Achieving impossible feats may be fun for a stunt hacker with something to prove, but competing with major tech companies’ engineering teams may not be sustainable for a small nonprofit with Marlinspike no longer at the helm.</p><p>Fittingly for an organization formerly led by an anarchist, Signal lacks a sustainable business model, to the point where you might almost call it anti-capitalist. It has survived so far in ways that don’t seem replicable, and that may alienate some users. Signal is largely funded by a big loan from a WhatsApp founder, and that loan has already grown to $100 million. It has also accepted funding from the US government through the Open Technology Fund. Because Signal can’t sell its users’ data, it has recently begun developing a business model based on directly providing services to users and encouraging them to donate to Signal in-app. But to get enough donations, the nonprofit must grow from 40 million users to 100 million. The company’s aggressive pursuit of growth, coupled with lack of moderation in the app, has already led Signal employees themselves to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22249391/signal-app-abuse-messaging-employees-violence-misinformation">publicly question</a> whether growth might come from abusive users, such as far-right groups using Signal to organize.</p><p>But there are also reasons for hope. So far, the most effective change that Signal has created is arguably not the existence of the app itself, but making it easy for WhatsApp to bring Signal-style end-to-end encryption to billions of users. Since WhatsApp’s adoption, Facebook Messenger, Google’s Android Messages, and Microsoft’s Skype have all adopted the open source Signal Protocol, though in milder forms, as the history of temporary autonomous zones would have us guess. Perhaps the existence of the Signal Protocol, coupled with demand from increasingly privacy-conscious users, will encourage better-funded messaging apps to compete against each other to be as encrypted as possible. Then Signal would no longer need to exist. (In fact, this resembles Signal’s original theory of change, before they decided they would rather compete with mainstream tech companies.)</p><p>Now, as the era of the global watercooler ends, small private group chats are becoming the future of social life on the internet. Signal started out a renegade, a pirate utopia encircled by cryptography, but the mainstream has become—alarmingly quickly—much closer to the vision Signal sought. In one form or another, its utopia just might last.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

Kxlider is a musician, and X is a social media company.</p><p>“The question there would be, is Twitter stepping on his toes in terms of his business?” Kattwinkel said. “The courts would look into: is Twitter doing anything in the music scene or anything that’s likely to encroach on what he's been doing all along? Probably not, but stranger things have happened in the courts.”</p><p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=joel+rothman+miami&amp;oq=joel+rothman+miami&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j33i160l3.3018j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joel Rothman</a>, a Miami lawyer who specializes in intellectual property infringement, told The Messenger that font producers usually protect their creations not through any copyright laws but through terms of service that restrict what users can do with them based on the license agreement.&nbsp;</p><p>"The use of a single letter is typically not prohibited, necessarily, by those agreements. Rather, it's the distribution of the entire font family,” Rothman said. Whether or not using single letter as a logo would be a violation would depend on the exact terms of the agreement —&nbsp;but again, that appears not to be a potential problem.</p><figure><p><span><img alt="A worker removes letters from the Twitter sign that is posted on the exterior of Twitter headquarters on July 24, 2023 in San Francisco, California." sizes="100vw" srcset="https://themessenger.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcms.themessenger.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F07%2FGettyImages-1568024962-1024x683.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 640w, https://themessenger.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcms.themessenger.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F07%2FGettyImages-1568024962-1024x683.jpg&amp;w=750&amp;q=75 750w, https://themessenger.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcms.themessenger.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F07%2FGettyImages-1568024962-1024x683.jpg&amp;w=828&amp;q=75 828w, https://themessenger.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcms.themessenger.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F07%2FGettyImages-1568024962-1024x683.jpg&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1080w, https://themessenger.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcms.themessenger.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F07%2FGettyImages-1568024962-1024x683.jpg&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75 1200w, https://themessenger.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcms.themessenger.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F07%2FGettyImages-1568024962-1024x683.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1920w, https://themessenger.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcms.themessenger.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F07%2FGettyImages-1568024962-1024x683.jpg&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 2048w, https://themessenger.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcms.themessenger.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F07%2FGettyImages-1568024962-1024x683.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 3840w" src="https://themessenger.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcms.themessenger.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F07%2FGettyImages-1568024962-1024x683.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" loading="lazy" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p><figcaption><span>A worker removes letters from the Twitter sign that is posted on the exterior of Twitter headquarters on July 24, 2023 in San Francisco, California.</span><span>Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>A Brand Problem?</strong></p><p>Rather, the biggest obstacle in the way of Twitter's rebrand may be the fact that both Microsoft and Meta hold trademarks on the use of the letter X as a brand identity used for social media and communications purposes.&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft’s trademark application on the brand mark 'X' was filed <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=76041368&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all the way back in 2003</a> and last renewed on July 18, 2023.</p><p>In the application, Microsoft stated the X branding would be used for “interactive multiplayer game services for games played over computer networks and global communications networks; providing computer games and video games downloadable over computer global communications networks; providing information on the video game and computer game industries via the Internet; and providing information on computer games, video games, video game consoles and accessories therefor via the Internet.”</p><p>For context, a <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn76041368&amp;docId=SPE20221228152814&amp;linkId=3#docIndex=2&amp;page=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">document</a> filed in December in support of the trademark branding was an advertisement for Xbox Community services.&nbsp;</p><p>Meta’s trademark <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=87980831&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=statusSearch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">use on 'X,'</a> which includes initial documentation from <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn87980831&amp;docId=RFA20190508154130&amp;linkId=31#docIndex=30&amp;page=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft filed in 2017</a>, is more encompassing.</p><p>The trademark 'X,' which is stylized as a white and blue symbol, is trademarked to brand a wide array of uses, including but not limited to streaming of video and audio content, “providing online forums for transmission of messages among computer users," and "providing internet chat rooms."

            <p>
      
      RNA editing, a post-transcriptional process, allows the diversification of proteomes beyond the genomic blueprint; however it is infrequently used among animals for this purpose. Recent reports suggesting increased levels of RNA editing in squids thus raise the question of the nature and effects of these events. We here show that RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites. Editing is enriched in the nervous system, affecting molecules pertinent for excitability and neuronal morphology. The genomic sequence flanking editing sites is highly conserved, suggesting that the process confers a selective advantage. Due to the large number of sites, the surrounding conservation greatly reduces the number of mutations and genomic polymorphisms in protein-coding regions. This trade-off between genome evolution and transcriptome plasticity highlights the importance of RNA recoding as a strategy for diversifying proteins, particularly those associated with neural function.

    <p><b>(A)</b> The species studied span the cephalopod evolutionary tree, as well as sea hare (<i>Aplysia californica</i>) as an outgroup (top). For comparison, a representative tree for vertebrates is shown (bottom), constructed based on divergence times estimated in (Hedges et al., 2006). <b>(B)</b> Tens-thousands of A-to-I editing sites (identified as A-to-G DNA-RNA mismatches) are detected in squid, sepia and the two octopus species (see Tables S1–S4 for more details). The noise level (estimated by the number of G-to-A mismatches) is rather low. In contrast, in nautilus and sea hare no enrichment of A-to-G mismatches is observed (inset). <b>(C)</b> The nucleotides neighboring the detected editing sites, show a clear pattern consistent with known ADAR preference (Alon et al., 2015; Eggington et al., 2011; Kleinberger and Eisenberg, 2010) for the extensively recoded coleoid species – squid, sepia, and the two octopus species – but not in nautilus or sea hare. The motif is characterized by under-representation of G upstream to the editing site (relative location −1) and over-representation of G in the downstream base (The height of the entire stack of letters represents the information content in bits, the relative height of each letter represents its frequency).</p>

      Figure 2. Proteomic validation of recoding by RNA editing
    </strong>
  

  
    <p>We analyzed peptides identified by mass spectrometry analysis of two squid tissues, looking for evidence of recoding. For each site covered by one or more peptides, we marked whether the edited, non-edited or both versions of the peptide are observed. The distribution is presented, binned by the predicted RNA editing level (as measured from RNA-seq data). In parentheses are the numbers of recoding sites analyzed in each editing-level bin. The proteomic recoding level follows closely the predicted RNA editing level. Altogether, this experiment validated protein recoding in 432 sites in two tissues: <b>(A)</b> Squid stellate ganglion, where 320 of the 3,204 single-site peptides (10.0%) were shown to be edited. <b>(B)</b> Squid giant axon (giant fiber lobe), where 283 of the 2,741 single-site peptides (10.3%) were shown to be edited.</p>

      Figure 3. Editing in Octopus bimaculoides
    </strong>
  

  
    <p><b>(A)</b> A-to-I editing sites were found within coding sequences of <i>Octopus bimaculoides</i> using three methods: the genome-free method (alignment to de-novo transcriptome), the genome-dependent approach using REDItools (Picardi and Pesole, 2013), and identification of hyper-edited reads (Porath et al., 2014). Overall, the three methods identified 170,825 unique AG sites in <i>Octopus bimaculoides</i> coding sequences (38,066 hyper-editing sites do not overlap those found by the other methods). See <b>Methods</b> for analysis of the differences between the results of the first two methods. <b>(B)</b> RNA editing levels, measured across the whole transcriptome (see Table S5) by the editing index (weighted average of editing levels over all editing sites identified in the transcriptome, see <b>Methods</b>). Levels vary across tissues and are highest for neural tissues (see Table S6). Unlike mammals, a sizable fraction of editing events (11–13% in neural tissues) results in recoding events. Annotation of transcripts and repeats is based on (Albertin et al., 2015). (CNS= central nervous system; ANC=Axial nerve cord; OL=Optic Lobe; Sub=Subesophageal ganglia; Supra=Supraesophageal ganglia; PSG=posterior salivary gland; ST15=stage 15 embryo) <b>(C)</b> The number of editing sites in coding region is comparable to the number found in introns. <b>(D</b>) Unlike the case in mammals, editing is not exceptionally enriched in specific repeat families in <i>Octopus bimaculoides</i>, as measured by the editing index (here defined as the editing level averaged over all, edited and unedited, adenosines in each specific repeat family). <b>(E)</b> Protocadherins is a gene family known to be principally expressed in the brain, important for mediating combinatorial complexity in neuronal connections and are thought to play a role in diversifying neural circuitry (Chen and Maniatis, 2013). It was impressively expanded in <i>Octopus bimaculoides</i> (Albertin et al., 2015). A large number of protocadherins are found in the assembled transcriptomes for the four coleoid species (127–251 open reading frames), but not in nautilus (28 open reading frames). <b>(F–G)</b> Protocadherins contain significantly higher numbers of AG sites <b>(F)</b> and are edited at higher levels (editing level summed over all sites and normalized by ORF length), in all four coleoid species but not in nautilus <b>(G)</b>.</p>

    <strong>
      Figure 4. Extensive recoding is conserved across coleoid cephalopods
    </strong>
  

  
    <p><b>(A)</b> Tens-thousands sites are conserved across species (see Table S7). The closer the species are evolutionarily, the higher the number of conserved sites. <b>(B)</b> Virtually all (97.5–99%) mismatches conserved across species are A-to-G, resulting from A-to-I editing. Manual inspection of the few non-A-to-G mismatches appearing in multiple species suggests that they either result from systematic erroneous alignments, or they are actually editing sites that were mistakenly identified as G-to-A mismatches due to insufficient DNA coverage. <b>(C)</b> The majority of editing sites is conserved between the two octopus species, and even the most distant species share a sizable fraction of their sites. <b>(D)</b> In contrast, only 36 human recoding sites (1–2% of human recoding sites) are shared by mouse, and a similar number is shared between <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> and <i>D. mojavensis</i> (Yu et al., 2016) (diverged at later times than squid-sepia). <b>(E)</b> Interestingly, 1146 AG modification sites (in 443 proteins) are conserved and shared by all four coleoid cephalopod species. Of these, 887 are recoding sites and 705 are highly edited (&gt;=10% editing) recoding sites (in 393 proteins). <b>(F)</b> Some proteins include multiple highly-edited recoding sites (see Table S8). Of note are Uromodulin, α Spectrin (previously reported to harbor the highest number of recoding sites in squid (Alon et al., 2015)), and Calcium-dependent secretion activator 1 (CAPS1) with 14, 8 and 7 strong shared recoding sites, respectively. Recoding in CAPS1 was found to be conserved in vertebrate species from human to zebrafish (Li et al., 2009). <b>(G)</b> Not only are the locations of editing sites conserved, but their editing levels are correlated as well. Editing levels in 887 recoding sites shared by all species are highly, positively and significantly correlated in all pairs of coleoid cephalopod species (p&lt;1e–75 for all pairs; see Supp. Fig. 1 for three additional pairs). Correlation is higher the closer the species are to each other in evolutionary terms, with Pearson rho = 0.95 for the two octopus species.</p>

      Figure 5. Signs for positive selection of recoding by editing
    </strong>
  

  
    <p><b>(A)</b> The fraction of recoding sites among all editing sites in coding region increases with editing levels (top), as well as the fraction of recoding sites among all conserved sites (bottom). Red horizontal dashed line represents the recoding fraction expected assuming neutrality. <b>(B)</b> Editing levels are higher in conserved recoding sites. Distributions of editing levels in four groups of putative A-to-I editing sites: recoding and conserved (Rec+, Cons+), recoding and non-conserved (Rec+, Cons−), conserved sites that cause a synonymous change (Rec−, Cons+), and non-conserved synonymous sites (Rec−, Cons−). Horizontal red lines mark the median level, and yellow diamonds mark the mean. Conservation and non-synonymity are both positively correlated with higher editing levels, as well as their interaction (ANOVA, p-value&lt;1.0e–162). Data presented here for squid (conserved sites are conserved in sepia), but the results are similar and significant for all species. <b>(C)</b> In contrast with the case in humans, highly edited sites tend to be more conserved: the fraction of conserved sites rises with the editing level for all species pairs, but more dramatically for the closely related octopuses and the sepia-squid pair. <b>(D)</b> Highly conserved regions of the transcriptome are enriched in editing sites, further attesting for positive selection of RNA editing. Density of editing sites (number of AG sites normalized by length) is higher for 112 recoding regions that are highly-conserved across the four species (&gt;95% identity; average length 1382bp), compared with all other, less conserved, regions (Wilcoxon p-value&lt;0.001 for all species). Error bars represent the S.E.M.</p>

    <p>Unedited (wt) and singly-edited versions of the voltage-dependent K<sup>+</sup> channels of the K<sub>v</sub>2 subfamily were studied under voltage-clamp (see Table S9). <b>(A)</b> (i) Current traces resulting from a voltage step from −80 mV to 40 mV for the wt Sepia K<sub>v</sub>2.1 and the same construct containing the sepia-specific I529V edit, lying within the 4<sup>th</sup> transmembrane domain (green), showing that I529V accelerates the rate of slow inactivation. (ii) Time constants for slow inactivation determined by fitting single exponentials to traces similar to those in panel (i) at different activating voltages (Vm). <b>(B)</b> (i) Tail currents measured at a voltage (Vm) of −80mV, following an activating pulse of +20 mV for 25 ms. Traces are shown for the wt K<sub>v</sub>2.1 channels from squid, sepia and Octopus vulgaris. (ii) Tail currents for the same channels edited at the shared I-to-V site in the 6<sup>th</sup> transmembrane span, following the same voltage protocol. (iii) Time constants from single exponential fits to tail currents obtained at various negative voltages (Vm) (following an activating pulse to 20 mV for 25 ms) show that the unedited channels close at distinct rates, (iv) but the edited versions close at similar rates. N = 5 ± s.e.m. for all data plotted in this figure.</p>

      Figure 7. RNA editing slows down cephalopod genome evolution
    </strong>
  

  
    <p><b>(A)</b> Inter-species mutations are purified from genome loci surrounding conserved recoding sites (data shown for sites shared by squid and sepia). Depletion of mutations extends up to ~100bp of shared recoding sites (left). As a control, we show the mutations density (mutations/bp) around random non-edited adenosines from the same transcripts (right). Yellow – synonymous change; light green – non-synonymous; dark green – deletions. <b>(B)</b> Genomic polymorphisms are depleted near editing/recoding/conserved-recoding sites in squid, attesting to reduced genome plasticity. Effect is stronger for recoding sites, and even more so for the conserved recoding sites. <b>(C)</b> GC-content is elevated near editing sites in squid, allowing for more stable double-stranded RNA structures. The effect is even stronger in conserved sites. Dashed line represents the baseline GC level in the entire ORFome, and error bars represent the S.E.M. See Supp. Fig. 3 for analyses similar to those presented in panels A–C in other species.</p>

<p>Google's newest proposed web standard is... DRM? Over the weekend the Internet got wind of <a href="https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/tree/main">this proposal</a> for a "Web Environment Integrity API. " The <a href="https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/blob/main/explainer.md">explainer</a> is authored by four Googlers, including at least one person on Chrome's "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/02/googles-privacy-sandbox-advertising-system-arrives-on-android-in-beta/">Privacy Sandbox</a>" team, which is responding to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/07/google-delays-death-of-tracking-cookies-again-wants-more-time-for-testing/">death of tracking cookies</a> by building a user-tracking ad platform right into the browser.</p>
<p>The intro to the Web Integrity API starts out: "Users often depend on websites trusting the client environment they run in. This trust may assume that the client environment is honest about certain aspects of itself, keeps user data and intellectual property secure, and is transparent about whether or not a human is using it."</p>
<p>The goal of the project is to learn more about the person on the other side of the web browser, ensuring they aren't a robot and that the browser hasn't been modified or tampered with in any unapproved ways. The intro says this data would be useful to advertisers to better count ad impressions, stop social network bots, enforce intellectual property rights, stop cheating in web games, and help financial transactions be more secure.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Perhaps the most telling line of the explainer is that it "takes inspiration from existing native attestation signals such as [Apple's] <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/validating_apps_that_connect_to_your_server">App Attest</a> and the [Android] <a href="https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity">Play Integrity API</a>." Play Integrity (formerly called "SafetyNet") is an Android API that lets apps find out if your device has been rooted. Root access allows you full control over the device that you purchased, and a lot of app developers don't like that. So if you root an Android phone and get flagged by the Android Integrity API, several types of apps will just refuse to run. You'll generally be locked out of banking apps, Google Wallet, online games, Snapchat, and some media apps like Netflix. You <em>could</em> be using root access to cheat at games or phish banking data, but you could also just want root to customize your device, remove crapware, or have a viable backup system. Play Integrity doesn't care and will lock you out of those apps either way. Google wants the same thing for the web.</p>
<p>Google's plan is that, during a webpage transaction, the web server could require you to pass an "environment attestation" test before you get any data. At this point your browser would contact a "third-party" attestation server, and you would need to pass some kind of test. If you passed, you would get a signed "IntegrityToken" that verifies your environment is unmodified and points to the content you wanted unlocked. You bring this back to the web server, and if the server trusts the attestation company, you get the content unlocked and finally get a response with the data you wanted.</p>

<p><span>You hear it often: dating </span>today doesn’t work like it used to. Or: apps like Tinder have made flirting more distant.</p>
<p>But the process of staring, judging, and messaging potential suitors from afar—hallmarks of modern dating apps—is not new. Beginning in the 1920s, nightclub-goers in Berlin who feared face-to-face encounters could communicate with beautiful strangers from across the room.</p>
<p>All they needed to do? Turn to the nearest pneumatic tube.</p>
<p>Two nightclubs in particular—the Resi and the Femina—pioneered the trend. At the Resi (also called the Residenz-Casino), a large nightclub with a live band and a dance floor that held 1,000 people, an elaborate system of table phones and pneumatic tubes allowed for anonymous, late-night flirtation between complete strangers.</p>

<p>A <em><a href="http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1968/10/30/page/48/article/the-tribune-travelers-guide">Chicago Tribune</a></em> article describes the Resi’s “nightly ‘spectacular’—‘a dancing water ballet’ with jets of water rising and falling to a recorded symphony while colored lights flash.” The water-jet ballet, now known as a “<a href="http://liquidfireworks.com/video-gallery/">Waltzing Water</a>,” began in 1928 and drew in many visitors.</p>
<p>But the <em>Tribune</em> article refers to the system of phones and pneumatic tubes at each table as the Resi’s “big lure.”</p>
<p>Phones were fixed to individual tables, and above many was a lighted number. Singles needed only to look around the room until a fetching stranger caught their eye, note the number, and then direct a message to that table. “Lonesome Americans, and others, can call or send a note to equally lonesome women who look like they would enjoy company,” the article noted.</p>
<p>In 1931, during the heyday of this across-the-nightclub flirtation, <em><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=nlpBDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA164&amp;lpg=PA164&amp;dq=The+Residenz-Casino&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=v3JYahpG1R&amp;sig=BeO7Wv1zKw2FmCrhC0hUYqbZ5ZA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiUor2wh5vUAhUo9YMKHVpMA38Q6AEIWTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Residenz-Casino&amp;f=false">The Berliner Herold</a></em> described the process of receiving a call from an amorous stranger: “the tabletop telephones buzzed, and the acquaintance with the blonde, raven-haired or redheaded, monocle-wearing beauty was made, one was no longer alone, and had twice as much fun.” (At the Ballhaus Berlin, this numbered phone system still lives today—check out photos <a href="http://www.ballhaus-berlin.de/first-gallery/">here</a>.)</p>
<figure><img src="https://img.atlasobscura.com/vsmYxzi0VnQuRhaU1hq-j6i0wls1sSIsuRyRLenFV3k/rt:fill/w:1200/el:1/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL2Fzc2V0/cy9lMTFhZTA1ODkz/N2M0NDZkODVfUmVz/aS0yLmpwZWc.jpg" alt="The Resi floor plan." width="auto" data-kind="article-image" id="article-image-42689" data-src="https://img.atlasobscura.com/vsmYxzi0VnQuRhaU1hq-j6i0wls1sSIsuRyRLenFV3k/rt:fill/w:1200/el:1/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL2Fzc2V0/cy9lMTFhZTA1ODkz/N2M0NDZkODVfUmVz/aS0yLmpwZWc.jpg"><figcaption>The Resi floor plan. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cabaret-berlin.com/?p=491">Courtesy of Brendan Nash </a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Similar systems thrived at the Femina, the larger of the two nightclubs, which <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=nlpBDAAAQBAJ&amp;q=two+large+bars+and+a+smaller+one+in+the+vestibule#v=snippet&amp;q=two%20large%20bars%20and%20a%20smaller%20one%20in%20the%20vestibule&amp;f=false">boasted</a> more than 2,000 seats, “two large bars and a smaller one in the vestibule, in addition to three orchestras, a hydraulic dance floor,” and over 225 table telephones, which were accompanied by instructions in both German and English.</p>
<p>But for those who were too shy to pick up the phone, the pneumatic tubes offered a perfect alternative. The tubes were built into the handrails, and one was located at each table. The nightclub provided paper on which to scrawl notes. Patrons only had to specify where they wanted their missives sent. Like messaging on a dating app, but with—you know—tubes.</p>
<p>At the Resi, many provocative notes were passed around, but eager flirters needed to be careful—“<a href="http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1968/10/30/page/48/article/the-tribune-travelers-guide">messages sent by tube [were] checked by female ‘censors’ in the switchboard room</a>” in an early form of comment moderation.</p>

<p>The pneumatic tube system existed for decades, and Americans who visited Berlin after World War II <a href="http://www.cabaret-berlin.com/?p=491#comments">remember it fondly</a>.</p>
<p>Today, many fictionalized accounts memorialize it: <em>Then We Take Berlin</em> by John Lawton <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=m6vGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA246&amp;lpg=PA246&amp;dq=pneumatic+tube+nightclub&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7IP9C488gY&amp;sig=jUynGQMdbt4bihAh2QQ3NC_TmJ4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjhq6vpwZ3UAhWBaxQKHRvcA-k4ChDoAQhMMAg#v=onepage&amp;q=pneumatic%20tube%20nightclub&amp;f=false">describes</a> how visitors could “write a message, stick it in the snake’s head, yank on the handle and the pneumatic tube would whisk it up to the top gallery and they’d redirect it to the right table.” (<em>Cabaret</em>, meanwhile, tributes the table phone system in “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5SLGipH-cA">The Telephone Song</a>.”) Ian McEwan’s novel <em>The Innocent</em> also offers an evocative tribute. When his main character, Leonard, visits a fictionalized version of the Resi nightclub, the protagonist finds a pamphlet that boasts the establishment’s “Modern Table-Phone-System” and “Pneumatic-Table-Mail-Service,” which sends “every night thousands of letters or little presents from one visitor to another.”</p>
<p>This “table mail service” was real, and allowed patrons to send more than just a handwritten note to that handsome stranger across the way. The Resi offered a long menu of gifts that visitors could dispatch via pneumatic tube—including <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=81FjCwAAQBAJ&amp;q=pneumatic#v=snippet&amp;q=pneumatic&amp;f=false">perfume bottles, cigar cutters, travel plans</a>, and, <a href="https://www.roundabouttheatre.org/Roundabout/media/Roundabout/PDF/UPSTAGE/Cabaret_UpstageGuide_R3.pdf">according to one source, cocaine</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="description_news"><p>Based upon a review by the SUN DAY Campaign of data newly released by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), utility-scale solar and wind appear to be on track to provide a quarter of the nation's installed electrical generating capacity within three years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In its latest monthly "Energy Infrastructure Update" report (with data through May 31, 2023) FERC notes that wind is now 11.63% of total installed generating capacity while utility-scale solar provides another 6.86%. &nbsp;</p>



<p>However, over the next three years (i.e., by May 2026), FERC anticipates "high probability additions" of solar to provide another 80,087-MW while wind is expected to expand by 19,816-MW. Assuming that materializes, in three years, wind would account for 12.43% of installed capacity while utility-scale solar would provide another 12.41%. And that does not include generating capacity provided by small-scale, distributed (e.g., rooftop) solar. [1]&nbsp;</p>



<p>Factoring in FERC's forecasts for hydropower, geothermal, and biomass, renewable energy sources would expand from today's 28.01% of installed generating capacity to 33.85% - i.e., over a third - by May 2026. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Solar and wind's share of U.S. generating capacity could actually be substantially higher if new capacity exceeds FERC's forecast of "high probability additions." The agency indicates that the amount of solar and wind in the three-year pipeline could be nearly three times higher than the total of the "high probability additions". Solar could add 214,022-MW while wind could grow by 66,065-MW.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, recent history suggests that solar and wind growth is outpacing FERC's predictions for "high probability additions." A year ago, FERC reported "high-probability additions" for wind and solar within three years of 18,711-MW and 62,835-MW respectively.[2] FERC's latest 3-year forecast for those sources is now 22.5% higher. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Signs of that prospective growth may already be evident. For the first five months of 2023, wind and solar accounted for more than half of the new capacity additions this year - 51.07% - comprised of 4,460-MW of solar and 2.645-MW of wind. New capacity provided by hydropower (254-MW), geothermal (37-MW), and biomass (29-MW) brought renewables' combined share of new capacity up to 53.38%. The balance (other than 2-MW from oil) was provided by natural gas. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Notwithstanding the recent natural gas additions, FERC foresees a net decline of 1,564-MW in natural gas generating capacity over the next three years in addition to a drop of 19,966-MW in coal capacity. Oil and nuclear capacity are also foreseen falling - by 569-MW and 123-MW respectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Should just FERC's "high probability" forecasts materialize, by May 2026, installed U.S. fossil fuels' share of total capacity will drop over the next three years: natural gas - 41.67% (from 44.37% in May 2023), coal - 14.05% (from 16.49%), and oil - 2.68% (from 2.89%). Nuclear power will also fall from 8.07% today to 7.60% in May 2026.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Wind and solar are now poised to each provide an eighth of the nation's installed generating capacity within three years while all renewables combined will account for over a third," noted the SUN DAY Campaign's executive director Ken Bossong. "But in light of renewable energy growth rates of recent years, those numbers may very well prove to be an under-estimate."</p>

<p><b>Sources:&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>FERC's 7-page "Energy Infrastructure Update for May 2023" was released on July 17, 2023, and can be found at:&nbsp;<a href="https://cms.ferc.gov/media/energy-infrastructure-update-may-2023">https://cms.ferc.gov/media/energy-infrastructure-update-may-2023</a>. For the information cited in this update, see the tables entitled "New Generation In-Service (New Build and Expansion)," "Total Available Installed Generating Capacity," and "Generation Capacity Additions and Retirements." &nbsp;</p>



<p><b>Notes:</b></p>

<p>[1] FERC generally only reports data for utility-scale facilities (i.e., those rated 1-MW or greater) and therefore its data do not reflect the capacity of distributed renewables, notably rooftop solar PV which - according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) - accounts for approximately 30% of the nation's electrical generation by solar. That would imply that the total of distributed and utility-scale solar capacity combined is significantly more than the solar capacity of 6.86% reported by FERC for the first five months of 2023 and is perhaps closer to 9.0% or 10.0%.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><a rel="noopener follow" href="https://erikvandeven.medium.com/?source=post_page-----54590420c225--------------------------------"><div aria-hidden="false"><p><img alt="Erik van de Ven" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*fwRvhhQzroW7HLMQ2MJN5w.jpeg" width="44" height="44" loading="lazy"></p></div></a></div><figure><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/fr/@usinglight?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Stefan Steinbauer</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="1076">What Kyle Simpson mentions about JavaScript in his books, Luciano Ramalho mentions in his book ‘Fluent Python’ about Python. They basically address the same issue of both languages. To put it in my own words:</p><blockquote><p id="dccc">Because the language is so easy to learn, many practitioners only scratch the surface of its full potential, neglecting to delve into the more advanced and powerful aspects of the language which makes it so truly unique and powerful</p></blockquote><p id="abb4">So let’s discuss briefly all functionalities you might haven’t heard of, but you definitely want to know if you aim to become a truly seasoned Pythonista.</p><h2 id="e247">Evaluation of Default Arguments</h2><p id="2954">Python arguments are evaluated when the function definition is encountered. Good to remember that! This means that each time the <strong>fib_memo </strong>function (which is mentioned below) is called without explicitly providing a value for the memo argument, it will use the same dictionary object that was created when the function was defined.</p><pre><span id="d90b">def fib_memo(n, memo={0:0, 1:1}):<br>  """ <br>  n is the number nth number <br>  you would like to return in the sequence <br>  """<br>  if not n in memo:<br>    memo[n] = fib_memo(n-1) + fib_memo(n-2)<br>  return memo[n]<p># 6th Fibonacci (including 0 as first number)<br>fib_memo(6) # should return 8</p></span></pre><p id="6d25">So this code works, in Python. This also means that you could execute the <strong>fib_memo </strong>function in a single script multiple times, like in a for loop, with each execution increasing the fibonacci number to be computed, without hitting the “maximum recursion depth exceeded” limit, as the memo will keep expanding. <a href="https://medium.com/@erikvandeven/memoization-done-right-in-python-96d3527a43f6" rel="noopener">More information can be found in my other article</a>.</p><h2 id="34c6">Walrus Operator</h2><p id="08b5">The walrus operator (<code>:=</code> ), introduced in Python 3.8, allows you to assign a value to a variable within an expression. This way, you can assign the value to a variable and check its value in one expression:</p><pre><span id="ce90">import random<br>some_value = random.randint(0,100) # return a number between 0 and, including, 100<p>if((below_ten := some_value) &lt; 10):<br>    print(f"{below_ten} is smaller than 10")</p></span></pre><p id="d177">Obviously, it’s also easy to assign and check whether the returned value contains a truthy value or not:</p><pre><span id="fbac">if(result := some_method()): # If result is not Falsy<br>    print(result)</span></pre><h2 id="3b91">*args and **kwargs</h2><p id="2eeb">With the asterisk (<code>*</code> ) you can unpack the arguments or keyword arguments (with <code>**</code> ) before passing them to the function. For example, let’s consider the following code:</p><pre><span id="9ecb">my_numbers = [1,2]<p>def sum_numbers(first_number, second_number):<br>    return first_number + second_number</p><p># This will return a TypeError.<br># TypeError: sum() missing 1 required positional argument: 'second_number'<br>sum_numbers(my_numbers)</p><p># This will return the expected result, 3<br>sum_numbers(*my_numbers)</p></span></pre><p id="c430">When we call the <code>sum_numbers</code> function without unpacking <code>my_numbers</code>, it raises a <em>TypeError </em>because the function expects two separate arguments. However, by using the asterisk (*), we can unpack the values from <code>my_numbers</code> and pass them as individual arguments, resulting in the correct output.</p><p id="4790">This unpacking technique works not only with tuples and lists, but also with dictionaries (though it will pass the keys as arguments). But what about keyword arguments? For that, we can utilize the double asterisk (**). Take the following code as an example:</p><pre><span id="70c5">def greet_person(last_name, first_name):<br>  print(f"Hello {first_name} {last_name}")<p>data = {"first_name": "John", "last_name": "Doe"}<br>greet_person(**data)</p></span></pre><p id="275b">Besides unpacking a sequence to pass them as arguments to a function, you could also use it to create a new sequence, for example:</p><pre><span id="ec87">numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br>new_list_numbers = [*numbers]</span></pre><p id="8f8f">The original numbers list remains unaffected, and you have a <code>new_list_numbers</code> variable which contains a copy of the same list. Be careful with links containing objects, though:</p><pre><span id="16bb">numbers = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]<br>packed_numbers = [*numbers]<p>numbers[0].append(10)  # Modify the nested list within the original list</p><p>print(numbers)          # Output: [[1, 2, 10], [3, 4], [5, 6]]<br>print(packed_numbers)   # Output: [[1, 2, 10], [3, 4], [5, 6]]</p></span></pre><h2 id="ffdb">any and all</h2><p id="bae3"><code>any</code> and <code>all</code> are built-in functions that operate on iterable objects (such as lists, tuples, or sets) and return a Boolean value based on the elements in the iterable. An example:</p><pre><span id="26e3">some_booleans = [True, False, False, False]<p>any(some_booleans) # returns True<br>all(some_booleans) # returns</p></span></pre><p id="cec9">You could use the <code>all</code> and <code>any</code> functions in combination with list comprehensions, which return an iterable and pass it as argument to the <code>all</code> functions:</p><pre><span id="e6d1">numbers = [5, 10, 3, 8, -2]<br>all_positive = all(num &gt; 0 for num in numbers)</span></pre><p id="499e">… or any functions:</p><pre><span id="c007">fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'durian']<p># Check if all fruits start with 'a'<br>result = all(fruit.startswith('a') for fruit in fruits)<br>print(result)  # Output: False</p></span></pre><p id="5547">A table which shows the differences of outputs depending on the values in the iterable, is shown below.</p><figure></figure><h2 id="648b">Swapping Variables</h2><p id="95bd">You can combine tuple packing (what is happening on the right of the equal (=) sign) and unpacking (what is happening on the left of the equal(=) sign) and leverage this functionality for swapping variables:</p><pre><span id="9ac7">a = 10<br>b = 5<p># Swap the values of b and a by packing and unpacking<br>a, b = b, a</p><p>print(a) # 5<br>print(b) # 10</p></span></pre><h2 id="0cd5">str vs repr</h2><p id="12d6">We are used to converting some variable or value to a string, using<code>str(some_value)</code>, so we can print it for debugging purposes. I would like to make you aware of <code>repr(some_value)</code>. The main difference is that <code>repr</code> tries to return a printable representation of the object, while <code>str</code> just tries to return a string representation. A better example is shown below:</p><pre><span id="e33c">import datetime<p>today = datetime.datetime.now()</p><p>print(str(today))   # Output: 2023-07-20 15:30:00.123456<br>print(repr(today))  # Output: datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 20, 15, 30, 0, 123456)</p></span></pre><p id="2e4c">As you can see, <code>str()</code> simply returns the <em>datetime </em>as a string representation. If you want to determine whether the variable <strong>today </strong>contains a string or a <em>datetime </em>object, you wouldn’t be able to discern that information from this alone. On the other hand, ⁣<code>repr()</code> provides information about the actual object that the variable holds. This information is significantly more valuable during debugging.</p><h2 id="4869">Extended Iterable Unpacking</h2><p id="22ad">We can keep this simple: if you would like to get the first and last value of a sequence in a single command:</p><pre><span id="4ede">first, *middle, last = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<p>print(first)  # 1<br>print(middle) # [2, 3, 4]<br>print(last)   # 5</p></span></pre><p id="50aa">But this works as well</p><pre><span id="f1df">*the_first_three, second_last, last = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<p>print(the_first_three) # [1, 2, 3]<br>print(second_last)     # 4<br>print(last)            # 5</p></span></pre><p id="516a">Or other combinations.</p><h2 id="326c">Multiple Context Managers</h2><p id="d74c">We are used to using one context manager at a time, like opening a file:</p><pre><span id="734d">with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:<br>    # Code that uses the file<br>    # The file will be automatically closed at the end of the block<br>    # even if an exception occurs<p>    # Example: reading lines from the file<br>    for line in file:<br>        print(line.strip())</p><p>with open('file_2.txt', 'r') as other_file:<br>    # Second context manager </p><p>    for line in other_file:<br>        print(line.strip())</p></span></pre><p id="a93d">But we could easily open multiple files in a single statement. Easy if you would like to write lines to the other file for example:</p><pre><span id="e21f">with open('file1.txt') as file1, open('file2.txt') as file2:<br>    # Code that uses both file1 and file2<br>    # The files will be automatically closed at the end of the block<br>    # even if an exception occurs<p>    # Example: reading lines from file1 and writing them to file2<br>    for line in file1:<br>        file2.write(line)</p></span></pre><h2 id="6f7b">The Python Debugger</h2><p id="aedc">We could just print a ton of variables in our file, for debugging purposes, or we could simply use the Python Debugger (pdb), which helps us to set breakpoints which makes it so much easier:</p><pre><span id="2d39">import pdb<p># Set this breakpoint somewhere in your code<br>pdb.set_trace()</p></span></pre><p id="e97d">What makes this so much more valuable is that the program will stop at the breakpoint at which you could print any variable to check its value or existence at that specific breakpoint. Try it! These are several commands you could use when the program hits a breakpoint:</p><ul><li id="6187"><code>n</code> or <code>next</code>: Execute the next line.</li><li id="cfb5"><code>s</code> or <code>step</code>: Step into a function call.</li><li id="0f52"><code>c</code> or <code>continue</code>: Continue execution until the next breakpoint.</li><li id="b58f"><code>l</code> or <code>list</code>: Show the current code context.</li><li id="1c34"><code>p &lt;expression&gt;</code> or <code>pp &lt;expression&gt;</code>: Print the value of an expression.</li><li id="48c2"><code>b &lt;line&gt;</code> or <code>break &lt;line&gt;</code>: Set a new breakpoint at the specified line.</li><li id="c763"><code>h</code> or <code>help</code>: Get help on using <code>pdb</code>.</li><li id="455f"><code>q</code> or <code>quit</code>: Quit the debugger and terminate the program.</li></ul><h2 id="fffc">collections.Counter</h2><p id="3fd8">The <code>Counter</code> class from the <code>collections</code> module provides a convenient way to count elements in an iterable:</p><pre><span id="7d70">from collections import Counter<p>my_list = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5]<br>counts = Counter(my_list)<br>print(counts)  # Output: Counter({1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 1, 5: 1})</p></span></pre><h2 id="ed15">Combinations Using Itertools</h2><p id="f5b8">We could combine different for loops to create permutations, combinations or a cartesian product, or we could simply use the built in itertools.</p><h2 id="0cdd">Permutations</h2><pre><span id="0079">import itertools<p># Generating permutations<br>perms = itertools.permutations([1, 2, 3], 2)<br>print(list(perms))  # Output: [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2)]</p></span></pre><h2 id="0c28">Combinations</h2><pre><span id="6457">import itertools<p># Generating combinations<br>combs = itertools.combinations('ABC', 2)<br>print(list(combs))  # Output: [('A', 'B'), ('A', 'C'), ('B', 'C')]</p></span></pre><h2 id="380c">Cartesian product</h2><pre><span id="992e">import itertools<p># Generating Cartesian product<br>cartesian = itertools.product('AB', [1, 2])<br>print(list(cartesian))  # Output: [('A', 1), ('A', 2), ('B', 1), ('B', 2)]</p></span></pre><h2 id="662b">Two Ways of Using Underscore</h2><p id="823c">These are two ways to use the underscore in Python: as a separater for large numbers or as a throwaway variable.</p><h2 id="0db3">Throwaway Variable</h2><p id="7870">The underscore <code>_</code> can be used as a throwaway variable to discard unwanted values:</p><pre><span id="0672"># Ignoring the first return value of a function<br>_, result = some_function()<p># Looping without using the loop variable<br>for _ in range(5):<br>    do_something()</p><p># You just need the first and the last<br>first, *_, last = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</p></span></pre><h2 id="a32f">Separater for Large Numbers</h2><p id="81aa">You can use underscores (<code>_</code>) as visual separators to enhance readability when working with large numeric values. This feature was introduced in Python 3.6 and is known as "underscore literals."</p><pre><span id="6f99">population = 7_900_000_000<br>revenue = 3_249_576_382.50<p>print(population)  # Output: 7900000000<br>print(revenue)  # Output: 3249576382.5</p></span></pre></div><div><p id="ac5b">Liked this article?</p><p id="135d">A few <strong>claps 👏 </strong>is very much appreciated (Just hold that clap button and never let go 😜)!

                                        <p>Intel® architecture powers datacenters and personal computers around the world. Since its introduction by Intel® in 1978, the architecture has continuously evolved to take advantage of emerging workloads and the relentless pace of Moore’s law. The original instruction set defined only eight 16-bit general-purpose registers, which over the years were doubled in number and quadrupled in size. A large set of vector registers was added, and most recently Intel® AMX introduced two-dimensional matrix registers, providing a big jump in AI performance.<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/accelerator-engines/advanced-matrix-extensions/overview.html"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Today, we are introducing the next major step in the evolution of Intel® architecture. Intel® Advanced Performance Extensions (Intel® APX) expands the entire x86 instruction set with access to more registers and adds various new features that improve general-purpose performance. The extensions are designed to provide efficient performance gains across a variety of workloads – without significantly increasing silicon area or power consumption of the core.</p>

<p>Intel® APX doubles the number of general-purpose registers (GPRs) from 16 to 32. This allows the compiler to keep more values in registers; as a result, APX-compiled code contains 10% fewer loads and more than 20% fewer stores than the same code compiled for an Intel® 64 baseline.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Register accesses are not only faster, but they also consume significantly less dynamic power than complex load and store operations.</p>

<p>Compiler enabling is straightforward – a new REX2 prefix provides uniform access to the new registers across the legacy integer instruction set. Intel® AVX instructions gain access via new bits defined in the existing EVEX prefix. In addition, legacy integer instructions now can also use EVEX to encode a dedicated destination register operand – turning them into three-operand instructions and reducing the need for extra register move instructions. While the new prefixes increase average instruction length, there are 10% fewer instructions in APX-compiled code<sup>2</sup>, resulting in similar code density as before.</p>

<p>The new GPRs are XSAVE-enabled, which means that they can be automatically saved and restored by XSAVE/XRSTOR sequences during context switches. They do not change the size and layout of the XSAVE area as they take up the space left behind by the deprecated Intel® MPX registers.</p>

<p>We propose to define the new GPRs as caller-saved (volatile) state in application binary interfaces (ABIs), facilitating interoperability with legacy binaries. Optimized calling conventions can be introduced where legacy compatibility requirements are relaxed. Generally, more register state will need to be managed at function boundaries. In order to reduce the associated overhead, we are adding PUSH2/POP2 instructions that transfer two register values within a single memory operation. The processor tracks these new instructions internally and fast-forwards register data between matching PUSH2 and POP2 instructions without going through memory.</p>

<p>The performance features introduced so far will have limited impact in workloads that suffer from a large number of conditional branch mispredictions. As out-of-order CPUs continue to become deeper and wider, the cost of mispredictions increasingly dominates performance of such workloads. Branch predictor improvements can mitigate this to a limited extent only as data-dependent branches are fundamentally hard to predict.</p>

<p>To address this growing performance issue, we significantly expand the conditional instruction set of x86, which was first introduced with the Intel® Pentium® Pro in the form of CMOV/SET instructions. These instructions are used quite extensively by today’s compilers, but they are too limited for broader use of if-conversion (a compiler optimization that replaces branches with conditional instructions).</p>

<p>Intel® APX adds conditional forms of load, store, and compare/test instructions, and it also adds an option for the compiler to suppress the status flags writes of common instructions. These enhancements expand the applicability of if-conversion to much larger code regions, cutting down on the number of branches that may incur misprediction penalties. All these conditional ISA improvements are implemented via EVEX prefix extensions of existing legacy instructions.</p>

<p>Application developers can take advantage of Intel® APX by simple recompilation – source code changes are not expected to be needed. Workloads written in dynamic languages will automatically benefit as soon as the underlying runtime system has been enabled.</p>

<p>Intel® APX demonstrates the advantage of the variable-length instruction encodings of x86 – new features enhancing the entire instruction set can be defined with only incremental changes to the instruction-decode hardware. This flexibility has allowed Intel® architecture to adapt and flourish over four decades of rapid advances in computing – and it enables the innovations that will keep it thriving into the future.</p>

I tend to find that while Huggingface has built a superb library in transformers, their guides tend to overcomplicate things for the average joe. The second part, fine-tuning on custom data, is coming at the end of the week!</p><p>To get started, get yourself either an A10, A10G, A100 (or any GPU with &gt;24GB GPU memory). If you're not sure where to start, the <a href="https://console.brev.dev/environment/new?instance=gpu_1x_a10">Brev Cloud</a> makes it easy to access each of these GPUs!</p><h2 id="1-download-the-model">1.

<p>
In March 2021 Nathan Long published <a href="https://dockyard.com/blog/2021/03/30/elixir-is-safe">Elixir is Safe</a>, a post about the security benefits of using Elixir, which focused on memory and thread safety. It is an excellent article for programmers and executives about the security benefits of Elixir. In July 2023 I googled “Elixir is Safe”, and the first result was a snippet from the paper, “Vision for a Secure Elixir Ecosystem: An Empirical Study of Vulnerabilities in Elixir Programs”, which was <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3476883.3520204">published by the ACM in April 2022.</a></p>
<p><img src="https://paraxial.io/blog/google.png" width="550"></p><p>
Several of the paper’s authors are students, and this post is not meant to criticize them as researchers. The paper is written as a reaction to Nathan’s article, which accurately describes the security benefits of Elixir. The paper’s claims are misleading, and the fact that it currently ranks above the original article on Google, and was published in a reputable journal, warrants a response.</p>
<p>
<em>“Practitioners perceive Elixir to be a ‘safe’ language, as the language allows practitioners to write fast software programs without introducing vulnerabilities, unlike other languages, such as C[16]. Positive perception of practitioners about the safety and security Elixir programs is subject to empirical validation. Practitioner perceptions are formed through personal experience, and not based on empirical evidence [9]. A systematic empirical investigation that quantifies reported security vulnerabilities can shed light on the state of security of Elixir programs. Such empirical investigation can also yield recommendations for practitioners and researchers on how to securely develop Elixir programs.”</em></p>
<p>
<em>[16] Nathan Long. 2021. Elixir is Safe. <a href="https://dockyard.com/blog/2021/03/30/elixir-is-safe">https://dockyard.com/blog/2021/03/30/elixir-is-safe</a></em></p>
<p>
Nobody thinks Elixir “allows practitioners to write fast software programs without introducing vulnerabilities”. The article “Elixir is Safe” never makes that claim, rather it mentions that Elixir is a memory safe language, which C is not, and discusses the thread safety benefits of Elixir. These are both important topics, for example Elixir completely eliminates <a href="https://paraxial.io/blog/data-race">security issues due to data races</a>, a severe vulnerability that can lead to users being logged into the wrong account, a disaster for banking and medical portals. </p>
<p>
An empirical study showing that Elixir programs contain vulnerabilities is not surprising, because software written in every language has them. Imagine Elixir as a type of asphalt which reduces the rate of potholes in roads, and Nathan’s article is explaining this benefit. Then a paper is published saying, “roads paved with Elixir still have potholes”, ignoring that it results in fewer potholes. The paper does not mention memory or thread safety at all, which are the specific security benefits Nathan discusses. Rather, it surveys popular open-source Elixir projects for vulnerability related commits. </p>
<p><img src="https://paraxial.io/blog/repo_set.png" width="500"></p><p>
Which repos were selected for the dataset? The paper does not mention them, below is a list pulled from the <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Elixir_Vulnerability_Dataset/15078573/1">dataset</a>. The unix command <code>awk -F "," '{print $1}' ELIXIR_FINAL_SECURITY_BUG_DATASET.csv | sort | uniq</code> was used to get this list.</p>
<pre><code>1. 30-days-of-elixir
2. absinthe
3. analytics
4. awesome-elixir
5. credo
6. curlconverter
7. distillery
8. edeliver
9. elixir
10. elixir-koans
11. guardian
12. httpoison
13. papercups
14. phoenix
15. phoenix-trello
16. poison
17. quantum-core
18. realtime
19. rustler</code></pre>
<p>
It is surprising to only see 19 repos, when the paper says 25. The inclusion of <code>30-days-of-elixir</code>, <code>awesome-elixir</code>, and <code>elixir-koans</code> is debatable, considering these repos do not store projects intended to be run in production. The counts for “Elixir Files” and “Elixir-related Commits” in the dataset do match the paper. </p>
<p><img src="https://paraxial.io/blog/table2.png" width="500"></p><p>
These numbers do match the dataset, but the definition of “program” is misleading. For example, commit <code>2d68e9c</code> maps to two files in the dataset:</p>
<pre><code>absinthe/test/absinthe/phase/document/complexity_test.exs
absinthe/lib/absinthe/phase/document/complexity/result.ex</code></pre>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/absinthe-graphql/absinthe/pull/800/commits/2d68e9c4d6540a200cd134661c23400d26631f75">View this commit on Github.</a> Both of these files are considered a “program” in the paper. It is misleading to say the dataset has “319 programs with vulnerability related commits”, the paper came to that number by counting files per commit classified as vulnerable. </p>
<p>
In the paper’s dataset, the repo for <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible Analytics</a> is included, with commit <code>f7b37fe</code>. You can <a href="https://github.com/plausible/analytics/commit/f7b37fe9eac54336f7a61a6b4d2378a381637b5b">view this commit on Github</a>, but it is for a PR with 32 changed files, so the commit alone is not enough information to determine what vulnerability the dataset is referring to. The paper mentions that commits were found via a keyword search for terms often used to describe vulnerabilities, one of which is “sql”.</p>

<p>
The string interpolation in a Clickhouse DB query looks suspicious, but the <code>db_to_create</code> value is not set by user input, so there is no vulnerability. The keywords “security” and “vulnerability” also appear in the PR. Link to sub-commits:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/plausible/analytics/pull/209/commits/b3f783edb698c273cfa13271be3a74c9f226d65a"><code>b3f783e</code></a> - Adds a container security tool, not related to Elixir. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/plausible/analytics/pull/209/commits/57171f893aa762d02eeea5130f6e84f739f447a3"><code>57171f8</code></a> - The text of this comment says, “fixing some vulnerabilities identified by the scanning tools”, however it involved a Debian upgrade, not related to Elixir.</p>
<p>
The paper counts <code>f7b37fe</code> as “28 programs with vulnerability related commits”, because it involves 28 Elixir source code files, which is not correct. The lack of clarity around the vulnerable code in the dataset is concerning, making it impossible to truly replicate the paper’s findings, because you have to guess which specific lines the dataset is referring to as vulnerable. The dataset contains no labels for the type of security issue found (DoS, XSS, CSRF, etc), no information on the severity of each issue, and no discussion on how an attacker would use each vulnerability. This limits its utility in discussing the security of Elixir applications.</p>
<p>
It is highly unlikely that the dataset from this paper includes vulnerabilities related to thread or memory safety, which is the main point Nathan correctly makes in his article <a href="https://dockyard.com/blog/2021/03/30/elixir-is-safe">Elixir is Safe</a>.</p>
