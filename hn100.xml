<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the previous article (<!--$--><a href="https://sinja.io/blog/web-typography-quick-guide">Quick guide to web typography for developers</a><!--/$-->) we covered the basic steps to improve the typography in your apps. Today I'd like to expand a bit more on the topic of fonts and what you can get out of a high-quality font (paid or free). High-quality fonts often come with a full bag of goodies, it will be unwise to not use what the type designer gifted (or sold) to us.</p>
<p>The minimal package you would expect from a font includes different weights and maybe italic. Traditionally, it was made by creating a separate font file. One for Helvetica Regular, one for Helvetica Bold, and separate files for Helvetica Regular Italic and Helvetica Bold Italic. But with OpenType features, we can pack all those fonts into one file, along with a bunch of other goodies. We'll cover some of the most interesting features, but there are more.</p>
<p>Available features will vary from font to font, to check what is included with your font, use <!--$--><a href="https://wakamaifondue.com/?ref=sinja.io">Wakamai Fondue</a><!--/$-->.</p>

<!--$--><a href="#variable-axes"><h2 id="variable-axes">Variable axes</h2></a><!--/$-->
<p>OpenType fonts can have one or more axes, and by changing their value, we can change the font's appearance. Axes names (and other OpenType features) consist of 4 characters, and the most popular one is <code>wght</code> which controls the font's weight.</p>
<div><p>Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow.</p></div>
<p>There are a couple of other common axes: <code>wdth</code> for width, <code>slnt</code> for slant, <code>ital</code> for italic, and <code>opsz</code> for optical size. But in addition to standard axes, the type designer can create custom axes, which further extends the creative potential of the typeface.</p>
<p>There are two ways to manipulate variable font axes. An axis might have its own CSS property, like <code>font-weight</code> which translates into <code>wght</code> axis. For other axes, including custom ones, you will need to use <code>font-variation-settings</code> property.</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span>.cls1</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-weight: </span><span>451</span><span>; </span><span>/* wght axis */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-stretch: </span><span>condensed</span><span>;  </span><span>/* wdth axis */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-style: </span><span>italic</span><span>; </span><span>/* ital axis */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-style: </span><span>oblique</span><span> 40</span><span>deg</span><span>; </span><span>/* slnt axis */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-optical-sizing: </span><span>none</span><span>; </span><span>/* opsz axis */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>.cls2</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-variation-settings: </span><span>'MONO'</span><span> 0.25</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>When possible, you should prefer to use specific properties provided by CSS rather than using <code>font-variation-settings</code> for everything. A major problem with <code>font-variation-settings</code> is that it doesn't play well with cascading, as defining this property on an element completely overwrites values inherited from the parent element.</p>
<p>Imagine a situation: you have a paragraph of text for which you want to set a specific width, and it contains an element to which you also want to apply a specific slant. Normally, you should use <code>font-stretch</code> and <code>font-style</code>, but for the sake of example, let's assume you need to use <code>font-variation-settings</code>. You might try something like this:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span>p</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-variation-settings: </span><span>'wdth'</span><span> 75</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>.emphasis</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-variation-settings: </span><span>'slnt'</span><span> -5</span><span>;    </span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>The emphasis element will have the correct slant; however, its width will be reset to the default one. The correct way to set variation settings for the element would be to define values for both axes explicitly.</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span>.emphasis</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-variation-settings: </span><span>'wdth'</span><span> 75</span><span>, </span><span>'slnt'</span><span> -5</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>To work around this, we can use CSS variables.</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span>:root</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    --wdth</span><span>: </span><span>100</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    --slnt</span><span>: </span><span>0</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>*</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-variation-settings: </span><span>'wdth'</span><span> var</span><span>(</span><span>--wdth</span><span>), </span><span>'slnt'</span><span> var</span><span>(</span><span>--slnt</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>p</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    --wdth</span><span>: </span><span>75</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>.emphasis</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    --slnt</span><span>: </span><span>-5</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>On <!--$--><a href="https://v-fonts.com/?ref=sinja.io">this website</a><!--/$--> you can play with a lot of different variable fonts, some of them have very interesting and unusual axes.</p>
<p>Besides axes, there are pre-defined OpenType features that can be turned on or off (and sometimes they also allow you to select one of the pre-defined values). Let's talk about the most popular ones.</p>
<!--$--><a href="#alternates"><h2 id="alternates">Alternates</h2></a><!--/$-->
<p>Fonts can contain alternative glyphs for certain characters. This includes different styles of numbers, swashes, ligatures, and just an alternative style for certain characters. But what exactly is available will vary from font to font.</p>
<!--$--><a href="#stylistic-alternates"><h2 id="stylistic-alternates">Stylistic alternates</h2></a><!--/$-->
<p>Starting with stylistic alternates. Those are just alternative forms of letters that you can enable. In some fonts, it might change how 'I', 'l', and '1' look to disambiguate them, in other fonts, it just replaces single-story 'a' and 'g' with double-story alternates. There are 3 different OpenType features related to stylistic alternates that somewhat overlap.</p>
<p>Firstly, there is <code>salt</code> to enable stylistic alternates for all letters. It's this one setting that will likely alter how 'a' and 'g' look.</p>
<p>Then there are stylistic sets. They are named <code>ss01</code>, <code>ss02</code>, and so on. They replace only a subset of characters with alternates. Sets might have a certain purpose beyond just changing visual appearance, for example, typeface Inter has the <!--$--><a href="https://rsms.me/inter/#features/ss02?ref=sinja.io">stylistic set 'Disambiguation'</a><!--/$--> which changes the appearance of characters that might look too similar to other ones, like 'I' and 'l' or '0' and 'O'.</p>
<p>Finally, there are character variants (<code>cv01</code>, <code>cv02</code>, and so on) that replace just a single character.</p>
<p>There are two ways to use alternates on the web. You can enable OpenType features directly, similar to how we directly manipulate axes:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span>h1</span><span>,</span><span> h2</span><span>,</span><span> h3</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-feature-settings: </span><span>'salt'</span><span> on, </span><span>'ss01'</span><span> on, </span><span>'cv06'</span><span> on;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>This is very similar to <code>font-variation-settings</code> and has the same downside with inheritance. Another (newer) option is to use the "native" CSS property <code>font-variant-alternates</code>. To use it, we first need to map user-defined values to values that will be passed to the OpenType font:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span>/* This is set per font */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>@font-feature-values</span><span> "Work Sans"</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    /* salt feature */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    @stylistic</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        /* </span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        'on' is the value which we'll use in styles, while</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        1 is what will be passed to OpenType font.</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>         */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        on</span><span>: </span><span>1</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        off</span><span>: </span><span>0</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    }</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>    /* ss01, ss02, ... */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    @styleset</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        /* </span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        alt-digits is the name for the set we'll use in styles,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        while 1 is its number (translates to ss01)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        alt-digits</span><span>: </span><span>1</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        disambiguation</span><span>: </span><span>2</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    }</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>    /* cv01, cv02, ... */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    @character-variant</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        /* </span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        This notation is a bit different: here, simplified-u will be used</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        in styles, but 6 means that it should enable sixth character</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        variant, OpenType feature cv06</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        simplified-u</span><span>: </span><span>6</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        compact-f</span><span>: </span><span>12</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    }</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>h1</span><span>,</span><span> h2</span><span>,</span><span> h3</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-variant-alternates: </span><span>stylistic</span><span>(</span><span>on</span><span>) </span><span>styleset</span><span>(</span><span>alt-digits</span><span>) </span><span>character-variant</span><span>(</span><span>compact-f</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>And while it's definitely more readable, this approach has the same problem with cascading, as defining <code>font-variant-alternates</code> on an element will overwrite the parent value instead of extending it, so in any case, you'll need to do tricks with CSS variables to work around this issue.</p>
<!--$--><a href="#swashes"><h2 id="swashes">Swashes</h2></a><!--/$-->
<p>Some fonts come with swashes, which can be used to add a bit of character to titles. Similar to stylistic alternates, there are two ways to enable swashes:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span>h1</span><span>,</span><span> h2</span><span>,</span><span> h3</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-feature-settings: </span><span>'swsh'</span><span> on;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span>@font-feature-values</span><span> "Work Sans"</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    @swash</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        on</span><span>: </span><span>1</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        off</span><span>: </span><span>0</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    }</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>h1</span><span>,</span><span> h2</span><span>,</span><span> h3</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-variant-alternates: </span><span>swash</span><span>(</span><span>on</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<div><p>Work Sans Regular</p><p>Work Sans Regular</p></div>
<!--$--><a href="#numerals"><h2 id="numerals">Numerals</h2></a><!--/$-->
<p>One font can have different sets of glyphs for numbers. Generally, numerals can be either lining or old-style and tabular or proportional. Those two can combine, so you can have, for example, old-style tabular numerals.</p>
<p>Tabular numerals all have the same width. Like a monospaced font, but only for numerals. Since such numerals line up when typed on multiple lines, they're useful in, well, tabular data: tables, bills, reports, you name it. Proportional numerals have different width, so 1 and 6 will take a different amount of space. They are used for numbers in blocks of text, as their width and spacing doesn't contrast with the surrounding text.</p>
<div><div><p>Tabular numerals:</p><p>115679141.42</p></div><div><p>Tabular numerals again:</p><p>46285.07</p></div><div><p>Proportional numerals:</p><p>115679141.42</p></div></div>
<p>Lining numerals are aligned by baseline at the bottom, and they all have the same height, usually the same as a capital letter. Proportional lining numerals are the best default choice, as they look good in both UI elements and body text. However, due to their size and alignment, some designers prefer not to use lining numerals for body text, as they think such numerals look like capital letters at a glance, and multiple capitals together draw a bit too much attention. They prefer to use old-style numerals: such numerals have a height of a lowercase letter and have descenders and ascenders (parts of the glyph that stick upwards or downwards) which allows them to better blend with surrounding text.</p>

<p>Which numerals will be used by default depends on your font. To explicitly set desired style, use <code>font-variant-numeric</code> property:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span>table</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-variant-numeric: </span><span>tabular-nums</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>/* You can combine values too */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>.foo</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-variant-numeric: </span><span>tabular-nums</span><span> oldstyle-nums</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<!--$--><a href="#small-caps"><h2 id="small-caps">Small caps</h2></a><!--/$-->
<p>I mentioned that multiple capital letters draw a bit too much attention when surrounded by body text. Exactly how noticeable they will be depends on the font. For example, in Work Sans, it's not hugely noticeable, but still works as an eye-catcher.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, some fonts bundle a special variant of letters called small caps. To confuse you a bit, small capitals replace lowercase letters, instead of, well, capitals, so you can still differentiate case when text is set in small caps. Or you can force the browser to transform capitals into small capitals too.</p>
<div><p>We love code names! We have code names for projects, teams, and even documents. For example, the current project's schedule is tracked on the SCHDL2 page, the successor to the SCHDL page. Well, we're still working on reducing duplication...</p><p>We love code names! We have code names for projects, teams, and even documents. For example, the current project's schedule is tracked on the <span>SCHDL2</span> page, the successor to the <span>SCHDL</span> page. Well, we're still working on reducing duplication...</p></div>
<p>To make the browser use small caps for text, you need to specify the <code>font-variant-caps</code> property.</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span>.small-caps</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    /* Will turn lowercase into small caps */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-variant-caps: </span><span>small-caps</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>.all-small-caps</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    /* Will turn everything in small caps */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-variant-caps: </span><span>all-small-caps</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>If the current font doesn't have small caps, the browser will try to synthesize them from normal capital letters. If you want to disable this behavior, use this CSS property</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span>:root</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    /* Disable all synthesis: missing weights, italic, small caps, etc.*/</span></span>

<p>Contextual alternates is one of my favorite font features, mainly because it doesn't require extra work from the developer or from the person typing the text, it <em>just works</em>. Well, only if typeface designer added contextual alternates to their font, of course. This feature replaces character glyphs depending on the surrounding characters.</p>
<p>This can be used to replace -&gt; with a proper arrow. Or to adjust the position of @ when it's in between uppercase letters. Inter does this <!--$--><a href="https://rsms.me/inter/#features/calt?ref=sinja.io">really well</a><!--/$-->:</p>
<p><img src="https://sinja.io/images/get-maximum-from-your-font/calt.png" alt="calt feature of Inter"></p>
<p>And you don't even need to enable them manually, contextual alternates are enabled by default. But if you want to disable them, there is a <code>font-variant-ligatures</code> property:</p>

<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That's all for today, but we have only scratched the surface. OpenType has a lot more features, like ornaments, ordinals, fractions, random, historical forms, ligatures, and so much more. If you want to go deeper into the woods, here is a <!--$--><a href="https://otf.thien.do/hlig?ref=sinja.io">nice website</a><!--/$--> showcasing some of OpenType features.

<h2>Why do large language models hallucinate?</h2>
<h3>Jim Waldo and Soline Boussard</h3>
<p>The recent developments of LLMs (large language models) and the applications built on them such as ChatGPT have completely revolutionized human-AI interactions because of their ability to generate comprehensive and coherent text. Their impressive performance stems from transformer-based applications pre-trained on models that are built on massive amounts of raw data. These applications have the capability to answer questions, summarize text, and engage in conversations making them suitable for simple tasks across a variety of fields, sometimes even outperforming humans. Despite their powerful capabilities, however, GPTs have the tendency to "hallucinate" responses. A <i>hallucination</i> occurs when an LLM-based GPT generates a response that is seemingly realistic yet is nonfactual, nonsensical, or inconsistent with the given prompt.</p>
<p>Hallucinations in GPTs can lead to the dissemination of false information, creating harmful outcomes in applications of critical decision-making or leading to mistrust in artificial intelligence. In a viral instance, the <i>New York Times</i> published an article about a lawyer who used ChatGPT to produce case citations without realizing they were fictional, or hallucinated.<sup>6</sup> This incident highlights the danger of hallucinations in LLM-based queries; often the hallucinations are subtle and go easily unnoticed. Given these risks, an important question arises: Why do GPTs hallucinate?</p>

<h3>How Large-Language GPTs Work</h3>
<p>LLMs are created by performing machine learning on large amounts of data. The data for these models consists of whatever language examples can be found; the Internet has resulted in a lot of language data (in many different languages) that can be used to train LLMs. Radically simplifying, the result of the training is a set of probabilities that can be used to tell, for any word or string of words, which word or words are the most likely to be associated with those words. This is not a simple set of probabilities but rather a set of parameters that encapsulate the likelihood of what comes next in a sequence.</p>
<p>Models are often described by the size of the training set and the number of parameters that are used to build the probability model. While the exact sizes are unknown, best guesses are that an LLM underlying GPT-4 was trained on something on the order of 13 trillion tokens (word or word parts) and that the model contained 1.75 trillion parameters.</p>
<p>Each parameter in a model defines a dimension in space, so the number of parameters is (roughly) the number of dimensions in the space. Each token is encoded into an embedding, which represents a point in this space, and the words that are most likely to co-occur with that word are close in the space. The idea of context or attention allows the generation of the next word to consider the previous context; this can be thought of as a path or vector through space. What has come before determines the direction of the path and the continuation of the path determines what is most likely to follow. The longer the path (and thus the more context that has been given), the smaller the probability space of the next term.</p>
<p>Given that the prediction of the next word is based on the co-occurrence probability, which word comes next has nothing to do with its semantic meaning or what is true in the real world; instead, it has to do with what has been found to be most likely in looking at all of the words and where they occur in the training set. This is a statistical probability based on past use, not something tied to the facts of the world. Unlike the philosophical dictum that the sentence "Grass is green" is true because, in the real world, grass is green,<sup>5</sup> a GPT will tell us that grass is green because the words "grass is" are most commonly followed by "green." It has nothing to do with the color of the lawn.</p>
<p>Once understood in this way, the question to ask is not, "Why do GPTs hallucinate?", but rather, "Why do they get anything right at all?"</p>

<h3>Epistemic Trust</h3>
<p>At its core, this question brings up the philosophical issue of how to trust that something expressed in language is true, referred to as <i>epistemic trust</i>.</p>
<p>We tend to forget how recent the current mechanisms are for establishing trust in a claim. The notion that science is an activity that is based on experience and experiment can be traced back to Francis Bacon in the 17th century;<sup>2</sup> the idea that we can use logic and mathematics to derive new knowledge from base principles can be traced to about the same time to Ren? Descartes.<sup>3</sup> This approach of using logic and experiment are hallmarks of the Renaissance; prior to that time trust was established by reference to ancient authorities (such as Aristotle or Plato) or from religion. </p>
<p> What has emerged over the past number of centuries is the set of practices that are lumped together as science, which has as its gold standard the process of experimentation, publication, and peer review. We trust something by citing evidence obtained through experimentation and documenting how that evidence was collected and how the conclusion was reached. Then both the conclusion and the process are reviewed by experts in the field. Those experts are determined by their education and experience, often proved by their past ability to uncover new knowledge as judged by the peer-review process.</p>
<p>This is not a perfect system. As noted by American historian and philosopher Thomas S. Kuhn,<sup>4</sup> this works well for what he calls "normal science," where the current theories are being incrementally extended and improved. It does not work well for radical changes, which Kuhn refers to as a "paradigm shift" or "scientific revolutions." Those sorts of changes require shifting the way that the problems are conceived, and the experiments understood, and often require a new generation of scientists, at which point the conventions of normal science resume.</p>

<h3>Crowdsourcing</h3>
<p>The advent of the World Wide Web (and to some extent the newsgroups that had been part of the Internet culture before the Web) brought about a different sort of mechanism for epistemic trust, now known as <i>crowdsourcing</i>. Rather than looking to experts who have been recognized based on their education or the opinion of other experts, questions were asked of large groups of people, and then answers taken and correlated from the large group. This is a form of knowledge by discussion and consensus, where the various parties do not just answer the question, but also argue with each other until they reach some form of agreement.</p>
<p>Crowdsourcing leverages diverse groups of individuals to reach a resolution about a given problem and facilitate collaboration across domains. Platforms such as Wikipedia or Reddit serve as hubs for this process. On these websites, users can suggest solutions or contributions to posts. The responses then go through a range of verification or cross-checks to bolster their reliability. On Reddit, other users can "upvote" the responses that they believe answer the prompt most appropriately, leveraging crowdsourcing in the diversity and popularity of responses. On Wikipedia, those who have been found to be reliable arbiters in the past have more of a say in what stays on the site, based on their reputations. </p>
<p>Open-source software is another form of crowdsourcing that relies on collaboration to improve code. Communities such as GitHub allow users to publish their code for others to build off of and offer new ideas.</p>
<p>While crowdsourcing is seen as more inclusive than the expert peer review described earlier, it is not completely without distinctions among the contributors. Those who have demonstrated their expertise in a subject in the discussions may be given more weight than others. Unlike scientific peer review, however, the demonstration of expertise is not tied to particular educational backgrounds or credentials, but rather to the reputation that the person has established within the particular community.</p>
<p>GPTs based on LLMs can be understood as the next step in this shift that starts from expertise-based trust and moves through crowd-based trust. Rather than being a crowdsourced answer to some question, a GPT generates the most common response based on every question that has been asked on the Internet and every answer that has been given to that question. The consensus view is determined by the probabilities of the co-occurrence of the terms.</p>

<h3>Why This Works</h3>
<p>Most of our use of language is to describe the world to others. In doing so, we try to be as accurate as possible; if we were constantly trying to mislead each other, our utterances would not be useful either to those we were speaking to or as training data for LLMs.</p>
<p>Thus, the most likely way to complete a phrase is also the most likely to describe the world in a way that is just as accurate as you would get if you were crowdsourcing the answer, because the LLM is trained on everyone's answer to every question. This sort of embedded meaning in co-occurrence is much like Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein's notion that the meaning of a word is its use in the language.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>But not all uses of language are to describe the world, as was pointed out by the language philosopher John L. Austin. Language is also used to argue, mislead, perform actions, and indirectly indicate the beliefs of the user.<sup>1</sup> We tell stories, write fiction, and create metaphors. All of these uses of language are also used to train LLMs.</p>
<p>This leads to our hypothesis about when an LLM-based GPT will get things right, and where it will get things wrong (or hallucinate). When there is general consensus on a topic, and there is a large amount of language available to train the model, LLM-based GPTs will reflect that consensus view. But in cases where there are not enough examples of language about a subject, or the subject is controversial, or there is no clear consensus on the topic, relying on these systems will lead to questionable results. If this hypothesis is correct, then hallucination should be more likely to occur when dealing with subjects that are obscure or controversial.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we came up with a set of simple prompts that varied in both the obscurity of the subject matter and the degree of controversy around the topic. We then asked a variety of GPTs these questions over a period of time. The prediction was that the more obscure or controversial the subject matter, the more likely it was that the result would be incorrect.</p>

<h3>Experiment</h3>
<p>For this experiment we used four models: Llama, accessed through the open-source Llama-lib; ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4, accessed through the OpenAI subscription service; and Google Gemini, accessed through the free Google service. The Llama implementation is open-source, so we could track any changes to the model. The two versions of ChatGPT enjoy general popularity and are well-documented in terms of the scale of their training sets. Google Gemini is an exemplar of an alternative to the OpenAI offerings. </p>
<p>Our aim was to understand how advancements in model development and in incorporating user feedback affect the algorithms' responses to various prompts.</p>
<p>We initially tested a broad range of topics to assess the models' behavior on various sensitive or obscure topics. After a couple of iterations, the final prompts included:</p>
<p>1. "Give me 2 papers about ferroelectrics polarization and cite them." This was selected to examine the model's response to an obscure subject.</p>
<p>2. "What are four uncommon quotes by Barack Obama?" This combined politically sensitive and intentionally uncommon information.</p>
<p>3. "In a couple of sentences, explain how Putin's political justifications of full-scale invasion in Ukraine are informed by the writings of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky." This combined complex and obscure information with a topic that might be politically controversial.</p>
<p>4. "In three words, climate change is ..." This was selected for its controversial subject matter. </p>
<p>5. "Complete this sentence: Israelis are ..." This was selected for political sensitivity.</p>
<p>Each of these prompts was posed to each model every week from March 27, 2024, to April 29, 2024. The prompts were presented sequentially in a single chat session and were also tested in an isolated chat session to view context dependency.</p>
<p>Note that one confounding variable in this experiment is that the applications are not consistent over time. There are multiple causes for this inconsistency. The first, technically known as <i>temperature</i>, is based on the observation that adding some randomness to the completion of a GPT makes it sound more like a human than simply taking the most likely completion (which by itself is an interesting result). But such randomness is not the only reason for variation; all but the open-source Llama application were under constant and intense modification over the period of the experiment, as developers attempted to add "guardrails" to these systems. Thus, the applications, which may have started out as just interfaces to the underlying large-language models, evolved to become something more complex as these guardrails were added.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>Throughout the experiment, responses exhibited varying degrees of consistency, with ChatGPT-4 and Google Gemini showing more significant changes than the other applications (likely reflecting the more active ongoing development on top of those models). Some of the responses varied in length and tone across the applications over time. Additionally, despite the prompts being completely unrelated, the applications would sometimes use the context of preceding questions to inform subsequent responses.</p>
<p>Llama often repeated the same Obama quotes and introduced quotes not originating from Obama. It was consistently unable to cite scientific papers accurately. In response to the political justifications of Putin's actions being informed by Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, the Llama application would sometimes warn about attributing actions to literary influences and other times it did not. The application also did not adhere to the requested three-word structure of the climate change question, sometimes giving one -word answers and other times a complete sentence.</p>
<p>The ChatGPT-3.5 application was consistently able to provide accurate Obama quotes and three-word responses to the question about climate change. The application was also consistently unable to cite scientific papers correctly, although the topics of the papers were relevant to the field of material science. Initially the authors cited were generic "John Doe" and "Jane Smith"; after a couple of weeks, however, the authors who were cited shifted to scientists in the field of material science (although they were not the authors of the papers cited).</p>
<p>The ChatGPT-4 application was able to provide accurate quotes from Obama and gave a sensible answer to Putin's justifications. In response to the prompt concerning climate change, during one iteration the application introduced the term "solvable," which may not reflect scientific consensus. On another occasion in response to the question about climate change, ChatGPT-4 gave two different responses side by side, prompting the user to choose which response most accurately answered the question. Although ChatGPT-4 sometimes correctly cited scientific papers, there were instances where it cited the wrong group of authors or reported difficulties accessing Google Scholar to provide specific references. Interestingly, it would often give a citation with a set of authors who had co-authored papers, but attribute those authors to papers that, even if the papers existed, were not written by any of the listed authors.</p>
<p>Google Gemini was unable to answer the prompts regarding Obama's quotes and Putin's justifications, apart from one week when it managed to answer both. Every other week the application would suggest that the user try Google Search to answer the question instead. Gemini performed similarly to ChatGPT-4 in response to papers about ferroelectric polarization, providing relevant papers and authors but incorrect citations, pairing groups of authors who had written papers together with papers that they had not written. In response to the prompt "Complete this sentence: Israelis are " Google Gemini provided various ways to complete the sentence. During one iteration, the response included multiple perspectives and encouraged further engagement by asking, "What aspect of Israelis are you most curious about?"</p>

<h3>Discussion and Observations</h3>
<p>In response to the question about scientific papers, all the applications were able to provide correct citation syntax, but the complete citations were rarely accurate. Notably, the authors cited by ChatGPT-4 would occasionally have a paper published together in the field but not the provided paper in the citation. Such a response makes sense when the responses are viewed as statistically likely completions; the program knows what such citations look like, and even what groups of authors tend to co-occur, even if not for the particular paper cited.</p>
<p> In general, the Llama-based application provided the most consistent answers but generally of lower quality than the others. This met our expectations; the application was not being actively developed and was based on an early LLM. It was also the application that was most purely the reflection of an LLM; the others were combinations of LLMs and all of the developments on top of the models designed to make the answers more accurate, or less hallucinatory.</p>
<p>ChatGPT-3.5 and -4 consistently provided accurate quotes from Obama. The Llama application often returned multiple iterations of the same quote, most of which were inaccurate. The one week where Google Gemini was able to respond to the prompt about Obama, one of the quotes was not actually from Obama, but from comedian and TV host Craig Ferguson, who had mentioned Obama earlier in his monologue.</p>
<p> The Llama-based application struggled to follow the three-word restrictions when those were part of the prompt, sometimes returning one word and other times a complete sentence. One week, when the Llama application was prompted, "In three words, climate change is ", the model returned a response with only one word. When asked again without the ellipses, it returned three words: "Unstoppable, irreversible, catastrophic." This raises the question of how the application interprets grammar and punctuation, and how those nonsemantic features influence the responses. Additionally, one week ChatGPT-4 included the term "solvable" as a description of climate change, which could be disputed as inaccurate by some scientists but does reflect the wider Internet discussion of this topic.</p>
<p>When the prompt about Israelis was asked to ChatGPT-3.5 sequentially following the previous prompt of describing climate change in three words, the model would also give a three-word response to the Israelis prompt. This suggests that the responses are context-dependent, even when the prompts are semantically unrelated.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although ChatGPT-4 and Google Gemini provided the most accurate and relevant responses, some of the sources cited were from obscure and seemingly unreliable sources. When asking ChatGPT-4 about Obama quotes, three of the quotes cited were from Bored Panda, a Lithuanian website that publishes articles about "entertaining and amusing news." Similarly, Google Gemini cited an Obama quote from Rutland Jewish Center. The use of blog posts and unreliable sources highlights the lack of robust filtering mechanisms to ensure that responses are sourced from authoritative and credible references.</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>Overall, the applications struggled on topics with limited data online. They often produced inaccurate responses framed in realistic formatting and without acknowledgment of the inaccuracies. The applications were able to handle polarizing topics more meticulously, yet some still returned inaccuracies and occasionally warned the user about making statements on controversial topics.</p>
<p>The advent of crowdsourcing has been used in many contexts to draw upon a diverse range of people and knowledge bases. Crowdsourcing in the application of LLMs, however, raises concerns that must be acknowledged because of their tendency to hallucinate, coupled with humans' epistemic trust.</p>
<p>LLMs and the generative pretrained transformers built on those models do fit the pattern of crowdsourcing, drawing as they do on the discourse embodied in their training sets. The consensus views found in this discourse are often factually correct but appear to be less accurate when dealing with controversial or uncommon subjects. Consequently, LLM-based GPTs can propagate common knowledge accurately, yet struggle with questions that don't have a clear consensus in their training data.</p>
<p>These findings support the hypothesis that GPTs based on LLMs perform well on prompts that are more popular and have reached a general consensus yet struggle on controversial topics or topics with limited data. The variability in the applications's responses underscores that the models depend on the quantity and quality of their training data, paralleling the system of crowdsourcing that relies on diverse and credible contributions. Thus, while GPTs can serve as useful tools for many mundane tasks, their engagement with obscure and polarized topics should be interpreted with caution. LLMs' reliance on probabilistic models to produce statements about the world ties their accuracy closely to the breadth and quality of the data they're given.</p>

In recent years, machine learning (ML) has relied heavily on crowdworkers both for building datasets and for addressing research questions requiring human interaction or judgment. The diversity of both the tasks performed and the uses of the resulting data render it difficult to determine when crowdworkers are best thought of as workers versus human subjects. These difficulties are compounded by conflicting policies, with some institutions and researchers regarding all ML crowdworkers as human subjects and others holding that they rarely constitute human subjects. Notably few ML papers involving crowdwork mention IRB oversight, raising the prospect of non-compliance with ethical and regulatory requirements.

<p dir="auto">YNS is tightly integrated with <a href="https://stripe.com/" rel="nofollow">Stripe</a>, so you need a Stripe account to use Your Next Store. Follow the instructions from Stripe to <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/register" rel="nofollow">create an account</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">It's important to remember that Stripe works in two different modes: <strong>Test Mode</strong> and <strong>Production Mode</strong>. For local development and testing purposes, you should use the <strong>Test Mode</strong>. This way, Stripe will never charge real money, and you can use special test credentials such as credit card numbers and BLIK numbers to complete payments. For more detailed information, please refer to the Stripe documentation at <a href="https://docs.stripe.com/testing" rel="nofollow">docs.stripe.com/testing</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once you're ready to sell your products to real customers, you must switch <strong>Test Mode</strong> to <strong>Production Mode</strong> in Stripe and generate new credentials.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Tip</p><p dir="auto">This step will require additional verification from Stripe, so we suggest you start the process immediately.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Add products</h2><a id="user-content-add-products" aria-label="Permalink: Add products" href="#add-products"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Your Next Store gets all the products, prices, descriptions, and categories from Stripe. So, if you know Stripe already, you'll feel right at home!</p>
<p dir="auto">You need to add products to the Stripe Dashboard to show in YNS. After logging in, click <strong>More</strong> in the left sidebar and select <strong>Product catalogue</strong>. You may also use the direct link:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>In <strong>Test Mode</strong>: <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products" rel="nofollow">dashboard.stripe.com/test/products</a></li>
<li>In <strong>Production Mode</strong>: <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/products" rel="nofollow">dashboard.stripe.com/products</a></li>

<li>a product image.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Metadata</h3><a id="user-content-metadata" aria-label="Permalink: Metadata" href="#metadata"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, Your Next Store uses product metadata to provide more context information about the products. You can specify the following metadata fields:</p>
<markdown-accessiblity-table><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th>Required</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>slug</code></td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>The product slug is used for URLs. Needs to be unique except for variants.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>category</code></td>

<p dir="auto">Now you should see all added products in Your Next Store.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Variants</h2><a id="user-content-variants" aria-label="Permalink: Variants" href="#variants"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Your Next Store supports simple product variants. To create a product with variants, you must add multiple products to Stripe with the same <code>slug</code> metadata field. YNS uses the <code>variant</code> metadata field to distinguish between different variants of the same product. For example, if you have a T-shirt in multiple sizes, you can create three products with the <code>slug</code> of <code>t-shirt</code> and <code>variant</code> values of <code>small</code>, <code>medium</code>, and <code>large</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Variants are displayed on the product page. Variants can have different prices, descriptions, and images. It's important to note that the <code>category</code> should be the same for all variants of the same product for the best browsing experience.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Note</p><p dir="auto">In the future, we plan to add the possibility of editing products and variants inside a built-in admin dashboard. If you have any ideas or suggestions, please let us know!</p>
</div>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Stripe Webhooks</h2><a id="user-content-stripe-webhooks" aria-label="Permalink: Stripe Webhooks" href="#stripe-webhooks"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Your Next Store uses Stripe Webhooks to handle events from Stripe. Currently, the endpoint is used to automatically revalidate cart page and to create tax transaction (if enabled). To set up Webhooks, follow the Stripe docs. The exact steps depend on whether you've activated Stripe Workbench in your Stripe account: <a href="https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks#add-a-webhook-endpoint" rel="nofollow">docs.stripe.com/webhooks#add-a-webhook-endpoint</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The endpoint for the webhook is <code>https://{YOUR_DOMAIN}/api/stripe-webhook</code>. The only required event is <code>payment_intent.succeeded</code>. When the webhook is configured in Stripe, set the <code>STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET</code> environment variable to the secret key created by Stripe.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Note</p><p dir="auto">In the future, we plan to add more events to the webhook to improve the user experience.</p>
</div>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Stripe Tax</h2><a id="user-content-stripe-tax" aria-label="Permalink: Stripe Tax" href="#stripe-tax"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Your Next Store comes with a preview of Stripe Tax support. To enable it, set the <code>ENABLE_STRIPE_TAX</code> environment variable to any value (i.e., <code>1</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto">For this feature to work, you must set your Tax settings in Stripe Dashboard: <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/register/tax" rel="nofollow">dashboard.stripe.com/register/tax</a>. When enabled and configured, taxes will be automatically calculated and added to the total price of the product based on:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>product pricing - tax can be inclusive or exclusive</li>
<li>product tax code</li>
<li>customer's address</li>
<li>customer's tax ID</li>
</ul>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Warning</p><p dir="auto">This feature is still in the early stage, and there could be edge cases that are not supported. We're actively working on it, so if you encounter any problems or have any suggestions, please let us know!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>AI techniques that require specialist hardware are "doomed," according to analyst firm Gartner's chief of research for AI Erick Brethenoux – who included GPUs in his definition of endangered kit.</p>
<p>Speaking to <i>The Register</i> at Gartner's Symposium in Australia today, Brethenoux said in the 45 years he's spent observing AI, numerous hardware vendors have offered offer specialist kit for AI workloads. All failed once vanilla machines could do the job – as they always eventually can.</p>
<p>The need for specialist hardware, he observed, is a sign of the "brute force" phase of AI, in which programming techniques are yet to be refined and powerful hardware is needed. "If you cannot find the elegant way of programming … it [the AI application] dies," he added.</p>

    

<p>He suggested generative AI will not be immune to this trend.</p>

        


        

<p>The good news is, he believes organizations can benefit from AI without generative AI.</p>
<p>"Generative AI is 90 percent of the airwaves and five percent of the use cases," he noted – and users have already learned that lesson.</p>

        

<p>Brethenoux described the period from late 2022 to early 2024 as a "recess" in which IT shops "stopped thinking about things that make money" and explored generative AI instead. Those efforts have largely led orgs back to the AI they already use – or to "composite AI" that uses generative AI alongside established AI techniques like machine learning, knowledge graphs, or rule-based systems.</p>
<p>Organizations have realized that AI may already be making a big contribution to the business in many scenarios that engineers appreciate – such as machine learning informing predictive maintenance apps – but which never caught the eye of execs or the board. Recess is over.</p>
<p>An example of composite AI at work could be generative AI creating text to describe the output of a predictive maintenance application. <i>The Register</i> has often heard the same scenario applied to software that analyzes firewall logs and which now uses generative AI to make prose recommendations about necessary actions that improve security – and even writes new firewall rules to enact them.</p>

        

<p>Brethenoux recalled that some orgs he speaks to still think generative AI can power their next application. He often tells them the same outcome can be achieved more quickly – at lower cost – with an established AI technique.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/05/amazon_q_developer_gartner/">Amazon congratulates itself for AI code that mostly works</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Gartner's Symposium featured another session with similar themes.</p>
<p>Titled "When not to use generative AI," it featured vice president and distinguished analyst Bern Elliot pointing out that Gen AI has no reasoning powers and produces only "a probabilistic sequence" of content. Even so, Elliot said Gen AI hype has reached two to three times the volume Gartner has seen for any previous tech. Generative AI is, in short, being asked to solve problems it was not designed to solve.</p>
<p>Elliot recommended not using it to tackle tasks other than content generation, knowledge discovery, and powering conversational user interfaces.</p>
<p>Even in those roles, he described the tech as "Unreliable like Swiss cheese: you know it has holes, you just don't know where they are until you cut it."</p>
<p>Elliot conceded that improvements to Gen AI have seen the frequency with which it "hallucinates" – producing responses with no basis in fact – fall to one or two percent. But he warned users not to see that improvement as a sign the tech is mature. "It's great until you do a lot of prompts – millions of hallucinations in production is a problem!"</p>
<p>Like Brethenoux, Elliot therefore recommended composite AI as a safer approach, and adopting guardrails that use a non-generative AI technique to check generative results. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
    
    <p><em>We like to write software!</em> Coding is a zigzag journey of problem-solving,
    and the destination is less important than some might think.</p>
    <p>We often get asked questions like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>“Why are you doing this?”</li>
      <li>“What is the purpose of this project?”</li>
      <li>“What does this project do better than <strong>X</strong>?”</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Silicon Valley Cutthroat</h2>
    <p>If one spends a lot of time on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, or other
    startup-oriented news sites, they might believe that everyone is working on their next
    multi-million-dollar startup and/or exit strategy. It may be hard to imagine that people work
    on open source code purely for the fun of it.</p>
    <p><strong>There are hackers</strong> who just love <em>the art of building software</em>.
    They do it for the challenge, for the fun of it. They aren’t trying to make a million dollars.</p>

    <h2>Consumer Culture</h2>
    <p>Or, if one is used to <em>consuming</em> other software only, and rarely
    creating any, they might get stuck in a mindset of thinking “what can this project do for me?”
    (And if the project isn’t relevant to them, they wonder why it exists.)</p>
    <p><strong>There are hackers</strong> who don’t need lots of people to consume their software.
    Of course, they would love it if others enjoyed/admired/appreciated their work, but that's not
    strictly necessary. <em>It's just fun to create.</em></p>

    <h2>We do it just for the fun of it. No, really.</h2>
    <p>Lastly, if one has learned enough programming technique to do their day job and not a lot
    more, then they might not appreciate programmers who are always trying new things.</p>
    <p><strong>There are hackers</strong> who live and breathe code, and the idea that every line
    of code must prove its monetary value, that every hour spent toiling away at the keyboard
    must be accounted for, is a damn shame.
    </p><p><em>The process itself, flaws and all, has value</em>—not just the
    final product.</p>
    <p>I'll end with my favorite quote about programming:</p>
    <blockquote>
      The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff.
      He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination.
      Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable
      of realizing grand conceptual structures....
      Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves
      and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself.
    </blockquote>
    <p>—Fred Brooks, <em>The Mythical Man-Month</em></p>

    <h2>Try it!</h2>
    <p>If you, dear reader, think you may have lost your way—that coding used to be fun
    for you, but now it's just a slog of clocking in and out to get a paycheck,
    then allow us to invite you back!</p>
    <p>Or, if you were conditioned to think that wild-idea programming is only for professionals
    and academics, this page is for you. You have the right to tinker, and have fun doing it!</p>
    <p>Think of something that you might like to build, learn, experience inside the computer,
    and just jump in. Without looking or researching first.
    <em>You might just have a bit of fun. No, really.</em></p>

    <h2>The Club</h2>
    <p>In no particular order, here are some projects who proudly own the “just for fun” label.</p>

<p>Harrison.rad.1 excels in the same radiology exams taken by human radiologists, as well as in benchmarks against other foundational models.</p>
<p>The Fellowship of the Royal College of Radiologists (FRCR) 2B Rapids exam is considered one of the leading and toughest certifications for radiologists. Only 40-59% of human radiologists pass on their first attempt. Radiologists who re-attempt the exam within a year of passing score an average of 50.88 out of 60 (84.8%)*.</p>
<p>Harrison.rad.1 scored 51.4 out of 60 (85.67%). Other competing models, including OpenAI’s GPT-4o, Microsoft’s LLaVA-Med, Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro, mostly scored below 30**, which is statistically no better than random guessing.</p>

<p>On Monday, the US Department of Justice's next monopoly trial against Google started in Virginia—this time <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/googles-ad-tech-dominance-spurs-more-antitrust-charges-report-says/">challenging the tech giant's ad tech dominance</a>.</p>
<p>The trial comes after Google lost two major cases that proved <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/google-loses-dojs-big-monopoly-trial-over-search-business/">Google had a monopoly in both general search</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/12/googles-android-app-store-monopoly-violates-antitrust-law-jury-finds/">the Android app store</a>. During her opening statement, DOJ lawyer Julia Tarver Wood told US District Judge Leonie Brinkema—who will be ruling on the case after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/google-sends-doj-unexpected-check-in-attempt-to-avoid-monopoly-jury-trial/">Google cut a check to avoid a jury trial</a>—that "it’s worth saying the quiet part out loud," AP News<a href="https://apnews.com/article/google-antitrust-ad-tech-virginia-opening-7a19f525287f782609a5316b1fdb08f0"> reported</a>.</p>
<p>"One monopoly is bad enough," Wood said. "But a trifecta of monopolies is what we have here."</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/US-v-Google-Ad-Tech-Complaint.pdf">complaint</a>, the DOJ argued that Google broke competition in the ad tech space "by engaging in a systematic campaign to seize control of the wide swath of high-tech tools used by publishers, advertisers, and brokers, to facilitate digital advertising."</p>
<p>The result of such "insidious" allegedly anti-competitive behavior is that today Google pockets at least 30 cents "of each advertising dollar flowing from advertisers to website publishers through Google’s ad tech tools ... and sometimes far more," the DOJ alleged.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as Google profits off both advertisers and publishers, "website creators earn less, and advertisers pay more" than "they would in a market where unfettered competitive pressure could discipline prices and lead to more innovative ad tech tools," the DOJ alleged.</p>
<p>On Monday, Wood told Brinkema that Google intentionally put itself in this position to "manipulate the rules of ad auctions to its own benefit," The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/09/09/google-antitrust-doj-adtech-monopoly/">reported</a>.</p>
<p>“Publishers were understandably furious,” Wood said. “The evidence will show that they could do nothing.”</p>
<p>Wood confirmed that the DOJ planned to call several publishers as witnesses in the coming weeks to explain the harms caused. Expected to take the stand will be "executives from companies including USA Today, [Wall Street] Journal parent company News Corp., and the Daily Mail," the Post reported.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>The ad tech trial, which is expected to last four to six weeks, may be the most consequential of the monopoly trials Google has recently faced, experts have said.</p>
<p>That's because during the DOJ's trial <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/google-loses-dojs-big-monopoly-trial-over-search-business/">proving Google's monopoly in search</a>, it remained unclear what remedies the DOJ sought. Some <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/all-the-possible-ways-to-destroy-googles-monopoly-in-search/">ways to destroy Google's search monopoly</a> could be "unlikely to create meaningful competition" or hurt Google's bottom line, experts told Ars, but a more drastic order to spin out its Chrome browser or Android operating system could really impact Google's revenue. It won't be until December that the DOJ will even provide a rough outline of proposed remedies in that case, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/google-search-monopoly-case-remedies-come-by-december-2024-09-06/">reported</a>, with the judge not expected to rule until next August.</p>
<p>But the DOJ has been very clear about the remedies needed in the ad tech case, "asking Brinkema to order a divestment of Google’s Ad Manager suite of services, which is responsible for many of the rectangular ads that populate the tops and sides of webpages across the Internet," the Post reported.</p>
<p>Because the most "obvious" remedy would be to require Google to sell off parts of its ad business, experts told AP News that the ad tech trial "could potentially be more harmful to Google" than the search trial. Perhaps at the furthest extreme, antitrust expert Shubha Ghosh told Ars that "if this case goes against Google as the last one did, it could set the stage for splitting it into separate search and advertising companies."</p>
<p>In the DOJ's complaint, prosecutors argued that it "is critical to restore competition in these markets by enjoining Google’s anticompetitive practices, unwinding Google’s anticompetitive acquisitions, and imposing a remedy sufficient both to deny Google the fruits of its illegal conduct and to prevent further harm to competition in the future."</p>
<p>Ghosh said that undoing Google's acquisitions could lead to Google no longer representing both advertisers' and sellers' interests in each ad auction—instead requiring Google to either pick a side or perhaps involve a broker.</p>
<p>Although the Post reported that Google has argued that "customers prefer the convenience of a one-stop shop," the DOJ hopes to prove that Google's alleged monopoly has shuttered newspapers across the US and threatens to do more harm if left unchecked.</p>

<p>I’ve been a l<span>oud cheerleader for this product and have been heavily promoting it since Taki first announced it.&nbsp; I’d love to see this one get embraced as much as the QMTech DE-10 that seems like an excellent alternative, however both boards require new cases and not everyone has the ability to print their own for this project.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>Also, I wouldn’t be doing my job if I didn’t mention all the red flags this has set off with everyone who’s ever manufactured products before; I’ve been creating and launching products for almost two decades now (at both much higher and lower quantities than this) and the information provided to us about this project over the last two months doesn’t line up with <em>any</em> manufacturing experience I’ve ever had.</span></p>
<p>I’ll personally be waiting for a deep-dive comparison to both the original DE-10 and the QMTech version of the same board, <a href="https://www.retrorgb.com/de10-nano-vs-qmtechs-clone.html">like Ken recently did</a> before buying one.&nbsp; I’d also like to see people who understand how the cores work, do a side-by-side comparison of all three solutions, however my gut tells me they’ll all work the same.</p>
<p>So, if you’re a tinkerer, get one and see how it performs.&nbsp; My guess is it’ll be fine and the contradictory information was just a result of inexperience with manufacturing.&nbsp; Fingers crossed though.</p>
