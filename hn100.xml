            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://entropytown.com/articles/2025-11-13-world-model-lecun-feifei-li/">https://entropytown.com/articles/2025-11-13-world-model-lecun-feifei-li/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45923326">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p>AI has finally reached the “we need to model the whole world” phase.</p>
<p>In the same season, Fei-Fei Li’s World Labs shipped <strong>Marble</strong>, a “multimodal world model” that turns prompts into walkable 3D scenes in your browser, and reports emerged that Meta’s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun is leaving to build a <strong>world-model</strong> startup of his own. DeepMind, meanwhile, is calling its new interactive video engine <strong>Genie 3</strong> a world model as well.</p>
<p>Same phrase. Three very different bets.</p>
<h2 id="the-week-world-models-went-mainstream">The week “world models” went mainstream</h2>
<p>World Labs has spent the year rolling out a neat narrative stack: Fei-Fei Li’s manifesto, <a href="https://drfeifei.substack.com/p/from-words-to-worlds-spatial-intelligence"><em>From Words to Worlds: Spatial Intelligence Is AI’s Next Frontier</em></a>, argues that language-only systems (LLMs) are a dead end and that the real frontier is “spatial intelligence” and “world models” that understand 3D space, physics and action. On top of that sits the launch of <a href="https://www.worldlabs.ai/blog/marble-world-model">Marble</a>, which promises anyone can now generate editable 3D worlds from text, images, videos or simple layouts.</p>
<p>At almost the same time, outlets like Nasdaq reported that LeCun is preparing to leave Meta and raise money for a company “focused on world models” in the very different sense he’s been sketching since his 2022 paper <em>A Path Towards Autonomous Machine Intelligence</em> (<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/metas-chief-ai-scientist-yann-lecun-depart-and-launch-ai-start-focused-world-models">Nasdaq</a>, <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BZ5a1r-kVsf">paper PDF</a>).</p>
<p>On Hacker News, the Marble launch thread is full of arguments about Gaussian splats and game engines (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45902732">HN</a>). The LeCun thread is full of arguments about whether Meta has chosen “AI slopware” over proper research. Same word, different fights.</p>
<p>To understand why, we have to start with the only thing anyone can actually click.</p>
<h2 id="world-labs-world-model-gaussian-splats-for-humans">World Labs’ world model: Gaussian splats for humans</h2>
<p><strong>Marble</strong>, as shipped today, is a full-stack 3D content pipeline:</p>
<ul>
<li>It takes <strong>text prompts, single images, short videos or blocky 3D layouts</strong>.</li>
<li>It hallucinates a <strong>3D representation</strong> of a scene.</li>
<li>It lets you <strong>walk around</strong> that scene in a web or VR viewer and tweak it with an in-browser editor called Chisel.</li>
<li>It exports as <strong>Gaussian splats</strong>, standard <strong>meshes</strong> (OBJ/FBX) or flat <strong>video</strong> for downstream tools (<a href="https://www.worldlabs.ai/blog/marble-world-model">Marble docs</a>, <a href="https://radiancefields.com/world-labs-unveils-new-model-marble-a-generative-world-model">RadianceFields explainer</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>For people who ship VR apps or game levels, a pipeline that goes “prompt → 3D world → export to Three.js / Unity” is extremely useful. World Labs even ships its own Three.js renderer, Spark, specifically tuned for splats (<a href="https://radiancefields.com/world-labs-releases-spark-v0-1-9">Spark release</a>).</p>
<p>But it’s very much a <strong>3D asset</strong> story. On Marble’s own blog, “world model” sits in the same sentence as “export Gaussian splats, meshes and videos”; there is no robot in sight.</p>
<p>Hacker News users clocked that immediately. One early top-level comment, contrasting Marble with DeepMind’s video-based Genie, reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Genie delivers on-the-fly generated video that responds to user inputs in real time. Marble renders a static Gaussian Splat asset (like a 3D game engine asset) that you then render in a game engine.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another says, with the particular baffled politeness of an ML engineer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Isn’t this a Gaussian Splat model? I work in AI and, to this day, I don’t know what they mean by ‘world’ in ‘world model’.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reddit is less shy. In a thread about the first demo from the “$230m startup led by Fei-Fei Li” in r/StableDiffusion, one commenter sums it up as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Taking images and turning them into 3D environments using gaussian splats, depth and inpainting. Cool, but that’s a 3D GS pipeline, not a robot brain.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1h53uhj/first_demo_from_world_labs_230m_startup_led_by/">Reddit thread</a>)</p>
<p>That doesn’t make Marble bad. It does make its use of “world model” slightly ambitious. To see how, you need a quick primer in what a Gaussian splat actually is.</p>
<h3 id="sidebar-photogrammetry-splats-and-meshes">Sidebar: photogrammetry, splats and meshes</h3>
<p>If you’re not a 3D person, 2025’s splat discourse can sound like hand-waving. In practice, there are three characters here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Photogrammetry</strong> – The old guard. Take hundreds of overlapping photos of a real thing, reconstruct a <strong>polygon mesh</strong> (a shell made of tiny triangles), and bake textures on top. Great if you want to measure, collide or 3D-print.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3D Gaussian splatting</strong> – The new hotness. Represent the scene as millions of fuzzy coloured blobs (“Gaussians”) floating in space, and “splat” them onto the screen so they blend into an image. Excellent at foliage, hair and soft light; runs in real time on gaming GPUs. The canonical paper is Kerbl et al.’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04079"><em>3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering</em></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Renderers</strong> – Engines like Three.js, Unity or Unreal that take a mesh or a splat cloud and turn it into pixels.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A photogrammetry practitioner on r/photogrammetry puts the trade-off like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Use photogrammetry if you want to do something with the mesh itself, and Gaussian splatting if you want to skip all the steps and just show the scan like it is. It’s kind of a shortcut to interactive photorealism.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/photogrammetry/comments/1mqt64y/what_are_the_benefits_and_different_use_cases/">explainer thread</a>)</p>
<p>Marble lives squarely in that world: it’s a <strong>shortcut to interactive photorealism</strong>. It generates splats/meshes and hands them to a renderer. The “world” it models is the part we can see and walk around in. It’s for humans (and game engines), not for machines to think with.</p>
<p>Fei-Fei Li’s essay, however, speaks in a different register.</p>
<p>She writes about “embodied agents”, “commonsense physics” and “robots that can understand and act in the world” — all the things you would want a robot’s <strong>internal model</strong> to support. Marble is presented as “step one” on that road. The tension, and the comic potential, comes from the fact that step one is currently a very polished 3DGS viewer.</p>
<p>Ironically, Fei-Fei Li’s original manifesto, <em>From Words to Worlds</em>, never once mentions 3D Gaussian Splatting — the very technique at the heart of Marble’s output pipeline.</p>
<p>If Marble were the only “world model” on offer, you could reasonably conclude that the term has been kidnapped by marketing. Unfortunately for your hot take, Yann LeCun exists.</p>
<h2 id="lecuns-world-model-the-brain-in-the-middle">LeCun’s world model: the brain in the middle</h2>
<p>LeCun’s use of “world model” comes from control theory and cognitive science rather than from 3D graphics.</p>
<p>In <em>A Path Towards Autonomous Machine Intelligence</em> (<a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BZ5a1r-kVsf">PDF</a>), he describes a system in which:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>world model</strong> ingests streams of sensory data.</li>
<li>It learns <strong>latent state</strong>: compressed internal variables that capture “what’s going on out there”.</li>
<li>It learns to <strong>predict how that latent state will evolve</strong> when the agent (or environment) acts.</li>
<li>A separate module uses that machinery to <strong>plan</strong> and choose actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>You never see the world model directly. It doesn’t need to output pretty pictures. Its job is to let an agent think a few steps ahead.</p>
<p>JEPA-style models — “Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures” — are early instances of this approach: instead of predicting raw pixels, they predict masked or future embeddings and are trained to be <em>useful</em> representations rather than perfect renderings. LeCun has been giving talks about this since at least 2022 (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvSe0ktD95k">YouTube</a>).</p>
<p>When Nasdaq and others reported that he’s spinning out to build a world-model startup (<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/metas-chief-ai-scientist-yann-lecun-depart-and-launch-ai-start-focused-world-models">Nasdaq</a>), the reaction on HN wasn’t, “ooh, another 3D viewer.” It was:</p>
<ul>
<li>does this mean Meta has given up on this line of research in favour of GPT-ish products?</li>
<li>can a JEPA-like architecture ever match LLMs in practical usefulness?</li>
<li>is there even a market for a world model that mostly lives in diagrams and robot labs?</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you think LeCun is right or wrong, you can’t really accuse him of chasing the same thing as World Labs. One “world model” is essentially a front-end asset generator. The other is a back-end predictive brain.</p>
<p>And then there’s DeepMind, happily occupying the middle.</p>
<h2 id="deepminds-world-model-worlds-as-video">DeepMind’s world model: worlds as video</h2>
<p>DeepMind’s <strong>Genie 3</strong> model is introduced, without much modesty, as “a new frontier for world models” (<a href="https://deepmind.google/blog/genie-3-a-new-frontier-for-world-models">blog</a>).</p>
<p>From a text prompt, it generates an <strong>interactive video-like environment</strong> at 720p / 24 fps that you (or an agent) can move around in for several minutes. Objects persist across frames, you can “prompt” world events (“it starts raining”), and the whole thing functions as a tiny videogame rendered by a model instead of a traditional engine.</p>
<p>The Guardian describes it as a way for AI agents and robots to “train in virtual warehouses and ski slopes” before they ever touch the real world (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/05/google-step-artificial-general-intelligence-deepmind-agi">Guardian</a>). DeepMind is perfectly happy to connect it to the AGI narrative.</p>
<p>Where Marble generates <strong>assets</strong> and LeCun dreams of <strong>latents</strong>, Genie 3 produces <strong>simulators</strong>: online environments where you can act, observe consequences and learn.</p>
<p>On HN, when someone asks “how does Marble compare?”, a typical answer is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Genie is on-the-fly generated video that responds to user inputs in real time. Marble is a static Gaussian splat asset you render in a game engine.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, not an insult — just taxonomy.</p>
<h2 id="one-word-three-bets">One word, three bets</h2>
<p>Put all of this together and “world model” now covers at least three distinct ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>World models as interface</strong><br>
Marble is a beautiful way to go from <em>words and flat media</em> to <em>3D environments humans can edit and share</em>. The “world” is whatever your Quest headset needs next.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>World models as simulator</strong><br>
Genie-style models produce <em>continuous, controllable video worlds</em> where agents can try things, fail, and try again. The “world” is whatever keeps the game loop coherent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>World models as cognition</strong><br>
LeCun-style architectures are about <em>internal predictive state</em>. The “world” lives inside an agent as latent variables and transition functions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Fei-Fei Li’s writing borrows heavily from bucket (3) — embodied agents, intuitive physics — while Marble, so far, mostly occupies bucket (1). LeCun’s plans live squarely in (3), with the hope that someone, someday, builds a good version of (2) on top. Genie lives between (2) and (3), with occasional marketing holidays in all of them.</p>
<p>If you only look at Marble’s demo, it’s tempting to say “world model” is just 3DGS with better PR. If you only read LeCun, it’s tempting to believe language models were a historical detour and JEPA will save us all. If you only read DeepMind, it’s simulated ski slopes all the way down.</p>
<p>The truth is they’re all building different parts of the same vague ambition: <strong>give machines some structured way to think about the world, beyond next-token prediction.</strong> One group starts from the rendering, one from the physics, one from the internal code.</p>
<p>Until the jargon catches up, the safest move when you see a “world model” headline is to ask three questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is this a <strong>thing for humans to look at</strong>, a <strong>place for agents to train</strong>, or a <strong>box inside a diagram</strong>?</li>
<li>Does it output <strong>static assets</strong>, <strong>real-time frames</strong>, or mostly <strong>latent states</strong>?</li>
<li>If you knock over a virtual vase, does anything in the system remember for more than one frame?</li>
</ol>
<p>If the answers are “for humans”, “static assets” and “not really”, you’re basically looking at a very nice Gaussian splat viewer. If they’re “for agents”, “real-time” and “yes, in latent space”, then you might just be staring at the world model LeCun has been talking about — the one that, very inconveniently for demo culture, doesn’t fit in a single tweetable GIF.</p>  </div></div>]]></description>

Feel free to search on your own.</li></ul><p>This article will mainly focus on modifying IP geolocation and using WARP to get a corresponding-region IPv4 address. Unlocking streaming content and running an IDC won’t be covered in depth — refer to the link above if interested.</p><h2 id="Prerequisites"><a href="#Prerequisites" title="Prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites</h2><p>This is probably common knowledge for many, but for completeness, let’s go over it briefly.</p><h3 id="IP-Databases"><a href="#IP-Databases" title="IP Databases"></a>IP Databases</h3><p>IP database providers compile mappings from <code>IP → geographical location</code> using methods like network scanning and WHOIS lookups. They also include data such as IP threat scores and type (residential, server, or VPN). These databases are sold to users — typically websites — which then query them in the backend to display location info and perform risk assessment. A handy tool for querying multiple geolocation databases at once: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://iplark.com/">https://iplark.com/</a></p><p>Popular IP databases include Maxmind, IPInfo, and DB-IP. Smaller databases often sync data from larger ones.</p><h3 id="WARP"><a href="#WARP" title="WARP"></a>WARP</h3><p>WARP is a WireGuard-based VPN service provided by Cloudflare. While they offer an official Linux client, most people use native WireGuard to connect. WARP can provide your server with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, commonly used to add IPv4 connectivity to IPv6-only VPSes (or vice versa). One key feature of WARP is that <strong>the public IP it assigns will have the same geolocation as the IP you’re connecting from</strong> — we’ll use this property later. For a detailed WARP setup guide, check out: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://p3terx.com/archives/use-cloudflare-warp-to-add-extra-ipv4-or-ipv6-network-support-to-vps-servers-for-free.html">https://p3terx.com/archives/use-cloudflare-warp-to-add-extra-ipv4-or-ipv6-network-support-to-vps-servers-for-free.html</a></p><h2 id="Submitting-Geolocation-Correction-Requests"><a href="#Submitting-Geolocation-Correction-Requests" title="Submitting Geolocation Correction Requests"></a>Submitting Geolocation Correction Requests</h2><p>In reality, the “location” of an IP is inherently fuzzy. For instance, my <code>2a14:7c0:4d00::/40</code> block was originally allocated to Israel. But later, I bought parts of this range and announced them via BGP in Germany, the US, and Singapore (see previous article on <a href="https://blog.lyc8503.net/post/asn-4-anycast-network/">Anycast networks</a>). Meanwhile, I’m physically located in mainland China. As the owner of this IP block, I can also freely edit the <code>country</code> field in the WHOIS database — and I set it to KP (North Korea).</p><p>Because of this ambiguity, it’s nearly impossible to precisely determine an IP’s location using any single technical method. As a result, almost all geolocation databases accept public/user-submitted correction requests.</p><h3 id="Preparation"><a href="#Preparation" title="Preparation"></a>Preparation</h3><p>Before submitting any requests, let’s do a little prep work.</p><p>IP databases collect IP ranges from global routing tables. Previously, we were announcing the entire <code>2a14:7c0:4d00::/40</code> block without subdividing it in RIPE NCC, which makes it harder for databases to process smaller segments. So let’s fix that.</p><p>Log in to the RIPE Database, go to <code>My Resources → IPv6 → Create assignment</code>, and fill out the form to create a new <code>inet6num</code> (which represents an IPv6 address block):</p><ul><li><code>inet6num</code>: Enter a subnet. The smallest allowed is <code>/48</code>, so I entered <code>2a14:7c0:4d00::/48</code>. If you only own a <code>/48</code>, you can’t subdivide further — you can only edit the LIR-assigned block.</li><li><code>netname</code>: Pick a name you like</li><li><code>country</code>: Choose the country/region you want this IP block to appear in</li><li><code>admin-c</code> &amp; <code>tech-c</code>: Fill in two contact objects — use the ones you created earlier</li><li><code>status</code>: Select <code>ASSIGNED</code> to indicate it’s assigned</li></ul><p><img src="https://blog.lyc8503.net/en/post/asn-5-worldwide-servers/inet6num.png" alt="Form for creating a new inet6num"><span>Form for creating a new inet6num</span></p><p>After creation, you can see all your subnets under “My Resources”:</p><p><img src="https://blog.lyc8503.net/en/post/asn-5-worldwide-servers/specific-inet6.png" alt="Viewing subnets under the LIR-assigned block"><span>Viewing subnets under the LIR-assigned block</span></p><p>Next, update the BIRD configuration from our <a href="https://blog.lyc8503.net/post/asn-2-bgp-session/">previous article</a>, changing <code>2a14:7c0:4d00::/40</code> to <code>2a14:7c0:4d00::/48</code>, then restart BIRD.</p><p>After some time, use BGP Tools to verify that <code>2a14:7c0:4d00::/48</code> is now visible. The old <code>/40</code> page should return 404.</p><h3 id="Submitting-Correction-Requests"><a href="#Submitting-Correction-Requests" title="Submitting Correction Requests"></a>Submitting Correction Requests</h3><p>You can submit geolocation correction requests to common IP databases: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip-location-correction">Maxmind</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ipinfo.io/corrections">IPInfo</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://support.google.com/websearch/workflow/9308722?hl=en">Google</a></p><p>If asked for justification, write something like “Due to incorrect IP geolocation, I/my clients cannot access region-restricted websites” (in English). Avoid mentioning use for anonymous proxies — that might violate their correction policies.</p><p>Each database has its own review process. Some involve manual checks, and changes usually take 3 days to 2 weeks to go live. Most offer online lookup tools (like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip-web-services-demo">Maxmind’s Demo</a>) — you can use them to check progress, or use IPLark for batch queries.</p><p>In my test, IPInfo accepted my request within a week. Maxmind didn’t respond after two weeks, so I followed up via their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.maxmind.com/en/contact-corrections">contact form</a>, and they finally approved it. (Wait a bit first — only reach out after multiple failed submissions.)</p><p>(p.s. Recently, Maxmind has been rejecting requests to set location to Antarctica (AQ) — <del>probably too many people trying to go there</del>. That’s why this article uses North Korea as an example. If you really want an Antarctica IP, try the geofeed method at the end to bypass manual review.)</p><p>Below is for reference only — feel free to <del>make up</del> craft your own justification:</p><blockquote><p>Q: Hello, I am the network operator and owner of AS214775.

I have tried several times to submit data corrections using the data correction form, but no response. I have corrected the country of my IP segment in the RIPE NCC database, and some other databases such as ipinfo.io have been synchronized, but Maxmind keeps locating my IP segment to Israel. I would like to politely ask why MaxMind has not responded to my correction request?</p><p>A: Thank you for your email.

            <guid>45922550</guid>
            <pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 00:41:08 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/mini-apps-partner/">https://developer.apple.com/programs/mini-apps-partner/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45922550">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


								<h2>How it works</h2>

								<p>This program is designed for developers who host mini apps and games, which are experiences that are built using web technologies like HTML5 or JavaScript and distributed within a larger, native app. Participating apps are required to support certain App&nbsp;Store technologies, including the Declared Age Range API and the Advanced Commerce API in order to provide a safe and seamless experience for customers. As a result, program members earn 85% of <a href="#qualifying-in-app-purchase">qualifying In‑App&nbsp;Purchase</a> sales within <a href="#qualifying-mini-app">qualifying mini apps</a>.</p>

								<h3>Implement host app requirements</h3>

								<p>To be eligible for the Mini&nbsp;Apps Partner&nbsp;Program:</p>

								<ul>
									<li>Your app must be available on iOS and iPadOS on the App&nbsp;Store.</li>
									<li>You must ensure all hosted mini apps comply with applicable requirements from the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/terms/apple-developer-program-license-agreement/">Apple&nbsp;Developer Program License Agreement</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines">App&nbsp;Review Guidelines</a>, including the specific requirements listed in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#third-party-software">guideline 4.7</a> — Mini apps, mini games, streaming games, chatbots, plug-ins, and game emulators — and have provided a manifest required by guideline 4.7.4 that’s approved by Apple and includes hosted mini app metadata.</li>
									<li>You must provide metadata that follows the outlined guidance in order to identify all mini app in-app purchases (including non-qualifying) and the digital goods and services sold. This allows customers to clearly understand what purchases they’re making within your qualifying mini apps, as well as helps Apple identify qualifying In‑App&nbsp;Purchases and apply appropriate commission rate.</li>
									<li>Your app must support the following technologies: 
										<ul>
											<li><strong>The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/in-app-purchase/advanced-commerce-api/">Advanced Commerce API</a> and supporting technologies</strong> to properly merchandise qualifying mini apps and any associated purchases.</li>
											<li><strong>The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/declaredagerange">Declared Age Rating API<span></span></a></strong> to help provide age-appropriate content and experiences within your app.</li>
											<li><strong>Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/in-app-purchase/">In‑App Purchase</a> system</strong> to provide users with a familiar and trusted way to make purchases and easily check their purchase history, view, modify, or cancel subscriptions, as well as access customer support, like requesting a refund.</li>
											<li><strong>The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreserverapi/send_consumption_information"> Send Consumption Information<span></span></a></strong> endpoint in the App&nbsp;Store Server API to send information about a user’s In‑App Purchase to Apple when they request a refund. This information also helps to inform and improve the refund request process.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul>




								<h3>Join the program</h3>

								<p>If you’d like to participate in the Mini&nbsp;Apps Partner&nbsp;Program, submit a request form. Please note that you’ll need to be an Account&nbsp;Holder in the Apple&nbsp;Developer Program. You’ll be asked to provide information related to your host app, eligibility, and mini app, as well as agree to the program’s terms and conditions. If approved, you’ll receive an email confirmation that includes setup details to help you configure your offerings.</p>

								<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/mini-apps-partner-program/">Make a request<span></span></a></p>

								<h3>Submit for review</h3>

								<p>Once your app is tested and ready, you’ll <a href="https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/submit-for-review">submit</a> it for app review. Submit your app binary and generic mini app In‑App Purchase Product&nbsp;ID in App&nbsp;Store&nbsp;Connect and be sure to mention that your app uses the Advanced Commerce API and offers mini apps.</p>

								<p>If you’re currently a participant in the Mini&nbsp;Apps Partner&nbsp;Program and would like to add additional mini apps, simply update your manifest with this information as part of your submission process. To add an additional host app, be sure your app has access to the Advanced Commerce API (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/advanced-commerce/">submit a request<span></span></a> if needed) and provide an accompanying manifest describing your host app and associated mini&nbsp;apps.</p>




								<h2>Q&amp;A</h2>

								<h4 id="mini-app">What’s a mini&nbsp;app?</h4>
								<p>Mini apps are software packages, scripts, or game content that are added after app installation and executed on the device, provided such code is written in HTML5 or JavaScript, or another language approved by Apple. All such code must comply with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/terms/apple-developer-program-license-agreement/#apis-functionality">Section 3.3.1(B)</a> of the Apple Developer&nbsp;Program License Agreement.</p>

								<h4 id="qualifying-mini-app">What’s a qualifying mini&nbsp;app?</h4>
								<p>A qualifying mini app within the Mini&nbsp;Apps Partner&nbsp;Program is one that’s put out by a person or entity that’s not directly or indirectly controlled by you, nor under common control with you. “Control” for the purposes of this definition means that an entity or person possesses, directly or indirectly, the power to direct or cause the direction of the management policies of the other entity, whether through ownership of voting securities, an interest in registered capital, by contract, or otherwise.</p>

								<h4 id="qualifying-in-app-purchase">What’s a qualifying mini app In‑App Purchase?</h4>
								<p>A qualifying In‑App Purchase is the sale of any digital goods and services within a qualifying mini app, including consumable, non-consumable, auto-renewable subscriptions, and non-renewing subscriptions. These purchases are facilitated by the Advanced Commerce API. For example:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Consumables, such as currency, lives, or items, that are purchased and used immediately within a single qualifying mini app. Keep in mind that in order to qualify as eligible mini app In‑App Purchases, these purchases cannot be shared or consumed across mini apps.</li>
									<li>An auto-renewing subscription that’s purchased and accessed within a single qualifying mini app.</li>
								</ul>

								<h4>Am I eligible for the Mini&nbsp;Apps Partner&nbsp;Program if I’m already a participant in other Apple programs?</h4>
								<p>Yes. If approved, your app may participate in the Mini&nbsp;Apps Partner&nbsp;Program while also participating in Apple programs such as the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/video-partner/">Apple Video Partner Program<span></span></a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/apple-news/program/">News Partner Program<span></span></a>, or <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/">App&nbsp;Store Small&nbsp;Business Program</a>.</p>

								<h4>Can I apply for the program if I haven’t been approved for the Advanced Commerce API? </h4>
								<p>Yes. If you don’t currently have access to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/in-app-purchase/advanced-commerce-api/">Advanced Commerce API</a>, we recommend applying for Advanced Commerce API access and the Mini&nbsp;Apps Partner&nbsp;Program at the same time. In order to be approved for the Mini&nbsp;Apps Partner&nbsp;Program, you will need to have been approved for and support the Advanced Commerce API.
								</p>

								<h4>Can I use App&nbsp;Store&nbsp;Connect to manage In‑App Purchases within my hosted mini apps?</h4>
								<p>No. In order to participate in the economic benefits of the Mini&nbsp;Apps Partner&nbsp;Program, you’re required to use the Advanced Commerce API to manage any In‑App Purchases within your hosted mini apps. Learn more about <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/advancedcommerceapi/creating-skus-for-the-mini-app-partner-program">creating SKUs for the Mini&nbsp;App Partner&nbsp;Program<span></span></a>.</p>

								<h4>Where can I find more information about the technical details required for participation?</h4>
								<p>For more details and technical guidance, review our documentation on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/advancedcommerceapi/creating-skus-for-the-mini-app-partner-program">creating SKUs for the Mini&nbsp;Apps Partner&nbsp;Program<span></span></a> and the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/advancedcommerceapi/">Advanced Commerce API<span></span></a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.kubernetes.dev/blog/2025/11/12/ingress-nginx-retirement/">https://www.kubernetes.dev/blog/2025/11/12/ingress-nginx-retirement/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45921431">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>To prioritize the safety and security of the ecosystem, Kubernetes SIG Network and the Security Response Committee are announcing the upcoming retirement of <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/">Ingress NGINX</a>. Best-effort maintenance will continue until March 2026. Afterward, there will be no further releases, no bugfixes, and no updates to resolve any security vulnerabilities that may be discovered. <strong>Existing deployments of Ingress NGINX will continue to function and installation artifacts will remain available.</strong></p><p>We recommend migrating to one of the many alternatives. Consider <a href="https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/">migrating to Gateway API</a>, the modern replacement for Ingress. If you must continue using Ingress, many alternative Ingress controllers are <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/">listed in the Kubernetes documentation</a>. Continue reading for further information about the history and current state of Ingress NGINX, as well as next steps.</p><h2 id="about-ingress-nginx">About Ingress NGINX</h2><p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/">Ingress</a> is the original user-friendly way to direct network traffic to workloads running on Kubernetes. (<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/gateway/">Gateway API</a> is a newer way to achieve many of the same goals.) In order for an Ingress to work in your cluster, there must be an <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/">Ingress controller</a> running. There are many Ingress controller choices available, which serve the needs of different users and use cases. Some are cloud-provider specific, while others have more general applicability.</p><p><a href="https://www.github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx">Ingress NGINX</a> was an Ingress controller, developed early in the history of the Kubernetes project as an example implementation of the API. It became very popular due to its tremendous flexibility, breadth of features, and independence from any particular cloud or infrastructure provider. Since those days, many other Ingress controllers have been created within the Kubernetes project by community groups, and by cloud native vendors. Ingress NGINX has continued to be one of the most popular, deployed as part of many hosted Kubernetes platforms and within innumerable independent users’ clusters.</p><h2 id="history-and-challenges">History and Challenges</h2><p>The breadth and flexibility of Ingress NGINX has caused maintenance challenges. Changing expectations about cloud native software have also added complications. What were once considered helpful options have sometimes come to be considered serious security flaws, such as the ability to add arbitrary NGINX configuration directives via the “snippets” annotations. Yesterday’s flexibility has become today’s insurmountable technical debt.</p><p>Despite the project’s popularity among users, Ingress NGINX has always struggled with insufficient or barely-sufficient maintainership. For years, the project has had only one or two people doing development work, on their own time, after work hours and on weekends. Last year, the Ingress NGINX maintainers <a href="https://kccncna2024.sched.com/event/1hoxW/securing-the-future-of-ingress-nginx-james-strong-isovalent-marco-ebert-giant-swarm">announced</a> their plans to wind down Ingress NGINX and develop a replacement controller together with the Gateway API community. Unfortunately, even that announcement failed to generate additional interest in helping maintain Ingress NGINX or develop InGate to replace it. (InGate development never progressed far enough to create a mature replacement; it will also be retired.)</p><h2 id="current-state-and-next-steps">Current State and Next Steps</h2><p>Currently, Ingress NGINX is receiving best-effort maintenance. SIG Network and the Security Response Committee have exhausted our efforts to find additional support to make Ingress NGINX sustainable. To prioritize user safety, we must retire the project.</p><p>In March 2026, Ingress NGINX maintenance will be halted, and the project will be <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-retired/">retired</a>. After that time, there will be no further releases, no bugfixes, and no updates to resolve any security vulnerabilities that may be discovered. The GitHub repositories will be made read-only and left available for reference.</p><p>Existing deployments of Ingress NGINX will not be broken. Existing project artifacts such as Helm charts and container images will remain available.</p><p>In most cases, you can check whether you use Ingress NGINX by running <code>kubectl get pods \--all-namespaces \--selector app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx</code> with cluster administrator permissions.</p><p>We would like to thank the Ingress NGINX maintainers for their work in creating and maintaining this project–their dedication remains impressive. This Ingress controller has powered billions of requests in datacenters and homelabs all around the world. In a lot of ways, Kubernetes wouldn’t be where it is without Ingress NGINX, and we are grateful for so many years of incredible effort.</p><p><strong>SIG Network and the Security Response Committee recommend that all Ingress NGINX users begin migration to Gateway API or another Ingress controller immediately.</strong> Many options are listed in the Kubernetes documentation: <a href="https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/">Gateway API</a>, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/">Ingress</a>. Additional options may be available from vendors you work with.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin has landed the booster of its New Glenn mega-rocket on a drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean on just its second attempt — making it the second company to perform such a feat, following Elon Musk’s SpaceX.</p>

<p>It’s an accomplishment that will help the new rocket system become an option to send larger payloads to space, the moon, and beyond.</p>







<p>Thursday’s launch wasn’t just about the landing attempt, though. Roughly 34 minutes after takeoff, the upper stage of New Glenn successfully deployed the rocket’s first commercial payload: twin spacecraft for NASA that will travel to Mars to study the red planet’s atmosphere.</p>

<p>The pair of achievements are remarkable for the second-ever launch of such a massive rocket system. And it could put Blue Origin in position to compete with SpaceX, which dominates the world’s launch market with its Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and Starship rockets. </p>

<p>The accomplishment is noteworthy for the broader space industry, and one that SpaceX CEO Gwynne Shotwell acknowledged via a post on social media site X with a simple “Magnificent!” Musk even offered his own <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1989096465898303600" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">congratulations</a> shortly after. </p>

<figure></figure>

<p>New Glenn’s first launch was in January, and Blue Origin experienced a number of delays in getting the second rocket to launch. The company had hoped to make a second attempt as early as the spring, but pushed it back multiple times. New Glenn finally made it to the launch pad on Sunday, but weather and solar storms delayed it further.</p>

<p>The rocket finally took off from Launch Complex 36 in Cape Canaveral, Florida on Thursday at around 3:55 p.m. ET. At about four minutes into the flight, the second stage separated and headed further into space, while the New Glenn booster began its journey back toward Earth. Roughly 10 minutes into the flight, the 189-foot-tall booster touched down on the platform.</p>

<p>Blue Origin had attempted to bring the New Glenn booster back on the rocket’s first flight in January. But the booster exploded before it had a chance to land on the drone ship. Blue Origin worked with the Federal Aviation Administration to identify and make a number of fixes to the rocket, and the company was confident it could stick the landing on attempt number two.</p>

<p>The ability to land a booster like this is an important step in making the rocket system reusable, which lowers the cost for customers — a capability that SpaceX has mastered. Blue Origin will now have to demonstrate the ability to refurbish the rocket booster and launch it again.</p>

<p>These are crucial capabilities for commercial customers and government missions. Blue Origin has had its eyes on the moon for years, and is currently developing a lunar lander. So is SpaceX, with Starship. But the government has asked them to speed up these programs, and acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy recently criticized SpaceX for moving too slowly.</p>







<p>Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/blue-origin-will-move-heaven-and-earth-to-help-nasa-reach-the-moon-faster-ceo-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recently said in response</a> his company “will move heaven and Earth” to help NASA get back to the moon faster. But it can’t do that without successfully proving out all of New Glenn’s capabilities.</p>

<p>Thursday’s launch went a long way toward accomplishing that overarching goal.  </p>

      <p>
        OpenMANET is an open-source project for building Raspberry Pi–based MANET radios on Wi-Fi HaLow (915 MHz) using Morse Micro chipsets. 
        A MANET (Mobile Ad-Hoc Network) is a self-forming wireless mesh where each node connects directly without centralized infrastructure. 
        This technology is especially useful in the civilian space for search and rescue, disaster response, airsoft events, and any disconnected communications scenario. 
        <span>Designed to be budget-friendly with excellent long-range performance.</span>
        The build is designed to integrate with ATAK over multicast, but works equally well over standard IP and internet links.

            <h2>Your collective defense against AI-generated spam and content farms</h2>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-11-12/1762955857-538822-expecteddog.png" alt="Three side by side images of Kagi’s cartoon dog mascot, named Doggo, with antenna-like ears showing progression from ‘Expected dog’ to ‘Expected Slop’ with last one highlighted in orange with 3 ears and 3 eyes"></p>

<p>We made it our mission to prevent the web from becoming useless and a harmful space. That’s why today, Kagi Search introduces the first community-driven system to detect and downrank deceptive AI-generated text, images, and video inside search results.</p>

<p>It’s 2025, and the internet we loved is drowning in AI-generated noise. Content farms exploiting AI for profit are manipulating search results in this attention economy’s race to the bottom.</p>

<p>This makes us wonder: who are we building the web for?</p>

<h2>What is AI “Slop” and how can we stop it?</h2>

<p><strong>AI slop is deceptive or low-value AI-generated content, created to manipulate ranking or attention rather than help the reader.</strong></p>

<p>Per our <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/why-kagi/ai-philosophy.html">AI integration philosophy</a>, we’re not against AI tools that enhance human creativity. But when it includes fake reviews, fabricated expertise, misinformation, content farms designed purely for profit rather than value, and systems that seek to replace genuine human insight and connection, we know it’s hurting us, and we take it upon ourselves to act.</p>

<p>Our ethos at Kagi is to put humans in control.</p>

<p>We’ve been fighting AI slop since we introduced our AI-generated image filter a year ago. Since our inception, we have actively downranked content filled with ads and trackers with little or no value to our members, prompting and enabling you to take control of your search experience.</p>

<p>SlopStop now tackles the wider spectrum of misleading AI-generated content: videos, articles, domains, and everything in between. From now on, you will see a display within the search results showing the real-time AI slop score. As our CEO, Vlad, puts it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We believe AI slop is an existential threat to an internet that should belong to humans. This is the first step towards our ultimate goal: to kill AI slop so you never see it again.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This initiative will give you even greater control over what you see online, elevating high-value, trustworthy information above misinformation, news websites, false narratives, and content farms. We’ll improve the system by learning from your feedback and building more automated elements.</p>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-11-13/1763055249-452114-product.png" alt="Search results comparing AI slop detection on megik.com versus official Magic: The Gathering website on magic.wizards.com"></p>

<p>All Kagi Search users can now flag low-quality AI content (“AI slop”) in web, image, and video search results. We will verify these reports using our own signals. If a domain primarily publishes AI-generated content, we will downrank it in Kagi Search and mark it as AI slop. If a page is AI-generated but the domain is mixed (not mostly AI), we will flag the page as AI-generated but will not downrank it.</p>

<p>For media results, images and videos confirmed as AI-generated, they will be labelled as such and automatically downranked on the results page. Users can also choose to filter out AI-generated media entirely.</p>

<h2>The powerful duo: SlopStop and Small Web</h2>

<p>AI is evolving so quickly that it is increasingly complex to detect, but not impossible. Not all AI-generated content is harmful and misleading, but if a domain is in the business of only disseminating AI content, we consider it slop.</p>

<p>In parallel to fighting AI-generated slop, we are implementing solutions for whitelisting and amplifying verified human creators online through our <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/small-web">Small Web initiative</a>. Every piece of AI slop we flag makes authentic human content more discoverable. We want to prioritize creators who make the internet truly valuable, no matter the tools they use.</p>

<p>The Small Web represents everything AI slop threatens: authentic human voices, genuine creativity, and content created for passion rather than profit. Together, SlopStop and the Small Web create a powerful defense against the commercialization and artificial pollution of the internet.</p>

<h2>Building the largest AI slop dataset to fight LLM hallucinations</h2>

<p>SlopStop within our search is a step to an enhanced, trustworthy experience across the Kagi ecosystem. As a result of this initiative, we aim to build the largest dataset of AI-slop domains on the web, using in-house-built detection and a carefully curated community reporting system. In essence, we are using AI to destroy AI slop.</p>

<p>We’ll use this dataset to build our own AI content detection tech, which will be used across our products as additional defense against AI-generated hallucinations, false claims, and misinformation, <a href="https://www.newsguardtech.com/ai-monitor/march-2025-ai-misinformation-monitor/">which we know now account for 30-41% of the fail response rate</a> in most other chatbots.</p>

<p><strong>Access to the database will be shared soon, you can express interest <a href="https://tally.so/r/wLlPJG">here</a> if you’d like to receive updates.</strong></p>

<h2>Join the fight: protect the quality of your search</h2>

<p>The battle for internet authenticity can’t be won without your support. We are starting with this crowdsourced effort to help us learn and develop the final, automated solution. Every piece of harmful AI-generated content you identify helps create a better, more trustworthy search experience for everyone.</p>

<p>See something that qualifies as AI generated? Here’s how to flag it:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click the shield icon next to any search result</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Select “Report as AI-generated”</li>
<li>Our review team takes it from there</li>
</ol>

<p>To learn more about how SlopStop works, view our <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/slopstop.html">documentation</a>. As usual, we rely heavily on user input for all our products, so if you have feedback or suggestions, share them in our <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/">forums</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/disrupting-AI-espionage">https://www.anthropic.com/news/disrupting-AI-espionage</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45918638">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>We recently argued that an <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-ai-cyber-defenders">inflection point</a> had been reached in cybersecurity: a point at which AI models had become genuinely useful for cybersecurity operations, both for good and for ill. This was based on systematic evaluations showing cyber capabilities doubling in six months; we’d also been tracking real-world cyberattacks, observing how malicious actors were using AI capabilities. While we predicted these capabilities would continue to evolve, what has stood out to us is how quickly they have done so at scale.</p><p>In mid-September 2025, we detected suspicious activity that later investigation determined to be a highly sophisticated espionage campaign. The attackers used AI’s “agentic” capabilities to an unprecedented degree—using AI not just as an advisor, but to execute the cyberattacks themselves.</p><p>The threat actor—whom we assess with high confidence was a Chinese state-sponsored group—manipulated our <a href="https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code">Claude Code</a> tool into attempting infiltration into roughly thirty global targets and succeeded in a small number of cases. The operation targeted large tech companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturing companies, and government agencies. We believe this is the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention.</p><p>Upon detecting this activity, we immediately launched an investigation to understand its scope and nature. Over the following ten days, as we mapped the severity and full extent of the operation, we banned accounts as they were identified, notified affected entities as appropriate, and coordinated with authorities as we gathered actionable intelligence.</p><p>This campaign has substantial implications for cybersecurity in the age of AI “agents”—systems that can be run autonomously for long periods of time and that complete complex tasks largely independent of human intervention. Agents are valuable for everyday work and productivity—but in the wrong hands, they can substantially increase the viability of large-scale cyberattacks.</p><p>These attacks are likely to only grow in their effectiveness. To keep pace with this rapidly-advancing threat, we’ve expanded our detection capabilities and developed better classifiers to flag malicious activity. We’re continually working on new methods of investigating and detecting large-scale, distributed attacks like this one.</p><p>In the meantime, we’re sharing this case publicly, to help those in industry, government, and the wider research community strengthen their own cyber defenses. We’ll continue to release reports like this regularly, and be transparent about the threats we find.</p><h2 id="how-the-cyberattack-worked">How the cyberattack worked</h2><p>The attack relied on several features of AI models that did not exist, or were in much more nascent form, just a year ago:</p><ol><li><em>Intelligence.</em> Models’ general levels of capability have increased to the point that they can follow complex instructions and understand context in ways that make very sophisticated tasks possible. Not only that, but several of their well-developed specific skills—in particular, software coding—lend themselves to being used in cyberattacks.</li><li><em>Agency</em>. Models can act as agents—that is, they can run in loops where they take autonomous actions, chain together tasks, and make decisions with only minimal, occasional human input.</li><li><em>Tools</em>. Models have access to a wide array of software tools (often via the open standard <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro">Model Context Protocol</a>). They can now search the web, retrieve data, and perform many other actions that were previously the sole domain of human operators. In the case of cyberattacks, the tools might include password crackers, network scanners, and other security-related software.</li></ol><p>The diagram below shows the different phases of the attack, each of which required all three of the above developments:</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2755" height="2050" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fb0d38712e4f7b8002bb3a2734ceeb33f34817a43-2755x2050.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fb0d38712e4f7b8002bb3a2734ceeb33f34817a43-2755x2050.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>The lifecycle of the cyberattack, showing the move from human-led targeting to largely AI-driven attacks using various tools (often via the Model Context Protocol; MCP). At various points during the attack, the AI returns to its human operator for review and further direction.</figcaption></figure></div><p>In Phase 1, the human operators chose the relevant targets (for example, the company or government agency to be infiltrated). They then developed an attack framework—a system built to autonomously compromise a chosen target with little human involvement. This framework used Claude Code as an automated tool to carry out cyber operations.</p><p>At this point they had to convince Claude—which is extensively trained to avoid harmful behaviors—to engage in the attack. They did so by jailbreaking it, effectively tricking it to bypass its guardrails. They broke down their attacks into small, seemingly innocent tasks that Claude would execute without being provided the full context of their malicious purpose. They also told Claude that it was an employee of a legitimate cybersecurity firm, and was being used in defensive testing.</p><p>The attackers then initiated the second phase of the attack, which involved Claude Code inspecting the target organization’s systems and infrastructure and spotting the highest-value databases. Claude was able to perform this reconnaissance in a fraction of the time it would’ve taken a team of human hackers. It then reported back to the human operators with a summary of its findings.</p><p>In the next phases of the attack, Claude identified and tested security vulnerabilities in the target organizations’ systems by researching and writing its own exploit code. Having done so, the framework was able to use Claude to harvest credentials (usernames and passwords) that allowed it further access and then extract a large amount of private data, which it categorized according to its intelligence value. The highest-privilege accounts were identified, backdoors were created, and data were exfiltrated with minimal human supervision.</p><p>In a final phase, the attackers had Claude produce comprehensive documentation of the attack, creating helpful files of the stolen credentials and the systems analyzed, which would assist the framework in planning the next stage of the threat actor’s cyber operations.</p><p>Overall, the threat actor was able to use AI to perform 80-90% of the campaign, with human intervention required only sporadically (perhaps 4-6 critical decision points per hacking campaign). The sheer amount of work performed by the AI would have taken vast amounts of time for a human team. The AI made thousands of requests per second—an attack speed that would have been, for human hackers, simply impossible to match.</p><p>Claude didn’t always work perfectly. It occasionally hallucinated credentials or claimed to have extracted secret information that was in fact publicly-available. This remains an obstacle to fully autonomous cyberattacks.</p><h2 id="cybersecurity-implications">Cybersecurity implications</h2><p>The barriers to performing sophisticated cyberattacks have dropped substantially—and we predict that they’ll continue to do so. With the correct setup, threat actors can now use agentic AI systems for extended periods to do the work of entire teams of experienced hackers: analyzing target systems, producing exploit code, and scanning vast datasets of stolen information more efficiently than any human operator. Less experienced and resourced groups can now potentially perform large-scale attacks of this nature.</p><p>This attack is an escalation even on the “vibe hacking” findings we <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/detecting-countering-misuse-aug-2025">reported this summer</a>: in those operations, humans were very much still in the loop, directing the operations. Here, human involvement was much less frequent, despite the larger scale of the attack. And although we only have visibility into Claude usage, this case study probably reflects consistent patterns of behavior across frontier AI models and demonstrates how threat actors are adapting their operations to exploit today’s most advanced AI capabilities.</p><p>This raises an important question: if AI models can be misused for cyberattacks at this scale, why continue to develop and release them? The answer is that the very abilities that allow Claude to be used in these attacks also make it crucial for cyber defense. When sophisticated cyberattacks inevitably occur, our goal is for Claude—into which we’ve built strong safeguards—to assist cybersecurity professionals to detect, disrupt, and prepare for future versions of the attack. Indeed, our Threat Intelligence team used Claude extensively in analyzing the enormous amounts of data generated during this very investigation.</p><p>A fundamental change has occurred in cybersecurity. We advise security teams to experiment with applying AI for defense in areas like Security Operations Center automation, threat detection, vulnerability assessment, and incident response. We also advise developers to continue to invest in safeguards across their AI platforms, to prevent adversarial misuse. The techniques described above will doubtless be used by many more attackers—which makes industry threat sharing, improved detection methods, and stronger safety controls all the more critical.</p><p>Read <a href="https://assets.anthropic.com/m/ec212e6566a0d47/original/Disrupting-the-first-reported-AI-orchestrated-cyber-espionage-campaign.pdf">the full report</a>.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You may not have heard about new AI image generation models as much lately, but that doesn’t mean that innovation in the field has stagnated: it’s quite the opposite. <a href="https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev">FLUX.1-dev</a> immediately overshadowed the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion">Stable Diffusion</a> line of image generation models, while leading AI labs have released models such as <a href="https://replicate.com/bytedance/seedream-4">Seedream</a>, <a href="https://replicate.com/ideogram-ai/ideogram-v3-turbo">Ideogram</a>, and <a href="https://replicate.com/qwen/qwen-image">Qwen-Image</a>. Google also joined the action with <a href="https://deepmind.google/models/imagen/">Imagen 4</a>. But all of those image models are vastly overshadowed by ChatGPT’s <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-4o-image-generation/">free image generation support</a> in March 2025. After going <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/openai-ceo-chatgpt-studio-ghibli-ai-images-1236349141/">organically viral</a> on social media with the <code>Make me into Studio Ghibli</code> prompt, ChatGPT became the new benchmark for how most people perceive AI-generated images, for better or for worse. The model has its own image “style” for common use cases, which make it easy to identify that ChatGPT made it.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/chatgpt_gens_hu13840334073228854249.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/chatgpt_gens_hu9642028181388950696.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/chatgpt_gens_hu15202136820295934118.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/chatgpt_gens.webp 1024w" src="https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/chatgpt_gens.webp" alt="Two sample generations from ChatGPT.

ChatGPT image generations often have a yellow hue in their images. Additionally, cartoons and text often have the same linework and typography.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Of note, <code>gpt-image-1</code>, the technical name of the underlying image generation model, is an autoregressive model. While most image generation models are diffusion-based to reduce the amount of compute needed to train and generate from such models, <code>gpt-image-1</code> works by generating tokens in the same way that ChatGPT generates the next token, then decoding them into an image. It’s extremely slow at about 30 seconds to generate each image at the highest quality (the default in ChatGPT), but it’s hard for most people to argue with free.</p><p>In August 2025, a new mysterious text-to-image model appeared on <a href="https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard/text-to-image">LMArena</a>: a model code-named “nano-banana”. This model was <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-gemini-2-5-flash-image/">eventually publically released by Google</a> as <a href="https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/image/">Gemini 2.5 Flash Image</a>, an image generation model that works natively with their Gemini 2.5 Flash model. Unlike Imagen 4, it is indeed autoregressive, generating 1,290 tokens per image. After Nano Banana’s popularity <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/gemini-tops-the-app-store-thanks-to-new-ai-image-model-nano-banana/">pushed the Gemini app</a> to the top of the mobile App Stores, Google eventually made Nano Banana the colloquial name for the model as it’s definitely more catchy than “Gemini 2.5 Flash Image”.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/ios.webp 296w" src="https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/ios.webp#center" alt="The first screenshot on the iOS App Store for the Gemini app." width="25%" height="25%"><figcaption><p>The first screenshot on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-gemini/id6477489729">iOS App Store</a> for the Gemini app.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Personally, I care little about what leaderboards say which image generation AI looks the best. What I do care about is how well the AI adheres to the prompt I provide: if the model can’t follow the requirements I desire for the image—my requirements are often <em>specific</em>—then the model is a nonstarter for my use cases. At the least, if the model does have strong prompt adherence, any “looking bad” aspect can be fixed with prompt engineering and/or traditional image editing pipelines. After running Nano Banana though its paces with my comically complex prompts, I can confirm that thanks to Nano Banana’s robust text encoder, it has such extremely strong prompt adherence that Google has understated how well it works.</p><h2 id="how-to-generate-images-from-nano-banana">How to Generate Images from Nano Banana</h2><p>Like ChatGPT, Google offers methods to generate images for free from Nano Banana. The most popular method is through Gemini itself, either <a href="https://gemini.google.com/app">on the web</a> or in an mobile app, by selecting the “Create Image 🍌” tool. Alternatively, Google also offers free generation in <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat">Google AI Studio</a> when Nano Banana is selected on the right sidebar, which also allows for setting generation parameters such as image aspect ratio and is therefore my recommendation. In both cases, the generated images have a visible watermark on the bottom right corner of the image.</p><p>For developers who want to build apps that programmatically generate images from Nano Banana, Google offers the <code>gemini-2.5-flash-image</code> endpoint <a href="https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/gemini/2-5-flash-image">on the Gemini API</a>. Each image generated costs roughly $0.04/image for a 1 megapixel image (e.g. 1024x1024 if a 1:1 square): on par with most modern popular diffusion models despite being autoregressive, and much cheaper than <code>gpt-image-1</code>’s $0.17/image.</p><p>Working with the Gemini API is a pain and requires annoying image encoding/decoding boilerplate, so I wrote and open-sourced a Python package: <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/gemimg">gemimg</a>, a lightweight wrapper around Gemini API’s Nano Banana endpoint that lets you generate images with a simple prompt, in addition to handling cases such as image input along with text prompts.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="python"><span><span><span>from</span> <span>gemimg</span> <span>import</span> <span>GemImg</span>

My go-to test case is:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="txt"><span><span>Create an image of a three-dimensional pancake in the shape of a skull, garnished on top with blueberries and maple syrup.
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I like this prompt because not only is an absurd prompt that gives the image generation model room to be creative, but the AI model also has to handle the maple syrup and how it would logically drip down from the top of the skull pancake and adhere to the bony breakfast. The result:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/7fm8aJD0Lp6ymtkPpqvn0QU_hu2763368023143779032.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/7fm8aJD0Lp6ymtkPpqvn0QU_hu5784325784934638275.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/7fm8aJD0Lp6ymtkPpqvn0QU_hu6440430231719997140.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/7fm8aJD0Lp6ymtkPpqvn0QU.webp 1024w" src="https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/7fm8aJD0Lp6ymtkPpqvn0QU.webp"></figure><p>That is indeed in the shape of a skull and is indeed made out of pancake batter, blueberries are indeed present on top, and the maple syrup does indeed drop down from the top of the pancake while still adhereing to its unusual shape, albeit some trails of syrup disappear/reappear. It’s one of the best results I’ve seen for this particular test, and it’s one that doesn’t have obvious signs of “AI slop” aside from the ridiculous premise.</p><p>Now, we can try another one of Nano Banana’s touted features: editing. Image editing, where the prompt targets specific areas of the image while leaving everything else as unchanged as possible, has been difficult with diffusion-based models until very recently with <a href="https://replicate.com/blog/flux-kontext">Flux Kontext</a>. Autoregressive models in theory should have an easier time doing so as it has a better understanding of tweaking specific tokens that correspond to areas of the image.</p><p>While most image editing approaches encourage using a single edit command, I want to challenge Nano Banana. Therefore, I gave Nano Banana the generated skull pancake, along with <em>five</em> edit commands simultaneously:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="txt"><span><span>Make ALL of the following edits to the image:
</span></span><span><span>- Put a strawberry in the left eye socket.

I’m legit impressed. Now we can test more difficult instances of prompt engineering.</p><h2 id="the-good-the-barack-and-the-ugly">The Good, the Barack, and the Ugly</h2><p>One of the most compelling-but-underdiscussed use cases of modern image generation models is being able to put the subject of an input image into another scene. For open-weights image generation models, it’s possible to “train” the models to learn a specific subject or person even if they are not notable enough to be in the original training dataset using a technique such as <a href="https://replicate.com/docs/guides/extend/working-with-loras">finetuning the model with a LoRA</a> using only a few sample images of your desired subject.

In the case of the original Stable Diffusion, it used <a href="https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-base-patch32">CLIP</a>, whose <a href="https://openai.com/index/clip/">text encoder</a> open-sourced by OpenAI in 2021 which unexpectedly paved the way for modern AI image generation. It is extremely primitive relative to modern standards for transformer-based text encoding, and only has a context limit of 77 tokens: a couple sentences, which is sufficient for the image captions it was trained on but not nuanced input. Some modern image generators use <a href="https://huggingface.co/google-t5/t5-base">T5</a>, an even older experimental text encoder released by Google that supports 512 tokens. Although modern image models can compensate for the age of these text encoders through robust data annotation during training the underlying image models, the text encoders cannot compensate for highly nuanced text inputs that fall outside the domain of general image captions.</p><p>A marquee feature of <a href="https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/flash/">Gemini 2.5 Flash</a> is its support for <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/29/agentic-coding/">agentic coding</a> pipelines; to accomplish this, the model must be trained on extensive amounts of Markdown (which define code repository <code>README</code>s and agentic behaviors in <code>AGENTS.md</code>) and JSON (which is used for structured output/function calling/MCP routing). Additionally, Gemini 2.5 Flash was also explictly trained to understand objects within images, giving it the ability to create nuanced <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/conversational-image-segmentation-gemini-2-5/">segmentation masks</a>. Nano Banana’s multimodal encoder, as an extension of Gemini 2.5 Flash, should in theory be able to leverage these properties to handle prompts beyond the typical image-caption-esque prompts. That’s not to mention the vast annotated image training datasets Google owns as a byproduct of Google Images and likely trained Nano Banana upon, which should allow it to semantically differentiate between an image that is <code>Pulitzer Prize winning</code> and one that isn’t, as with similar buzzwords.</p><p>Let’s give Nano Banana a relatively large and complex prompt, drawing from the learnings above and see how well it adheres to the nuanced rules specified by the prompt:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="txt"><span><span>Create an image featuring three specific kittens in three specific positions.

I suspect that if precedent is set from <a href="https://www.mckoolsmith.com/newsroom-ailitigation-38">existing IP lawsuits against OpenAI and Midjourney</a>, Google will be in line to be sued.</p><p>Another note is moderation of generated images, particularly around NSFW content, which always important to check if your application uses untrusted user input. As with most image generation APIs, moderation is done against both the text prompt and the raw generated image. That said, while running my standard test suite for new image generation models, I found that Nano Banana is surprisingly one of the more lenient AI APIs. With some deliberate prompts, I can confirm that it is possible to generate NSFW images through Nano Banana—obviously I cannot provide examples.</p><p>I’ve spent a very large amount of time overall with Nano Banana and although it has a lot of promise, some may ask why I am writing about how to use it to create highly-specific high-quality images during a time where generative AI has threatened creative jobs. The reason is that information asymmetry between what generative image AI can and can’t do has only grown in recent months: many still think that ChatGPT is the only way to generate images and that all AI-generated images are wavy AI slop with a piss yellow filter. The only way to counter this perception is though evidence and reproducibility. That is why not only am I releasing Jupyter Notebooks detailing the image generation pipeline for each image in this blog post, but why I also included the prompts in this blog post proper; I apologize that it padded the length of the post to 26 minutes, but it’s important to show that these image generations are as advertised and not the result of AI boosterism. You can copy these prompts and paste them into <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat">AI Studio</a> and get similar results, or even hack and iterate on them to find new things. Most of the prompting techniques in this blog post are already well-known by AI engineers far more skilled than myself, and turning a blind eye won’t stop people from using generative image AI in this manner.</p><p>I didn’t go into this blog post expecting it to be a journey, but sometimes the unexpected journeys are the best journeys. There are <em>many</em> cool tricks with Nano Banana I cut from this blog post due to length, such as providing an image to specify character positions and also investigations of styles such as pixel art that most image generation models struggle with, but Nano Banana now nails. These prompt engineering shenanigans are only the tip of the iceberg.</p><p><em>Jupyter Notebooks for the generations used in this post are split between the <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/gemimg">gemimg repository</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/nano-banana-tests">second testing repository</a>.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

Tucked away in the bill, on page 163, in Title VII of Division B, was a provision to shut down the hemp industry. It wipes out the regulatory frameworks adopted by several states, takes away consumer choice and destroys the livelihoods of hemp farmers.</p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" min-height="600" fluid="" outstream="" momentum=""></partner-banner><p>This could not come at a worse time for our farmers. Costs have increased while prices for crops have declined. Farm bankruptcies are rising. For many farmers, planting hemp offered them a lifeline. Hemp can be used for textiles, rope, insulation, composite wood, paper, grain and in CBD products, and growing hemp helped farmers to mitigate the loses they’ve endured during this season of hardship.</p><p>But that lifeline is about to be extinguished.</p><h2>Nearly 100% of hemp products currently sold will be illegal</h2><p>The <a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/opinion/contributors/2025/07/17/mcconnell-hemp-kentucky-kids-thc-candy-poison-farmers/85243371007/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/opinion/contributors/2025/07/17/mcconnell-hemp-kentucky-kids-thc-candy-poison-farmers/85243371007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">justification</a> for this hemp ban, we are told, is that some bad actors are skirting the legal limits by enhancing the concentrations of THC in their products. The hemp industry and I had already come to the negotiating table, in good faith, to discuss reforms that prevent “juicing up” hemp products with purely synthetic cannabinoids of unknown origin.</p><partner-inline util-module-path="elements/partner" placement="native-article_link" sizes="[[300, 250], [3, 3]]" min-height="250" fluid="" outstream=""></partner-inline><p>Dozens of states have already instituted age limits and set THC levels for such products. I have no objection to many of these reforms. In fact, during negotiations, I expressly stated I would accept a federal ban on synthetic THC, as well as reasonable per serving limits. All along, my objective was to find an agreement that would protect consumers from bad actors while still allowing the hemp industry to thrive.</p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" fluid="" bottom="" lazy="" min-height="390" outstream=""></partner-banner><partner-inline util-module-path="elements/partner" placement="native-article_link" sizes="[[300, 250], [3, 3]]" min-height="250" fluid="" outstream=""></partner-inline><p>But the provision that was inserted into the government funding bill makes illegal any hemp product that contains more than 0.4 milligrams of THC per container. That would be nearly 100% of hemp products currently sold. This is so low that it takes away any of the benefit of the current products intended to manage pain or other conditions.</p><h2>Hemp products — and plants — are being targeted</h2><p>There is no reason to wipe out the progress made by states that have been regulating hemp since it was legalized. Of the 23 states that expressly permit the sale of hemp THC food and beverages, not one of them has set a limit lower than the 0.4 milligram limit established by the bill.</p><cta-atoms-container-inline util-module-path="elements/cta"></cta-atoms-container-inline><p>For example, Kentucky, along with Minnesota, Utah and Louisiana, limits THC to 5 milligrams per serving. Alabama and Georgia allow 10 milligrams per serving. Tennessee allows 15 milligrams per serving. Maine allows 3 milligrams per serving. These state laws will be preempted and wiped out by this new federal 0.4 milligram restriction.</p><p>For reference, the illegal “juiced up” synthetic products that this funding bill is supposedly targeting are around 50 to 100 milligrams.</p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" fluid="" bottom="" lazy="" min-height="600" outstream="" momentum=""></partner-banner><p>Hemp products aren’t the only things being targeted — it’s also the hemp plants themselves. The bill changes the current Farm Bill definition of hemp plants from .3 delta-9 THC to .3 <em>total</em> THC. In other words, crops already in the ground would be declared illegal. This rips the rug out from under American farmers, whose investments will be stripped away from them.</p><partner-inline util-module-path="elements/partner" placement="native-article_link" sizes="[[300, 250], [3, 3]]" min-height="250" fluid="" outstream=""></partner-inline><h2>I will not stop advocating for hemp farmers and consumers</h2><p>In true Washington swamp fashion, this hemp ban is not being debated on its own, on the merits. Instead, it is attached to a must-pass bill. Once again, Congress created a crisis, then conveniently used the crisis to jam through new laws without debate. Anyone that asks for a debate when these “reforms” emerge from behind closed doors is accused of obstruction by Congressional leaders.&nbsp;</p><p>I was able to force a vote in the Senate to remove the hemp ban, and while this effort was not successful on the first attempt, it will not be the last word. As farmers are forced to destroy their crops, consumers see empty shelves where their favorite products once sat and black markets emerge and thrive, the issue will not go away. And I will not stop advocating for farmers and consumers being targeted by a few members of Congress.</p><media-image image-set="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/03/PLOU/84016065007-rand-paul.JPG bestCrop, https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/03/PLOU/84016065007-rand-paul.JPG?crop=1302,977,x0,y277 4:3, https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/03/PLOU/84016065007-rand-paul.JPG?crop=1302,1738,x0,y54 3:4, https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/03/PLOU/84016065007-rand-paul.JPG?crop=1302,733,x0,y369 16:9" image-alt="" credit="Provided by Rand Paul" caption="Rand Paul" orientation="vertical" util-module-path="elements/media"></media-image><p><em>Rand Paul is a United States senator from Kentucky and the author of "The Case Against Socialism."</em></p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" fluid="" bottom="" lazy="" min-height="390" outstream=""></partner-banner><lit-timestamp slot="timestamp" publishdate="2025-11-13 15:58:12.131241513 +0000 UTC" updatedate="2025-11-13 15:58:12.131241513 +0000 UTC"></lit-timestamp><p><a alt="Post the article to your Facebook Timeline" data-size="large" onclick="fireNavShareAnalytics('facebook');" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><svg view-box="0 0 24 24">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>It's Monday, 12 PM ET, and the entire Zed Industries team is piled into our weekly all-hands meeting.
Some teammates jot down their schedule deviations, while others detail what they intend to focus on for the week.
<a href="https://github.com/nathansobo">Nathan</a> just wrapped up top-of-mind announcements and <a href="https://github.com/morgankrey">Morgan</a> is sharing trends from our metrics and covering operational updates.
Meanwhile I'm preparing user quotes from the last week to share out, and others add topics to the <code>Discussions</code> section.</p>
<p>Throughout the meeting, screens are being shared, various voices are popping in and out of the conversation, and our notes are growing rapidly as dozens of cursors are concurrently editing the same file in real-time.</p>
<p>This entire meeting is taking place inside Zed.</p>

<p>Our mission from the beginning has been to engineer an editor that will be:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="https://zed.dev/blog/videogame">Responsive</a></strong>: The latency between keystroke and re-render should be imperceptible.</li>
<li><strong>Focused</strong>: The interface should offer minimal distractions and stay out of the code's way.</li>
<li><strong>Collaborative</strong>: Working with teammates should feel no different than sitting next to them in the office.</li>
</ol>
<p>Setting the first two properties aside, let's focus on collaboration.</p>
<h2 id="collaboration-built-into-zeds-dna"><a href="#collaboration-built-into-zeds-dna" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Collaboration Built into Zed's DNA</span></a></h2>
<p>We've been dreaming of building the ultimate collaborative editor for years.
The roots of this vision go back to Nathan's early days at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivotal_Labs">Pivotal Labs</a>, where <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/11/pivotal-one/">pair programming with two keyboards plugged into the same computer</a> was the standard practice.
We set out to recreate that seamless collaboration experience—but for distributed teams.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But wait... doesn't this technology already exist in other editors?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes!
If you've been a developer long enough, you might recall the <a href="https://atom-editor.cc/teletype">teletype</a> package for <a href="https://atom-editor.cc/">Atom</a>—both built by Zed's founders.
Teletype enabled developers to share "portals" into their workspaces, which was an initial step towards Zed's collaborative vision.
Despite <a href="https://atom-editor.cc/blog/2017/08/08/atom-1-19#improved-responsiveness-and-memory-usage">attempts</a> to make Atom—an <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a> application—more responsive, it never reached the performance standards the team yearned for.
Nathan left the Atom team and eventually began work on <a href="https://www.gpui.rs/">gpui</a>, Zed's GPU-accelerated UI rendering framework, written in Rust, and Atom would later be <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/sunsetting-atom/">sunset by GitHub</a> after.
No more Atom, no more Teletype.</p>
<p>Other editors have added their versions of collaboration, but the landscape still falls short.
Setup is just tedious enough to be a hassle; you often have to install extensions, and paste links into a terminal or editor every time you want to share.
Concurrent edits don't merge cleanly, performance degrades quickly as more collaborators join, and worst of all, you often resort to sharing your screen over a Slack or Zoom anyway.</p>
<p>We engineered Zed from the ground up to be collaborative—it is <strong>not</strong> a bolt-on service <strong>or</strong> an afterthought.</p>
<p>Leveraging <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/crdts">CRDTs</a> as our core data structure, we ensure conflict-free and eventually consistent properties where everyone's changes merge seamlessly and converge to the same state.
You shouldn't have to worry about performing cursor gymnastics in order to avoid fatal flaws in the collaboration service.
Our architecture provides low latency, whether coworkers are in the same office or across an ocean, and performance remains snappy whether you're working in a pair or mob programming.</p>
<p>Setup is effortless: no extensions to install, no per-session links to copy and paste; only your GitHub handle is required.
And with built-in audio and automatic switching to screensharing, there's no need to fall back to external tools when you need to communicate work happening outside the editor.</p>
<p>We built Zed's collaboration service primarily for ourselves, so we can effectively build Zed, in Zed, together.
This isn't just a feature for us—it's <strong>vital</strong> for how we work.
We've both benefited and find great joy in using Zed's collaboration service, and we think you will too!</p>

<ul>
<li><code>1</code>: The collaboration panel is opened by clicking the people icon in the status bar, and becomes accessible after you have signed in through the GitHub authentication flow.</li>
<li><code>2</code>: This area houses virtual rooms called "channels" that are organized in a hierarchical structure.</li>
<li><code>3</code>: Create top-level channels by clicking the <code>+</code> button.
Create nested children channels by right clicking an existing channel and selecting the <code>New Subchannel</code> option.</li>
<li><code>4</code>: GitHub avatars show who is in which channel.
Click a channel's name to join it.</li>
<li><code>5</code>: Click the document icon to access its "channel notes," which serves as metadata associated with the channel.</li>
<li><code>6</code>: Once in a channel, mute/unmute your voice via the microphone icon.</li>
<li><code>7</code>: Allow others the option to view your screen.</li>
<li><code>8</code>: Channels are <strong>project agnostic</strong>.
Projects are voluntarily shared <em>through</em> them via the <code>Share</code> button in the title bar.
Channels can be public (🛜) or restricted to specific members (#️⃣), and include a permissions system with <code>Guest</code>, <code>Member</code>, and <code>Admin</code> roles.</li>
<li><code>9</code>: Click an avatar in the title bar to follow a teammate.
If you are following someone who is sharing their screen, Zed will automatically switch between following their cursor in your Zed instance and their screen share, depending on whether they are focused on Zed or another application.</li>

<p><a href="https://zed.dev/channel/zed-283">Our channel tree</a> has been through many iterations as our company has grown, but what we have today is a structure flexible enough to accommodate many forms of collaboration.
Our channel tree is used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Company-wide discussions</li>
<li>Working on projects</li>
<li>Individual focus time</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="company-wide-discussion-spaces"><a href="#company-wide-discussion-spaces" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Company-Wide Discussion Spaces</span></a></h3>
<p>While any channel can technically be categorized and used as a "meeting" space, we have a few designated for "all-hands" meetings.
These channels are used for checking in, knowledge dissemination, and reflection.
Projects aren't typically shared through these meetings; the work happens directly in channel notes.
Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Every Monday, we jump into the <code>this week</code> channel to discuss our plans for the week, review metrics, and discuss any pressing matters we need to act on.</p>

<p>In addition to channels for specific company-wide meetings, we have a handful of <a href="https://zed.dev/channel/rooms-23084">generalized meeting rooms</a> for one-offs that don't fit elsewhere and don't demand a dedicated space.</p>

<p>We structure channels and teams around specific projects, and it's where the bulk of our collaboration happens.
Projects typically group multiple features needed for larger initiatives, such as <a href="https://zed.dev/channel/git-1-0-25944"><code>git 1.0</code></a>, <a href="https://zed.dev/channel/edit-predictions-v2-23075"><code>edit predictions v2</code></a>, <code>delta db</code>, and <code>cloud</code>.
In these channels, a project member acts as host by sharing their Zed codebase instance for the team to collaborate on.
Channel notes will typically include a list of the members on the project, goals, links to <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed">GitHub Issues</a> / <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/discussions">Discussions</a> / project boards that we are aiming to tackle in this effort, and the overall progress of the project.</p>

<p>In our tree, we have a <code>people</code> channel.
Staff members are encouraged to add a subchannel named after themselves here.
These are our personal workspaces—our "virtual cubicles."
When a teammate is in a personal channel, it tends to send the signal: "I need some heads-down focus time to get this task over the line, but you're welcome to drop by if you need something."
Everyone on the team utilizes these slightly differently. I frequently use my channel to organize content for blog posts I want to work on.</p>
<p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: <em>This blog post was initially outlined in my <code>blog</code> subchannel.</em></p>

<p>Astute observers might notice there are no avatars next to these channels in the above screenshot.
It isn't uncommon for these to be unoccupied because the team generally prefers to collaborate when possible!</p>
<hr>
<p>Our virtual office is not so different from any other in-person office—we have designated spaces for meetings, working on projects, and individual focus time.
We've structured our channel tree to support workflows that empower us to operate our company, but you can structure yours however best fits your team's needs.</p>

<p>While collaboration in Zed has given us the ability to run Zed Industries from within Zed, it merely <em>scratches</em> the surface of <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/sequoia-backs-zed">how we envision working as a team</a>.
We're building toward a future where collaboration is continuous conversation, not discrete commits—where every discussion, edit, and insight remains linked to the code as it evolves, accessible to both teammates and AI agents.</p>
<p>Getting here hasn't been a straight line.
Over the years, we've paused work on collaboration to focus on features users frequently requested—<a href="https://zed.dev/ai">agent-powered tooling</a>, <a href="https://zed.dev/debugger">debugging</a>, <a href="https://zed.dev/windows">Windows support</a>, and <a href="https://zed.dev/git">git support</a>—but our primary goals for Zed <strong>have not changed</strong>.
As we reach parity with other editors on table-stakes features, these detours are becoming less frequent, opening us up to refocus on what we're most excited about: building the greatest multiplayer software development tool.</p>
<p><em>Collaboration as it stands today is considered <code>alpha</code>, and for the time being, is free for all to use!

<p>On Sunday, Senate leadership inserted a hemp-recriminalization clause into the must-pass funding bill that would end the longest shutdown in American history, reported <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/congressional-deal-would-ban-many-hemp-thc-products-while-excluding-provisions-to-let-va-doctors-recommend-medical-marijuana/" rel="noopener">Marijuana Moment</a>. On Monday, <a href="https://www.cannabisbusinesstimes.com/hemp/news/15771427/hemp-product-ban-included-in-deal-to-reopen-government" rel="noopener">Cannabis Business Times</a> confirmed that intoxicating hemp is being targeted as part of the three-bill spending package tied to reopening the government.</p>



<p>Not a standalone bill. Not a debate on cannabis reform. A shutdown ransom note.</p>



<h2 id="what-the-bill-actually-does">What the bill actually does</h2>



<p>The hemp language appears in the Agriculture–FDA spending bill, which is bundled into the shutdown deal. It would:</p>



<ul>
<li>Redefine hemp to include <strong>total THC</strong>, not just delta-9 THC</li>



<li>Count any cannabinoids with “similar effects” toward that THC total</li>



<li>Prohibit synthesized cannabinoids or converted CBD intermediates</li>



<li>Cap finished hemp products at <strong>0.4 milligrams total THC per container</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Not 0.4 mg per gummy. Per entire bottle, bag, vape, beverage.</p>



<p>That wipes out full-spectrum tinctures, hemp seltzers, delta-8 anything and even most CBD oils.</p>




<p>Jim Higdon, cofounder of Cornbread Hemp, told Marijuana Moment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The .4mg limit will make 100% of Cornbread Hemp products illegal.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He added:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“This is a dark day for anyone who hopes for a future when cannabis is descheduled in America.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="mitch-mcconnells-uturn"><span id="mitch-mcconnells-u-turn">Mitch McConnell’s U-turn</span></h2>



<p>Senator Mitch McConnell pushed the 2018 Farm Bill that legalized hemp. Now he is pushing to shut down the intoxicating hemp market.</p>



<p><em>Update — November 10, 2025: Back in 2018, when hemp legalization passed, McConnell publicly celebrated it. In remarks entered into the Congressional Record on April 12, 2018, he said: “Our bill will finally legalize hemp and remove it from the list of controlled substances.” On the same day, Senator Ron Wyden added, “Hemp does not produce the high associated with marijuana. The only thing you are going to accomplish by smoking hemp is wasting your breath, wasting your time, and wasting lighter fluid.” Those statements directly contrast with McConnell’s 2025 argument that intoxicating hemp products were never the intent of the Farm Bill.</em></p>



<p>He said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“My 2018 hemp bill sought to create an agricultural hemp industry, not open the door to the sale of unregulated, intoxicating, lab-made, hemp-derived substances with no safety framework.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Thomas Winstanley, EVP and general manager of Edibles.com, responded in a statement sent to <em><a href="https://hightimes.com/">High Times</a></em>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Senator Mitch McConnell, architect of the 2018 Farm Bill, sowed the hemp seeds, and now seeks to scorch the soil, salting the fields of his own harvest.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He called banning legal hemp a move that would only push consumers into unregulated channels, writing:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Banning legitimate hemp products won’t stop bad actors, it will only drive the market underground and further erode consumer safety.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="rand-paul-says-the-senate-will-have-to-fight-him-for-it">Rand Paul says the Senate will have to fight him for it</h2>



<p>The other senator from Kentucky is not on board.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/11/09/congress/rand-paul-shutdown-hemp-00644108" rel="noopener">Politico</a>, Rand Paul warned GOP leadership he would slow down the shutdown deal if hemp was targeted.</p>



<p>“I’ll vote no, but it’ll take them five days to pass this,” Paul said.</p>



<p>He also accused his own party of trying to “kill an entire industry.”</p>



<p>This is not theater. Paul has done it before: Cannabis Business Times notes that he previously forced Senate leaders to remove similar hemp-ban language in July by threatening to stall the funding package.</p>



<p>Two Kentucky senators. Both instrumental to U.S. hemp. Now they are fighting over who kills or saves it.</p>



<h2 id="the-economic-hit">The economic hit</h2>



<p>The numbers are heavy.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://hempsupporter.com/" rel="noopener">U.S. Hemp Roundtable</a>, in an official press release sent to <em>High Times</em>, states:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The U.S. Hemp Roundtable condemns the latest proposed Senate language to recriminalize hemp products, a harmful decision by Congress that threatens to eliminate America’s $28.4 billion hemp industry and jeopardizes more than 300,000 American jobs.”</p>



<p>“If passed, this legislation would wipe out 95 percent of the industry, shuttering small businesses and American farms while costing states $1.5 billion in lost tax revenue.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And:</p>



<blockquote>

</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p>“Our industry is being used as a pawn as leaders work to reopen the government.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to <a href="https://lynnwoodtimes.com/2025/11/09/hemp/" rel="noopener">Lynnwood Times</a>, intoxicating hemp represents <strong>over 80%</strong> of current industry revenue.</p>



<p>Adam Terry, CEO of Cantrip, summed up the consequences in the <a href="https://www.cultivated.news/" rel="noopener">Cultivated Daily newsletter</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Every state program that has codified Hemp products will shutter. Hemp farmers will go out of business. 330,000 Americans will lose their jobs. There is no ‘state legal’ hemp.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="not-everyone-wants-hemp-saved">Not everyone wants hemp saved</h2>



<p>Parts of the regulated cannabis industry are cheering.</p>



<p>Chris Lindsey, director of state advocacy and public policy at ATACH, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We applaud lawmakers for taking this critical step to clarify Congress’ intent in the 2018 Farm Bill. Willful misinterpretation of the Farm Bill led to the proliferation of unregulated synthetic THC products widely available for sale to minors.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He argues that the bill creates clear lanes separating natural hemp, synthetic cannabinoids and cannabis sold in legal dispensaries.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, as <em>High Times</em> recently reported in <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/politics/big-alcohols-hemp-civil-war/">Big Alcohol’s Hemp Civil War</a>, the alcohol industry is split. Producer lobbies want intoxicating hemp removed until federal rules exist, while beer and spirits distributors want to keep hemp beverages legal and taxed like alcohol.</p>



<p>Because distributors are already moving hemp drinks.</p>



<p>To them, hemp THC is not a threat. It is inventory.</p>



<h2 id="veterans-get-cut-out-entirely">Veterans get cut out entirely</h2>



<p>Another buried twist: The shutdown deal removed previously approved language that would have let VA doctors recommend medical cannabis to patients.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/congressional-deal-would-ban-many-hemp-thc-products-while-excluding-provisions-to-let-va-doctors-recommend-medical-marijuana/" rel="noopener">Marijuana Moment</a> confirmed the provision was stripped.</p>



<p>The message to veterans is simple: Not now.</p>



<h2 id="what-happens-next">What happens next</h2>



<ul>
<li>The deal would reopen the government until January 30, 2026.</li>



<li>The hemp ban has a <strong>one-year countdown</strong> before enforcement.</li>



<li>Rand Paul can force multi-day delays if leadership refuses to remove or modify the language.</li>
</ul>



<p>If passed, brands have three options:</p>



<ol>
<li>Reformulate to fit the <strong>0.4 mg limit</strong></li>



<li>Enter the regulated cannabis system</li>



<li>Shut down</li>
</ol>



<p>Congress says it is closing a loophole. The hemp industry says Congress is closing an industry.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>European nations, including the Netherlands, have decided against acquiring six Boeing E-7 Wedgetail Airborne Warning and Control Aircraft (AWACS) as replacements for the aging Boeing E-3A fleet.</p>
<p>This was confirmed in an <a href="https://www.defensie.nl/actueel/nieuws/2025/11/13/awacs-partners-zoeken-alternatief-voor-vervanging-vloot">official <span>statement</span></a> issued by the Dutch Ministry of Defence.</p>
<p>The existing E-3A AWACS aircraft, which have monitored European airspace since 1982 from Geilenkirchen, Germany, are expected to reach the end of their service life in 2035. The Netherlands said the aircraft have also been <strong>causing noise pollution</strong> in the region.</p>
<p>The decision follows the <strong>withdrawal of the U.S. from the joint AWACS replacement program in July 2024</strong>, which left the initiative without its strategic and financial foundation. The remaining European partners, part of the Support Partnership Committee, have therefore suspended plans to procure the U.S.-made E-7 Wedgetail and are now seeking alternative solutions and partners.</p>
<p><em>“The goal remains to have other<strong>,</strong> quieter aircraft operational by 2035,”</em> said Dutch State Secretary for Defence Gijs Tuinman. “<em>The U.S. withdrawal (from the </em>joint AWACS replacement program)<em> also demonstrates the importance of investing as much as possible in European industry.</em><strong><em>”</em></strong></p>
<p>AWACS aircraft play a critical role in NATO operations, equipped with radar and communications systems that enable rapid deployment and coordination of air operations. NATO first introduced these radar aircraft into service in 1982.</p>
<p>With the E-7 acquisition now shelved, European partners are expected to explore other options to sustain NATO’s airborne surveillance capability beyond 2035. While there is no single European-made AWACS platform that directly matches the Boeing E-7’s capabilities, options include modified Airbus A330, Airbus C295 AEW&amp;C, Dassault Falcon-based AEW platform and Saab GlobalEye aircraft.</p></div></div>]]></description>

  <div id="reasoning">
  <h2 data-block-key="gubo4">The Power of Reasoning</h2><p data-block-key="3019d">The first version of SIMA learned to perform over 600 language-following skills, like “turn left,” “climb the ladder,” and “open the map,” across a diverse set of commercial video games. It operated in these environments as a person might, by “looking” at the screen and using a virtual keyboard and mouse to navigate, without access to the underlying game mechanics.</p><p data-block-key="eeb78">With SIMA 2, we’ve moved beyond instruction-following. By embedding a Gemini model as the agent's core, SIMA 2 can do more than just respond to instructions, it can think and reason about them.</p>
</div>


  
    




  


  
    




  <div>
  <p data-block-key="gubo4">SIMA 2’s new architecture integrates Gemini’s powerful reasoning abilities to help it understand a user’s high-level goal, perform complex reasoning in pursuit, and skillfully execute goal-oriented actions within games.</p><p data-block-key="791ik">We trained SIMA 2 using a mixture of human demonstration videos with language labels as well as Gemini-generated labels. As a result, SIMA 2 can now describe to the user what it intends to do and detail the steps it's taking to accomplish its goals.</p>
</div>


  
    




  
    



  


  
    




  <div>
  <p data-block-key="gubo4">In testing, we have found that interacting with the agent feels less like giving it commands and more like collaborating with a companion who can reason about the task at hand.</p><p data-block-key="d02sb">And thanks to our collaboration with our existing and new game partners (see, Acknowledgements), we have been able to train and evaluate SIMA 2 on a wider array of games.</p><p data-block-key="214oh">This is the power of Gemini brought to embodied AI: a world-class reasoning engine that can now perceive, understand, and take action in complex, interactive 3D environments.</p>

  <div id="generalization">
  <h2 data-block-key="gubo4">A Leap in Generalization Performance</h2><p data-block-key="942je">The addition of Gemini has also led to improved generalization and reliability. SIMA 2 can now understand more complex and nuanced instructions than its predecessor and is far more successful at carrying them out, particularly in situations or games on which it’s never been trained, such as the new Viking survival game, ASKA, or MineDojo - a research implementation of the popular open-world sandbox game, Minecraft.</p>

<p data-block-key="gubo4">Moreover, its capacity to transfer learned concepts — for instance, taking its understanding of "mining" in one game and applying it to "harvesting" in another —is foundational to achieving the kind of broad generalization seen in human cognition. Indeed, as a result of this ability, SIMA 2’s performance is significantly closer to that of a human player on a wide range of tasks.</p>

  <h3 data-block-key="4oh1b">The Ultimate Test: Playing in Newly-Imagined Worlds</h3><p data-block-key="47sm1">To test the limits of SIMA 2’s generalization abilities, we combined it with another groundbreaking research project, <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie-3-a-new-frontier-for-world-models/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Genie 3</strong></a>, which can generate new, real-time 3D simulated worlds from a single image or text prompt.</p><p data-block-key="4kk35">When we challenged SIMA 2 to play in these newly generated worlds, we found it was able to sensibly orient itself, understand user instructions, and take meaningful actions toward goals, despite never having seen such environments before. It demonstrated an unprecedented level of adaptability.</p>

  <div id="self-improvement">
  <h2 data-block-key="4oh1b">Towards Scalable, Multitask Self-Improvement</h2><p data-block-key="8ue5a">One of SIMA 2’s most exciting new capabilities is its capacity for self-improvement. We’ve observed that, throughout the course of training, SIMA 2 agents can perform increasingly complex and new tasks, bootstrapped by trial-and-error and Gemini-based feedback.</p><p data-block-key="b6ibg">For example, after initially learning from human demonstrations, SIMA 2 can transition to learning in new games exclusively through self-directed play, developing its skills in previously unseen worlds without additional human-generated data. In subsequent training, SIMA 2’s own experience data can then be used to train the next, even more capable version of the agent. We were even able to leverage SIMA 2’s capacity for self-improvement in newly created Genie environments – a major milestone toward training general agents across diverse, generated worlds.</p>

  <div id="next-steps">
  <h2 data-block-key="tjz5c">Looking to the Future: The Journey to General Embodied Intelligence</h2><p data-block-key="7ov35">SIMA 2’s ability to operate across diverse gaming environments is a crucial proving ground for general intelligence, allowing agents to master skills, practice complex reasoning, and learn continuously through self-directed play.</p><p data-block-key="f8cc8">While SIMA 2 is a significant step toward generalist, interactive, embodied intelligence, it is fundamentally a research endeavor, and its current limitations highlight critical areas for future work. We find the agents still face challenges with very long-horizon, complex tasks that require extensive, multi-step reasoning and goal verification. SIMA 2 also has a relatively short memory of its interactions - it must use a limited context window to achieve low-latency interaction. Finally, executing precise, low-level actions via the keyboard and mouse interface and achieving robust visual understanding of the complex 3D scenes remain open challenges that the entire field continues to address.</p><p data-block-key="bd6ol">This research provides a fundamental validation for a new path in action-oriented AI. SIMA 2 confirms that an AI trained for broad competency, leveraging diverse multi-world data and the powerful reasoning of Gemini, can successfully unify the capabilities of many specialized systems into one coherent, generalist agent.</p><p data-block-key="4fcdo">SIMA 2 also offers a strong path toward application in robotics. The skills it learned - from navigation and tool use to collaborative task execution - are some of the fundamental building blocks for the physical embodiment of intelligence needed for future AI assistants in the physical world.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Running databases in the cloud can be convenient, but it can also get expensive fast. For the Prosopo team, MongoDB Atlas was initially a fast, reliable way to run a cloud database, but as our data grew, so did the bills. Over the last year, we realised that we were spending <em>thousands of dollars</em> per month on infrastructure that we could run more efficiently ourselves. We explored various options but ultimately decided to migrate our MongoDB deployment to Hetzner, a cost-effective cloud provider.</p><p>Here's how we managed to cut our costs by 90% without sacrificing performance or reliability.</p><h2 id="starting-with-mongodb-atlas-for-free-but-scaling-costs-added-up" tabindex="-1"><a href="#starting-with-mongodb-atlas-for-free-but-scaling-costs-added-up">Starting with MongoDB Atlas for <em>Free</em> but Scaling Costs Added Up</a></h2><p>When we first started building, MongoDB Atlas was an easy choice. Everything was set up for us, and we could focus on building our application without worrying about database management. The free tier was sufficient for our initial needs, and as we grew, scaling up was as simple as a few clicks. However, scaling came with a steep price tag. We went from paying $0 per month for a small database to over $3,000 per month for a few hundred GBs of data. The cost breakdown before we migrated looked roughly like this:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Service</th><th>Monthly Cost</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Atlas M40 Instance - AWS</td><td>$1000</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Atlas Continuous Cloud Backup Storage</td><td>$700</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Atlas AWS Data Transfer (Same Region)</td><td>$10</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Atlas AWS Data Transfer (Different Region)</td><td>$1</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Atlas AWS Data Transfer (Internet)</td><td>$1,000</td><td>❗</td></tr><tr><td>Total + VAT</td><td>$3000+</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The more keen eyed among you will have noticed the huge cost associated with data transfer over the internet - its as much as the servers! We're building Prosopo to be resilient to outages, such as the recent <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/heres-what-experts-say-the-aws-outage-reveals-about-the-cloud/ar-AA1OUxC6">massive AWS outage</a>, so we use many different cloud providers. This means that a lot of our database traffic goes over the internet, which is very expensive on MongoDB Atlas, due to it running on AWS (other options are available, but we chose AWS).</p><p>When your entire stack is on AWS, data transfer costs are minimal, as shown by the "Same Region" line item above. However, this architecture creates <a href="https://scisimple.com/en/articles/2025-07-23-measuring-internet-centralization-a-new-approach--a9rgqe5">centralisation and single points of failure</a>, which we want to avoid.</p><p>Oh, and even though we were paying this much, we didn't have access to any support! That's a separate paid plan.</p><h2 id="why-we-chose-hetzner" tabindex="-1"><a href="#why-we-chose-hetzner">Why We Chose Hetzner</a></h2><p>Hetzner offered a compelling alternative:</p><ul><li><strong>High-performance dedicated servers</strong> at a fraction of AWS pricing</li><li><strong>Predictable, flat-rate pricing</strong> without surprise bills</li><li><strong>Strong European data center presence</strong>, which aligns with our privacy requirements</li><li><strong>No Data Transfer fees</strong> between our application servers and database</li></ul><p>We decided that the only way to regain control over our costs was to move to a self-hosted solution. MongoDB Atlas was running in replica set mode but we opted to instead set up a much beefier machine with a huge amount of RAM (256GB) and fast SSDs to handle our workload. In future, if we want to move back to a distributed setup, we can always add more nodes.</p><p><strong>The server in question costs $160 per month</strong>, which is a huge saving over our previous costs.</p><h2 id="migration" tabindex="-1"><a href="#migration">Migration</a></h2><p>Our Atlas instance held about 500GB of data but the product doesn't rely on this data in real-time - its used for generating detection rules using ML modelling, and the rules are applied to our CAPTCHA providers in a follow-up step. The reason for this architecture stems from our <a href="https://prosopo.io/blog/prosopo-web3-foundation-grant/">blockchain beginnings</a>.</p><p><img src="https://prosopo.io/static/mongo-provider-architecture.webp" alt="MongoDB Provider Architecture"></p><p>We were able to take a mongodump of the database, restore it to the new Hetzner server, and then use scripts to sync any changes that happened during the migration window.</p><p>Setting up our Hetzner server wasn't just a matter of spinning up MongoDB. We run Proxmox on the host machine, created an Ubuntu VM, and deployed MongoDB in Docker. Networking added another layer of complexity: the VM sits on a private subnet (10.0.0.x) with the host handling DHCP, NAT, and port forwarding. We also use Traefik as a reverse proxy to handle SSL and route traffic from the outside world to MongoDB, which saves us from wrestling with MongoDB's own SSL certificates. While this setup gives us flexibility and security, it does require a bit more technical know-how compared to fully managed solutions.</p><h2 id="things-you'll-need-to-do-yourself" tabindex="-1"><a href="#things-you'll-need-to-do-yourself">Things You'll Need To Do Yourself</a></h2><p>When you migrate from MongoAtlas to a self-hosted solution, you're taking on more responsibility for managing your database. You need to make sure it is secure, backed up, monitored, and can be recreated in case of failure or the need for extra servers arises. We used the following tools:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Tool</th><th>Purpose</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://docs.ansible.com/">Ansible</a></td><td>Automated server provisioning</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a></td><td>Running MongoDB in a container</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/database-tools/mongodump/">mongodump</a></td><td>Backup CLI tool</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://openobserve.ai/">OpenObserve</a></td><td>Log aggregation and alerting</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW">UFW</a></td><td>Firewall management</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">WireGuard</a></td><td>Secure connections over VPN</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The monitoring in MongoDB Atlas was very useful. It highlighted times when we were opening up unlimited connections due to connection leaks in our application code. However, <strong>MongoDB Atlas wouldn't let us kill the connections using admin shell commands</strong>! This meant we reached our connection limit and we had no way to restart the server. We had to kill our services to free up connections. With our own server, we can now monitor and manage connections directly via <a href="https://openobserve.ai/">OpenObserve</a> and, crucially, the MongoDB shell.</p><p>Backups in MongoDB Atlas were also convenient but expensive. We now use <code>mongodump</code>, a cron, and a storage box from Hetzner to take daily backups of our database. The backups are compressed and encrypted before being sent to the remote storage box.</p><h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2><p>We've opted for a DIY approach to our servers and databases, which has significantly reduced our costs whilst giving us more control over our infrastructure. However, this approach isn't for everyone. We're still a small team, and managing the limited number of servers we run is feasible.</p><p>The performance we're seeing from our new standalone MongoDB server is very much improved over the Atlas setup. This is simply because the specs are so much higher and the indexes can mostly be held in memory. We are aware that MongoDB Atlas has something called vector search but we weren't using it, so it wasn't a factor in our decision.</p><p>For reference, the specs look like this:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Specification</th><th>Atlas M40 Instance</th><th>Hetzner Dedicated Server</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>CPU</td><td>8 vCPU</td><td>8 cores Intel Xeon W-2145</td></tr><tr><td>RAM</td><td>16 GB</td><td>256 GB</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td>380 GB SSD</td><td>4 x 3.84 TB NVMe SSD RAID 5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Its more than likely that as we grow, we'll start to see value in hosted solutions again, but for now we're quite pleased with the new setup. Hopefully this experience helps to inform others starting out on their cloud journey - for a small amount of pain you can save a lot of money!</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">Ory Kratos is an API first identity and user management system that follows <a href="https://www.ory.sh/docs/ecosystem/software-architecture-philosophy" rel="nofollow">cloud architecture best practices</a>. It focuses on core identity workflows that almost every application needs:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Self service login and registration</li>
<li>Account verification and recovery</li>
<li>Multi factor authentication</li>
<li>Profile and account management</li>
<li>Identity schemas and traits</li>
<li>Admin APIs for lifecycle management</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">We recommend starting with the <a href="https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/" rel="nofollow">Ory Kratos introduction docs</a> to learn more about its architecture, feature set, and how it compares to other systems.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why Ory Kratos</h3><a id="user-content-why-ory-kratos" aria-label="Permalink: Why Ory Kratos" href="#why-ory-kratos"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Ory Kratos is designed to:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Remove identity logic from your application code and expose it over HTTP APIs</li>
<li>Work well with any UI framework through browser based and native app flows</li>
<li>Scale to large numbers of identities and devices</li>
<li>Integrate with the rest of the Ory stack for OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and access control</li>
<li>Fit into modern cloud native environments such as Kubernetes and managed platforms</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Migrating from Auth0, Okta, and similar providers</h2><a id="user-content-migrating-from-auth0-okta-and-similar-providers" aria-label="Permalink: Migrating from Auth0, Okta, and similar providers" href="#migrating-from-auth0-okta-and-similar-providers"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you are migrating from Auth0, Okta, or another identity provider that uses OAuth2 / OpenID Connect based login, consider using <strong>Ory Hydra + Ory Kratos</strong> together:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Ory Hydra</strong> acts as the OAuth2 and OpenID Connect provider and can replace most authorization server and token issuing capabilities of your existing IdP.</li>
<li><strong>Ory Kratos</strong> provides identity, credentials, and user-facing flows (login, registration, recovery, verification, profile management).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This combination is often a drop-in replacement for OAuth2 and OpenID Connect capabilities at the protocol level. In practice, you update client configuration and endpoints to point to Hydra, migrate identities into Kratos, and keep your applications speaking the same OAuth2 / OIDC protocols they already use.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Deployment options</h2><a id="user-content-deployment-options" aria-label="Permalink: Deployment options" href="#deployment-options"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can run Ory Kratos in two main ways:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>As a managed service on the Ory Network</li>
<li>As a self hosted service under your own control, with or without the Ory Enterprise License</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Use Ory Kratos on the Ory Network</h3><a id="user-content-use-ory-kratos-on-the-ory-network" aria-label="Permalink: Use Ory Kratos on the Ory Network" href="#use-ory-kratos-on-the-ory-network"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://www.ory.sh/cloud" rel="nofollow">Ory Network</a> is the fastest way to use Ory services in production. <strong>Ory Identities</strong> is powered by the open source Ory Kratos server and is API compatible.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Ory Network provides:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Identity and credential management that scales to billions of users and devices</li>
<li>Registration, login, and account management flows for passkeys, biometrics, social login, SSO, and multi factor authentication</li>
<li>Prebuilt login, registration, and account management pages and components</li>
<li>OAuth2 and OpenID Connect for single sign on, API access, and machine to machine authorization</li>
<li>Low latency permission checks based on the Zanzibar model with the Ory Permission Language</li>
<li>GDPR friendly storage with data locality and compliance in mind</li>
<li>Web based Ory Console and Ory CLI for administration and operations</li>
<li>Cloud native APIs compatible with the open source servers</li>
<li>Fair, usage based <a href="https://www.ory.sh/pricing" rel="nofollow">pricing</a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Sign up for a <a href="https://console.ory.sh/registration?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=kratos-readme" rel="nofollow">free developer account</a> to get started.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Self-host Ory Kratos</h3><a id="user-content-self-host-ory-kratos" aria-label="Permalink: Self-host Ory Kratos" href="#self-host-ory-kratos"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can run Ory Kratos yourself for full control over infrastructure, deployment, and customization.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/install" rel="nofollow">install guide</a> explains how to:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Install Kratos on Linux, macOS, Windows, and Docker</li>
<li>Configure databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and CockroachDB</li>
<li>Deploy to Kubernetes and other orchestration systems</li>
<li>Build Kratos from source</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This guide uses the open source distribution to get you started without license requirements. It is a great fit for individuals, researchers, hackers, and companies that want to experiment, prototype, or run unimportant workloads without SLAs. You get the full core engine, and you are free to inspect, extend, and build it from source.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you run Kratos as part of a business-critical system, for example login and account recovery for all your users, you should use a commercial agreement to reduce operational and security risk. The <strong>Ory Enterprise License (OEL)</strong> layers on top of self-hosted Kratos and provides:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Additional enterprise features that are not available in the open source version such as SCIM, SAML, organization login ("SSO"), CAPTCHAs and more</li>
<li>Regular security releases, including CVE patches, with service level agreements</li>
<li>Support for advanced scaling, multi-tenancy, and complex deployments</li>
<li>Premium support options with SLAs, direct access to engineers, and onboarding help</li>
<li>Access to a private Docker registry with frequent and vetted, up-to-date enterprise builds</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">For guaranteed CVE fixes, current enterprise builds, advanced features, and support in production, you need a valid <a href="https://www.ory.com/ory-enterprise-license" rel="nofollow">Ory Enterprise License</a> and access to the Ory Enterprise Docker registry.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>   <p>In distributed systems, one of the fundamental challenges is knowing whether a node or service is alive and functioning properly. Unlike monolithic applications, where everything runs in a single process, distributed systems span multiple machines, networks, and data centers. This becomes even glaring when the nodes are geographically separated. This is where heartbeat mechanisms come into play.</p>
<p>Imagine a cluster of servers working together to process millions of requests per day. If one server silently crashes, how quickly can the system detect this failure and react? How do we distinguish between a truly dead server and one that is just temporarily slow due to network congestion? These questions form the core of why heartbeat mechanisms matter.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-heartbeat-messages">What are Heartbeat Messages</h2>
<p>At its most basic level, a heartbeat is a periodic signal sent from one component in a distributed system to another to indicate that the sender is still alive and functioning. Think of it as a simple message that says “I am alive!”</p>
<p>Heartbeat messages are typically small and lightweight, often containing just a timestamp, a sequence number, or an identifier. The key characteristic is that they are sent regularly at fixed intervals, creating a predictable pattern that other components can monitor.</p>
<p>The mechanism works through a simple contract between two parties: the sender and the receiver. The sender commits to broadcasting its heartbeat at regular intervals, say every 2 seconds. The receiver monitors these incoming heartbeats and maintains a record of when the last heartbeat was received. If the receiver does not hear from the sender within an expected timeframe, it can reasonably assume something has gone wrong.</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="python"><code><span><span>class</span><span> HeartbeatSender</span><span>:  </span></span>

<p>When a node crashes, stops responding, or becomes isolated due to network partitions, the heartbeats stop arriving. The monitoring system can then take appropriate action, such as removing the failed node from a load balancer pool, redirecting traffic to healthy nodes, or triggering failover procedures.</p>
<h2 id="core-components-of-heartbeat-systems">Core Components of Heartbeat Systems</h2>
<p>The first component is the heartbeat sender. This is the node or service that periodically generates and transmits heartbeat signals. In most implementations, the sender runs on a separate thread or as a background task to avoid interfering with the primary application logic.</p>
<p>The second component is the heartbeat receiver or monitor. This component listens for incoming heartbeats and tracks when each heartbeat was received. The monitor maintains state about all the nodes it is tracking, typically storing the timestamp of the last received heartbeat for each node. When evaluating node health, the monitor compares the current time against the last received heartbeat to determine if a node should be considered failed.</p>

<span><span>        return</span><span> failed_nodes  </span></span></code></pre>
<p>The third parameter is the heartbeat interval, which determines how frequently heartbeats are sent. This interval represents a fundamental trade-off in distributed systems. Sending heartbeats too frequently, we waste network bandwidth and CPU cycles. Send them too infrequently, and we will be slow to detect failures. Most systems use intervals ranging from 1 to 10 seconds, depending on the application requirements and network characteristics.</p>
<p>The fourth one is the timeout or failure threshold. This defines how long the monitor will wait without receiving a heartbeat before declaring a node as failed.</p>
<p>Note, the timeout must be carefully chosen to balance two competing concerns: fast failure detection versus tolerance for temporary network delays or processing pauses. A typical rule of thumb is to set the timeout to at least 2 to 3 times the heartbeat interval, allowing for some missed heartbeats before declaring failure.</p>
<h2 id="deciding-heartbeat-intervals-and-timeouts">Deciding Heartbeat Intervals and Timeouts</h2>
<p>When a system uses very short intervals, such as sending heartbeats every 500 milliseconds, it can detect failures quickly. However, this comes at a cost. Each heartbeat consumes network bandwidth, and in a large cluster with hundreds or thousands of nodes, the cumulative traffic can become significant. Additionally, very short intervals make the system more sensitive to transient issues like brief network congestion or garbage collection pauses.</p>
<p>Consider a system with 1000 nodes where each node sends heartbeats to a central monitor every 500 milliseconds. This results in 2000 heartbeat messages per second just for health monitoring. In a busy production environment, this overhead can interfere with actual application traffic.</p>
<p>Conversely, if the heartbeat interval is too long, say 30 seconds, the system becomes sluggish in detecting failures. A node could crash, but the system would not notice for 30 seconds or more. During this window, requests might continue to be routed to the failed node, resulting in user-facing errors.</p>
<p>Similarly, the timeout value must also account for network characteristics. In a distributed system spanning multiple data centers, network latency varies. A heartbeat sent from a node in California to a monitor in Virginia might take 80 milliseconds under normal conditions, but could spike to 200 milliseconds during periods of congestion.</p>
<p>Hence, if the timeout is set too aggressively, these transient delays trigger false alarms.</p>
<p>A practical approach is to measure the actual round-trip time in the network and use that as a baseline. Many systems follow the rule that the timeout should be at least 10 times the round-trip time. For example, if the average round-trip time is 10 milliseconds, the timeout should be at least 100 milliseconds to account for variance.</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="python"><code><span><span>def</span><span> calculate_timeout</span><span>(round_trip_time_ms, heartbeat_interval_ms):  </span></span>
<span><span>    # Timeout is 10x the RTT  </span></span>
<span><span>    rtt_based_timeout </span><span>=</span><span> round_trip_time_ms </span><span>*</span><span> 10</span><span>  </span></span>
<span><span>    </span></span>
<span><span>    # Timeout should also be at least 2-3x the heartbeat interval  </span></span>
<span><span>    interval_based_timeout </span><span>=</span><span> heartbeat_interval_ms </span><span>*</span><span> 3</span><span>  </span></span>
<span><span>    </span></span>
<span><span>    # Use the larger of the two  </span></span>
<span><span>    return</span><span> max</span><span>(rtt_based_timeout, interval_based_timeout)  </span></span></code></pre>
<p>Another important consideration is the concept of multiple missed heartbeats before declaring failure. Rather than marking a node as dead after a single missed heartbeat, systems wait until several consecutive heartbeats are missed. This approach reduces false positives caused by packet loss or momentary delays.</p>
<p>For instance, if we send heartbeats every 2 seconds and require 3 missed heartbeats before declaring failure, a node would need to be unresponsive for at least 6 seconds before being marked as failed. This provides a good balance between quick failure detection and tolerance for transient issues.</p>
<h2 id="push-vs-pull-heartbeat-models">Push vs Pull Heartbeat Models</h2>
<p>Heartbeat mechanisms can be implemented using two different communication models: push and pull.</p>
<p>In a push model, the monitored node actively sends heartbeat messages to the monitoring system at regular intervals. The node takes responsibility for broadcasting its own health status. The monitored service simply runs a background thread that periodically sends a heartbeat message.</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="python"><code><span><span>class</span><span> PushHeartbeat</span><span>:  </span></span>

<p>The push model works well in many scenarios, but it has limitations. If the node itself becomes completely unresponsive or crashes, it obviously cannot send heartbeats. Additionally, in networks with strict firewall rules, the monitored nodes might not be able to initiate outbound connections to the monitoring system.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kubernetes Node Heartbeats</li>
<li>Hadoop YARN NodeManagers push heartbeats to the ResourceManager</li>
<li>Celery and Airflow workers push heartbeats to the schedule</li>
</ul>
<p>In a pull model, the monitoring system actively queries the nodes at regular intervals to check their health. Instead of waiting for heartbeats to arrive, the monitor reaches out and asks, “Are you alive?” The monitored services expose a health endpoint that responds to these queries.</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="python"><code><span><span>class</span><span> PullHeartbeat</span><span>:  </span></span>

<p>The pull model provides more control to the monitoring system and can be more reliable in some scenarios. Since the monitor initiates the connection, it works better in environments with asymmetric network configurations. However, it also introduces additional load on the monitor, especially in large clusters where hundreds or thousands of nodes need to be polled regularly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Load balancers actively probe backend servers</li>
<li>Prometheus pulls metrics endpoints on each target</li>
<li>Redis Sentinel monitors and polls Redis instances with PING</li>
</ul>
<p>By the way, many real-world systems use a hybrid approach that combines elements of both models. For example, nodes might send heartbeats proactively (push), but the monitoring system also periodically polls critical nodes (pull) as a backup mechanism. This redundancy improves overall reliability.</p>
<h2 id="failure-detection-algorithms">Failure Detection Algorithms</h2>
<p>While basic heartbeat mechanisms are effective, they struggle with the challenge of distinguishing between actual failures and temporary slowdowns. This is where more sophisticated failure detection algorithms come into play.</p>
<p>The simplest failure detection algorithm uses a fixed timeout. If no heartbeat is received within the specified timeout period, the node is declared failed. While easy to implement, this binary approach is inflexible and prone to false positives in networks with variable latency.</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="python"><code><span><span>class</span><span> FixedTimeoutDetector</span><span>:  </span></span>

<h3 id="phi-accrual-failure-detection">Phi Accrual Failure Detection</h3>
<p>A more sophisticated approach is the <a href="https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/phi-accrual">phi accrual failure detector</a>, originally developed for the Cassandra database. Instead of providing a binary output (alive or dead), the phi accrual detector calculates a suspicion level on a continuous scale. The higher the suspicion value, the more likely it is that the node has failed.</p>
<p>The phi value is calculated using statistical analysis of historical heartbeat arrival times. The algorithm maintains a sliding window of recent inter-arrival times and uses this data to estimate the probability distribution of when the next heartbeat should arrive. If a heartbeat is late, the phi value increases gradually rather than jumping immediately to a failure state.</p>
<p>The phi value represents the confidence level that a node has failed. For example, a phi value of 1 corresponds to approximately 90% confidence, a phi of 2 corresponds to 99% confidence, and a phi of 3 corresponds to 99.9% confidence.</p>
<h2 id="gossip-protocols-for-heartbeats">Gossip Protocols for Heartbeats</h2>
<p>As distributed systems grow in size, centralized heartbeat monitoring becomes a bottleneck. A single monitoring node responsible for tracking thousands of servers creates a single point of failure and does not scale well. This is where gossip protocols come into play.</p>
<p>Gossip protocols distribute the responsibility of failure detection across all nodes in the cluster. Instead of reporting to a central authority, each node periodically exchanges heartbeat information with a randomly selected subset of peers. Over time, information about the health of every node spreads throughout the entire cluster, much like gossip spreads in a social network.</p>
<p>The basic gossip algorithm: each node maintains a local membership list containing information about all known nodes in the cluster, including their heartbeat counters. Periodically, the node selects one or more random peers and exchanges its entire membership list with them. When receiving a membership list from a peer, the node merges it with its own list, keeping the most recent information for each node.</p>

<p>The gossip protocol eliminates single points of failure since every node participates in failure detection. It scales well because the number of messages each node sends remains constant regardless of cluster size. It is also resilient to node failures since information continues to spread as long as some nodes remain connected.</p>
<p>However, gossip protocols also introduce complexity. Because information spreads gradually, there can be a delay before all nodes learn about a failure. This eventual consistency model means that different nodes might temporarily have different views of the cluster state. The protocol also generates more total network traffic since information is duplicated across many gossip exchanges, though this is usually acceptable since gossip messages are small.</p>
<p>Many production systems use gossip-based failure detection. Cassandra, for example, uses a gossip protocol where each node gossips with up to three other nodes every second. Nodes track both heartbeat generation numbers and version numbers to handle various failure scenarios. The protocol also includes mechanisms to handle network partitions and prevent split-brain scenarios.</p>
<h2 id="implementation-considerations">Implementation Considerations</h2>
<p>One important implementation consideration is the transport protocol.</p>
<p>Should heartbeats use TCP or UDP? TCP provides reliable delivery and guarantees that messages arrive in order, but it also introduces overhead and can be slower due to connection establishment and acknowledgment mechanisms.</p>
<p>UDP is faster and more lightweight, but packets can be lost or arrive out of order. Many systems use UDP for heartbeat messages because occasional packet loss is acceptable, the receiver can tolerate missing a few heartbeats without declaring a node dead.</p>
<p>However, TCP is often preferred when heartbeat messages carry critical state information that must not be lost.</p>
<p>Another consideration is network topology. In systems spanning multiple data centers, network latency and reliability vary significantly between different paths. A heartbeat between two nodes in the same data center might have a round-trip time of 1 millisecond, while a heartbeat crossing continents might take 100 milliseconds or more. Systems should account for these differences, potentially using different timeout values for local versus remote nodes.</p>

<p>Another important implementation consideration is to ensure that we do not have blocking operations in the heartbeat processing path. Heartbeat handlers should execute quickly and defer any expensive operations to separate worker threads.</p>
<p>Resource management is also critical. In a system with thousands of nodes, maintaining separate threads or timers for each node can exhaust system resources. We should prefer event-driven architectures or thread pools to efficiently manage concurrent heartbeat processing. Connection pooling would also reduce the overhead of establishing new connections for each heartbeat message.</p>
<h2 id="network-partitions-and-split-brain">Network Partitions and Split-brain</h2>
<p>A network partition occurs when network connectivity is disrupted, splitting a cluster into two or more isolated groups. Nodes within each partition can communicate with each other but cannot reach nodes in other partitions.</p>
<p>During a partition, nodes on each side will stop receiving heartbeats from nodes on the other side. This creates an ambiguous situation where both sides might believe the other has failed. If not handled carefully, this can lead to split-brain scenarios where both sides continue operating independently, potentially leading to data inconsistency or resource conflicts.</p>
<p>Consider a database cluster with three nodes spread across two data centers. If the network connection between data centers fails, the nodes in each data center will form separate partitions. Without proper safeguards, both partitions might elect their own leader, accept writes, and diverge from each other.</p>
<p>To handle network partitions correctly, systems often use quorum-based approaches. A quorum is the minimum number of nodes that must agree before taking certain actions. For example, a cluster of five nodes might require a quorum of three nodes to elect a leader or accept writes.</p>
<p>During a partition, only the partition containing at least three nodes can continue operating normally. The minority partition recognizes it has lost quorum and stops accepting writes.</p>

<p>Each node in a Kubernetes cluster runs a kubelet agent that periodically sends node status updates to the API server. By default, kubelets send updates every 10 seconds. If the API server does not receive an update within 40 seconds, it marks the node as NotReady.</p>
<p>Kubernetes also implements liveness and readiness probes at the pod level. A liveness probe checks whether a container is running properly, and if the probe fails repeatedly, Kubernetes restarts the container. A readiness probe determines whether a container is ready to accept traffic, and failing readiness probes cause the pod to be removed from service endpoints.</p>

<p>Cassandra, a distributed NoSQL database, uses gossip-based heartbeats to maintain cluster membership. Each Cassandra node gossip with up to three other random nodes every second. The gossip messages include heartbeat generation numbers that increment whenever a node restarts and heartbeat version numbers that increment with each gossip round.</p>
<p>Cassandra uses the phi accrual failure detector to determine when nodes are down. The default phi threshold is 8, meaning a node is considered down when the algorithm is about 99.9999% confident it has failed. This adaptive approach allows Cassandra to work reliably across diverse network environments.</p>
<p>etcd, a distributed key-value store used by Kubernetes, implements heartbeats as part of its Raft consensus protocol. The Raft leader sends heartbeat messages to followers every 100 milliseconds by default. If a follower does not receive a heartbeat within the election timeout (typically 1000 milliseconds), it initiates a new leader election.</p>

<p>Heartbeats are essential to distributed systems. From simple periodic messages to sophisticated adaptive algorithms, heartbeats enable systems to maintain awareness of component health and respond to failures quickly.</p>
<p>The key to effective heartbeat design lies in balancing competing concerns. Fast failure detection requires frequent heartbeats and aggressive timeouts, but this increases network overhead and sensitivity to transient issues. Slow detection reduces resource consumption and false positives but leaves the system vulnerable to longer outages.</p>
<p>As we design distributed systems, consider heartbeat mechanisms early in the architecture process. The choice of heartbeat intervals, timeout values, and failure detection algorithms significantly impacts system behavior under failure conditions.</p>
<p>No matter what we are building, heartbeats remain an essential tool for maintaining reliability.</p>   </div></div>]]></description>

<p>Introducing an innovation space within the Blender project, where designers and developers can work together on challenging or future-facing projects, to keep Blender relevant in the years to come.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Over the years, Blender has grown and matured into a powerful and complex piece of software. With its unstoppable release cycle, a massive, highly demanding, and diverse user community, natural technical debt, and complex technical dependencies, shipping new features and general improvements requires more and more effort and coordination.</p>



<p>Software stability and reliability have become critical for individuals and companies. As a consequence, development efforts focus on those aspects, offering progressive improvements of existing functionality only when these are clear enhancements of what is already there.</p>



<p>This makes it more challenging to innovate, think outside the box, experiment, and break things.</p>



<p>To facilitate this essential aspect of product development, the Blender Foundation is establishing a new project: the Blender Lab. This is the innovation space where designers, developers, and researchers work together on challenging and future-facing projects that will help Blender stay relevant in the years to come.</p>



<a href="#what-is-a-lab-activity"><h2 id="what-is-a-lab-activity">What is a lab activity?</h2></a>



<p>A lab activity is a project that brings innovation to the Blender project, and contributes to Blender Foundation’s mission. The project should face some unknowns, but also be handled by a team or individual with sufficient domain knowledge to solve them. Lab activities are meant to be independent of Blender releases.</p>



<a href="#what-does-it-look-like"><h2 id="what-does-it-look-like">What does it look like?</h2></a>



<p>Lab activities are always public and visible on <a href="https://www.blender.org/lab/">blender.org/lab</a>. Here the ongoing projects are presented, sharing objectives, timeline and participants. Intermediate builds for testing and feedback will be available here as well.</p>



<a href="#first-batch-and-more-examples"><h2 id="first-batch-and-more-examples">First batch, and more examples</h2></a>



<p>To get started with this initiative, here are some projects that qualify, and that are listed:</p>



<ul>
<li>Beyond mouse and keyboard (touch and pen)</li>



<li>Beyond mouse and keyboard (VR/XR)</li>



<li>Volume rendering</li>



<li>Light transport</li>
</ul>



<p>Some more projects that could be added soon:</p>



<ul>
<li>USD Authoring</li>



<li>AI and ML technologies, starting with a Blender MCP server</li>
</ul>



<a href="#applied-vs-academic-research"><h2 id="applied-vs-academic-research">Applied vs. Academic research</h2></a>



<p>Lab activities can be grouped in two categories:</p>



<ul>
<li>Applied research, which is the main focus of the lab. Developing and eventually shipping groundbreaking solutions based on the latest research and knowledge in the field</li>



<li>Academic research. For example, this can be achieved by participating in projects organized by institutions such as universities and research centers, where Blender developers offer an advisory role on how technology can be implemented in production software.</li>
</ul>



<a href="#how-do-i-make-my-project-a-lab-project"><h2 id="how-do-i-make-my-project-a-lab-project">How do I make my project a Lab project?</h2></a>



<p>The goal is to start with a limited number of projects, assessed by Blender Foundation with the support of key Blender contributors. During the course of 2026, more guidelines will be defined and shared. If you are interested in submitting a proposal for a Lab project, you can do so by contacting Blender Foundation and sharing a public document where you describe the project and make a compelling case for it. The adoption of a project depends on many factors, including funds availability, relevance to the Blender missions, experience of the applicant, and more.</p>



<a href="#conclusion-and-credits"><h2 id="conclusion-and-credits">Conclusion and credits</h2></a>



<p>Special credit goes to Ton Roosendaal for advocating for this project since 2018. At the time the Blender project was not able to allocate resources to the initiative, but today, thanks to growing community and corporate support there starts to be a path for it. Future campaigns and partnerships will be crucial for the success of this project. You can make this happen by joining the Blender Development Fund at fund.blender.org.</p>

                                        <p>Liberalization of the railways has been a key tenet of European transport policy since the early 2000s, with proponents claiming that competition results in improved service quality and increased ridership. This is an instantly disprovable statement given that ridership was already on the rise across Europe prior to, rather than after, liberalization efforts, suggesting other effects are at play.</p><p><strong>Gareth Dennis</strong> is an award-winning railway engineer and writer. He is the author of the internationally bestselling book <i>How The Railways Will Fix the Future</i> and co-founder of the Campaign for Level Boarding.</p><p>On the other hand, the case against fragmented and privatized operations focuses on three key arguments. The first is that railways are complex systems where commercial boundaries at engineering interfaces are a threat to safety and efficiency. The second is that railway operations are geographic monopolies where market conditions are — at best — contrived. The third is that railways are a public service that cannot fail — hence, introducing private interests into the railways is merely a way to sequester income into private hands while the state shoulders the financial risk. In other words, private interests’ role is simply to extract profit that could otherwise be reinvested into the system.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom was one of first countries in Europe to liberalize a significant portion of its railways (Northern Ireland’s railways remained publicly owned and operated). As such, the aftermath of privatization is instructive in tracing liberalization’s final destination. In short: it isn’t pretty.</p>
<h4>Selling the Family Silver</h4>
<p>The UK’s contiguous network in Wales, Scotland, and England was privatized in stages between 1988 and 1997, starting with its domestic train manufacturing industry. This took place following a massive self-off of public assets in the aftermath of the broader financialization of the British economy. For example, the water industry in England and Wales was wholly divested through the 1980s — something no other country has ever done. Thanks to archived papers from then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, we can understand precisely what the political drivers for mass privatization were.</p>
<p>First, as a large employer of over 50,000 staff, divesting the water industry would greatly contribute to “the privatisation programme”. Second, it would take necessary investment in an ageing asset off the public books. Finally, it would increase shareholding in the public, mitigate state interference, and create financial assets for trade. It is worth noting that none of these justifications took the quality or expansion of services into account.</p>
<p>And so, we turn back to railways. In 1990, things had been looking up for British Rail. Ridership had been climbing solidly since the mid-1980s. The average subsidy was as low as 20 percent of running costs, making the British system one of the most efficient in Europe. Urban, regional, and high-speed rail projects were being delivered or, in the latter case, were in serious development.</p><blockquote><p>Three rolling stock operating companies bought — at rock-bottom prices — an enormous range of hugely valuable trains for which British Rail had scrimped and saved over the preceding decades.</p></blockquote><p>Then the early-1990s recession hit. More than a decade of constrained public spending and service sell-offs meant there was an immediate impact on passenger numbers, sending the government into a panic. Suddenly, the Thatcherite doctrine of “sell everything but the railways” was thrown out the window, and plans for privatization were put in motion.</p>
<p>In July 1992, a white paper entitled “New Opportunities for the Railways” was published, heavily informed by Treasury mandarins and their advisers at the Tufton Street-based Adam Smith Institute in London. It recommended nothing less than an atomization of the formerly integrated railway operating structure, with the creation of as many independent elements as possible to maximize perceived opportunities for competition.</p>
<p>On 1 April 1994, the Railways Act came into effect and the demise of British Rail began. It is worth noting that privatization had already started in the 1980s, for example with the sale of the train manufacturers in Derby and various ferry operations. But the 1990s was different — this was a fire sale.</p>
<h4>Deadly Side-Effects</h4>
<p>The first private entity to be created was Railtrack, which took over the railway infrastructure such as track, signals, and stations. Seven infrastructure maintenance units and six track renewal units were set up to split off maintenance from operation. Six freight operating companies were created. Twenty-five train operating units were also established, which from 1996 onwards were franchised out to the train operating companies.</p>
<p>Three rolling stock operating companies (ROSCOs) bought — at rock-bottom prices — an enormous range of hugely valuable trains for which British Rail had scrimped and saved over the preceding decades. They then leased these back to the train operators at eye-watering cost and with little oversight, enabling a significant outflow of cash from the industry. This has incentivized one of British passengers’ biggest gripes — the widespread use of trains that are as short as possible to minimize leasing costs, without a care for the resulting overcrowding.</p>
<p>Another impact of the ROSCOs landing a large, cheap asset that they could rent out at high prices was the near-death of the UK train manufacturing industry, as there was no incentive to continue British Rail's programme of fleet renewals. In the aftermath of privatization, only British Rail’s partially fulfilled orders remained on the books, and new passenger trains wouldn't be built at volume until the early 2000s, resulting in the demise of all but the Derby works. At great cost, new plants have opened in Newton Aycliffe and Newport since, but even these are once again under threat thanks to the lack of any long-term rolling stock strategy.</p>
<p>All franchises had been awarded, a plethora of regulating and organizing bodies had been established to hold the system together, and privatization was essentially complete by 1 April 1997, achieving the outgoing administration’s goal of completing the process by the next general election. Despite promises to the contrary, New Labour’s coming into power did not result in a reversal of the process.</p><blockquote><p>Franchise agreements, now managed by the Department for Transport, were growing more complex and more restrictive.</p></blockquote><p>However, in September 1997, an express train collided with a freight train in Southall, London, killing seven people and injuring 139 others. A lack of effective communication between the fragmented elements of the railway was the root cause of the horrific crash, the first of a series of serious fatal derailments that were attributable to the new structure of the railways.</p>
<p>In October 1999, the death of 31 people and the injury of 417 others at Ladbroke Grove, London, resulted in a cascade of changes to safety regulation. The derailment of an express train at Hatfield in October 2000 killed four people and injured 70, sending shockwaves through the industry as it had resulted directly from Railtrack’s self-perception as a contract management organization, not an engineering outfit. This fomented the demise of Railtrack, which was absorbed into a new government body called Network Rail. A gargantuan and rushed effort to replace thousands of miles of substandard track materials followed, requiring billions of pounds of additional funds and greatly impacting passenger numbers for several years.</p>
<p>Another fatal derailment at Potters Bar in May 2002 killed seven people and was caused by the negligence of a private maintenance company. This led to the return of many maintenance tasks in-house under Network Rail. With the process of Railtrack’s reconstitution as Network Rail completing in October 2002, the UK’s rail infrastructure had been de facto renationalized.</p>
<h4>Growing Pains</h4>
<p>The West Coast Main Line had long been considered the jewel in the crown of the British rail network, having been electrified and modernized through the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. By 1998, passenger growth was putting significant pressure on the route, and Virgin’s Richard Branson wanted to introduce new tilting trains and a much more frequent timetable. By 2002, costs had risen from 2.5 billion to 14.5 billion pounds (just short of 30 billion pounds in today’s money), and the scope of the project had been severely curtailed. What started in 1998 as a promise for a 140-miles-per-hour railway with fully digital signalling had descended into chaos by the early 2000s, contributing to Railtrack’s demise.</p>
<p>By this point, railways were at their most popular since the beginning of the previous century. Passenger numbers were skyrocketing, and a cross-party consensus agreed that rail investment and the expansion of the rail network were a good thing. Franchises previously let as “not for growth” such as those in Wales and the North were creaking at the seams as people turned to trains.</p>
<p>Franchise agreements, now managed by the Department for Transport, were growing more complex and more restrictive. The number of bidders reduced, and the ambition of their bids increased. This came to a head in 2009, when National Express was stripped of the East Coast franchise after failing to meet its payment targets despite continuing passenger growth.</p>
<p>In 2012, the West Coast bidding process was scrapped by government and was awarded as a short-term concession pending a review, and amidst a wider crisis across the industry in June 2018, the East Coast franchise — subsequently awarded to yet another optimistic bid by Virgin — also collapsed and had to be returned to state operation. By this point, franchise bidders were few and far between, and the system was close to collapse.</p><blockquote><p>Railways must be set into the bigger transport picture with ambitious targets — mobility in totality, not rail in isolation.</p></blockquote><p>These increasingly overambitious bids, combined with ever-more complex and controlling contracts, left only one lever open to the train operators to cut costs: staffing. From 2016 onwards, a wave of increasingly disruptive strikes took hold of the network, as terms and conditions were altered to attempt to reduce the number of staff the train operating companies had to have on their books.</p>
<p>Just as the industry’s new structure had resulted in the creation of the ROSCOs, which incentivised a freeze in new train procurement, the creation of Railtrack and its private suppliers resulted in a freeze in recruitment across the infrastructure domain. Crudely, when you have a fleet of trains that already run the service, why build new ones? The same ended up being broadly true for infrastructure — why employ new staff when you already have an enormous workforce?</p>
<p>A decade-wide gap in skills was the consequence. With the growth in passenger demand came a huge growth in the number of infrastructure projects being carried out, and this skills bottleneck, combined with an industry structure that exacerbated costs by maximizing the number of organizational interfaces, meant work was being delivered too slowly and at too high a price. Cost escalations became unbearable for government in 2017 and resulted not only in the curtailment of the national electrification programme, but also in the abandonment of other enhancements across the country, particularly in and around the north of England. Meanwhile, there was a glut of new train orders, many for new electric trains for which there were no longer overhead wires planned to power them.</p>
<p>May 2018 was supposed to be the moment that an enormous leap in capacity was created. New track and trains would enable a great leap in the number of trains running in the timetable. As it happened, neither the track nor the trains were in place to deliver much of this uplift, and the result was a collapse in the system’s reliability. Driver training could not happen, and a lack of trains, tracks, and staff resulted in the cancellation of upwards of one third of services in the South East and the north of England, with lesser but significant effects felt by passengers across the network.</p>
<p>Long an opponent of the franchise system and the lack of integration between track and train, then Secretary of State for Transport Chris Grayling initiated the Williams Review in 2018 to work out what shape the industry needed to be in to enable growth without cycling back to calamity. This review took time to pick up speed, leaving the industry in perpetual crisis mode.</p>
<h4>The Final Nail in the Coffin</h4>
<p>In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic reduced ridership to 5 percent of pre-COVID levels and the industry was placed on life support. By the end of that month, all franchises were transferred onto emergency concessions, and the franchise system was gone. This was made official in September 2020, as the government stated that franchising was to cease to exist, and by April 2021 the National Audit Office announced that train operators were to be officially classified as state-owned, despite the continued involvement of private companies. The irony of a Conservative than a Labour government beginning the re-integration of the system should not be lost on readers — indeed, this is a recurring theme.</p>
<p>Finally, in May 2021, the Williams—Shapps Plan for Rail was published, setting out a loose view of the future structure of the railways. Although lacking in details, the headline was that a new organization called Great British Railways (GBR) was to be created. A transition team was established to understand what GBR would do and how it would be structured. The ROSCOs, as the last major vestige of the Railways Act 1993, remained untouched.</p>
<p>Roll forwards seven years and, despite several train operators being controlled directly by the Department for Transport, there is still no clear picture of what GBR will be empowered or funded to do, let alone what its structure and intentions will be. Meanwhile, a general election has worsened, not improved, the outlook for the railway industry, as the number of major projects continues to fall alongside ongoing maintenance funding. Capacity is more squeezed than ever before.</p><blockquote><p>The rail industry needs democratization, so that decisions about the railways we use are made closer to us.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Despite the public’s continued support for publicly owned railways — 75% in 2025 compared with 60% in 2017 — the extent to which “nationalization” will achieve democratic oversight and the necessary reinvigoration of the industry remains unclear. Britain’s rail unions are cautiously supportive, but it is worth noting that scepticism has grown as the Labour Party drifts further to the centre.</p>
<p>The rail industry needs democratization, so that decisions about the railways we use are made closer to us. That means moving power, including over spending, away from Westminster. Democratic accountability at local and regional levels is key to unlocking the cycle of proposed and cancelled investment, and in pushing operators to do better. That means devolution of decision and funding powers to both the regions and cities, but also delivering sufficient industry funding autonomy so that it can respond quickly to these demands and rise above electoral cycles and fiscal anxiety.</p>
<p>Railways must be set into the bigger transport picture with ambitious targets — mobility in totality, not rail in isolation. Moreover, investment must be matched to those targets to build a railway that more people can use and benefit from — more capacity, more reliability and more accessibility.</p>
<p>Empowerment of the rail industry as a self-governing entity accountable chiefly to the UK’s regions and cities rather than to central government is a critical step in kicking things out of crisis mode and reshaping the industry to be fit for the long-term future. But as important is the need for the railways to tell a story about themselves that the public can get behind. Only with an ambitious and exciting vision of the future will the railways fulfil their true potential. Privatization, as the British experience shows, utterly failed to do so.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><h2 node="[object Object]">hack club: a story in three acts (aka, the shit sandwich)</h2>
<h2 node="[object Object]">how i got here</h2>
<p node="[object Object]">november 2024. i got an email from github education with the subject line "Set sail with Hack Club High Seas 🚢" and something about it just caught my eye. probably the ship emoji, if i'm honest. but i thought "wow, this looks fucking amazing, i ought to take part."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">and i did. got properly hooked, actually. made a few projects - they weren't particularly good, but i had FUN doing them. and that's kind of the whole point, isn't it? there were issues, sure - high seas being slow as hell sometimes, peer voting being a bit dodgy, the inevitable flood of AI generated projects - but most of the other projects were full of heart. you could tell people were actually building things they cared about.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">that's what got me invested in hack club. not the free stuff (though that's nice), but the feeling that there was actually a community of teenagers building things and helping each other out. it felt different from everywhere else online.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">which is why what i found later was so disappointing.</p>
<h2 node="[object Object]">act one: what they got right (the top slice)</h2>
<p node="[object Object]">look, i need to start with this: hack club's mission is genuinely brilliant. empowering teenagers to build, ship, and create things they care about? that's important work. most schools treat you like you're just there to absorb information and regurgitate it on tests. hack club says "no, you can make stuff that actually matters, right now."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">and the community, when it's working properly, is something special. you know how stack overflow is? ask a question, get downvoted, someone tells you "this has been asked before" without linking to where. discord servers are full of people being passive-aggressive. but hack club built something different - a space where teenagers actually help each other. where you can ask "how does this work?" and get a proper explanation instead of being made to feel stupid.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">one person put it perfectly: "if i post in this slack - i get a person who is kind enough to explain it to me in detail and a community to support me on. hack club tolerates <em>none</em> of what i described before, which is the social-norm everywhere else."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the programmes are stupidly cool too. YSWS (you ship, we ship) where teens build projects and hack club sends them hardware, grants or prizes. hackathons where hundreds of students get together to make things. summer of making, arcade, high seas - programmes that reward teenagers for following their interests. hack club bank letting student organisers access fiscal sponsorship and financial tools. neighbourhood offering housing in san francisco for coding projects. this is what makes students <em>actually</em> want to build things, not just show up.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">and the transparency thing? groundbreaking. most nonprofits are black boxes - you have no idea where money goes, who makes decisions, how things work. hack club open-sourced their code, their finances (you can see HCB transactions), their processes. teenagers could see exactly how things worked and contribute. there was this whole "leeks" culture where you'd get excited about upcoming programmes because you could see them being built. that <strong>is</strong> genuinely special.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the opportunities for teenagers to take real responsibility are rare. most places put teens on "youth advisory boards" where you get to feel involved without actually doing anything. at hack club, teenagers are running production systems, organising events, building the infrastructure. that trust in young people's capabilities is outstanding - when it works properly.</p>
<h3 node="[object Object]">the real impact</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">and look, this isn't just abstract "empowerment" nonsense. people are actually doing amazing things.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">one person shared their story: stumbled upon hack club through a github email, was able to ship their first app ever. college admissions didn't go as planned, so they took a gap year. during that year, thanks to what they'd built through hack club, they landed a full-stack software engineering internship at a reputable company and got a freelance gig doing app development. they said "none of them pay well but for my experience and age it is awesome to be able to do things this cool... and i would certainly say Hack Club played a huge role in it."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">someone else listed all the things they tried for the first time because of hack club: "I created my first pcb, advanced hardware, VR application, my own programming language, CLI application, a reinforced ML agent, ARM assembly, my mouse, 3D website, mcp, slack discord telegram Bot, a desktop application... All these were my first time!! And the learning from these has much more value in my life then the prizes I got."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">another person talked about making a game called voidborne during summer of making. started as "just another project" to get shells (the currency), but "it quickly evolved into smth else. it made me realize not everything i do is for prizes... i genuinely stopped caring about SoM and prizes, and just worked for the sake of making the game i had envisioned, something i could genuinely be proud of. seeing everyone so happy upon shipping it and seeing everyone i knew across slack playing it was the best experience i ever had in hackclub."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">that's the magic when it works. teenagers trying things they thought weren't possible. building things they're genuinely proud of. getting opportunities that lead to real jobs and real skills. "i joined for the prizes," someone said, "and stayed for the community."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">as zach (the founder) put it: "Ultimately the thing we are trying to do here is create a space where people build real projects they're proud of (and through that, hardcore technical skills), lifelong friendships, and experiences of incredible adventures like traveling across the world to go to a hackathon."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">and when that's happening? it's genuinely beautiful.</p>
<h2 node="[object Object]">act two: where it all went wrong (the filling)</h2>
<p node="[object Object]">but here's where the shit sandwich gets its name.</p>
<h3 node="[object Object]">the data protection failures</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">so in july 2025, i discovered that neighbourhood was exposing thousands of users' full legal names through an unprotected API endpoint. literally anyone with a slack ID could access this data. no authentication, no nothing. just a URL parameter and boom, there's your real name.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">i sent formal breach notifications to security@hackclub.com and gdpr@hackclub.com on july 9th. radio silence. nothing. not even an automated "we've received your email" response.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">when i tried talking to HQ staff informally, the responses were... well, shocking doesn't quite cover it. the first intern told me that since hack club is US-based, they're "not held to GDPR," that if fined "nothing compels us to pay it," and that EU people "void your EU protections" by coming to the US.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">when i pointed out that not having a privacy policy is itself a violation, they admitted they got this legal advice from chatgpt. yes. chatgpt. for legal advice about handling thousands of minors' personal data.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">thinking "okay, this is just one person who doesn't know better," i was pretty surprised when another intern came at me with the same attitude - "you know that eu can't do a shit with hackclub" because there's no physical presence in europe. when i pointed out payment processors and hosting make them liable, they switched tactics to "it'll never be enforced anyway" because "no one will" take them to court. then called me "annoying" for pushing the issue.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">but here's where it gets properly ridiculous. i raised this with chris, who's a full-time staff member (not a teenager), and he insisted that exposing physical addresses and sensitive info was "just a vuln" not a breach. said he's "never heard the term 'data breach' used that way" and... also relied on chatgpt instead of actual legal advice.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the exact same pattern. teenage intern using chatgpt for legal advice? concerning. full-time adult staff member doing the same thing? that's not a mistake, that's institutional practice.</p>
<h4 node="[object Object]">the pattern continues</h4>
<p node="[object Object]">and here's the thing - this wasn't a one-off. it keeps happening.</p>
<p node="[object Object]"><strong>neighbourhood:</strong> exposed full legal names, emails, and home addresses. one community member noted that "many were filed [reports], however, right after one was patched, the organisers would push vulnerable code all again, exposing AGAIN the PII leaks. also, no one was warned that their data was exposed." so they'd fix it, then immediately break it again. rinse and repeat.</p>
<p node="[object Object]"><strong>juice:</strong> leaked participants' names, phone numbers, emails, and flight receipts for over 7 months. two passport numbers were sitting there in airtable, publicly accessible. the endpoint had zero authentication - just pass an email in a URL and get everything. when i reported it, HQ initially claimed "flight receipts were not exposed" and the "most damning information is just phone numbers and names." then people started providing evidence - actual screenshots of flight receipts, passport numbers visible - and they had to walk it back. classic deny first, admit only when caught.</p>
<p node="[object Object]"><strong>high seas:</strong> exposed location data through unprotected endpoints. same story, different programme.</p>
<p node="[object Object]"><strong>thomas's log files:</strong> in september 2025, thomas committed and pushed log files to git containing emails, full names, physical addresses, dates of birth, and phone numbers of 3 minors. the response? private the repo, ask github to clear it from forks, job done. thomas said: "I have since started using git add <!-- -->&lt;fileName&gt;<!-- --> instead of git add ."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">mate. that's not learning from a mistake. that's basic git hygiene you should've been following from day one. this is like saying "i learned not to leave my car unlocked after someone nicked it three times."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">one person who was affected put it perfectly: "I believe, that if someone leaks data once it could be forgiven, but if it happens multiple times, one should rethink the way that data is handled."</p>
<h4 node="[object Object]">what about notifications?</h4>
<p node="[object Object]">filed a formal DSAR (data subject access request) on july 18th. three months later: nothing. no email, no data, complete silence. the gdpr@hackclub.com contact got taken down after people complained publicly about it. data deletion requests? same thing - ignored. another user noted: "same for data/gdpr removal requests."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">when zach (the founder) finally showed up in meta on july 10th, he said "Improving our policies around data is something that we started about 2 weeks ago and will probably have updates by end of September on."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">spoiler alert: end of september came and went. no updates.</p>
<h3 node="[object Object]">the surveillance infrastructure (orpheus engine)</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">so one day, someone in the community was poking around hack club's public repositories and found something called orpheus-engine. turns out hack club's been running this dagster pipeline every ~6 hours that:</p>
<ul node="[object Object]">
<li>profiles YSWS submission authors across social platforms using bright data and openai</li>
<li>sends full names and countries to third-party APIs (genderize, openai) to guess people's gender</li>
<li>uses OSINT techniques to search for where projects get mentioned across reddit, hacker news, etc.</li>
<li>geocodes addresses and archives project pages/repos</li>
<li>collects git commit emails</li>
</ul>
<p node="[object Object]">was any of this disclosed beforehand? no. opt-in? no. privacy policy explaining it? also no. the community only found out because someone stumbled across it in the public repos.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">when people asked about it, staff justified it as "necessary for sponsor analytics" - basically they need to show sponsors demographics and "impact" metrics. which, fair enough, sponsors want data. but maybe tell people you're profiling them across social media first?</p>
<h3 node="[object Object]">the vibecoding problem: when "just ship it" meets critical infrastructure</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">here's a fundamental problem that underlies a lot of this: the culture of "vibecoding" critical systems.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">someone in meta put it perfectly: "Honestly right now it feels like there's too much emphasis on the 'just ship it' mentality, especially for infrastructure that's handling sensitive data or forms the backbone of official events... when you're building systems that manage <em>real user data</em>, participant logistics, and authentication flows, the bar has to be higher. These aren't just random personal side projects, they are the core parts of <em>real</em> experiences that affect <em>real</em> people."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">they went on: "From what I've seen, there's a worrying lack of professional oversight or experienced review when it comes to security and infrastructure. Things are being 'vibecoded' quickly spun up without clear planning, code quality control, or long term maintainability."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">what's vibecoding? itai explained it: "vibecoding... is to push AI code without looking over it and/or constraining and testing it. unfortunately, when critical infrastructure such as DNS is vibecoded, a LOT of shit will break!"</p>
<p node="[object Object]">and break it did. neighbourhood. juice. highseas. thomas's public log files. these weren't isolated incidents - they were the inevitable result of prioritising speed over security when handling people's personal data.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">felix and others kept saying "please no more vibe coding" and calling for an actual DPO (data protection officer). but the culture remained: ship fast, deal with consequences later. except when you're dealing with teenagers' passport numbers and addresses, "later" is too fucking late.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the "hacker spirit" of rapid iteration is great for side projects. it's dangerous for production systems holding sensitive data. and hack club never seemed to learn the difference.</p>
<h3 node="[object Object]">minors making critical legal decisions</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">14-16 year old interns are handling:</p>
<ul node="[object Object]">
<li>gdpr compliance decisions</li>
<li>security breach responses</li>
<li>legal interpretation of data protection requirements</li>
<li>bounty assessments for bug hunters</li>
</ul>
<p node="[object Object]">these aren't "learning experiences" - they're critical legal and compliance roles that require qualified professionals.</p>
<h4 node="[object Object]">the $25 payout incident</h4>
<p node="[object Object]">so when i reported the neighbourhood vulnerability (the one exposing thousands of users' full legal names), rowan handled it. rowan's a teenage intern. the payout? $25. they'd reduced it from the "base amount" of $50 because:</p>
<ul node="[object Object]">
<li>i reported it via email to security@hackclub.com instead of using their form</li>
<li>i apparently "did not approach the situation with care"</li>
</ul>
<p node="[object Object]">rowan claimed they were "already working on a fix" because someone else reported it in july, and that he "follows up weekly on those reports." which would be fine, except i had screenshots. actual DMs between rowan and thomas where thomas said he "never wanted to fix it" and that "sadly nothing" could be done about the vulnerabilities.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">when i pointed this out and shared the screenshots, rowan's response was: "i got to go to bed soon."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">and look - i don't blame rowan for this. he's a teenager who was put in charge of security bounty decisions, legal compliance interpretations, and managing bug hunters. of course he's going to bed soon - he's probably got school the next day. the problem isn't that rowan made mistakes, it's that he was put in a position where those mistakes affected thousands of people's data security.</p>
<h4 node="[object Object]">the bounty programme's problems</h4>
<p node="[object Object]">as one community member pointed out: "Currently the Security Program's payout rules aren't logical - it goes against the founding principals of this program... what we should do is being generous about the payouts - doing so can instill confidence in people's heart, buy people's trust in Hackclub."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">another asked: "if you found a security vulnerability within hackclub, severe or major, given how they have currently handled reports so far, would YOU report it and go through the same process and payouts that previous people have experienced?"</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the answer from most people was a resounding no.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">someone else noted the irony: "also kinda funny given the two people running the security program have gotten several thousands in bug bounties themselves."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the juice vulnerability? i was told my payout would be docked entirely because i shared the vulnerable endpoint in a private group chat (of which less than 10 people saw) after reporting it through proper channels. apparently "responsible disclosure" means "don't tell anyone ever, even in private" - which is a great way to discourage people from reporting issues.</p>
<h3 node="[object Object]">exploitative labour practices</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">the "regional manager fellowship" pitched as a "near full-time" role for 6 months offers a $350 baseline stipend (works out to roughly $2.69/hour if actually full-time). when challenged about minimum wage, staff responded:</p>
<ul node="[object Object]">
<li>"it's a contractor role" (to sidestep employment law)</li>
<li>"worst case - no regional managers in europe"</li>
<li>"most people would be happy doing it for free"</li>
<li>"a @hackclub.com email is an amazing perk"</li>
</ul>
<p node="[object Object]">teenagers are positioned as "independent contractors" to avoid employment protections, holiday pay, and wage floors. this isn't "scrappy nonprofit" energy - it's child exploitation dressed up as opportunity.</p>
<h3 node="[object Object]">the enshittification process</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">hack club has followed the classic pattern:</p>
<ol node="[object Object]">
<li>build community goodwill with genuine mission and values</li>
<li>grow large enough that individual users become expendable</li>
<li>prioritise institutional interests over user protection</li>
<li>dismiss criticism as "toxic" or "unconstructive"</li>
<li>rely on defensive PR instead of actual accountability</li>
</ol>
<h4 node="[object Object]">the community notices</h4>
<p node="[object Object]">the community's noticed, and they're not exactly keeping quiet about it.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">one person put it like this: "i joined hackclub a year ago and it was enjoyable, i had fun building new shit and enjoyed the free stuff because it made me feel my projects were worth spending time on. the community was engaging and helpful. now however? the yswses seem more unpolished... hackclub has become less about creating for the sake of it and more about making sloppy work for free stuff."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">another: "Hack Club was once a community. A community that <em>helped</em> each other... A community that built amazing things <em>together</em>. But sometime, this year or last, things had changed quite... drastically... If HC was a community then, I'd say it's now a micro-society. A society, where you do X to exchange for Y, <em>quantity</em> (time/hours) over <em>quality</em> (personality and originality)."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">"i really dont like how hc is right now... when i joined around a yr ago it was more technical and it had people actually trying to learn and grow instead of posting random videos of brain rot and meowing every few minutes."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">"meta derailed from it's original purpose... it's more about venting about problems in hackclub now rather than taking on direct community issues."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">technical conversations have dried up. programmes feel rushed and low-quality - 15+ YSWS in one summer, many being one-day events or minor add-ons. growth metrics (hours spent, submission counts) have replaced actual impact. the open-source culture's eroded.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">chris (HQ staff) even acknowledged there's always been drama: "A year ago &lt;#meta&gt; and hack club broadly had <em>every bit</em> as much toxicity and drama as it has today! Like, literally just scroll back to a year ago and read the <em>dozens and dozens</em> of dumpster fire threads about HQ democracy, about how arcade was the worst thing we had ever done..."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">but here's the thing - yeah, there's always been drama. but acknowledging "it's always been messy" doesn't excuse the fact that the specific problems now are about data protection, legal compliance, and exploitation of minors. those aren't just "community vibes," those are institutional failures with actual real-world consequences.</p>
<h3 node="[object Object]">the semantic games</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">when confronted about failures, hack club staff engage in:</p>
<ul node="[object Object]">
<li>arguing about the definition of "data breach" vs "vulnerability"</li>
<li>claiming US location exempts them from GDPR despite processing EU data</li>
<li>using "fellowship" language to avoid labour law</li>
<li>dismissing formal emails as "back channels"</li>
<li>treating 72-hour breach notification requirements as suggestions</li>
</ul>
<h3 node="[object Object]">email compliance failures</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">hack club has repeatedly:</p>
<ul node="[object Object]">
<li>automatically opted users into marketing emails when signing up for programmes</li>
<li>re-subscribed users who previously unsubscribed</li>
<li>used physical addresses collected for identity verification for mail forwarding without consent</li>
<li>operated for months without a privacy policy explaining any of this</li>
</ul>
<p node="[object Object]">this violates CAN-SPAM act, PECR, and basic consent requirements.</p>
<h3 node="[object Object]">the response to criticism</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">when community members raised concerns:</p>
<ul node="[object Object]">
<li>they were told to "just make a PR"</li>
<li>their concerns were dismissed as not understanding how nonprofits work</li>
<li>they were accused of being "toxic" or having a "vendetta"</li>
<li>threads were locked</li>
<li>staff played victim about being "attacked"</li>
</ul>
<p node="[object Object]">one particularly revealing response from max (HQ staff) blamed the community for making things worse:</p>
<p node="[object Object]">"what it spiraled into because the fake stuff went out sooner then the truth:
• someone DDoS'ed HC
• supply chain attacks– people contacting our server providers and almost shut down all HC infra
• people finding personal contact info of HC adjacent people (ie. donors) and harassing them
• spam/doxing attempts out side of official HC channels"</p>
<p node="[object Object]">so instead of acknowledging the root cause - actual data breaches and mishandling - the focus shifted to blaming "fake stuff" and community reactions. classic deflection.</p>
<h4 node="[object Object]">the real-world consequences</h4>
<p node="[object Object]">one affected user shared: "I don't know who you are, but I feel extremely sorry for you and I think at the very least Hack Club should provide some kind of data protection service for free for some time to people who suffer from their data breaches, and Hack Club should also invest more in preventing them from happening."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">another community member noted: "HC should be getting outside parties to do a security test against basically everything ngl, get things verified as safe to process data. there should also be requirements imo for how sites are built, data managed, git repo setup and commits, etc."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">but the most telling comment came from someone who experienced it firsthand: "this kinda fortifies my whole issue as well. we should not be letting kids handle this data without proper training. and so far, its very clear that they've had none. or they just simply don't care and want to get something rushed out as fast as possible."</p>
<h3 node="[object Object]">the "small team with limited resources" myth</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">here's a fun one you'll see constantly when questions come up about security, proper processes, or fair compensation: hack club loves to position itself as a "small team" with limited resources.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">max (HQ staff) put it this way: "Hack Club is not a high paying job. People work here and run programs because Hack Club changed their lives and they want to run life-changing programs for the next generation of Hack Clubbers. The work is a labor of love."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">sounds noble, right? a scrappy nonprofit doing its best with limited resources? when someone asked about expanding HCB to pakistan, ian responded: "We don't think this is fair, but there is literally <em>nothing</em> we can do to change it without incurring millions of dollars in expenses." another staff member chimed in: "HC is not really big."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">except here's the thing: you can check their finances yourself at hcb.hackclub.com/hq - they're transparent about it, remember? when someone thought HQ "only had like 2.5m", another community member corrected them and pointed to the actual balance. as of discussions in 2025, people were citing "$4 million dollars in bank" or more.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">let me be clear: they have <strong>millions in the bank</strong>. not thousands. millions. and yes, zach mentioned it would cost "$1m in development and legal costs to set up HCB for Europe and at least $500k/year in ongoing legal and compliance costs" - which is a lot. but when you're sitting on multiple millions and claiming you can't afford to pay security researchers proper bounties or regional managers minimum wage, the maths doesn't add up.</p>
<h4 node="[object Object]">what they claim they can't afford</h4>
<ul node="[object Object]">
<li>hiring qualified legal counsel (instead of consulting chatgpt), (since saying this, they have finally hired a lawyer)</li>
<li>paying bug hunters proper bounties ($25 for hundreds of exposed names)</li>
<li>paying regional managers minimum wage ($350 for 6 months near full-time work)</li>
<li>implementing proper data protection infrastructure</li>
<li>hiring a data protection officer</li>
<li>properly training staff handling PII</li>
<li>fulfilling DSAR requests in a timely manner</li>
</ul>
<p node="[object Object]">but somehow they can afford:</p>
<ul node="[object Object]">
<li>$200k+ openai bills (as mentioned in community discussions about orpheus engine costs)</li>
<li>paying for genderize API to infer gender from names</li>
<li>paying for bright data proxy networks to scrape social media</li>
<li>sending letters and physical prizes to thousands of participants</li>
</ul>
<p node="[object Object]">when challenged about the exploitative regional manager pay, someone pointed out: "assuming 20 RM's are hired and each makes idk, $1750 on average, you get a total expenditure of: $35,000. yeah the budget is suffering so hard because of this /s"</p>
<p node="[object Object]">$35,000 to pay teenagers fairly. they have millions. do the maths.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">but the justification persists. as one community member noted: "Hack Club has tons of people willing to jump in and help, often for free. They are not starving for hands."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">see, it's not that they <em>can't</em> afford it. it's that they don't have to, because teenagers will work for "exposure" and the promise that it's a "labor of love."</p>
<h4 node="[object Object]">the visibility problem</h4>
<p node="[object Object]">part of how they maintain the "small team" image is by being deliberately vague about who actually works for hack club. when someone asked "Is there a way to identify HC employees and YSWS organizers in the slack?" the responses were telling:</p>
<ul node="[object Object]">
<li>"you can find (most of) the hc employees at hackclub.com/team/" (note: <em>most</em> of them)</li>
<li>"some say on their profiles" (but not all)</li>
<li>"But i dont know why Slack doesnt show roles like Discord, since there is a staff role"</li>
</ul>
<p node="[object Object]">one person noted: "I would appreciate if everybody who worked for HC would put it on their profiles." but many don't. this creates plausible deniability - when a teenage intern gives bad legal advice or mishandles a security report, it's easy to claim "oh they're just a community member" even though they're literally running official programmes.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">when questioned about who counts as "HQ staff," someone said "i'd define staff as anyone who gets a paycheck." but even that's murky because of all the "volunteers" and "fellows" and contractors who aren't technically "staff" but are making critical decisions about other people's data.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the opacity serves a purpose: it lets them leverage unpaid or underpaid labour while maintaining the "scrappy small nonprofit" image, even when they're sitting on millions and running programmes that affect tens of thousands of teenagers.</p>
<h3 node="[object Object]">interlude: the cost of "learning experiences"</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">here's the uncomfortable truth that nobody at HQ wants to address: when you position critical security and legal compliance roles as "learning experiences" for teenagers, the people who pay the price aren't the teenagers learning - it's the thousands of minors whose data gets exposed.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">thomas admitted he learned to use <code node="[object Object]">git add &lt;fileName&gt;</code> instead of <code node="[object Object]">git add .</code> after leaking 3 minors' PII. that's great that he learned something. but those 3 people's data - full names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers - was publicly accessible on github. you can't un-leak that.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">rowan learned about weekly follow-ups and proper communication after cutting payouts and lying about fix timelines. fantastic personal growth. but thousands of users' legal names were exposed for months while he "learned."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the teenage interns learned that chatgpt isn't a substitute for legal counsel after giving wildly incorrect GDPR advice. wonderful lesson. but EU residents' data protection rights were violated in the meantime.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">and the cost isn't just on the community - it's on the interns, volunteers and staff too. as zach himself admitted: "One of the first trainings I had to give some of the interns and new gap years this summer was how not to be emotionally devastated by #meta because there were some posts about them. It sucks that I had to have that conversation before I even had a chance to show some of them how to get a website deployed on Hack Club infra."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">he went on: "Staff members lie awake at 11:30 pm on their phones doomscrolling #meta because they care and want to improve. But they are just getting bullied by anonymous people who speak with absolute authority, sometimes make threats, and generally have a bullying and belligerent attitude."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">so let's be clear: you put teenagers in critical legal and security roles without proper training. they fuck up (predictably). the community criticises the fuck-ups (reasonably). then you blame the community for "bullying" the teenagers you put in those positions.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the solution isn't training interns to cope with criticism. the solution is not putting people in roles that handle thousands of people's sensitive data in the first place.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">this isn't hypothetical harm. these are real people - many of them minors - whose personal information was mishandled, exposed, and inadequately protected because hack club decided that "empowering teenagers" meant putting them in roles they weren't qualified for without proper oversight.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">and when challenged on this, the response isn't "you're right, we need qualified adults handling this" - it's "you're being toxic and unconstructive."</p>
<h2 node="[object Object]">act three: what it means (the bottom slice)</h2>
<p node="[object Object]">here's the thing: i still believe in what hack club could be.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">empowering teenagers to build amazing things is important work. the world needs more spaces where young people are trusted, supported, and given real opportunities. the core idea - that teenagers can and should make meaningful things - is right.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the community still has incredible people in it. teenagers helping each other learn, shipping ambitious projects, supporting one another through challenges. the "radical acts of kindness" that built hack club haven't disappeared entirely.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">but the organisation has lost its way. it has prioritised growth over sustainability, metrics over meaning, institutional protection over user safety. it's become what it once stood against: another tech organisation that talks about transparency while operating in secrecy, that preaches empowerment while exploiting labour, that claims to care about teenagers while systematically failing to protect their data.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the path forward exists:</p>
<ul node="[object Object]">
<li>remove minors from legal compliance and data protection roles</li>
<li>implement actual data protection processes with qualified professionals</li>
<li>stop playing semantic games to avoid legal obligations</li>
<li>provide proper training and oversight for anyone handling user data</li>
<li>establish clear escalation paths for security issues</li>
<li>publish and follow actual privacy policies</li>
<li>treat security researchers as partners, not annoyances</li>
<li>acknowledge institutional failures instead of playing victim</li>
<li>pay teenagers fairly for real work</li>
<li>return to genuine transparency, not PR-managed disclosure</li>
</ul>
<p node="[object Object]">the infrastructure for greatness is still there. the mission is still valid. the community still has the potential to be something special. but it requires leadership to choose accountability over image management, protection over growth, and people over metrics.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">hack club can still be the organisation it claims to be. but it has to want to be better more than it wants to look good. and based on the pattern of responses over the past months, that shift hasn't happened yet.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the story isn't over. but the next chapter will determine whether hack club becomes a cautionary tale about organisational enshittification, or a redemption story about an organisation that listened, learned, and became what it always claimed to be.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">right now, it could go either way.</p>
<h3 node="[object Object]">epilogue: what i've learned from all this</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">i've spent months on this. formal emails, meta posts, private conversations, evidence gathering, arguing with staff, getting called toxic, watching payouts get cut, seeing data requests ignored. honestly? it's been exhausting.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">but here's what really gets me: i genuinely wanted hack club to succeed. still do, if i'm honest. the mission is too important to let it fail because of institutional arrogance and mismanagement.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">when i first found the neighbourhood vulnerability, i thought "okay, this is a problem, i'll report it properly, they'll fix it, everyone learns something." naive, sure. but i genuinely believed in the whole "we're all learning together" thing.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the response wasn't what i expected:</p>
<ul node="[object Object]">
<li>chatgpt legal advice from multiple staff members</li>
<li>$25 for thousands of exposed names</li>
<li>"you're annoying" for following up</li>
<li>"it'll never be enforced anyway"</li>
<li>three months of ignored DSAR requests</li>
<li>the gdpr contact email being taken down after complaints</li>
<li>being accused of not using "proper channels" when i literally used security@hackclub.com</li>
<li>watching the same developer cause the third or fourth breach with the same "oops learned my lesson" response</li>
</ul>
<p node="[object Object]">but here's the thing - even after all this, i've seen what hack club can be at its best.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">one community member put it perfectly: "Some of you (including me) don't seem to realise how lucky we are to have something like Hack Club. Hack Club, a community where we all share the same interest and mindset. Hack Club, a community where I feel empowered and respected. Hack Club, a community where I'm rewarded for, what, following my own interests?!"</p>
<p node="[object Object]">they're absolutely right. when hack club works, it's genuinely magical. teenagers building things they never thought possible. communities forming around shared interests. people getting opportunities that change their lives.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">but that same person also said: "HQ, I can't speak for others, but all I'm asking for is a bit of transparency. You can't ask us to be constructive when you don't tell us what you've tried, what you've stuck with, and why it works."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">and that's the core issue, isn't it? transparency without accountability isn't transparency - it's just PR. open-sourcing your finances is great, but if you're also ignoring GDPR requests and paying teenagers $2.69/hour, the transparency just makes the problems more visible.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the difference between what hack club is and what it could be isn't some impossible gap. it's just a choice. a choice to prioritise the mission over ego. to admit mistakes instead of denying them. to protect teenagers instead of exploiting them.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">i hope they make the right choice. because when i think about that person who got their first internship, or the one who built voidborne and felt proud for the first time, or the community member who said they feel "empowered and respected" - that's what hack club should be.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">that's worth fighting for. even when it's exhausting.</p>
<h3 node="[object Object]">the question nobody wants to ask</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">here's the uncomfortable question: is hack club actually good for teenagers?</p>
<p node="[object Object]">empowering teens to build things? absolutely yes.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">giving teens real responsibility and trust? mostly yes.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">but putting teens in legal compliance roles they're not qualified for? no.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">exposing thousands of teens' PII through repeatedly preventable security failures? definitely not.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">paying teens less than minimum wage by calling it a "fellowship"? also no.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">creating a culture where raising concerns gets you labeled "toxic"? really, really not.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the cost-benefit analysis is starting to look pretty grim. how many data breaches is "learning" worth? how much exploitation is acceptable in the name of "opportunity"?</p>
<h3 node="[object Object]">so what now?</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">here's the thing: the infrastructure for something genuinely incredible is still there.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">teenagers are still building amazing things. people are still landing internships because of what they learned at hack club. someone's still shipping their first VR app, their first PCB, their first game they're actually proud of. the community - when it's allowed to be a community and not a grinding machine - is still special.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">all the pieces are there:</p>
<ul node="[object Object]">
<li>an engaged community of thousands of teens who genuinely want to build things</li>
<li>programmes that, when properly managed, create real opportunities</li>
<li>financial resources (millions, remember?) to fix the problems</li>
<li>a mission that people genuinely believe in</li>
</ul>
<p node="[object Object]">what's missing is:</p>
<ul node="[object Object]">
<li>actual data protection oversight (hire a DPO, not chatGPT)</li>
<li>proper security review before shipping (professional oversight for sensitive systems)</li>
<li>fair compensation (pay minimum wage at least)</li>
<li>accountability (stop letting the same people cause breach after breach)</li>
<li>transparency that includes admitting mistakes (not just denying everything)</li>
</ul>
<p node="[object Object]">none of this is impossible. it's not even particularly expensive compared to what they're already spending. it just requires admitting there's a problem and choosing to fix it.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the mission - empowering teenagers to build amazing things - is genuinely important. that's why this all matters. that's why people like me spent months trying to get them to listen. not to tear hack club down, but because we wanted it to be better.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">and it still could be.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">teenagers deserve better than "vibecoded" infrastructure exposing their data. they deserve better than $2.69/hour "fellowships." they deserve better than being called toxic for raising legitimate concerns.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">they deserve a hack club that actually lives up to its mission.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the question is: will hack club choose to become that? or will it continue doubling down, denying breaches, dismissing critics, and hoping the community forgets?</p>
<p node="[object Object]">i genuinely hope they choose the first option. the potential is there. the resources are there. the community desperately wants to believe in the mission.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">all hack club needs to do is choose to be worthy of that belief.</p>
<h3 node="[object Object]">the aftermath: what actually changed</h3>
<p node="[object Object]">so after all this - the meta posts, the complaints, the evidence, the regulatory threats, the months of criticism - what actually got fixed?</p>
<p node="[object Object]">zach promised on july 10th: "Improving our policies around data is something that we started about 2 weeks ago and will probably have updates by end of September on."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">end of september came and went. by october 9th, someone noted: "Privacy policy is like the last thing you would make before making any web service public, but HC has lacked it for years."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">as of october, the situation looked like this:</p>
<p node="[object Object]"><strong>what got "fixed":</strong></p>
<ul node="[object Object]">
<li>thomas learned to use <code node="[object Object]">git add &lt;fileName&gt;</code> instead of <code node="[object Object]">git add .</code> (only took leaking 3 people's PII)</li>
<li>the security bounty programme exists (with shit payouts and questionable rules, but it exists)</li>
<li>some vulnerabilities that were reported got patched (until new code pushed them again)</li>
</ul>
<p node="[object Object]"><strong>what didn't get fixed:</strong></p>
<ul node="[object Object]">
<li>no comprehensive privacy policy for hack club's main operations</li>
<li>DSARs still being ignored months later ("it's been several months" as of writing this)</li>
<li>data still stored "in close to a hundred different places" making deletion near-impossible</li>
<li>identity vault still keeping documents indefinitely with no deletion option</li>
<li>orpheus-engine still profiling people without meaningful consent</li>
<li>minors still handling critical data and compliance decisions</li>
<li>same developers still shipping insecure code to production</li>
<li>still no qualified DPO or data protection oversight</li>
</ul>
<p node="[object Object]">one community member noted: "HQ would have to work on only data protection for a couple months straight to get things reasonably better."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">but they didn't do that. they just... carried on. new programmes, same problems.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the one bright spot? some community members took matters into their own hands. nest (a hq-sponsored but community-run project) sat down, mapped their data, considered legitimate interests, drafted a proper privacy policy, and implemented it. they showed it CAN be done. as they put it: "Privacy is a human right. To desire privacy is to be human... We're grateful that you trust us to handle your data and I think we should return the favor by respecting you."</p>
<p node="[object Object]">if a community project can do it, why can't HQ?</p>

<h2 node="[object Object]">thank-you's</h2>
<p node="[object Object]">first off, to hack club itself: thank you for existing. seriously. for all the criticism in this document, the world genuinely needs more organisations trying to empower teenagers to build things. the mission matters. the real impact on people's lives - the internships landed, the first projects shipped, the friendships formed, the opportunities created - that's real and it's valuable. this document exists because i believe in that mission enough to want it to succeed properly. i want hack club to be better because the alternative - it shutting down or becoming irrelevant - would be worse for everyone.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">to the community members who spoke up: thank you. to everyone who posted in meta about data protection, who questioned labour practices, who called out the vibecoding, who asked for transparency, who kept pushing even when called "toxic" - you did the right thing. speaking up when you see problems isn't being difficult, it's how communities stay healthy and organisations stay accountable. special thanks to those who helped gather evidence, who filed proper reports, who tried to work within the system even when it was exhausting and frustrating. you made this document possible.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">to the people whose data was exposed: i'm sorry this happened to you. you deserved better protection than you got. you trusted hack club with your personal information and that trust was violated. that's not okay, and it's not your fault.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">to the interns and staff who got caught in the middle: this isn't about you personally. you were put in impossible positions by institutional failures and you did your best with what you had. being trained on "how not to be emotionally devastated by meta" before being taught how to deploy a website isn't your fault - it's a sign that something is deeply wrong with how the organisation operates. you deserved better support and better guidance.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">to the nest team who actually wrote a proper privacy policy: thank you for showing it CAN be done. "privacy is a human right" - you get it.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">and to you, the reader: thank you for making it through 8 and a half thousand words of this. whether you're a hack club participant trying to understand what happened, a parent trying to evaluate the risks, a regulator looking into complaints, another nonprofit trying to learn from these mistakes, or just someone who cares about teenagers' data protection - thank you for caring enough to read this entire thing.</p>
<p node="[object Object]">the story isn't over. how it ends depends on what happens next. i hope it's a redemption arc.</p></section></div>]]></description>
