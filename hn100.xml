    <p><span><span>Many people see adverts as the scourge of the internet but they remain the major, and in many cases, only, revenue stream for online media publishers. Another blow has been struck to online advertising recently, however, as a study has revealed how it could constitute for as much as 79 percent of the mobile data consumed by each web page. &nbsp;</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
</div><div>
     
<h2><span><span>An average of 48% of our data is spent on ads</span></span></h2> 
<p><span><span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/enders-analysis-ad-blocker-study-finds-ads-take-up-79-of-mobile-data-transfer-2016-3?r=DE&amp;IR=T" target="_blank">The&nbsp;study</a>,</span></span><span><span> published by media research firm <a href="https://www.endersanalysis.com/" target="_blank">Enders Analysis</a> in late April, suggested that, on average, almost half of the data required to view a web page&nbsp;is consumed by advertising. </span><span>To test this, <em>Enders</em> used a browser that mimicked an iPhone 6 and accessed a total of eight "popular" news sites (though they didn't confirm what these were).&nbsp;</span></span></p> 
<p><span><span><em>Ender</em>'s published the chart below which shows&nbsp;the&nbsp;data consumed by&nbsp;three&nbsp;web page elements: HTML (blue), Javascript (orange) and ads (green). </span><span>The columns below correspond&nbsp;to the data (in megabytes) consumed by each of the eight websites. Pages were loaded once in their entirety, once with ads disabled, and once with Javascript and ads</span><span>&nbsp;disabled to achieve the results.</span></span></p>

</figure> 
<p><span><span>The conclusion is that the ads accounted for anywhere between 18&nbsp;and 79 percent of the data transferred while non-essential JavaScript elements&nbsp;added an extra 6 to 68 percent.&nbsp;</span></span></p> 
<p><span><span>"</span></span>On the basis of this investigation, an estimate that says advertising accounts for half of all data used by publisher pages on iPhones does not look unreasonable," <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/16/ad-blocking-advertising-half-of-data-used-articles" target="_blank">the report stated</a>.</p> 
<h2><span><span>Oh, so that's why I run out of data before the end of the month...</span></span></h2> 
<p>Well, not exactly. This was only tested on eight unnamed news sites&nbsp;on a system which represented an iPhone 6: it's far from comprehensive. That said, it does provide insight into the <em>potential</em>&nbsp;effect that advertising can have on mobile data.</p> 
<p>Mobile data is consumed by far more than just webpages: downloads, streaming, messages and apps can all add to how much mobile data your device uses. But mobile browsers like Chrome are often at the top of this list&nbsp;(just check your <em>mobile data</em> page in your Android settings now to see for yourself).</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2> 
<p><span><span>Solutions to this issue are scarce, but Adblock services do provide&nbsp;one way to reduce this data consumption. This is a c</span><span>ontroversial subject, though, as ads&nbsp;are often the sole&nbsp;source&nbsp;of a website's revenue, and cutting this off invariably means cutting funding for that site.&nbsp;</span></span></p> 
<p>With online ads being so omnipresent&nbsp;– and indeed vital to the survival of most websites&nbsp;– we just hope that they can be made more efficient, and their cost to the mobile data plans of consumers reduced further.

          <p data-word-count="21" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4nauuyx000h3b73487r3ekm@published"><a href="https://slate.com/theslatest?utm_source=slate&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=article_plain_text_topper"><em>Sign up for the Slatest</em></a><em> to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.</em></p>

  <p data-word-count="209" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3eiyb00120sm0zhdck0d1@published">In my life, I’ve personally witnessed three elite salespeople at work. The first was in the Johnson County, Iowa, jail, where I spent July&nbsp;4 and 5 some years ago for reasons I’d rather not go into here. It was so overcrowded that we had to sleep head to foot on foam pads, and on the second day, as the discharge process dragged into the afternoon and hangovers set in, the inmates became restive. Among us was a nondescript heavyset guy who started to hold forth: <em>Y’all want to know how to disable a burglar alarm with aluminum foil? Want to know how to cook meth without using fertilizer? Did you know there’s a way to open the door of a squad car from the inside?</em> Soon, almost the entire jail had gathered around him like kindergartners at story time, listening raptly as he dispensed criminal wisdom. Possibly he was making it all up as he went; a guy lying on the floor next to me with his forearm over his eyes would periodically mutter <em>that’s not true</em>,<em> uh-huh</em>,<em> that’s a great way to burn down your house</em>, that kind of thing. But if anything, that only increased my admiration—this guy had installed himself as top dog just by bullshitting.</p>

  

  <p data-word-count="112" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3fkec00183b73v7t98gbn@published">I know a good salesman when I see one. I was, briefly, the No.&nbsp;1 telemarketer in the United States. I can’t prove it; this was around 20 years ago, and I haven’t kept any of my framed “top seller” certificates or the daily sales sheets showing me already hitting 350&nbsp;percent of my weekly quota by Tuesday afternoon. But the company I worked for had <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2000/11/01/deals/worldcom/tracking.htm">one of the biggest telemarketing divisions</a> in the world, and during my hot streak there were several weeks in which I was the top salesperson in the entire company. Believe me or not, but who’d lie about being good at telemarketing? It’s like falsely claiming to have gonorrhea.</p>

  <p data-word-count="198" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3fkfa001a3b73w7sha16c@published">What’s strange is how completely I’d forgotten about this period in my life in the decades since, as one “forgets”—maybe <em>represses</em> is the more accurate word—certain embarrassing exes or haircuts. But it all came back to me recently, when I watched the HBO docuseries <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2023/08/telemarketers-hbo-episode-3-pat-pespas-max-documentary-finale.html"><em>Telemarketers</em></a>. If you’ve ever worked in telemarketing, you’ll immediately recognize the setting: the low-ceilinged, fluorescent-lit office building at the edge of town, the empty liquor bottles piled up in the men’s room, a time capsule of a world that came and went nearly unnoticed. You may even recognize yourself in the grainy VHS footage: an alternative but otherwise identical self, hunched over in an upholstered cubicle, rattling off canned rebuttals to some baffled retiree as you mime the jack-off motion for the amusement of the temporarily bankrupt drug dealer in the next cubicle. It was the Y2K-adjacent midpoint between the door-to-door salesmen of the boomer era and the present-day dystopia of A.I.–enhanced robocalling—the last few years before American credulity (and disposable income) was decisively strip-mined by post–9/11 disillusionment, the emergence of the internet, an economy that seemed to lurch from crisis to crisis, and, well, petty cheats like me, the bedrock of this nation.</p>

  


  


  


  


  <p data-word-count="135" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3fkgf001c3b73i1jnvdr6@published">I became a telemarketer only because I’d bombed out of every other job in Iowa City, from making the federal minimum wage at a video arcade in Iowa’s largest shopping mall (fired for abusing the “free game” key) to working the graveyard shift at a 24-hour adult video store (fired for being “too horny”). There was unlimited demand for telemarketers in those days; this was in the early aughts, at the tail end of the long-distance wars, when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/21/us/no-holds-barred-battle-for-long-distance-calls.html">more than 25&nbsp;million people a year</a> were switching phone companies in pursuit of lower rates on long-distance calls, a sentence that might as well be written in ancient Sumerian to anyone under 30. You didn’t really even have to apply back then. You just put your name in and they told you what day you were starting.</p>

  <p data-word-count="237" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3fkhf001e3b73ihp3r2sa@published">Everyone said that telemarketing was the worst job in town, and for once, everyone was right. Your very first day, you understood that this was the culmination of a long series of bad decisions, the consequences of which you thought you’d escaped—but no, you realized as you walked past the cars in the parking lot with trash bags duct-taped over shattered windows and avoided eye contact with the loiterers in the break room who checked the change slot after you bought a drink from the Coke machine—you’d only put them off until right now. After a short training period that seemed designed mostly to weed out the people who weren’t capable of sitting in a chair for four hours at a time (about half the applicants), we spent some time listening in on the calls of top sellers. I expected them to be devilishly persuasive, modern-day snake charmers, but there didn’t seem to be much to it. They’d tell people they could save them money on their phone bills. If the prospect said they weren’t interested, the seller would either keep talking as if they hadn’t heard or, if a hang-up seemed imminent, recite a “resistance buster” like “I am going to send YOU a check!” The abruptness of this non sequitur, half-shouted over the tail end of the conversation, almost always derailed the lead’s attempts at disengagement, and few people could resist asking, “For how much?”</p>

  


  


  


  


  <p data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3fki7001g3b73plc24rco@published"><em>What do you think?</em> my manager asked after I’d had a few days of listening in on these calls. Could I do it? My entire life savings at the time amounted to a stocking cap about half full of change. I had no choice but to find out.</p>

  
  <p data-word-count="113" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3fkj6001h3b73ommpftf4@published">In the early 2000s, most people were vaguely embarrassed to work in sales—I was—because it evinced need. This was a time when material abundance was such a given that Americans treated it as an entitlement; the gravest insult you could’ve lobbed at someone then was “sellout,” i.e., someone so tactless that they actively pursued success. It was a far cry from today, when we’ve all been stripped of even the pretense of being above the hard sell. In that context, it was only logical that the innate neediness of a sales pitch would be regarded as shameful, almost excremental. Salespeople were by definition losers—if they weren’t, they wouldn’t be asking you for money.</p>

  
  <p data-word-count="162" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3fkjx001i3b73x4w89hoe@published">This was a very novel attitude. Go back a century, when the margins were fat and the marks were plentiful, and sales was a respectable, even aspirational profession, the salesman as romantic and as quintessentially American as the cowboy. If the cowboy limned the frontiers of America, the salesman pacified its inhabitants by converting them into consumers, just as the salesman’s predecessors had converted them into Christians. The first proto-salesmen in America were the roving evangelical preachers, circuit riders who were paid a salary by the church, had monthly sermon quotas, and tracked how many souls they converted. (One definition of <em>evangelize</em> is “to talk about how good you think something is”—to sell, basically.) For pocket money, many of these preachers sold Bibles and books like the <em>Farmer’s Almanac</em>, and in doing so blazed a trail for the secular salesmen who followed, literally, in their footsteps, traveling the same routes, bearing novelty goods like sewing machines, clocks, smut books, and tin scissors.</p>

  


  


  


  


  <p data-word-count="187" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3fkkw001j3b734mn7p66u@published">Many salesmen turned out to be outright cheats, peddling fake spices or canned hams made of wood shavings. Others were a little craftier. According to <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674018334"><em>Birth of a Salesman: The Transformation of Selling in America</em></a>, by Harvard Business School scholar Walter A. Friedman, a clock salesman, confronted with settlers who swore they had no need for a timepiece, would cunningly ask them to hold a clock for him while he traveled the rest of his route, knowing that when he returned, they’d be unable to live without it. Firms working the <a href="https://history.nebraska.gov/publications_section/lightning-rod-salesmen/">lightning-rod grift</a> sent effete dandies to sell farmers on lightning rods for their house, barn, even their outhouse and doghouse, with no money required upfront, but when it was time to collect payment, the salesman was replaced by two or three hulking roughnecks. Book salesmen who met resistance when they returned to settle the bill on preorders were instructed to set up shop at the dining room table and fill out paperwork until money was produced. To keep out “Yankee peddlers,” more than a few municipalities passed laws requiring that out-of-town salesmen buy an expensive license.</p>

  <p data-word-count="286" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3fkm1001k3b73hho5thul@published">But in a very real sense, salesmen built the American economy and, by extension, America itself. In his book, Friedman notes that in the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/20/us/farm-population-lowest-since-1850-s.html">more than half</a> the U.S. population lived on a farm. Consumer markets were nonexistent. Salesmen went out and made them from scratch, a sale at a time, and not simply by bringing quality goods to eager buyers; they took them by their lapels and didn’t let go until they signed on the dotted line. Fortune magazine observed, in the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century, “Mass production would be a shadow of what it is today if it had waited for the consumer to make up his mind.” But because of what scholars call “supply-side bias,” we regard 19<sup>th</sup>-century tycoons like Rockefeller, Carnegie, and Vanderbilt as <em>Übermensch</em>, while erasing the accomplishments of the legions of lowly salesmen. Why? Economists, generally insulated from the dirty realities of turning a buck by tenure and/or wealth, think of demand as a vast natural force to be harnessed, like wind or oil—a conception that fits hand in glove with the equally simplistic “great man” theory, which posits that some people (men) are just born great. Sounds nice, but things look a little less elegant to the salesmen in the trenches. They know: Demand is more like blood, and it has to be mercilessly extracted, drop by drop, by an army of sweaty little goblins who don’t eat unless they hit their quotas. Suddenly, the economy looks more like an infinite series of tiny frauds than a harmonious ecosystem. And if the Greatest Economy in the World is little more than a shill mill, the implications for the Greatest Country in the World are dismaying, to say the least.<strong></strong></p>

  


  <p data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3fknz001l3b73jku1pucv@published">Who’s to say? I’m sure one of my betters could produce a little chart proving that the economy is definitely, objectively NOT bullshit, but get a job in sales and you’ll learn the truth by the end of your first week: People don’t buy out of need or desire; they buy because they’ve been sold.</p>

  


  


  


  
  <p data-word-count="214" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3fkow001m3b73gj6cv54m@published">The problem was, I was terrible at selling, at least in the beginning. To be fair, we didn’t have it easy. The telemarketers in <em>Telemarketers</em> were calling for donations to police charities, often (falsely) claiming they were collecting for officers wounded in the line of duty. The burned-out salesmen in the 1969 documentary <em>Salesman</em>, by the Maysles brothers and Charlotte Zwerin, were selling Bibles to people whose names they got from the local parishes, introducing themselves at the door by saying, “I’m here from the church.” If you can’t close <em>those</em>, just hang it up and get a nine-to-five square job. In contrast, I was selling subpar phone service to people who usually had better service already, and who were livid from the moment they realized why I was calling. The majority of the leads hung up in the first three seconds; others stayed on the phone only long enough to detail the sexual acts they’d performed on my mother the previous night. Once, early in my telemarketing days, I called a guy in Colorado who silently listened to my pitch, then asked if I was working out of the Greeley call center. <em>Yes</em>, I lied. “When you get off work tonight,” he said, “I’ll be waiting in the parking lot with a shotgun.”</p>

  


  <p data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3fkpx001n3b73f0p082px@published">I couldn’t understand it. I had an airtight pitch and I’d memorized all the rebuttals. But no one was buying. Finally, the manager had me sit in on the calls of one of the call center’s top performers, a soft-spoken divorcée who sat at her corner cubicle and seemed to close sales nonstop, all shift. This was the second elite salesperson I’ve witnessed.</p>

  <p data-word-count="173" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3fkqv001o3b73ml70p16h@published">As I remember it, our daily quota was around 3.5 sales in a four-hour shift. The auto-dialer could easily connect you to 100 potential buyers an hour, inclusive of hang-ups and no-answers, meaning you only had to hit a success rate of less than 1 percent. Sounds easy, but most people didn’t come close. Management would let you sit on the phones almost indefinitely without hitting your quotas, but few people could endure this. It was too demoralizing, being a rejection sponge, and, as with waiting tables, the base pay if you made no sales<strong> </strong>was unlivable. The only way to make real money was to sell, often and consistently. On the quota sheets they gave us, there was a gradated table of commissions; when you hit your weekly quota, you earned a modest bonus, and each sale was worth an additional sum. These sums increased gradually, then exponentially; the first sale after your quota was worth something like $1.10, the 10<sup>th</sup> was worth $8.50, the 30<sup>th</sup> was worth $90, and so on.</p>

  


  


  


  


  <p data-word-count="170" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3fks0001p3b73wen909qa@published">To reach the higher tiers—a rare feat—you had to get hot and stay hot, every day of the week. For an accomplished salesperson, it was fairly common to have a good day—close five or six or even a dozen sales—but the next day, you’d almost always be back to average or worse. The divorcée, though, was one of the few who could consistently pile up sales so that by Thursday she was making $60, $70, $100 a sale. She was a matronly woman with a kid at home whom we regarded as stuck-up and aloof, though in retrospect this was only because she showed zero interest in smoking ditch weed in the parking lot with us before the shift, or slugging cognac on breaks—she had the temerity to treat her job like a job instead of a temporary diversion before school or jail or some final capitulation that’d land you back in your childhood bedroom. She came in, took her seat, oversize travel mug from home in hand, and sold.</p>

  <p data-word-count="139" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3fkt8001q3b73eb00p852@published">When I shadowed her, I found to my surprise that she was reciting almost word for word the same pitch as everyone else, the same stale rebuttals, but getting much different results. Her warm voice and metronomic cadence had an almost narcotic effect on the leads. Even some of the cranks who snapped at her when they picked up—<em>I don’t want any goddamn phone service, I told the last guy to put me on the no-call list</em>, would meekly backtrack after listening to 20 or 30 seconds of her pitch: <em>I’m sorry, I had a long day at work, what’s this about saving me money? </em>Even I started feeling inclined toward her after a couple of hours. (“Hey, I don’t know if you have plans after work, but I know a place with 10-cent beers between 10 and 11&nbsp;…”)</p>

  


  


  


  


  <p data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3fkua001r3b73l59segmm@published">Eventually, it clicked, and I learned one of the bedrock principles of salesmanship: Whether you’re peddling long distance over the phone, Bibles door to door, or your own political candidacy on live national TV, it doesn’t matter what you’re selling—it matters how you make people feel. If you make them feel good, they’ll say yes. If you don’t, you could be selling a pill that reverses male-pattern baldness and makes you lose weight without exercise, and they’ll still turn you down flat.</p>

  <p data-word-count="124" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3fkv5001s3b73xapnjn2p@published">What this entailed for me was basically an attitude adjustment. No one is happy being a telemarketer, no matter how much you’re making, but bad energy will drive away even the easiest money, not only in an Instagram-mysticism law-of-attraction sense, but in the literal sense that Shelly in Wichita is not going to buy what you’re selling, no matter how good the deal is, if she can clearly hear in your voice how much you hate your job and, by extension, her. Grasping this was simple enough, but what was difficult was understanding just how much I had to adjust my sales persona, a realization that really sank in only after a few days of contrasting my halting monotone with the divorcée’s sparkly confidence.</p>

  


  


  


  <p data-word-count="261" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3fkw4001t3b73362c3rm2@published">Once I found my sweet spot, though, I started racking up sales. (To this day I can’t talk on the phone without lapsing into my “telemarketer voice,” which sounds like <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2014/09/phil-hartman-remembered-by-jack-handey-the-snl-writer-behind-unfrozen-caveman-lawyer-and-other-sketches.html">Phil Hartman</a> on ecstasy.) I wasn’t a coaxer, a hand-holder, a persuader; I hit people with my spiel, and if they hesitated or said no, I hung up on them midsentence. On to the next one. Unlike many of my less successful colleagues, I quickly learned to take yes for an answer; though we were legally required to read a long list of mandatory disclosures to all our sales, I noticed that this often broke the spell and gave people an opening to back out or “wait and ask the wife about it.” As soon as I heard a yes, I said, “Great choice!” and transferred them to confirmation. My manager occasionally came by and reminded me that it was technically illegal to skip my disclosures, but he made commission off my commission, and his tone made it clear that I could do as I pleased as long as I kept putting up numbers. Which I did, to an almost ludicrous degree. I hit every kicker, every bonus. I won scented candles, gift cards, and countertop appliances in daily sales contests. I earned the executive parking space in the very front of the lot, even though I took the bus to work. I was pretty pleased with myself. Making $800 in 15 to 20 hours a week when your monthly rent is $300 and beers are a dollar is real wealth.</p>

  <p data-word-count="4" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3fkxk001u3b73syrhj4bn@published">But it didn’t last.</p>

  
  <p data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3fky5001v3b7376fg680v@published">There’s a scene in Episode&nbsp;2 of <em>Telemarketers</em> that features a company’s top closer as he works, and we hear him muttering the most evil shit imaginable after being hung up on by old ladies named Joyce and Ethel: <em>I hope your house catches on fire. I hope your neighborhood gets shot up, you stinking bitch.</em> The scene is shot as a horror movie, with a sinister score, but I have to admit I laughed when I saw it. I understood.</p>

  


  


  


  <p data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3fkz1001w3b73vkuwj5o5@published">Once I started sitting by my fellow top sellers, I noticed that they seemed to enjoy ripping people off. Lying was de rigueur, of course, and rates and plans were fabricated on the spot to close a sale—that’s not what I’m talking about. Instead, leads who begged to be put on the no-call list got vindictively scheduled for Saturday morning callbacks. When a sobbing woman said she couldn’t talk now, her husband was dying, my colleague snapped, <em>Then why’d you answer the phone, Linda?</em> It seemed personal for them.</p>

  <p data-word-count="146" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3fl0k001x3b73ld8lmxz8@published">It didn’t take me long to understand why. We had quotas to meet, and not meeting them could have severe consequences. (As in <em>Glengarry Glen Ross</em>, “first prize is a Cadillac&nbsp;… third prize is you’re fired.”) We badly needed a steady drip of yeses from these people. But the best salesman who ever lived couldn’t close more than 5 to 10 percent of cold calls, which means that the vast majority of everyone you speak to is going to be a no. Eventually, as you’re hung up on, insulted, rejected by hundreds of leads a day, you realize that, miraculously, you have found the architects of your misery: Here, right here—these are the people responsible! The people you’re trying to rip off are simultaneously ripping <em>you</em> off. They are both exploited and exploiters, saviors and enemies. You depend on them, and dependence can only breed contempt.</p>

  
  <p data-word-count="143" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3fl1w001y3b73mey38c9n@published">So when we promised a lady that we were going to send her a check to “offset” her $75 switching fee (the check was for $1.99), or we told some guy that his master file showed he was already paying 40&nbsp;cents a minute with the competition (we had no way to know what anyone was paying), and the third-party compliance or a manager cut in on the line and said, <em>Hey, you can’t say that, that’s not legal</em>, we dismissed them as soft, out of touch. Fairness, conscience, empathy, and honesty were luxuries that, like caviar or health insurance, were for other people—<em>we</em> had to <em>work</em> for a living. We were victims. Therefore, we had license to take whatever measures were necessary. Once this worldview sets in, it’s very difficult to break out of, not least because it often feels so perfectly just.</p>

  


  


  


  <p data-word-count="136" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3fl2v001z3b73nzq6np7n@published">But that’s just the moral alibi. Even worse is the “sales mindset.” Seeing the world through the lens of selling and dealmaking can feel freeing, even empowering, but all you’ve done is condemn yourself to a life of never-ending nickel-and-diming. The better you are at selling, the more debased your life becomes, as everything is reduced to a transaction, a leveraging of the smallest edge: <em>Oh, you didn’t come? I’ll get you next time, twice. You know I’m good for it.</em> “Doris, what if I throw in a $50 calling card?” mutates into “I’ll be charming at your office Christmas party if you do the dishes this month,” aimed at a befuddled partner who may or may not have yet realized that what they thought was a partnership is in fact closer to a mutual exploitation.</p>

  <p data-word-count="106" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3fl3z00203b73v1tpv1an@published">How tiresome, how demeaning to all parties involved—yourself most of all—to admit the logic of petty hucksterism into your actual life. But to leave money or advantage on the table is anathema, because you’re a hustler—not in the popular usage of being a tireless worker, but in the sense of always looking to hustle a mark, and the thing is, everyone is a mark. <em>Five more minutes and then it’s bath time</em>, you tell your 5-year-old nephew—and he goes for it without even negotiating! Cute kid, but weak, clearly not a winner. This mindset will get you far in life, but it comes at a cost.<em></em></p>

  
  <p data-word-count="171" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3fl4z00213b73r8bgm90n@published">The ultimate insight of the salesman is not that Everything Is Selling, although that can be true, to the degree that you embrace it. The actual jewel of wisdom that every salesman forges out of their agonies and humiliations, if they stay with it long enough, is that Everything Is Luck. Every hotshot hits stretches when you simply can’t close anyone. You thought that your success was a product of your gifts, but the success itself was a gift, a gift of randomness, of luck—and luck always turns. Starting one day, everyone hangs up, everyone says no. <em>Why are you talking like that?</em> a woman in Alabama says about your stupid sales voice, and just like that, your confidence is gone, without which you are utterly lost. Suddenly you understand that you are powerless, that you have less agency than an ant on the sidewalk, that you are no different from the losers you disdain, the two-sales-a-week scrubs exiled to the back-office cubicles, the ones who simply “don’t want it enough.”</p>

  


  


  


  <p data-word-count="173" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3fl5t00223b73iq6q0yqs@published">What makes it even worse is that the guy across from you, the mumbling clown who until now couldn’t close a door, is all of a sudden closing everything, his name now at the top of the dry-erase board, the boss setting iced sodas on his desk unsolicited, patting him on the back—even as you, the former No.&nbsp;1 telemarketer in America, who just had the executive parking space for, what, three weeks straight, suddenly has to stay late on Thursday night because you haven’t hit your weekly quota, a measly number that you used to crush by midday Monday. As you settle in for an after-hours shift among the new hires and loafers and no-hopers, many of whom are visibly satisfied to see you brought down to their level—and who can blame them?—you have to trust that the wheel will turn, even as you feel in your bones that it won’t, that you are cursed, that you are being punished for all those old ladies you ripped off, the 8&nbsp;a.m. callbacks you scheduled.</p>

  <p data-word-count="120" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3fl6v00233b73nd6hfisd@published">You can take the subtle humiliations of being moved to the desk stacked with training materials, of using a headset with bare metal earcups because you forgot cash for foamies and the boss no longer tosses you a pair from the stash he keeps in his drawer. (Those foamies are for closers.) You can put up with the abuse and hang-ups and death threats from the customers who seem to have sensed your weakness before they even picked up, and the long weeks making no more than the subminimum base wage. But the worst part is not knowing how long your cold streak will go on, if it will last days or weeks or months—or, as in my case, forever.</p>

  


  


  


  <p data-word-count="145" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3fl7u00243b730cq0gq3g@published">Before my luck could turn back, the company’s ran out. One day, more or less out of nowhere, it declared bankruptcy. The call center stayed open, but every call was to a pay phone, a dentist’s office, a tollbooth on the New Jersey Turnpike, instead of living, breathing, hot-blooded marks. The company was recycling the dregs, buying tranches of the cheapest trash leads on the market because it couldn’t afford the good ones. It soon decided to clean up the telemarketing division now that it didn’t matter anymore. I was one of the first to go, technically for not making my required disclosures—about cancellation fees, international rates, all that fine print nobody ever bothered to recite—on a sale. This was true, as far as grounds for termination go, though I had never made any required disclosures on any of the hundreds of my previous sales.</p>

  
  <p data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3fl8y00253b73bj2h9u8j@published">It didn’t matter; I’d saved up a lot of money, thousands in sales bonuses I hadn’t yet touched. I frankly felt relief as security escorted me out after my firing. As a guiding life principle, ressentiment is thin gruel, and after almost a year on the phones, I was happy to be leaving behind a world of ethical squalor, the never-ending petty wheedling hustle. <em>I’ll never live like that again</em>, I thought. How naive I was.</p>

  <p data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3fla400263b73ys9mjyp2@published">In ways large and small, we live in a world shaped by telemarketing. When’s the last time you answered a call from an unknown number? How many tweets do you encounter <em>without </em>bots in the replies? Have you seen how many spam emails your parents receive? I chuckle to think how mad people used to get when we called during dinner—when do you have privacy now? Even your sleep app is hawking your data to companies trying to sell you melatonin gummies. Are these intrusions any less intrusive because they’re silent?</p>

  


  


  


  <p data-word-count="160" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3flb000273b733co9xw2q@published">Worse yet, decades of wage stagnation and the emergence of the gig economy have generalized the anxiety and pressure that used to be the exclusive domain of sales sweatshops; now we’re all pitching all the time, unironically using phrases like “building my personal brand,” indefatigably selling versions of ourselves via social media posts that fool no one, soliciting eyeballs, donations, subscriptions, views and clicks, for our Twitch streams, OnlyFans, Substacks, stand-up shows, GoFundMes, podcasts, NFTs, sending emails to our agent like, “Another piece in Slate, hmm, wonder if there’s a book in this one?” Manufactured precarity and the Hobbesian competition of <em>all against all</em>, combined with the public insistence on moral rectitude, have us all scrambling for grievances so we can justify doing what we must—even presidents and billionaires insist they are victims now. We’re all trapped in the back-office cubicle pod, our desperation rebranded as hustle, bitter entrepreneurs of abjection competing for the same dwindling pool of broke rubes.</p>


  <p data-word-count="139" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3flbz00283b73oog4l95g@published">Which brings me to the third elite salesperson. At the coffee shop I frequent, there are a number of panhandlers who come in regularly to beg for money. Most of them ask for change or a dollar in a desultory tone, open palm out, and get little or nothing. But one man comes in, walks up to a table, falls to his knees, interlaces his hands as if in prayer, and begs, at the top of his lungs, <em>Please please please, money, please I need a dollar! </em>This display of raw emotion is jarring even to jaded New Yorkers; he once did it to a European tourist next to me who scrambled to her feet, stammering, <em>Oh God, what, what did I do, what do you want?</em>, near tears. He only begged louder, scooting after her on his knees.</p>

  <p data-word-count="61" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm4n3flcu00293b73wznzu12i@published">Without fail, wallets are produced, cash is handed over. Anything to make it stop. Once he gathers $15 or $20, he dusts off his pants and walks out, smirking faintly, to his waiting girlfriend. The baristas and the other regulars dread his appearances, but I recognize him as the exemplar he is: The spirit of our era resides in this man.<strong><span></span></strong></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>A messy experiment that changed how we think about AI code analysis</em></p>

<p>Last week, I watched our AI choke on a React codebase - again. As timeout errors flooded my terminal, something clicked. We’d been teaching AI to read code like a fresh bootcamp grad, not a senior developer.</p>

<p>Here’s what I mean.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="the-bootcamp-vs-senior-mindset">The Bootcamp vs Senior Mindset</h2>

<p>Remember your first day reading production code? Without any experience with handling mature codebases, you probably quickly get lost in the details<sup>[0]</sup></p>

<p>But watch a senior dev review a massive PR:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They jump straight to the core files</li>
  <li>Group changes by feature (“all auth changes, all db changes”)</li>
  <li>Build a mental model of architecture first</li>
  <li>Only then dive into implementation</li>
</ul>

<p>Obvious in hindsight, right? This realization led us to completely rewire our analyzer.</p>

<h2 id="the-experiment">The Experiment</h2>

<p>Instead of dumping files linearly, we built a context-aware grouping system:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>interface</span> <span>FileGroup</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>files</span><span>:</span> <span>ProjectFile</span><span>[];</span>
  <span>totalSize</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>;</span>
  <span>groupContext</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>;</span> <span>// 'auth', 'database', etc.</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>groupFiles</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>files</span><span>:</span> <span>ProjectFile</span><span>[]):</span> <span>FileGroup</span><span>[]</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Group files by related functionality and size</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>fileInfos</span> <span>=</span> <span>files</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>file</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>({</span>
    <span>file</span><span>,</span>
    <span>size</span><span>:</span> <span>file</span><span>.</span><span>content</span><span>?.</span><span>length</span> <span>||</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
    <span>context</span><span>:</span> <span>getFileContext</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>.</span><span>path</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}));</span>

  <span>// Process larger, more important files first</span>
  <span>fileInfos</span><span>.</span><span>sort</span><span>((</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>b</span><span>.</span><span>size</span> <span>-</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>);</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>groups</span><span>:</span> <span>FileGroup</span><span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>[];</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>currentGroup</span> <span>=</span> <span>createEmptyGroup</span><span>();</span>

  <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>file</span><span>,</span> <span>size</span><span>,</span> <span>context</span> <span>}</span> <span>of</span> <span>fileInfos</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>shouldStartNewGroup</span><span>(</span><span>currentGroup</span><span>,</span> <span>size</span><span>,</span> <span>context</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>groups</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>currentGroup</span><span>);</span>
      <span>currentGroup</span> <span>=</span> <span>createNewGroup</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>,</span> <span>size</span><span>,</span> <span>context</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>addFileToGroup</span><span>(</span><span>currentGroup</span><span>,</span> <span>file</span><span>,</span> <span>size</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>groups</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then we changed how we prompt the AI. Instead of “analyze this file”, we give it context about the feature group first:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>buildGroupPrompt</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>group</span><span>:</span> <span>FileGroup</span><span>):</span> <span>string</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>`
    Analyzing authentication system files:
    - Core token validation logic
    - Session management
    - Related middleware
    
    Focus on:
    1. How these integrate with existing auth patterns
    2. Security implications
    3. Performance impact on other systems

    Files to analyze:
    </span><span>${</span><span>formatFiles</span><span>(</span><span>group</span><span>.</span><span>files</span><span>)}</span><span>
  `</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="the-holy-shit-moment">The Holy Shit Moment</h2>

<p>The results broke our benchmark script. We thought it was a bug.</p>

<p>The AI went from:</p>
<div><pre><code>"This file contains authentication logic using JWT tokens"
</code></pre></div>

<p>To:</p>
<div><pre><code>"Warning: This auth change could impact websocket connections.
The token refresh logic shares patterns with the notification 
service (added last month), suggesting a potential race 
condition during high-traffic socket reconnects.

Related PR: #1234 (merged last week) modified the same
retry logic. Consider adding backoff."
</code></pre></div>

<p>That’s senior dev level awareness. It was catching connections we hadn’t explicitly taught it about.</p>

<h2 id="what-actually-changed">What Actually Changed?</h2>

<p>The magic isn’t in fancy ML or bigger models. It’s in mirroring how senior devs think:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Context First</strong>: We front-load system understanding before diving into code</li>
  <li><strong>Pattern Matching</strong>: Group similar files to spot repeated approaches</li>
  <li><strong>Impact Analysis</strong>: Consider changes in relation to the whole system</li>
  <li><strong>Historical Understanding</strong>: Track why code evolved certain ways</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-unexpected-side-effects">The Unexpected Side Effects</h2>

<p>The system started catching things we didn’t design for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Spotting copy-pasted code across different features</li>
  <li>Flagging inconsistent error handling patterns</li>
  <li>Warning about potential performance bottlenecks</li>
  <li>Suggesting architectural improvements based on usage patterns</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>Every few days there’s a new “AI-powered IDE” on Product Hunt. They’re solving the wrong problem. Making code suggestions without deep context is like having a brilliant junior dev who just joined yesterday - they’ll write clean code that subtly breaks everything.</p>

<p>The key isn’t better code generation. It’s better code understanding.</p>

<h2 id="open-questions">Open Questions</h2>

<p>We’re still figuring out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When to refresh vs preserve historical understanding</li>
  <li>How to handle conflicting patterns in different parts of the system</li>
  <li>Whether to expose uncertainty in the analysis</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>

<p>I’m curious if we can teach AI to spot other senior dev instincts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identifying tech debt before it happens</li>
  <li>Suggesting architectural improvements</li>
  <li>Catching security issues from usage patterns</li>
  <li>Understanding unwritten team conventions</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem isn’t making AI write more code. It’s teaching it to think about code the way experienced developers do.</p>

We achieved a click-through rate of above 50% for our AI-generated phishing emails.</p><h2 id="Full_paper__https___arxiv_org_abs_2412_00586">Full paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00586">https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00586</a></h2><p id="block1">This post is intended to be a brief summary of the main findings, these are some key insights we gained:</p><ol><li id="block2">AI spear-phishing is highly effective, receiving a click-through rate of more than 50%, significantly outperforming our control group.</li><li id="block3">AI-spear phishing is also highly cost-efficient, reducing costs by up to 50 times compared to manual attacks.</li><li id="block4">AI models are highly capable of gathering open-source intelligence.

We include four email groups with a combined total of 101 participants: A control group of arbitrary phishing emails, which received a click-through rate (recipient pressed a link in the email) of 12%, emails generated by human experts (54% click-through), fully AI-automated emails 54% (click-through), and AI emails utilizing a human-in-the-loop (56% click-through). Thus, the AI-automated attacks performed on par with human experts and 350% better than the control group. The results are a significant improvement from similar studies conducted last year, highlighting the increased deceptive capabilities of AI models. Our AI-automated emails were sent using a custom-built tool that automates the entire spear phishing process, including information gathering and creating personalized vulnerability profiles for each target. The AI-gathered information was accurate and useful in 88% of cases and only produced inaccurate profiles for 4% of the participants. We also use language models to detect the intention of emails. Claude 3.5 Sonnet scored well above 90% with low false-positive rates and detected several seemingly benign emails that passed human detection. Lastly, we analyze the economics of phishing, highlighting how AI enables attackers to target more individuals at lower cost and increase profitability by up to 50 times for larger audiences.</p><h2 id="Method">Method</h2><p id="block8">In a brief summary, the method consists of 5 steps:</p><ol><li id="block9">Collecting Targets.</li><li id="block10">Collecting information about the targets using an AI web-browsing agent that crawls publicly available information.</li><li id="block11">Writing personalized phishing emails based on the collected information and carefully crafted language model prompts.</li><li id="block12">Sending emails using custom-built and automated software.</li><li id="block13">Analyzing outcomes by tracking clicks on embedded URLs in emails.</li></ol><figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GCHyDKfPXa5qsG2cP/zihrxmduql07fedjthpg" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GCHyDKfPXa5qsG2cP/ikadfgqrctfkr4odt4zs 340w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GCHyDKfPXa5qsG2cP/mj70icvkqleshm2gkrjh 680w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GCHyDKfPXa5qsG2cP/chqjwjz8z46bbjabcfip 1020w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GCHyDKfPXa5qsG2cP/qqxaaxn7dt2tazrnsmvg 1360w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GCHyDKfPXa5qsG2cP/r0azmgnf9kw4bxgqz27w 1700w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GCHyDKfPXa5qsG2cP/muertujy7chjqeyojaxw 2040w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GCHyDKfPXa5qsG2cP/h4ess8sexvyuodbowyno 2380w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GCHyDKfPXa5qsG2cP/hwcrsogy7gjv5aisifif 2720w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GCHyDKfPXa5qsG2cP/xtso6rsibpx4g0ccybdj 3060w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GCHyDKfPXa5qsG2cP/rln5x6elatjmjojxorrf 3372w"><figcaption>Example from the paper for an AI-compiled profile from step 2 and an AI-written email from step 3.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="Results">Results</h2><p id="block14">For full results, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00586">go to the paper</a></p><p id="block15">The results of the phishing emails are presented in the figure below (figure 5 in the paper).

In a manual analysis of 51 profiles, we found that 88% of profiles were accurate and useful, 8% were accurate but not useful and 4% contained inaccurate information.</p><p id="block18">To measure the time saved, we measured how much time we spent on the interventions for the human-in-the-loop group. The information gathering (OSINT) updates for this group took an average of 1:05 minutes, and the email message updates averaged 1:36 minutes. Thus, the total combined time was 2:41 minutes per message. To better measure the time difference between AI-automated and manual attacks, we manually replicated the OSINT information gathering and email crafting processes<br>provided by our AI tool. We performed the manual replication on four targets. The process required an average of 23:27 minutes to gather OSINT data and an additional 10:10 minutes to write each personalized email, totaling about 34 minutes per target. Thus the human-in-the-loop based AI-automation was about 92% faster than the fully manual process.</p><h2 id="Automated_intent_detection">Automated intent detection</h2><p id="block19">On average, Claude achieved a true positive detection rate of 97.25% with no false positives.

Detailed persuasion results for different models would help us understand how AI-based deception is evolving and how to ensure our protection schemes stay up-to-date. Additionally, we will explore fine-tuning models for creating and detecting phishing. We are also interested in evaluating AI's capabilities to exploit other communication channels, such as social media or modalities like voice. Lastly, we want to measure what happens after users press a link in an email. For example, how likely is it that a pressed email link results in successful exploitation, what different attack trees exist (such as downloading files or entering account details in phishing sites), and how well can AI exploit and defend against these different paths? We also encourage other researchers to explore these avenues.&nbsp;</p><p id="block24">We propose personalized mitigation strategies to counter AI-enhanced phishing. The cost-effective nature of AI makes it highly plausible we're moving towards an agent vs agent future. AI could assist users by creating personalized vulnerability profiles, combining their digital footprint with known behavioral patterns.</p><h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p id="block25">Our results reveal the significant challenges that personalized, AI-generated phishing emails present to current cybersecurity systems. Many existing spam filters use signature detection (detecting known malicious content and behaviors). By using language models, attackers can effortlessly create phishing emails that are uniquely adapted to every target, rendering signature detection schemes obsolete. As models advance, their capabilities of persuasion will likely also increase. We find that LLM-driven spear phishing is highly effective and economically viable, with automated reconnaissance that provides accurate and useful information in almost all cases. Current safety guardrails fail to reliably prevent models from conducting reconnaissance or generating phishing emails. However, AI could mitigate these threats through advanced detection and tailored countermeasures.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <p>I gained remote code execution via MIDI messages to trick my synth into playing Bad Apple on its LCD. This blog post is about my journey with this reverse engineering project.</p>

            <h2 id="the-beginning">The beginning</h2>
            <p>I’ve had this Yamaha PSR-E433 synth for a very long time, and a couple of years ago I decided to open it up — partly because it was in need of cleaning, and partly because I was really curious about its internals. After removing some screws and digging up the main circuit board (labeled “DMLCD”), I was quite amused to find two flash chips, one RAM chip and an absolute unit of a chip labeled “YAMAHA SWL01U”, which I guessed had to be the brains of the operation. Using that part number I wasn’t able to find any information about the chip online apart from an <a href="https://sandsoftwaresound.net/swl-micro-architecture/" target="_blank">article</a> that claimed it was based around a “SuperH” CPU core – an <abbr title="Instruction Set Architecture">ISA</abbr> that I’ve encountered for the first time ever in that article. So, after finishing the cleanup I just put the synth back together, which left me wondering about what that mysterious chip really had under the hood.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Fast forward to a few months ago, when I took apart the poor synth again – this time purely out of curiosity. What sparked that curiosity was a service manual for a similar synth (the E443, I own an E433) that I found online, which among other things featured a pinout of that main chip that listed pin descriptions so enticing (“TESTN – Test Mode”, “PROTN – Determines if the product is a prototype”) that I just had to get a look at what was going on. There were also two bidirectional UART interfaces, and by looking at the schematic I could see that one of the two transmit pins wasn’t connected anywhere, suggesting that the chip maybe emits some kind of log via that pin. Oh, and it also had JTAG test points nicely broken out on the board -  basically a 5-pin interface for various production line testing and debugging-adjacent tasks.</p>
            <p>So, what were my options at that point? I could:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Play around with the TESTN and PROTN pins and see how the synth behaves;</li>
                <li>Solder to the UART Tx pin and see what the chip outputs;</li>
                <li>Connect to the JTAG interface and read the chip’s identification code;</li>
                <li>Desolder one of the two flash chips and dump the firmware.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Let’s begin with the first approach. Both of the boot mode select pins end with an N, suggesting that these pins are active low, meaning that the signal is considered active when the voltage is close to zero, as opposed to the power rail, which in this case is 3.3 volts. The schematic says that both of these pins are pulled up to 3.3 volts with a resistor, so we can just short the pins to ground in order to activate them. That’s exactly what I did; unfortunately, it appeared as though activating the TESTN pin just prevented the synth from booting, and activating the PROTN pin didn’t change the synth’s behavior at all. Hey, at least I didn’t brick it!</p>
            <p>Next up, let’s try looking at the UART interface. That pin that I mentioned didn’t lead anywhere, not even a test point, which means that I had to solder directly to a 0.3mm wide pin of the chip. No success this time either, as the chip didn’t output anything in any of the 4 combinations of the TESTN and PROTN signals.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>It was now JTAG’s turn. Even though the next option (desoldering a flash chip) was quite scary as it meant that I had to build a flash dumper (I didn’t have one), messing around with the JTAG was even scarier for another reason. The thing is that JTAG is quite an abstract interface that vendors can build whatever they want on top of. In order to talk to a device via JTAG, you have to have a detailed description of the circuitry that builds on top of it, which usually comes in the form of a <abbr title="Boundary Scan Description Language">BSDL</abbr> file. There’s basically only one command that almost every device supports, and that is reading the IDCODE – a 32-bit number that acts as an identifier for the type of device you’re talking to. Let’s hook a <abbr title="a JTAG to USB adapter">J-Link</abbr> up to our board and try to read that identification code using <abbr title="the software in charge of controlling the JTAG">OpenOCD</abbr>.</p>

            <p>Well, that’s something. The IDCODE is reported as 0x3f0f0f0f, which is suspiciously pretty. So suspicious that I triple-checked my wiring, but nope, looks like that’s the actual IDCODE of the device, which after a quick Google search seemed like it belonged to either an STMicroelectonics STR7xxx or an Atmel SAM7xxx microcontroller, both of which were based around an <abbr title="not the same thing as ARMv7">ARM7</abbr> CPU core. My only option was to assume that I was dealing with an actual ARM7TDMI core like the one that these MCUs are based on. On the other hand, incorrectly talking to a device via JTAG risks catastrophic damage, as some implementations of the interface grant very low-level access to the hardware, even lower than the machine code that CPU cores execute have. There’s a small chance of letting the magic smoke out when you instruct the device incorrectly at such a low level, provided the circumstances turn against you. Anyways, I did it; I told OpenOCD that I’m dealing with an ARM7TDMI core and it happily complied.</p>

            <p>At least at this point, the magic smoke was still contained within the chip. I nervously connected to OpenOCD via <abbr title="a program used to debug software">GDB</abbr> and tried pausing and resuming execution of the program. I was very surprised and excited to witness the current draw reported by my lab bench power supply reacting predictably to my commands. The entire circuit board was drawing about 115 mA when running and about 98 mA when paused, which was a very good sign that what I was talking to was, in fact, an ARM7TDMI core. At that point I had no other way to verify whether the thing’s CPU was really stopping or not.</p>

            <h2 id="dumping-the-firmware">Dumping the firmware</h2>
            <p>Wow, it looks like I won’t even have to desolder the flash chip in order to dump the firmware! And I already know what ISA the chip is based on, so I won’t have to go digging around in the firmware image in order to find that out! Looking in the documentation for ARM7TDMI, the <abbr title="the address where the CPU starts executing instructions from when it’s first powered up">reset vector</abbr> is located at address 0, so let’s see what kind of data there is at that address.</p>
            <figure>
                <code>(gdb) x/2xw 0 <span># eXamine 2 heX Words at location 0</span>
<span>0x0</span>:    0xe59ff018      0xe59ff018

                <figcaption>Asking GDB to read two instructions at address 0</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Yeah, okay, it’s a jump, just as I expected. The very next instruction is some other vector, and it’s a jump as well. That looks about right. Yeah, we’re definitely on the right track! I know the size of the flash chip (16 MiBytes), so let’s just dump 16 MiBytes of data starting at address 0 into a file, load it up into <abbr title="a reverse engineering framework that I was used to using up until this point">Cutter</abbr> and see what secrets it contains.</p>
            <p>I’m very unexperienced when it comes to reverse engineering, but one thing that I do know is that strings are a goldmine of easily digestible information about a piece of software. That’s why the first thing that I do when starting an <abbr title="reverse engineering">RE</abbr> project is look at the “Strings” section in an RE tool. This project was no exception, and I was very pleased to see strings such as “This code can only run on a <abbr title="extension of ARM that introduces shorter instructions">Thumb</abbr> compatible processor”, “Illegal address (e.g. wildly outside array bounds)”, “Abnormal termination (e.g. abort() function)”, and most of all, “SWL01U Internal”.</p>
            <figure>
                <a href="https://psi3.ru/blog/swl01u/images/strings_in_cutter.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://psi3.ru/blog/swl01u/images/strings_in_cutter.png" alt="Strings section in Cutter"></a>
                <figcaption>Strings section in Cutter</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>What I didn’t like is how the very few strings that were there in the image repeated every 64 KiBytes. So, for instance, the string “SWL01U Internal” was contained at addresses 0x0000bfd0, 0x0001bfd0, 0x0002bfd0 and so on. Both this repetition (likely caused by a primitive design of the address decoder inside the chip) and that string itself hinted that I took a dump of some kind of memory inside the chip itself, and not one of the external flash chips like I had originally imagined. I concluded that this SWL01U chip contains a 64KiByte ROM.</p>
            <p>The instruction at the reset vector was a jump to address 0x02000000, which I thought might actually be the external flash chip this time. I once again took a 16 MiByte dump starting at that address, and was pleased not to find any repetitions this time. Also, I observed a large amount of strings that I could recognize just from using the synth, such as “GrandPno”, “Tr1 will be OverWritten!” and “BogiWogi”.</p>
            <p>So, what do we know so far? We know that the chip itself contains a 64 KiByte ROM that immediately transfers control over to the external 16 MiByte flash chip upon startup. The ROM is located at address 0x00000000, and the flash starts at 0x02000000. We have dumps of both memories and can now start reversing the firmware of this synth to hopefully gain more information about its main chip.</p>

            <h2 id="reversing-the-firmware">Reversing the firmware</h2>
            <p>After staring at the flash image for about an hour in Cutter, it became very obvious to me that this RE tool just wasn’t going to cut it (pun intended) and that I needed to switch it out for something more powerful. I’m happy to report that Ghidra met my expectations.</p>
            <p>Now, we have to get a little philosophical here. In my eyes, RE is like a game of minesweeper. You start with an empty field not knowing the state of any of the cells, i.e. not knowing whether each individual cell contains a landmine or not. When you discover the state of a cell, you have the context to deduce the state of its neighbor cells. In minesweeper, you don’t have a particular direction in which you progress. You never say “In this game of minesweeper, I want to go up no matter what”, you just let the numbers nudge you in the direction that is the easiest to go in at the moment. I assert that this is also true for RE. Once you find out what a function or a variable does, you suddenly understand a little more about functions and variables that depend on the ones whose meaning you’ve just inferred. It may be beneficial not to set any particular goal with an RE project, and instead letting the complex network of intertwined functions and variables guide you towards understanding the system as a whole.</p>
            <p>So, where do we start? Right now we have two entry points from which we could begin prying the firmware apart: the reset vector and the strings. I tried both, just spending night after night learning more about the next function based on new insights gained from learning more about the previous one. This process is not very exciting to witness from the outside, so I don’t feel the need to retrace and describe my steps here. It’s just a chain of simple logical conclusions which propagate through the codebase. Like those little flags propagating through the field in a game of minesweeper.</p>
            <p>There’s one subsystem in the firmware that I think is worth mentioning as it plays an instrumental role in the whole “Bad Apple” thing: The Shell. As I was digging around in the “Defined Strings” section of Ghidra, I noticed a cluster of a few ones that looked like they might be some kind of list of commands for some kind of a shell:</p>
            <figure>
                <a href="https://psi3.ru/blog/swl01u/images/strings_in_ghidra.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://psi3.ru/blog/swl01u/images/strings_in_ghidra.png" alt="The strings “help”, “?”, “info”, “ver” at addresses that are close together"></a>
                <figcaption>The strings “help”, “?”, “info”, “ver” at addresses that are close together</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>In RE, so-called “xrefs“ (cross-references) take center stage. When you’re looking at a symbol (a function or a global variable), xrefs tell you what other symbols use (reference) the symbol that you’re looking at. In the screenshot above, most of our strings have one xref. Let’s follow each of them and see where they lead us to:</p>
            <figure>
                <a href="https://psi3.ru/blog/swl01u/images/cmd_definition_array.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://psi3.ru/blog/swl01u/images/cmd_definition_array.png" alt="A sequence of references"></a>
                <figcaption>A sequence of references</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>What we’re seeing here is a sequence of pairs of references, where the first item in the pair is always the name of a command, and the second item is a pointer to some function. Only the first element in this sequence is referenced directly, which leads me to believe that this is an ordinary C array of C structs with two members. Let’s name this array, so that when we encounter this variable being used somewhere in the future we instantly know what it is.</p>
            <p>Let’s now look at some code! Normal programs (like .exe or ELF files) consist of sections with clear designations for what sort of data they contain. For example, the .text section contains executable code and the .rodata section contains read-only data that the code requires. Unfortunately, embedded systems don’t typically use these files, and instead throw the code and data together in one large pile. This also means that there’s absolutely no hope of recovering <abbr title="function or global variable">symbol</abbr> names and locations. Without symbol metadata, the stream of instructions is just that: a stream. Fortunately for us Ghidra has been programmed to at least recognize the boundaries of most functions, which it tends to do really well.</p>
            <p>As this was my first time dealing with ARM assembly, the C decompiler feature of Ghidra turned out to be very useful for me. Unfortunately, due to a total lack of symbols its output is still quite hard for me to process. Take a look at this function which references the array that we looked at earlier. Don’t read into it, just skim over it:</p>

            <p>Like I said, because Ghidra has absolutely no type or symbol information, the resulting C code is not something that you’d typically write and keep your job afterwards. Functions and global variables don’t have any meaningful names and are instead referred to by their addresses. Local variables don’t have meaningful names either, and they’re scoped to the entire function, as opposed to any particular block. Sometimes Ghidra thinks something is a local variable when really it’s better represented as a temporary result from an expression. It’s absolutely not the fault of the tool: all this information that makes code easy to understand is erased when it’s is compiled and the symbols are stripped away.</p>
            <p>Making sense of this heavily processed code is what’s so hard about RE, and it’s one of those things that you learn by doing a lot of. From now on, for the sake of clarity, I’ll only be presenting you the cleaned up C code after I’ve made sense of it. Anyways, we’re clearly dealing with some kind of state machine. Notice the outline of this function:</p>

            <p>There are two states in which the function does very little, and one state in which the function does a lot. Judging by the strings that the first two states reference (“login” and “Passwd Error”), this function implements some kind of login interface and only lets us run a command if we’re logged in. This function is only ever called by one other function, so let’s inspect that one:</p>

            <p>This function is going through some sort of buffer and calling another function for each character that it fetches from the buffer, and only calls the function that we looked at in the previous paragraph for every ‘\r’ (carriage return) character. Furthermore, the buffer appears to be a circular one with a size of 256. Let’s name some of the variables and functions to what I think they do based on those new insights:</p>

            <p>If we dive into the “shell_print” function, we see lots of yet unknown data transfers into global variables. These global variables are referenced by other pieces of code (both in the flash and internal ROM) which write data into mysterious addresses located at 0xfxxxxxxx, which I’m assuming is the memory region that’s used to talk to various peripherals inside of the chip.</p>
            <p>Okay, so what do we know about this shell?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It won’t respond to our commands unless we say “login” and type in the password “#0000”;</li>
                <li>It has quite a limited set of commands and is potentially uninteresting;</li>
                <li>We still don’t know how to access that shell.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Let’s list out potential candidates for various interfaces that this shell could be running on top of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>UART. There’s two documented UART interfaces. Based on the schematic, both receive pins and one of the two transmit pins are used as GPIOs, and the other transmit pin doesn’t do anything (remember the previous section?).</li>
                <li>USB. There are two USB interfaces on this synth: one is a device interface implemented by the SWL01U chip itself, and the other is a host interface for connecting pen drives and such, implemented by an external host controller chip. If a shell is running on top of one of them, it’s probably the device interface, not the host one. However, if we connect the synth to a PC and run “lsusb” to dump its USB descriptor, we see that it has nothing but <abbr title="Musical Instrument Digital Interface">MIDI</abbr>, an interface widely used in the music industry for transferring various music-related stuff such as “note on” and “note off” events. No serial ports or anything like that.</li>
                <li>JTAG. The documentation for ARM7TDMI says that its JTAG implementation features something ARM calls the <abbr title="Debug Communication Channel">DCC</abbr>, which lets a program running on the chip and an external debug probe exchange custom data. It’s bidirectional and could thus be very well used for a shell. The DCC is accessed via special coprocessor data transfer instructions (MCR and MRC) in 32-bit words.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If it’s UART, then it’s definitely not accessible on our variant of the board, but nevertheless the code shouldn’t be greatly modifying the data that it wants to send, as UART operates on a byte level. If it’s USB, then it must be running on top of MIDI and must thus be manipulating the data in a way that’s suitable to send over MIDI in one way or another. If it’s JTAG, then it must be running on top of the DCC and must be using special instructions that access the DCC. Let’s look deeper into how exactly our “shell_print” function mutilates the data:</p>
            <figure>

            <p>It seems to be breaking up each byte of data into two 4-bit nibbles and wrapping each of the two in its own byte. Every block of data that it passes on to the next stage in this data transfer pipeline starts with the same 8 bytes of data, followed by the payload, finally ending with an 0xf7 byte. Let’s use GDB to look at what those constant 8 bytes are:</p>

            <p>Here’s some context for those of you who don’t know how MIDI works. MIDI is a really simple protocol that emerged in the 80s and to this day allows various digital musical instruments to interoperate by sending and receiving messages such as “Please play the note C#4 with a loudness of 40 out of 127”, or “Please set the reverb level to 14 out of 127”, or “This is a tick. Assume that the period of time between the current and last tick corresponds to 1/24th of a quarter note”. MIDI has a few different message types, but they weren’t enough to describe every aspect of sound generation, so they introduced a special message called the System Exclusive message, or simply SysEx. In the words of the specification, “This message type allows manufacturers to create their own messages”.</p>
            <figure>
                <a href="https://psi3.ru/blog/swl01u/images/sysex_definition.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://psi3.ru/blog/swl01u/images/sysex_definition.png" alt="The SysEx message as defined by the MIDI specification"></a>
                <figcaption>The SysEx message as defined by the MIDI specification</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Sooooo.... it was MIDI, right? Every SysEx message starts with an 0xf0 byte (just like our shell packets do), followed by 1 or 3 bytes of the manufacturer ID, followed by the payload, finally ending with an 0xf7 byte (again, like our packets do). The SysEx payload can only contain bytes in which the <abbr title="Most Significant Bit">MSB</abbr> is 0 because MIDI uses the MSB to differentiate between command and data bytes: 1 means it’s a command, and 0 means it’s data associated with the last command – this is exactly why “shell_print” is cutting the bytes up into 4-bit nibbles. Let’s look at the first data byte that the synth sends out (0x43) and see what manufacturer that corresponds to.</p>
            <figure>

            <p>So yeah, these madlads made a shell that runs on top of MIDI SysEx messages on top of USB. Very cool. Let’s cook up a Python script that acts as a translation layer between the terminal and the synth’s twisted little shell protocol and try talking to it.</p>

                <figcaption>Our first conversation with the synth’s MIDI shell</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This is extraordinarily cool! I wasn’t really expecting this to work, as there’s a possibility that the format of the incoming messages is different from that of the outgoing ones. Fortunately, that turned out not to be the case. Although I have to say that the available commands are quite boring. Apart from your standard help and version information, the most interesting commands that we have are arbitrary memory read/write commands. So, if we really wanted to, we could just peek and poke the memory of the synth via MIDI. We don’t need JTAG for that.</p>

            <h2 id="shellcode">Shellcode</h2>
            <p>Now, what can we do with arbitrary memory poke commands? We could inject executable code into RAM, but we could never execute it. Right? Wrong! If we overwrite the call stack of the program, we can trick the synth into executing it once it finishes handling the command. This is binary exploitation 101, except we don’t have to find any buffer overflow vulnerabilities, the memory poke commands are right there!</p>
            <p>Let’s talk about data transfer speed. Our 32-bit memory write command takes the form of “m/l AAAAAAAA DDDDDDDD\r”, where A and D are the address and data respectively, expressed in hexadecimal. Each byte of the command is transformed into two bytes containing 4-bit nibbles of the original byte. It’s also extended with 9 additional bytes of the SysEx message. Then, every 3 bytes are wrapped in a 4 byte long USB-MIDI packet. In total, if we want to write 4 bytes into the memory, we have to send the synth 72 bytes, which is 18x larger than the payload. But that’s not all! The synth will read the command back to us, with every individual character nicely wrapped in its own SysEx transfer, and finish off with the “&gt; “ prompt. In total, us and the synth exchange 396 bytes, which is almost 100 times larger than the 4-byte payload! This low transfer efficiency definitely shows and will become a problem if we ever want to send large amounts of data (foreshadowing?)</p>
            <p>I found a region of RAM which looks like it’s not used by anything and might thus be safe to put arbitrary data into. Let’s write a little assembly snippet that nicely asks the firmware to print “HeloWrld” to the 8 character long text portion of the LCD:</p>
            <figure>
                <code><span># Tell the assembler what address this program is going to reside at.</span>
<span># Not really required in this case, but always nice to have:</span>
<span>.org</span> <span>0x06002900</span>

<span># This "write_str" function resides in the firmware.</span>
<span># We want to nicely ask it to print something.</span>
<span># First, load the address of this function into a register:</span>
<span>ldr</span> <span>r1</span>, <span>write_str</span>
<span># Then, load the address of the string into another register:</span>
<span>adr</span> <span>r0</span>, <span>str</span>
<span># Remember how we interrupted the normal execution flow by</span>
<span># overwriting the stack? Well, we need to somehow jump to where</span>
<span># the firmware wanted to jump originally once we're done.</span>
<span># Let's make the function we're calling do that for us!</span>
<span># Most functions (and write_str is no exception) expect to get called
<span># via the "bl" instruction (Branch and Link), which places the return</span>
<span># address in a special register called the Link Register (lr).</span>
<span># If we assign lr ourselves and just jump to the function, it will</span>
<span># return to our chosen address.</span>
<span>ldr</span> <span>lr</span>, <span>return</span>
<span># Jump to the function:</span>
<span>bx</span> <span>r1</span>

            <p>This took me quite a few tries to get right, but hey, it works! The nice part about this hack is that it doesn’t depend on any special interfaces like JTAG or UART. If we wanted to, we could write these messages to a MIDI file and play it on the synth like any other MIDI file. Hey, that gives me an idea.....</p>

            <p>Displaying graphics turned out to be way, way, way harder than displaying text. First, let’s look in the datasheet for our LCD controller (ML9040A) to decide whether that’s is even possible from a hardware standpoint. Turns out, not really – it can only handle text characters on a dot matrix. Our LCD definitely has a dot matrix part, but it also has this note notation part, and a 7-segment part in the middle, and another 7-segment part on the right, and a chord notation part below it, and finally a keyboard display at the very bottom.</p>

            <p>We can see three memories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Display Data RAM (DDRAM) is written to by the host (in this case, SWL01U) to change the text displayed on the display. The host never writes the image that it wants the controller to display; instead, it sends it plain old ASCII (with some extra characters), and the controller is responsible for translating ASCII into an image that can be displayed on a dot matrix.</li>
                <li>The Character Generation ROM (CGROM) is what actually performs this translation. This ROM is a simple lookup table. It spits out a graphical pattern that must be displayed at a particular row in order to form a particular character.</li>
                <li>The Character Generation RAM (CGRAM) allows the host to define up to 8 custom characters, which can be called up by using character codes 0 through 7 or 8 though 15.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The CGRAM is how the synth displays non-textual data and what we can use to display custom graphics in the dot matrix part of the LCD panel as well. Let’s use the assembly snippet from before to display the 8 custom characters in the dot matrix area.</p>
            <figure>
                <a href="https://psi3.ru/blog/swl01u/images/lcd_cgram.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://psi3.ru/blog/swl01u/images/thumb/lcd_cgram.jpg" alt="The LCD displaying the 8 custom characters controlled by the firmware"></a>
                <figcaption>The LCD displaying the 8 custom characters controlled by the firmware</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>No, it’s not displaying garbage. When I press down a key on the keyboard, two dots light up in the dot matrix area which correspond to a note in the notation area and a key in the keyboard area. When I let go of the key, those segments get extinguished. This confirms that the firmware manipulates the CGRAM in order to display its stuff below the dot matrix area.</p>
            <p>From the countless sleepless nights of digging around in the firmware I’ve discovered a function that sends arbitrary data to the LCD controller. Let’s write another assembly snippet that exploits this function to upload some custom data to the CGRAM.</p>
            <figure>
                <code><span># --- SNIP ---</span>

<span># We're going to be calling this function several times</span>
<span>ldr</span> <span>r4</span>, <span>lcd_write</span>

<span># Command 0x40 is "Set CGRAM write address to 0"</span>
<span>mov</span> <span>r0</span>, <span>#0x40</span>
<span>mov</span> <span>lr</span>, <span>pc</span>
<span>bx</span> <span>r4</span>

<span># Send the checker pattern (64 bytes)</span>
<span>mov</span> <span>r5</span>, <span>#0</span>
<span>ldr</span> <span>r0</span>, <span>checker_pattern</span>
<span>fill_loop:</span>
    <span># Send the data</span>
    <span>push</span> {<span>r0</span>}
    <span>mov</span> <span>lr</span>, <span>pc</span>
    <span>bx</span> <span>r4</span>
    <span>pop</span> {<span>r0</span>}
    <span># Invert the pattern for the next line</span>
    <span>eor</span> <span>r0</span>, <span>r0</span>, <span>#0xff</span>
    <span># Loop</span>
    <span>add</span> <span>r5</span>, <span>r5</span>, <span>#1</span>
    <span>cmp</span> <span>r5</span>, <span>#64</span>
    <span>bne</span> <span>fill_loop</span>

<span># --- SNIP ---</span>

<span>lcd_write:</span> <span>.word</span> <span>0x02020ac9</span> <span># Resides in the firmware</span>
<span>checker_pattern:</span> <span>.word</span> <span>0x4055</span> <span># That 0x4000 tells the function that we're sending data, not a command</span></code>
                <figcaption>Uploading data to the CGRAM</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>When I run this snippet, I can definitely see the data that I want displayed (in this case, a checker pattern) getting actually displayed in the dot matrix area. However, it’s quickly replaced with what the synth wants to display in the custom area. We definitely can’t play a video with this; we have to find a way to disable the part of the firmware responsible for updating the CGRAM. One way we could do this is to find the function responsible for that (which I’ve already done) and just replace it with an immediate return, causing it to not do anything. The problem is that this requires me to overwrite the synth’s flash chip, which I don’t want to do out of fear of bricking it. I specifically set out to make every experiment of mine instantly reversible through power cycling, which means that I’m only allowing myself to manipulate the RAM.</p>
            <p>I remember noticing that this firmware runs what appears to be some sort of a primitive <abbr title="Real-Time Operating System">RTOS</abbr> with some parts of it contained in the ROM of the SWL01U chip. There’s a set of constant global variables in the flash which define the callback functions for the tasks, as well as their stacks and other attributes which I couldn’t figure out the meaning of. So, if we could a) find out which of these 64 tasks is responsible for constantly updating the CGRAM, and b) find a way to overwrite the corresponding entry in the task table so that it points to a no-op function, we could effectively disable that part of the firmware.</p>
            <p>The key to this puzzle is the fact that the ROM and the flash are very loosely coupled. On startup, the firmware in the flash tells the ROM where its task table is located, and the ROM remembers this information in a global variable located in the embedded SRAM. If we make a copy of this task table in the RAM, and then tell the ROM that the task table has moved to a new location, we could coerce it into using this new table which we can modify in an instantly reversible way. So I did just that! I figured out which task was responsible for updating the display and replaced its callback with the default idle task callback, effectively preventing the firmware from continuously updating the CGRAM of the display controller.</p>
            <figure>
                <video src="https://psi3.ru/blog/swl01u/videos/bad_apple_1.mp4" controls=""></video>
                <figcaption>First iteration of Bad Apple</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>You can see that the first iteration has some artifacts, but the biggest problem is that the frame rate is very low. The reason for that is the extremely low data transfer efficiency that I was talking about. Even if we upload the executable snippet once and only replace its data section when we want to display a new frame, that’s still 6732 bytes of data transferred per 70 bytes of payload (64 bytes of CGRAM data plus a 32-bit return address overwrite). And it turns out that these transfers are really slow, which in our case translates to low frame rate.</p>
            <p>The two biggest contributors to this low payload efficiency are: a) the fact that this data has to be wrapped in a command, and b) that the synth reads the command back character by character in these enormous packets. If we could manipulate the task table once again in order to assign our own callback for the shell task, we could capture raw data and choose not to respond with anything, which would eliminate both of these problems. This, together with another packing optimization brings the total transfer size per frame down from 6732 bytes to 92 bytes – a 73-fold decrease! The artifacting is still there, but we’re now able to play video at a tolerable framerate.</p>
            <figure>
                <video src="https://psi3.ru/blog/swl01u/videos/bad_apple_2.mp4" controls=""></video>
                <figcaption>Second iteration of Bad Apple</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Now, what causes this artifacting? The synth uses the same 8 <abbr title="General-Purpose Input/Output">GPIO</abbr> lines for both talking to the display and scanning the panel with button controls and LEDs. One of the tasks is responsible for intertwining LCD accesses with panel scanning, and sometimes while we’re transferring our data to the LCD unbeknownst to this task, it decides to interrupt us and do a scan of the panel, which messes with the same data lines that the display is currently actively listening to, which causes these artifacts. To avoid this, we could stop talking to the display directly, and instead nicely ask that multiplexing task to send the data that we want once it’s done with the panel scan.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>So there you go! The algorithm to display video on the LCD of this synth over MIDI is as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Log into the shell;</li>
                <li>Write executable code into RAM using memory write commands provided by the shell;</li>
                <li>Execute the code from RAM by overwriting the return address on the stack;</li>
                <li>Make a copy of the task tables in RAM;</li>
                <li>Fix those new tables up so that they point to each other;</li>
                <li>Tell the ROM to use our new task tables;</li>
                <li>Replace the display task callback with the default idle callback;</li>
                <li>Replace the shell task callback with our own callback;</li>
                <li>In that callback, unpack data arriving via MIDI and transfer it over to the display/panel multiplexing task;</li>
                <li>Feed our synth video frames via MIDI.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This project is not quite done yet. I have a very limited understanding of the chip’s MMIO region, and absolutely no understanding about its most interesting part - the DSP that’s separate from the main ARM core. Stay tuned for when I figure those things out :)</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><header><div><p>Learn how we implemented real-time updates using Node.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL with HTTP long polling. A practical guide to building scalable real-time systems without WebSockets.</p><div><p><span>Nadeesha Cabral</span></p><p><span>•</span><time datetime="04-01-2025">04-01-2025</time></p></div></div></header><p>Like many teams building real-time systems with Node.js and TypeScript, we've been exploring ways to handle real-time updates at scale. Our system handles hundreds of worker nodes constantly polling our PostgreSQL-backed control plane for new jobs (tool calls issued by agents), while agents themselves continuously pull for execution and chat state updates. What started as an exploration into WebSockets led us to a surprisingly effective "old-school" solution: HTTP long polling with Postgres.</p>
<h2>The Challenge: Real-time Updates at Scale</h2>
<p>Our Node.js/TypeScript backend faced two main challenges:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Worker Node Updates</strong>: Hundreds of worker nodes running our Node.js / Golang / C# SDKs needed to know about new jobs as soon as they were available, requiring a querying strategy that didn't bring down our Postgres database</li>
<li><strong>Agent State Synchronization</strong>: Agents required real-time updates about execution and chat state, which we needed to stream efficiently.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Long Polling vs WebSockets: A Refresher</h2>
<h3>How Long Polling Works</h3>
<pre>sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server
    participant Database
    
    Client-&gt;&gt;Server: Request new data
    
    alt Data available immediately
        Server-&gt;&gt;Database: Check for data
        Database--&gt;&gt;Server: Return data
        Server--&gt;&gt;Client: Return response immediately
    else No data available
        Server-&gt;&gt;Database: Check for data
        Database--&gt;&gt;Server: No data
        Note over Server: Hold connection
        loop Check periodically
            Server-&gt;&gt;Database: Poll for new data
            Database--&gt;&gt;Server: New data arrives
        end
        Server--&gt;&gt;Client: Return response
    end
    Client-&gt;&gt;Server: Next request begins
</pre>
<p>The key difference between approaches can be understood with a simple train analogy:</p>
<p>Short polling is like a train that departs strictly according to a timetable - it leaves the station at fixed intervals regardless of whether there are passengers or not. WebSockets, on the other hand, are like having a dedicated train line always ready to transport passengers.</p>
<p>Long polling? It's like a train that waits at the station until at least one passenger boards before departing. If no passengers show up within a certain time (TTL), only then does it leave empty. This approach gives you the best of both worlds - immediate departure when there's data (passengers) and efficient resource usage when there's not.</p>
<p>In technical terms:</p>
<ol>
<li>With short polling, the server responds immediately whether there's data or not</li>
<li>With long polling, the server holds the connection open until either:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>New data becomes available</li>
<li>A timeout is reached (TTL)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Our Implementation Deep Dive</h2>
<p>Let's break down our Node.js implementation:</p>
<pre><code><span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>getJobStatusSync</span> = <span>async</span> (<span>{
  jobId,
  owner,
  ttl = <span>60_000</span>,
}: {
  jobId: <span>string</span>;
  owner: { clusterId: <span>string</span> };
  ttl?: <span>number</span>;
}</span>) =&gt; {
  <span>let</span> <span>jobResult</span>: {
    <span>service</span>: <span>string</span>;
    <span>status</span>: <span>"pending"</span> | <span>"running"</span> | <span>"success"</span> | <span>"failure"</span> | <span>"stalled"</span>;
    <span>result</span>: <span>string</span> | <span>null</span>;
    <span>resultType</span>: <span>ResultType</span> | <span>null</span>;
  } | <span>undefined</span>;

  <span>const</span> start = <span>Date</span>.<span>now</span>();
</code></pre>
<p>The function accepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>jobId</code>: Unique identifier for the job we're tracking</li>
<li><code>owner.clusterId</code>: Cluster identifier for multi-tenancy</li>
<li><code>ttl</code>: Time-to-live in milliseconds (defaults to 60 seconds)</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Polling Loop</h3>
<pre><code>  <span>do</span> {
    <span>const</span> [job] = <span>await</span> data.<span>db</span>
      .<span>select</span>({
        <span>service</span>: data.<span>jobs</span>.<span>service</span>,
        <span>status</span>: data.<span>jobs</span>.<span>status</span>,
        <span>result</span>: data.<span>jobs</span>.<span>result</span>,
        <span>resultType</span>: data.<span>jobs</span>.<span>result_type</span>,
      })
      .<span>from</span>(data.<span>jobs</span>)
      .<span>where</span>(<span>and</span>(<span>eq</span>(data.<span>jobs</span>.<span>id</span>, jobId), <span>eq</span>(data.<span>jobs</span>.<span>cluster_id</span>, owner.<span>clusterId</span>)));

    <span>if</span> (!job) {
      <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>NotFoundError</span>(<span>`Job <span>${jobId}</span> not found`</span>);
    }

    <span>if</span> (job.<span>status</span> === <span>"success"</span> || job.<span>status</span> === <span>"failure"</span>) {
      jobResult = job;
    } <span>else</span> {
      <span>await</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span>(<span><span>resolve</span> =&gt;</span> <span>setTimeout</span>(resolve, <span>500</span>));
    }
  } <span>while</span> (!jobResult &amp;&amp; <span>Date</span>.<span>now</span>() - start &lt; ttl);
</code></pre>
<p>Key aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>The loop continues until either:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>We get a final status (<code>success</code> or <code>failure</code>)</li>
<li>We hit the TTL timeout</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We use a 500ms delay between checks to prevent hammering the database</li>
<li>Database query is optimized with proper indexes on <code>id</code> and <code>cluster_id</code></li>
</ol>
<h3>Error Handling and Response</h3>
<pre><code>  <span>if</span> (jobResult) {
    <span>return</span> jobResult;
  } <span>else</span> {
    <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>JobPollTimeoutError</span>(<span>`Call did not resolve within <span>${ttl}</span>ms`</span>);
  }
</code></pre>
<p>The function concludes by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Throwing a timeout error if no result was found</li>
<li>Returning the job result if successful</li>
</ol>
<h2>Database Optimization</h2>
<p>For this pattern to work efficiently, proper Postgres indexing needs to be implemented:</p>
<pre><code><span>CREATE</span> INDEX idx_jobs_status <span>ON</span> jobs(id, cluster_id);
<span>CREATE</span> INDEX idx_jobs_lookup <span>ON</span> jobs(status) <span>WHERE</span> status <span>IN</span> (<span>'success'</span>, <span>'failure'</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>This ensures our frequent polling queries are fast and don't put unnecessary load on the database.</p>
<h2>The Hidden Benefits of Long Polling</h2>
<p>One of the most compelling aspects of long polling is what you don't have to build. Here's what we avoided:</p>
<h3><strong>Observability Remains Unchanged</strong></h3>
<p>One of the biggest wins is that we don't need to modify our observability stack for WebSockets. All our standard HTTP metrics just work out of the box, and our existing logging patterns do exactly what we need. There's no need to figure out new ways to monitor persistent connections or implement additional logging for WebSocket state.</p>
<h3><strong>Authentication Simplicity</strong></h3>
<p>We completely avoid the headache of implementing a new authentication mechanism for incoming WebSocket connections. We just keep using our standard HTTP authentication that we already have in place. All our existing security patterns continue to work exactly as they always have.</p>
<p>When we implemented Websockets earlier, this became extremely gnarly due to the RBAC restrictions we had to honor. Basically, we needed to be really careful about what data we push to the connected clients, and the privilege escalation that happens when a client moves from one cluster to another.</p>
<h3><strong>Infrastructure Compatibility</strong></h3>
<p>Corporate firewalls blocking WebSocket connections was one of our other worries. Some  of our users are behind firewalls, and we don't need the IT headache of getting them to open up WebSockets.</p>
<p>Not our problem. We don't need any special proxy configurations or complex infrastructure setups. Our standard load balancer configuration works fine without any modifications. The entire stack just keeps humming along as it always has.</p>
<h3><strong>Operational Simplicity</strong></h3>
<p>We never have to worry about server restarts dropping WebSocket connections. There's no connection state to manage or maintain. When something goes wrong (and something always goes wrong), it's much easier to debug and troubleshoot because we're just dealing with standard HTTP requests and responses.</p>
<p>We use Cloudflare for our edge, and that means our existing configuration rules and DDoS protection didn't need any changing.</p>
<h3><strong>Client Implementation</strong></h3>
<p>The client-side code stays remarkably simple. It works with any HTTP client, no special WebSocket libraries needed. Even better, reconnection handling comes for free with basic retry logic. The entire client implementation can often be just a few lines of code.</p>
<h2>Why Not ElectricSQL?</h2>
<p>While exploring solutions, we looked at <a href="https://electric-sql.com/blog/2024/07/17/electric-next">ElectricSQL</a>, which synchronizes Postgres data to the frontend. They make an interesting case for long polling over WebSockets:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Switching to an HTTP protocol may at first seem like a regression or a strange fit. Web sockets are built on top of HTTP specifically to serve the kind of realtime data stream that Electric provides. However, they are also more stateful and harder to cache."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, we actually recommend ElectricSQL if you don't need extreme control or low-level constructs to handle real-time updates. It's a solid, battle-tested solution that handles many edge cases and provides a great developer experience.</p>
<h3>Why We Chose Raw Long Polling</h3>
<p>The message delivery mechanism is a core part of our product - it's not just an implementation detail, it's central to what we do. You can't afford to have something as fundamental as message delivery abstracted away in a third-party library, no matter how good that library might be.</p>
<p>Our specific use case required:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Core Product Control</strong>: Full control over our message delivery mechanism - it's not just infrastructure, it's our product</li>
<li><strong>Zero External Dependencies</strong>: We needed our stack to be as simple as possible for self-hosting</li>
<li><strong>Close to the Metal</strong>: Direct control over the polling mechanism and connection handling</li>
<li><strong>Maximum Control</strong>: Ability to fine-tune every aspect of the implementation, including implementing dynamic polling intervals</li>
<li><strong>Simplicity</strong>: Making it easy for users to understand and modify the codebase</li>
</ol>
<p>For us, staying close to the metal with a simple HTTP long polling implementation was the right choice. But if you don't need this level of control, ElectricSQL provides a more feature-rich solution that could save you significant development time.</p>
<h2>Application Layer Best Practices</h2>
<p>When implementing long polling, there are several critical practices to follow to ensure reliable operation:</p>
<h3><strong>Mandatory TTL Implementation</strong></h3>
<p>You must implement a Time-To-Live (TTL) for your HTTP connections. Without this, you'll inevitably run into connection reset errors. Your polling logic should always return within this TTL, no matter what.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> <span>getJobStatus</span> = <span>async</span> (<span>jobId: <span>string</span>, ttl = <span>60_000</span></span>) =&gt; {
  <span>const</span> start = <span>Date</span>.<span>now</span>();
  
  <span>// Always check if we've exceeded TTL</span>
  <span>while</span> (<span>Date</span>.<span>now</span>() - start &lt; ttl) {
    <span>// polling logic here</span>
  }
  
  <span>return</span> <span>null</span>; <span>// TTL exceeded</span>
}
</code></pre>
<h3><strong>Client-Configurable TTL with Server Limits</strong></h3>
<p>While clients should be able to specify their desired TTL, the server must enforce a maximum limit:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> <span>MAX_TTL</span> = <span>120_000</span>; <span>// 2 minutes</span>

<span>const</span> <span>getJobStatus</span> = <span>async</span> (<span>jobId: <span>string</span>, clientTtl: <span>number</span></span>) =&gt; {
  <span>const</span> ttl = <span>Math</span>.<span>min</span>(clientTtl, <span>MAX_TTL</span>);
  <span>// ... polling logic</span>
}
</code></pre>
<h3><strong>Infrastructure-Aware TTL Settings</strong></h3>
<p>Your maximum TTL must stay under the minimum HTTP connection timeout across your entire infrastructure stack:</p>
<ul>
<li>Application server timeouts</li>
<li>Client timeouts</li>
<li>Load balancer timeouts</li>
<li>Edge server timeouts</li>
<li>Proxy timeouts</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if your edge server has a 30-second timeout, your max TTL should be comfortably under this, say 25 seconds.</p>
<h3><strong>Sensible Database Polling Intervals</strong></h3>
<p>As shown in our implementation, include a reasonable wait time between database polls. We use a 500ms interval:</p>
<pre><code><span>await</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span>(<span><span>resolve</span> =&gt;</span> <span>setTimeout</span>(resolve, <span>500</span>));
</code></pre>
<p>This prevents hammering your database while still providing reasonably quick updates.</p>
<h3><strong>Optional: Exponential Backoff</strong></h3>
<p>While not implemented in our current system, you can implement exponential backoff for more efficient resource usage:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> <span>getJobStatus</span> = <span>async</span> (<span>jobId: <span>string</span>, ttl = <span>60_000</span></span>) =&gt; {
  <span>const</span> start = <span>Date</span>.<span>now</span>();
  <span>let</span> waitTime = <span>100</span>; <span>// Start with 100ms</span>
  
  <span>while</span> (<span>Date</span>.<span>now</span>() - start &lt; ttl) {
    <span>const</span> result = <span>await</span> <span>checkJob</span>(jobId);
    
    <span>if</span> (result) <span>return</span> result;
    
    <span>// Exponential backoff with max of 2 seconds</span>
    waitTime = <span>Math</span>.<span>min</span>(waitTime * <span>2</span>, <span>2000</span>);
    <span>await</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span>(<span><span>resolve</span> =&gt;</span> <span>setTimeout</span>(resolve, waitTime));
  }
  
  <span>return</span> <span>null</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This approach means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Active requests (those likely to get data soon) terminate quickly</li>
<li>Inactive requests gradually increase their polling interval</li>
<li>System resources are used more efficiently</li>
</ul>
<h2>A Case for WebSockets: The Other Side of the Story</h2>
<p>While we've found long polling to be a great solution for our needs, it's not the only option. WebSockets are not inherently bad. They just require a lot of love and attention.</p>
<p>The challenges we mentioned aren't insurmountable - they just require proper engineering attention:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Observability</strong>: WebSockets are more stateful, so you need to implement additional logging and monitoring for persistent connections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Authentication</strong>: You need to implement a new authentication mechanism for incoming WebSocket connections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Infrastructure</strong>: You need to configure your infrastructure to support WebSockets, including load balancers and firewalls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operations</strong>: You need to manage WebSocket connections and reconnections, including handling connection timeouts and errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Client Implementation</strong>: You need to implement a client-side WebSocket library, including handling reconnections and state management.</p>
</li>
</ul></div></div>]]></description>

Picotool was used to write the covert code to the OTP. Then the RP2350's OTP memory was locked behind the Page Locks hardware protection feature, set to an 'inaccessible' state '13:12' as per the table above. Firmware was also signed, with Secure Boot enabled, and they disabled the chip debug feature, so prying eyes couldn't get to the secret via a Serial Wire Debug (SWD) interface. Furthermore, all other bootkeys were disabled, the RP2350 Glitch Detector was turned on and then set to its highest sensitivity. It certainly sounds like it was locked down.</p><p>Cullen says he started his hacking process by studying the RP2350 data sheet and the dependencies outlined in the documentation. Then Cullen drilled down on how the RP2350 boots and establishes its security settings, with particular attention to the OTP.</p><p>Cullen's first idea was to get the OTP to misread its critical bit settings, you could get the chip to work in a non-secure way. Cullen even X-rayed the RP2350 as part of his investigations and annotated the chip blocks. However, he stresses that this was just a pursuit of interest and not really instrumental to beating the challenge.</p><p>Research compelled Cullen to focus on Pin 53, labeled USB-OTP_VDD, as it is connected to OTP (and USB) functions. Perhaps a hacker could "mess with this power supply externally" to affect these functions, he pondered. So he took off the chip and isolated Pin 53 (physically cutting PCB trace), so it was ready to be electrically tampered with separately on a reassembled board.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-nQ4sTaGVvBq3RDynH4YwZQ"><section><p>Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p></section></div><div aria-hidden="false" data-swipeable="true" data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-imageGallery-nQ4sTaGVvBq3RDynH4YwZQ-V5ppwQPQlYKQEEzp8YfYNSf4WgG7yCzH"><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="false"><div><picture data-hydrate="true"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG.jpg" data-pin-nopin="true" data-slice-image="true"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-1200-80.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG.jpg" data-pin-nopin="true" data-slice-image="true"><img src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" alt="RP2350 Hacking Challenge" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG.jpg" data-pin-nopin="true" data-slice-image="true"></picture></div><figcaption><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Aedan Cullen )</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>With this hardware-modified setup, Cullen probed Pin 53 to "inject whatever voltages I want" and checked what happened. An unprotected RP2350 board was kept on hand for side-by-side comparisons. Once the hardware was set up he watched what normally occurs when a secured and a non-secured RP2350 started up – according to the probe readout on an oscilloscope.</p><p>16 groups of spikes were seen, corresponding with 16 initial OTP reads on startup. Cullen then tested injecting power glitches to Pin 53 at certain points in the boot process. Disappointingly, the debug remained locked down. Next, a Python script was used to sweep the position of a glitch power input through the entire 600-microsecond range of OTP reads during startup. The debug functionality was checked but never became available. So Cullen looked at the unlocked RP2350 board again, with debugging enabled, for clues.</p><p>Then, something interesting was observed, as the RISC-V cores showed up via the glitch on the unsecured RP2350. Cullen then used another script to check where the RISC-V debug access port shows up. This technique could also be triggered on the secured RP2350 – and a debugger could now be connected to the secured RP2350 and the secret read from the OTP!</p><h2 id="secret-gets-busted-3">Secret gets busted</h2><p>The 'permanently disabled' RISC-V cores had been woken by the glitch to enable this access. Cullen explains the odd underlying reason that the glitch 0x00030033 works is that it disables both Arm and RISC-V cores but, the Arm disable instruction has higher priority, leaving RISC-V turned on. Importantly the glitch successfully clears Debug_Disable.</p><div aria-hidden="false" data-swipeable="true" data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-imageGallery-nQ4sTaGVvBq3RDynH4YwZQ-NKOg5Y8ErILypSgdcOnKfaOiUe7TF7Qt"><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="false"><div><picture data-hydrate="true"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG.jpg" data-pin-nopin="true" data-slice-image="true"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG-1200-80.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG.jpg" data-pin-nopin="true" data-slice-image="true"><img src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" alt="RP2350 Hacking Challenge" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG.jpg" data-pin-nopin="true" data-slice-image="true"></picture></div><figcaption><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Aedan Cullen )</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>For more information about the background to this hack, particularly bypassing the guard read mechanism, we advise watching the video recorded during the 38c3 (linked top).
