We’ve been building AI video models for ‘digital twins’ or ‘avatars’ since 2020.</p><p>We’re sharing some of the challenges we faced building an AI video interface that has realistic conversations with a human, including getting it to under 1 second of latency.</p><p>To try it, talk to Hassaan’s digital twin: <a href="https://www.hassaanraza.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.hassaanraza.com</a>, or to our "demo twin" Carter: <a href="https://www.tavus.io/">https://www.tavus.io</a></p><p>We built this because until now, we've had to adapt communication to the limits of technology. But what if we could interact naturally with a computer? Conversational video makes it possible – we think it'll eventually be a key human-computer interface.</p><p>To make conversational video effective, it has to have really low latency and conversational awareness. A fast-paced conversation between friends has ~250 ms between utterances, but if you’re talking about something more complex or with someone new, there is additional “thinking” time. So, less than 1000 ms latency makes the conversation feel pretty realistic, and that became our target.</p><p>Our architecture decisions had to balance 3 things: latency, scale, &amp; cost. Getting all of these was a huge challenge.</p><p>The first lesson learned was to make it low-latency, we had to build it from the ground up. We went from a team that cared about seconds to a team that counts every millisecond. We also had to support thousands of conversations happening all at once, without getting destroyed on compute costs.</p><p>For example, during early development, each conversation had to run on an individual H100 in order to fit all components and model weights into GPU memory just to run our Phoenix-1 model faster than 30fps. This was unscalable &amp; expensive.</p><p>We developed a new model, Phoenix-2, with a number of improvements, including inference speed. We switched from a NeRF based backbone to  Gaussian Splatting for a multitude of reasons, one being the requirement that we could generate frames faster than realtime, at 70+ fps on lower-end hardware. 
We exceeded this and focused on optimizing memory and core usage on GPU to allow for lower-end hardware to run it all. We did other things to save on time and cost like using streaming vs batching, parallelizing processes, etc. But those are stories for another day.</p><p>We still had to lower the utterance-to-utterance time to hit our goal of under a second of latency. This meant each component (vision, ASR, LLM, TTS, video generation) had to be hyper-optimized.</p><p>The worst offender was the LLM. It didn’t matter how fast the tokens per second (t/s) were, it was the time-to-first token (tfft) that really made the difference. That meant services like Groq were actually too slow – they had high t/s, but slow ttft. Most providers were too slow.</p><p>The next worst offender was actually detecting when someone stopped speaking. This is  hard. Basic solutions use time after silence to ‘determine’ when someone has stopped talking. But it adds latency. If you tune it to be too short, the AI agent will talk over you. Too long, and it’ll take a while to respond. The model had to be dedicated to accurately detecting end-of-turn based on conversation signals, and speculating on inputs to get a head start.</p><p>We went from 3-5 to &lt;1 second (&amp; as fast as 600 ms) with these architectural optimizations while running on lower-end hardware.</p><p>All this allowed us to ship with a less than 1 second of latency, which we believe is the fastest out there. We have a bunch of customers, including Delphi, a professional coach and expert cloning platform. They have users that have conversations with digital twins that span from minutes, to one hour, to even four hours (!) - which is mind blowing, even to us.</p><p>Thanks for reading! let us know what you think and what you would build.

  <p><em>[Note that this article is a transcript of the video embedded above.]</em></p><p>If you have to know the answer right away, it’s no; or at least, my goal with this video is to convince you that the world is not running out of sand. But if it were that simple, I wouldn’t be here (right?) and you probably wouldn’t be either. In fact, I was really surprised by some of the things I didn’t know as I dug deeper into the topic further, and how some of the most widely spread sand “facts” are dead wrong.</p><p>The wide world of sand is complicated, and not in a boring, pedantic kind of way. This simple material touches nearly every part of our lives, and the science and engineering behind it is rich and deep, and to me at least, hard not to become obsessed with. There’s a good chance you’ve seen articles or videos over the past few years with essentially the same story about sand. The “Sand Wars” documentary kind of kicked off the modern discussion, and then Vince Beiser wrote an excellent book on the topic, “The World in a Grain.” Of course, a lot of the book’s best reviews focus on the fact that sand is kind of a topic that’s “taken for granted” or “neglected.” But, at least in civil engineering, it is one of the most glected materials out there. And I’d like to give you a peek behind the curtain and show you how we think about this seemingly unlimited resource and why it’s worth knowing a little more about it. But first, I need to head out to the garage and put some sand in a rock tumbler, because I want to do a material property shootout, and this is going to take a little while. I have something really cool in the other barrel, and I’ll show it to you later on in the video. I’m Grady, and this is Practical Engineering.</p><p>What the heck is sand anyway? It’s kind of a “know it when you see it”-type material. If we use the US Department of Agriculture’s soil textural triangle, sand is any granular material that is at least 85% sand… So, what the heck is sand? For a better answer, we have the Unified Soil Classification System. Geotechnical engineers sometimes say that “dirt” is a four-letter word. Maybe because it undermines the importance of soil (which is also a four-letter word, by the way), but I like to think it’s because we have better names for all the dirts around the world, and here they are. In fact, there are four specific kinds of sand, but they all fit this one criterion, and it’s all about the size of the particles. At least half of those particles have to make it through a Number 4 sieve (about 5 millimeters), but no more than half can go through a Number 200 sieve (less than a tenth of a millimeter, or about 75 microns). That is a pretty wide range of materials, but I think when you picture sand in your mind, you probably imagine what the USCS would call “clean sand” where less than 12% pass the 200 sieve. So, just to make it simple, let’s say that sand is a material where the particles fit through this, but they don’t fit through this. But still, that encompasses a huge range of different dirts. And I hope, at this point, you’re asking, “Who Cares?” because I would love to answer that question.</p><p>In his book, Beiser calls sand “the most important solid substance on earth…the literal foundation of modern civilization…” We use it to make glass, semiconductors, fiber optics, filters, and abrasives, use it to texture surfaces, to play in, for beauty, and more. But, probably more than anything else, sand is an essential ingredient in concrete. And, you know, I’m a civil engineer; this is a channel about the built environment; so I wanna talk about concrete. And, in fact, if this video sparks your curiosity about one of my favorite materials, I have a whole playlist of topics I’ve covered in the past so you can learn more after this. You can’t really overstate how important concrete is and how much of it we use. There’s a bigger conversation to be had about its environmental impacts, but when compared to alternative building materials, it just has so much going for it. It is an extremely low-cost, durable substance that can be made into just about any shape you can imagine. Concrete has enabled us to build structures that last for generations from some very simple ingredients that are (mostly) available across the world: water, cement, gravel, and sand.</p><p>Most of those ingredients are mined and used directly as raw materials. And they’re usually mined close by. Transportation makes up a big part of the cost associated with sands used for construction, so the distance between where they’re found and where they need to go is highly correlated with how economical they can be. And that often leads to environmental impacts, some worse than others, depending on local regulations. It turns out that the best sand for concrete often comes from rivers, and mining in rivers can be particularly destructive because the impacts can spread upstream and downstream through changes in the nature of the channel. (I have a series of videos on that topic, too, by the way). Sand isn’t spread evenly throughout the world, and it’s a non-renewable resource. Geologic processes produce it a lot slower than we can use it. So, it makes some intuitive sense to say that we could eventually run out. But here’s a fact that is often overlooked in the discussion: we can make sand.</p><p>And it’s not that complicated, either. I talked about the definition of sand a little earlier, but here’s another one: it’s just very small rocks. And we have engineered machines that can transform big rocks into small ones. In fact, I have such a machine in my garage. It’s called a hammer. Some might argue that this isn’t the best use of my time, but I spent about an hour to artisanally manufacture a batch of sand just to hammer this point home. First, you crush the rocks. Then you put them through the sieves to remove the stuff that’s too big or too small. It takes a little extra processing, but this is not grain surgery. And this has a lot of benefits compared to sourcing natural sand. Hard rock quarries and crushing operations are already out there producing coarse aggregates like gravel, so sometimes the smaller stuff is a waste product anyway. It opens up possibilities when natural deposits aren’t available and can move mining operations upland, away from rivers, where the environmental impacts are less severe. And, it can make the concrete stronger. Let me show you what I mean.</p><p>I took some sand out of my kids’ sandbox and put it in a rock tumbler for a week to try and simulate the erosion it might see over years in windswept dunes of a desert. Obviously, this erosion reduced the overall size of the particles. So, I classified both materials with the sieves to make them a closer match for a fair comparison. And both batches are within the spec for concrete sand in the US. Looking in the microscope, you can clearly see the differences. The tumbled sand is rounded with roughly spherical, smooth grains. The manufactured sand is jagged with sharp, angular corners. And watch what happens when I pile them up. I filled up two pieces of pipe with the same amount of sand, and then pulled the pipe away. It’s not a huge difference, but you can see the rounded sand spreads out a little further because the particles have less friction. It makes intuitive sense that concrete made from this sand would be weaker than with this sand. Let’s see if that’s true.</p><p>I mixed up a simple batch of concrete from the crushed sand, and the tumbled sand keeping the weights of all the ingredients equal. Here’s my recipe if you want to try this experiment yourself. Then I molded some concrete cylinders and let them cure for a week. Most concrete mixes are meant to reach their design strength after 28 days, but concrete strength gain is fairly predictable, so the relative difference between the samples should be consistent in time. Most importantly, my little benchtop hydraulic press would not be able to break these samples if I waited that long. And this load cell is not calibrated, so I’m doing this test in arbitrary Practical Engineering units of force. The tumbled sand cylinder broke at around 2500 units. And the manufactured sand concrete broke at 7500 units. You can easily see the difference in the results. “Goodnight!” It was 3 times as strong. Of course, this is my garage, not a testing lab, and I only did one sample because my arm got tired of hammering rocks. Luckily, people much smarter than me have tested this out, and the results are pretty conclusive that, if you keep everything the same, the angularity of fine aggregate increases the strength of concrete. And that’s the story you probably know if you’ve read anything on this topic. It’s the common explanation for why we don’t use dune sand, the most visible of earth’s sand resources, in concrete. It’s intuitive. Rounded grains don’t lock together. Beiser makes the claim not once but three times in his book. But it turns out it’s not that simple, because strength isn’t the only property of concrete that we care about.</p><p>Before concrete has to be strong, it has to be placed. Ask anyone who’s done this kind of work, and they’ll tell you it’s hard. Well, it’s liquid at first, but it’s hard to work with. Concrete is about two-and-a-half times the density of water. It’s heavy stuff, and to get it into the forms often can require a lot of different tools: wheelbarrows, buggies, chutes, pumps, hoses, and more. The better the concrete flows, the easier it is to do a good job of placing it. And that matters. If a mix is too stiff, it can clog up hoses, trap air bubbles, and ultimately lead to poor quality in the installed product. This property of concrete is usually called workability. It’s often measured using a slump test. Fill up a cone of concrete, pull the cone away, and see how far the concrete slumps. But the problem with workability is that, in one big way, it works against strength. And it all has to do with water.</p><p>What happens when the concrete truck shows up to your job site and the mix is too stiff? Depends on if the engineer is there or not, but in a lot of cases, you just tell the driver to add a few gallons of water to the mix. More water; better flow; easier to place. It’s pretty straightforward, but there’s a reason you don’t want the engineer to know: water decreases concrete strength. I’ve done a whole video about this with some garage demos, so again, check that out if you want to learn more. The gist is that the ratio of water to cement is one of the most important factors determining concrete's strength when it cures. Cement isn’t like some types of glue that harden as the water or solvent evaporates. It goes through a chemical reaction, incorporating the water into the final product. That’s why we say concrete “cures” instead of “dries”. But, cement can only react with around 35 percent of its weight in water, so any more than that is just taking up volume in the mix that could be used by the stronger ingredients. More water; less strong. And here’s where the shape of the sand grains comes into play.</p><p>I did a little garage slump test to gauge the workability of those two mixes I made for the earlier demonstration. Here’s the rounded sand mix… and here’s the manufactured sand. “Haha, no slump at all.” Honestly I expected this to be a subtle difference, but it was like night and day. They weren’t even close. So I wondered, what would happen if, instead of holding ingredient ratios constant, I used the workability as the controlled variable? Let’s find out. First I used the manufactured sand with enough water to get it to a workable level. 100 milliliters got it to here, which is a bit better than the first one. Then I did a second mix with the tumbled sand, slowly adding water and running the slump test until it was pretty close. It took only 70 ml of water to make them match, 30% less than the first batch. After a week, I tested the samples. The tumbled sand sample broke at 4,800 units. And the manufactured sand broke at only 4,300 units. The tumbled sand with the rounder grains was stronger this time (by about ten percent), and it’s all due to the lower water content in the mix.</p><p>So yes, if you use the same amount of water, more angular sand like you might find from a river or manufactured sand is better, but that’s not what happens in real construction. I say this with many, many caveats, but very generally, you only add as much water as you need for workability. Rounded sand gives you better workability, so you can add less water, and thus get stronger concrete. This idea that we can’t use wind-blown sands in concrete because of their shape is a myth. In fact, the American Concrete Institute has a bulletin that says it better than I can:</p><p>“The influence of fine aggregate shape and texture on the strength of hardened concrete is almost entirely related to the resulting water-to-cement ratio of the concrete…”</p><p>I tried to track down the original source of this idea that we can’t use rounded grains in concrete, but got nowhere. Beiser cites an article from the UN, which itself cites a 2006 paper about using two types of desert sand from China in concrete. But that paper doesn’t mention the roundness of the particles at all. They didn’t include any measure of the shape of the grains in their study, and they didn’t make any suggestions about how that particular property of the desert sand may have affected the results of their tests. In fact, the conclusion of that paper includes saying that desert sand is a feasible alternative to other types of fine aggregates used in concrete. And the whole reason it was a subject of scientific study at all has to do with size, not shape. This is a widely used specification for the distribution of particle sizes of fine aggregate for concrete. Any sand in this area meets the spec. And here’s the soil used in that paper. Even if the conclusion was that it doesn’t work, I think this would have a lot more to do with the results than the shape of the particles.</p><p>And that really gets to the heart of this whole discussion. Fine aggregates are found throughout the world. We can even make our own. And concrete is like baking; different ingredients can change the end results. But just like regional bread recipes evolved based on the availability of local ingredients, the construction industry has developed a lot of ways to use different local materials to achieve good structural properties. The real challenge, like many things in engineering, is cost.</p><p>It can be more expensive to manufacture sand compared to mining raw materials that can be put directly in a mix, especially when you factor in the other ingredients, like chemical admixtures, that might be required to make it more workable without adding too much water. It’s expensive to transport better quality sand from far away, rather than finding it close to a job site or batch plant. It’s expensive to mine sand in adherence to environmental regulations that are becoming stricter worldwide. It’s catchy to say there’s a scarcity of fine aggregates on earth, but I think it’s misleading. “Sand is getting a lot more expensive than it used to be” just doesn’t make as nice of a headline. And the tricky part is that, in many ways, those costs have always been there; we’ve just externalized them onto the environment and our future.</p><p>All the ingredients in concrete are mined or harvested just like other natural resources. It’s just that concrete is made on a scale that blows most other materials out of the water. It’s a huge business, and there’s lots of money flowing, which means a lot of potential environmental harm and social conflict as a result. That’s especially true in places that don’t have robust oversight and enforcement of how sand is extracted. And I think it’s important to point out that the low-cost of sand, because of its simplicity as a material and its abundance, is a big part of why we use so much concrete in the first place, even in situations where it’s not necessarily the best material choice in other respects. Everything in engineering is a tradeoff, and if the economics around sand change, the engineering and construction industries can change with them. Look at other examples of this. </p><p>Diamond used to be exclusively a mined material, but now we can make it in a lab. Synthetic diamond gemstones used in jewelry are now less expensive than mined diamonds, but, admittedly, there’s a lot more to that economy than the costs to make them. What I think is more interesting is that 99 percent of diamond used in the world for industrial purposes is synthetic. It used to be a rare mineral, but now you can pick up a diamond drill bit or saw blade from the hardware store for a fairly small premium.</p><p>Timber is another example. Natural forests used to be the only source, but now plantations, trees planted specifically for harvest, now make up more than a third of the wood we use globally. And engineered lumber like plywood, OSB, and structural composites can make more efficient use of raw materials. I’m pointing out these examples, not to say they’re good or bad - there are pros and cons in both cases - but just to illustrate how our demand for materials in the construction industry changes with the supply, and how technology can have a huge impact on that. And there’s another parallel between timber and sand: they both can be renewable.</p><p>I had another barrel in the rock tumbler not going to use, so I broke up some chunks of concrete and threw them in. I ran these through the grits, just like you would with any other rock in a tumbler. Concrete is pretty soft compared to most natural rocks, so it didn’t polish up that nicely, but the result is still pretty cool. You can really see the constituent materials of the concrete after it spent so long rolling around in there: the small and large aggregates and the cement paste locking them together. But the point of this demo is that concrete is pretty much just rock, that’s mostly what it’s made of in the first place. And just like the rocks I crushed to create manufactured sand, concrete can be recycled into aggregates that get reused in the construction industry, either in new concrete or other materials, reducing demand for virgin sources.</p><p>There’s a lot changing in the construction industry, and a lot of growth in the need for materials like sand and gravel. But I don’t think it’s fair to say the world is running out of those materials. We’re just more aware of all the costs involved in procuring them, and hopefully taking more account for how they affect our future and the environment.</p>

    <p>ProductHunt has over 1 million user signups.
More than 60% of those are bots.</p>

<h2>How it started</h2>

<p>I’ve used <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.producthunt.com/">ProductHunt</a> since early 2014.
Besides <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, it was a good way to see the latest product launches in tech.
Using the comments on products, I could discover similar tools or collect feedback on my own products.
Lately though, I’ve noticed most of the comments seem to be generated by ChatGPT.</p>

<h2>A simple test</h2>

<p>To test my theory, I launched my own product on ProductHunt but with a simple LLM prompt injection in the product’s description.
Sure enough, almost all the comments were automated.</p>

<p><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/ph/comments.png" alt="Comments screenshot" title="Comments screenshot"></p>

<p>Can you spot the bots?</p>

<p>Now we see that it’s a waste of time for people launching on ProductHunt to reply to comments.
Is launching on ProductHunt even worth it?
If so many bots are commenting, they must be upvoting too right?
Based on all the emails I receive offering votes for money, some people must be purchasing upvotes.</p>

<h2>The data</h2>

<p>To analyze upvotes, I found a dump of all ProductHunt users, launches, upvotes, and comments.
ProductHunt has over 1 million user sign ups, over 300 thousand launches, 2.5 million comments, and 20 million upvotes.
Each launch also came with the daily rank, which is the rank of the launch after 24 hours from midnight PDT when each new launch day starts.</p>

<h2>Detecting bot accounts</h2>

<p>Detecting bots is difficult, especially with only public data.
At first, I tried analyzing the times of day of user comments to find trends.
For example, here’s one user who signed up 677 days ago, commented 2,009 times and upvoted 4,649 launches.
Definitely a power user and using some automation, but probably not a bot (and wasn’t categorized as one).</p>

<p><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/ph/user-comment-hours-hist-real.png" alt="Comments by hour histogram real" title="Comments by hour histogram real"></p>

<p>Now look at a bot user’s comments.
This user signed up 140 days ago, commented 173 times and upvoted 246 launches.</p>

<p><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/ph/user-comment-hours-hist-bot.png" alt="Comments by hour histogram bot" title="Comments by hour histogram bot"></p>

<p>Notice how the bot comments at regular intervals and the chart looks boxy instead of smooth?</p>

<p>However, this wasn’t enough to detect bot accounts alone.
I assigned each user a risk score based on many different criteria, like account activity duration, upvote patterns over time, and content of comments.
Did you know ChatGPT generated comments have a higher frequency of words like <code>game-changer</code>?
Bot comments also contained characters not easily typeable, like <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash#Em_dash">em-dash</a>.
They also commonly included the name and bio word for word from a real person’s LinkedIn profile, but those people said they never created any ProductHunt account.
In the end, I detected over 60% of user signups to be automated bot accounts.
That’s a conservative number, because I didn’t detect all the bots.
It would be a lot easier for ProductHunt themselves to detect bot activity more accurately using insider data.</p>

<h2>Bot activity over time</h2>

<h3>User signups</h3>

<p>Since 2018, there have been more bot users created than real users.</p>

<p><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/ph/Bot%20vs%20Real%20Signups%20(Line%20Chart).png" alt="Bot User Signups" title="Bot User Signups"></p>

<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>In late 2022, bot comments really took off... around the same time ChatGPT was first widely available.
The spike in 2024 is because over time bot accounts are deleted, I’m not sure if by ProductHunt or by the account owner.
Newer accounts are more likely to not have been deleted, so we still have access to their comments.</p>

<p><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/ph/Bot%20vs%20Real%20Comments%20(Line%20Chart).png" alt="Bot Comments" title="Bot Comments"></p>

<h3>Upvotes</h3>

<p>Also in 2022, bot upvotes surpassed real votes.</p>

<p><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/ph/Bot%20vs%20Real%20Votes%20(Line%20Chart).png" alt="Bot Votes" title="Bot Votes"></p>

<p>These bots form voting rings where makers pay for upvotes to increase their chances of getting into the ProductHunt newsletter.</p>

<h3>Rankings</h3>

<p>Most launches get only a few real upvotes.
Since bots vote randomly to blend in, the bot trend line is smoother than the real user upvotes.</p>

<p><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/ph/Posts%20By%20Votes%20(Line%20Chart).png" alt="Count of launches grouped by number of votes" title="Count of launches grouped by number of votes"></p>

<h2>Daily rank</h2>

<p>First place launches get featured in the daily and weekly ProductHunt newsletter, so let’s see how many bot upvotes the top launches receive.</p>

<p><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/ph/Posts%20in%20First%20Place%20by%20Bot%20Votes.png" alt="Launches in first place by number of bot votes" title="Launches in first place by number of bot votes"></p>

<p>Looks like 15% bot votes is a safe amount to get your product in first place for the day.
Anything over 60% bot votes doesn’t seem to make it to first place for some reason.
Here’s the same chart limited to launches after 2020, showing bots are accounting for more of the upvotes in top posts lately.</p>

<p><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/ph/Posts%20in%20First%20Place%20by%20Bot%20Votes%20since%202020.png" alt="Launches in first place by number of bot votes since 2020" title="Launches in first place by number of bot votes since 2020"></p>

<p>Launches paying for upvotes probably aren’t high quality products, so they often rank top 5 instead of first place:</p>

<p><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/ph/Posts%20in%20Top%205%20by%20Bot%20Votes%20since%202020.png" alt="Launches in top 5 by number of bot votes since 2020" title="Launches in top 5 by number of bot votes since 2020"></p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I wanted to create a list of launches without the bot votes, to see if the top launch of the day changes with the bot votes are removed.
However, I don’t want to call out launches that didn’t really pay for votes but just happen to have many upvotes from bots, and I don’t want more publicity for the launches that did pay.
Either way, I’ve spent too much time on this already so that will have to wait for a possible future blog post.</p>

        <p>The Dutch government has sent 288 artifacts stolen from Indonesia during the archipelago’s colonial era, among them weapons, coins, jewelry and textiles, back to their home country.</p>

<p>“These objects should never have been here,” says <a href="https://www.government.nl/government/members-of-cabinet/eppo-bruins">Eppo Bruins</a>, the Dutch minister of education, culture and science, per <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2024/09/nl-returns-indonesian-art-which-should-never-have-been-here/"><em>Dutch News</em></a>. “There was looting and pillaging going on in the colonial period and other types of involuntary loss of cultural objects. It is a matter of material justice to return them.”</p>

<p>The September 20 ceremony at the <a href="https://amsterdam.wereldmuseum.nl/en?_gl=1%2A1iotms3%2A_gcl_au%2AMTcwODAyODEzNy4xNzI3NDQ3Mjgy%2A_ga%2AMTkzNjEzNzE1Mi4xNzI3NDQ3Mjgy%2A_ga_96W70H259F%2AMTcyNzQ0NzI4MS4xLjAuMTcyNzQ0NzI4Mi4wLjAuMA..%2A_ga_TPGM95SP38%2AMTcyNzQ0NzI4Mi4xLjEuMTcyNzQ0NzI4Mi42MC4wLjA.">World Museum</a> in Amsterdam marked the second time that the Netherlands has returned stolen artifacts to its former colonies since 2020, when the independent <a href="https://committee.kolonialecollecties.nl/">Colonial Collections Committee</a> issued a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/09/arts/design/dutch-restitution-report.html">report</a> advising the country to do so. The <a href="https://www.government.nl/latest/news/2023/07/06/colonial-collections-to-be-returned-to-indonesia-and-sri-lanka">first repatriation</a> took place in July 2023, when the Dutch government returned 478 objects to Indonesia and Sri Lanka.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.government.nl/latest/news/2024/09/20/for-second-time-cultural-artefacts-to-be-returned-to-indonesia">statement</a>, the trove of newly returned artifacts includes four Hindu-Buddhist sculptures. One of the works, a likeness of the god <a href="https://committee.kolonialecollecties.nl/binaries/commissioncolonialcollections/documenten/advisory-reports/2024/08/28/indonesia/Recommendation+Ganesha.pdf">Ganesha</a>, was shipped to the Netherlands from East Java in 1843 on the orders of a colonial administrator. The <a href="https://committee.kolonialecollecties.nl/binaries/commissioncolonialcollections/documenten/advisory-reports/2024/08/28/indonesia/Recommendation+Brahma.pdf">other three</a>, depicting the gods Bhairava, Nandi and Brahma, were taken from Singasari, a late 13th-century temple complex in East Java, in the mid-19th century.</p>

<p>But the bulk of the repatriated items came to the Netherlands in the aftermath of a 1906 <a href="https://amsterdam.wereldmuseum.nl/en/whats-on/exhibitions/bali-behind-scenes/tourism-and-colonialism">war in southern Bali</a>, in which the Dutch military attacked the kingdoms of Badung and Tabanan.</p>

<p>“Around 1,000 Balinese were killed, while the Dutch lost four men,” writes the <a href="https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2024/09/20/netherlands-to-return-288-items-looted-in-colonial-era-to-indonesia"><em>Art Newspaper</em></a>’s<em> </em>Catherine Hickley. “A week later, in the kingdom of Tabanan, the Dutch army attacked the palace and arrested the king, who together with the crown prince, [died by] suicide that night.”</p>

<p>An <a href="https://committee.kolonialecollecties.nl/binaries/commissioncolonialcollections/documenten/advisory-reports/2024/08/28/indonesia/Recommendation+Puputan+Badung.pdf">advisory report</a> issued by the Colonial Collections Committee divides the objects into several categories: “official loot” like the belongings of deposed Balinese kings, confiscated coins and weapons, and artifacts from the personal holdings of a <a href="https://wojnieuwenkamp.nl/en/the-artist/">Dutch artist</a> who purchased or otherwise acquired items linked to the 1906 conflict. The Indonesian government officially requested the return of these culturally significant objects, collectively known as the Puputan Badung Collection, last September.</p>

<p>Per the statement, the committee is currently preparing recommendations for additional repatriation requests from Nigeria, Sri Lanka, India and Indonesia. While some critics of repatriation have raised concerns over how poorer countries will care for their returned artifacts, <a href="https://leiden.wereldmuseum.nl/en/about-volkenkunde/press/marieke-van-bommel-new-managing-director">Marieke van Bommel</a>, director general of the National Museum of World Cultures, tells the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/world/europe/netherlands-indonesia-artifacts.html"><em>New York Times</em></a>’ Lynsey Chutel that “the thief cannot tell the rightful owners what to do with their property.”</p>

<p>GitHub Issues has been how the world’s best software teams collaborate since it first launched in <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/the-library/github-issue-tracker/">2009</a>. Today we are excited to unveil a major evolution of issues and projects, featuring a range of highly requested enhancements including sub-issues, issue types and advanced search for issues. Together, these additions make it easier than ever to break down work, visualize progress, categorize and find just the right issue in GitHub.</p>
<p>These new features are now available in public preview for you to try. To gain access for your organization, please sign up <a href="https://github.com/features/issues/signup">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="issues-ui-updates">🎨 Issues UI updates<a href="#issues-ui-updates" aria-label="🎨 Issues UI updates"></a></h2>
<p>All these new features are based upon an update to the issues front end, designed to be fast and familiar. This means there are no new UI patterns to slow you down, but we did include a few tweaks to speed you up, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The issues index page has a new filter bar with autocomplete and syntax highlighting.</li>
<li>Creating multiple issues is faster with a ‘create more’ option to quickly get back to the creation screen.</li>
<li>Issue form and templates are now presented in alphabetical order based on file name, making it easier for you to set just the right order.</li>
<li>Easily share the URL to an issue with a new ‘copy link’ button.</li>
<li>On long issues, selecting ‘load more’ will now fetch 150 events instead of 50.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="increased-items-in-github-projects">♾️ Increased items in GitHub Projects<a href="#increased-items-in-github-projects" aria-label="♾️ Increased items in GitHub Projects"></a></h2>
<p>Earlier this year, we introduced the <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2024-02-12-github-issues-projects-projects-without-limits-private-beta/">private beta of increased project item limits</a>, expanding the capacity from 1,200 to 50,000 items in a project. Today, we’re expanding the audience for these increased limits.</p>
<p>Since the private beta, we’ve added support for slice by, swimlanes, and GraphQL API. We’ve also fixed your top bug reports and made performance improvements.</p>
<p>If you’re a project admin and your project is approaching the item limit without utilizing Insights (our only currently unsupported feature), a banner will appear over your project to notify you.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b0efffa-11b3-43ed-9065-56afd2278a67" alt="The sign up banner for the increased items waitlist" width="700" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>As this update is on a project by project basis rather than per organization, to join, just click the “Join beta” button on eligible projects.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>Software developers who publish their products on third-party stores face all kinds of problems sometimes. From rejected apps or extensions to removed products or unjustified claims about them.</p>
<p>Raymond "gorhill" Hill, maker of the world's most popular content blocker uBlock Origin received two emails from Mozilla recently about his Firefox add-on <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2022/09/09/ublock-origin-minus-an-experimental-manifest-v3-compatible-extension/" data-wpel-link="internal">uBlock Origin Lite</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Good to know:</strong> uBlock Origin Lite is a Manifest V3-compatible version of the content blocker. It is less powerful, but since Google is disabling Manifest V2 support in Chrome, it is what will remain from uBlock Origin for Chromium-based browsers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ublock-origin-lite-firefox.png" alt="uBlock Origin Lite Firefox" width="1587" height="1203" srcset="https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ublock-origin-lite-firefox.png 1587w, https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ublock-origin-lite-firefox-768x582.png 768w, https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ublock-origin-lite-firefox-1536x1164.png 1536w, https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ublock-origin-lite-firefox-1200x910.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1587px) 100vw, 1587px"></p>
<p>Mozilla <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home/issues/197" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">says</a> that it has reviewed the extension and found violations. The following claims were made:</p>
<ul>
<li>The extension is not asking for consent for data collecting.</li>
<li>The extension contains "minified, concatenated or otherwise machine-generated code".</li>
<li>There is no privacy policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a consequence, Mozilla disabled the extension on the Firefox Add-ons Store.</p>
<p>Hill refuted all three claims that Mozilla made on the GitHub repository stating that the extension is not collecting any data, that there is no minified code in uBlock Origin Lite, and that there is a privacy policy.</p>
<p>He admitted further that he does not "have the time or motivation to spend time on this nonsense" and won't react to the allegations made or appeal the decision.</p>
<p>In a follow-up, Hill criticized the "nonsensical and hostile review process" that put added burden on developers. Mozilla disabled all versions of the extension except for the very first one. It still flagged the extension for the very same reasons, but nevertheless decided to keep the outdated version up.</p>
<p><strong>Does it affect uBlock Origin?</strong> The core extension remains available for Firefox. Unlike Google Chrome, Firefox will continue to support Manifest V2 extensions. Mozilla has not flagged this extensions or disabled it.</p>
<p>Hill is now self-hosting the extension uBlock Origin Lite for Firefox on the GitHub repository. Interested users find it <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home/releases" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">on the releases page</a> as a direct download.</p>
<h2>Mozilla realizes its blunder, but it seems too late</h2>
<p>Mozilla contacted Hill a few days later, likely after the thing blew up everywhere, stating that the "previous decision was incorrect" and that the extension has been restored.</p>
<p>The organization issued an apology for the "mistake"&nbsp; and recommended to Hill to reach out whenever he has questions or concerns about a review.</p>
<p>Hill decided to go ahead with the plan to self-host the extension. He removed the extension from Mozilla's Add-ons repository as a consequence.</p>
<p>When you search for uBlock Origin Lite, you won't get the extension returned anymore.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if the two parties will come closer together again or if this breakup will be permanent.</p>
<h3>Closing Words</h3>
<p>Most mistakes in review processes are made by machines. Google, for example, uses automated reviews for the most part, but may also manually review extensions.</p>
<p>The process does not keep all malicious extensions out, of which <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2023/06/05/75-million-chrome-users-have-installed-these-malicious-extensions/" data-wpel-link="internal">plenty</a> <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2021/05/18/dont-download-this-microsoft-authenticator-extension-for-chrome-it-is-fake/" data-wpel-link="internal">are</a> <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2023/12/23/google-removes-3-fake-vpn-extensions-with-1-5-million-users-from-chrome-web-store/" data-wpel-link="internal">regularly</a> discovered,&nbsp; but it may also <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2021/03/25/the-curious-case-of-clearurls-removal-from-the-google-chrome-webstore/" data-wpel-link="internal">block legitimate extensions</a> or updates.</p>
<p>In the case of uBlock Origin Lite, it is unclear how the reviewer came to the conclusion that the extension was in violation of policies. Especially the claim that the extension had no privacy policy, when it clearly had one, sheds no good light on the reviewer and process.</p>
<p>Mozilla might want to look at the review process to find out what went wrong exactly to avoid another disaster like it in the future.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">A Y Combinator startup named PearAI launched <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/CodeFryingPan/status/1840203597478539477">with an X post thread </a>and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18cHBU05zK0">YouTube video</a> on Saturday and created immediate controversy. And some of that is splashing onto YC itself.</p>

<p>PearAI offers an AI coding editor. The startup’s founder Duke Pan has openly said that it’s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/trypear/pearai-app">a cloned copy</a> of another AI editor called Continue, which was covered under the Apache open source license. But PearAI made a major misstep: PearAI originally slapped its own made-up closed license on it, called the Pear Enterprise License, which Pan admitted was written by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/ns123abc/status/1840481220188111076/photo/1">ChatGPT.</a></p>

	
	


<p>Changing a license like this is a big deal in the open source world. Not only are there legalities involved in violating a software license, but it defeats the whole purpose of open source, which is about community building, sharing, and contributing. In an apology PearAI’s Pan posted <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/CodeFryingPan/status/1840831339337302204">on Monday</a>, he said that the project has now been released under the same Apache open source license as the original project.</p>

<p>The launch thread went viral with thousands of comments by Sunday. Some were congratulatory, but others were vicious in pointing out the licensing and the fact that PearAI wasn’t so much a fork with new stuff added, but a replica with a new name. Pan admitted as much in his apology.</p>

<p>So many angry comments were made on Pan’s launch thread that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/dejavucoder/status/1840445397002543442?t=Tn--wZgbxhMe-db1Dmcxvg&amp;s=19"> X put a community note</a> on it that read: “Pear is a fork of Continue.dev, an open-source AI code editor. PearAI used Continue.dev’s code and mass-replaced all references to ‘Continue’ to ‘PearAI’ to mislead people into believing that they built this product on their own.”</p>

<p>This note wasn’t accurate, either. PearAI did say in some of its materials that the project was a clone (also known as a fork) of Continue as well as the original project that Continued used, VSCode. X subsequently removed that note.</p>

<p>Pan apologized for how hard it was to find that information, too. He said that one way he and his cofounder, Nang Ang, “screwed up, critically, was not being clear enough about this … doing so upon a fork of others’ work without many new features, and talking about it so publicly online, made it look like we were stealing the work of others as our own.”</p>


	
	


<p>On Sunday, Continue jumped in with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/continuedev/status/1840601490827989368">by posting</a> a subtle threat that it was “ecstatic to see the ecosystem that has formed around us. But open source can’t be taken for granted—it is a movement built on trust, and on respect for contributions, licenses, and intellectual property.”</p>

	
	


<p>Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan got involved, too. He defended PearAI with several <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/garrytan/status/1840490867280498873">tweets</a>. “Don’t understand why people are dragging a new project when literally it’s open source Apache license and that’s *the reason* why open source is awesome” one read. As you might imagine, people pointed out that it was changed to an Apache license after the uproar.</p>

<p>There were other reasons this project caught ire. Pan boasted how he “just quit my 270 000$ job at Coinbase” to do this startup, even though this was about as far from an original idea as a startup can get. In addition to Continue, another big competitor is Cursor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On top of that, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies?query=AI%20code%20editor">YC has funded two other AI code editors already, Void and Melty</a>, as the mob was quick to point out. To which Tan <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/garrytan/status/1840490996528029942">replied on X</a>, “More choice is good, people building is good, if you don’t like it don’t use it.”</p>

<p>Others criticized YC for selecting PearAI into its cohort at all. Blogger Sven Schnieders <a rel="nofollow" href="https://unfashionable.blog/p/yc/">wrote</a> that PearAI is an example of the “the decline of YC” because it accepted a company that is “nothing more than a codebase copied from another YC-backed company.”</p>

<p>On <a rel="nofollow" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41701265">Hacker News,</a> the site for programmers owned by YC, a commenter wrote that the debacle “says more about YC than this particular founder (lots of these types nowadays): i.e. their process, their due diligence.” Another wrote, “Is it typical for VC to just throw money at projects without any sort of oversight/auditing of, oh jeez, IDK, Licensing/Legal issues?”</p>

	
	


<p>YC’s plans to double from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/13/y-combinator-expanding-to-four-cohorts-a-year-in-2025/#:~:text=Silicon%20Valley%20startup%20accelerator%20Y,Thursday%2C%20and%20TechCrunch%20confirmed%20today.">two cohorts a year to four</a> isn’t likely to ease this perception, or this risk. </p>

<p>The whole uproar probably says as much about how eager all VCs are to fund AI startups as it does about YC’s love of this particular ilk of them.</p>

<p>Tan could not be immediately reached for comment. PearAI did not have further comment.</p>

<p>If you use Firefox and the uBlock Origin Lite content blocker from the Firefox Add-ons Store, be aware that the extension is no longer supported. Raymond Hill, the maker of the extension, pulled support and moved uBlock Origin Lite to self-hosting after multiple encounters with a "nonsensical and hostile" review process from the store review team.</p>

<p>It all started in early September when Mozilla flagged every version of the uBlock Origin Lite extension as violating its policies. Reviewers then claimed the extension apparently collected user data and contained "minified, concatenated or otherwise machine-generated code." The developer seemingly debunked those allegations, saying that "it takes only a few seconds for anyone who has even basic understanding of JavaScript to see the raised issues make no sense."</p>

<p>Raymond Hill <span>decided to drop the extension from the store and move it to a self-hosted version. This means that </span><span>those who want to continue using uBlock Origin Lite on Firefox should download the latest version <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home">from GitHub</a> (it can auto-update itself).</span></p>

                            <!-- PLACE THIS SECTION INSIDE OF YOUR BODY WHERE YOU WANT THE VIDEO PLAYER TO RENDER -->
            <p>The last message from the developer in a <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home/issues/197#issuecomment-2377395301">now-closed GitHub issue</a> shows an email from Mozilla admitting its fault and apologizing for the mistake. However, Raymond still pulled the extension from the Mozilla Add-ons Store, which means you can no longer find it on <a href="http://addons.mozilla.org/">addons.mozilla.org</a>.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that the original uBlock Origin for Firefox is still available and supported. The Lite version is a Manifest V3-based extension with a lighter and more efficient load on resources, such as processor and memory. Hill recently <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/ublock-origin-developer-recommends-switching-to-ublock-lite-as-chrome-flags-the-extension/">recommended switching to uBlockOrigin Lite</a> after Chrome started flagging the extension as unsupported (<a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/official-windows-registry-hack-extends-ublock-origin-support-on-google-chrome-edge/">there is a way to circumvent that</a>). Contrary to Chrome, Mozilla does not plan to drop the Manifest V2-based extensions in the near future, so uBlock Origin will continue to exist and work on Firefox and other browsers with MV2 support.</p>

<h3>Press Release</h3>


<p>26 September 2024</p>




<p>Astronomers have published a gigantic infrared map of the Milky Way containing more than 1.5 billion objects ― the most detailed one ever made. Using the European Southern Observatory’s VISTA telescope, the team monitored the central regions of our Galaxy over more than 13 years. At 500 terabytes of data, this is the largest observational project ever carried out with an ESO telescope.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“<em>We made so many discoveries, we have changed the view of our Galaxy forever,</em>” says Dante Minniti, an astrophysicist at Universidad Andrés Bello in Chile who led the overall project.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This record-breaking map comprises 200 000 images taken by ESO’s <a href="http://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/surveytelescopes/vista/">VISTA</a> ― the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy. Located at ESO’s <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/">Paranal Observatory</a> in Chile, the telescope’s main purpose is to map large areas of the sky. The team used VISTA’s infrared camera <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/surveytelescopes/vista/camera/">VIRCAM</a>, which can peer through the dust and gas that permeates our galaxy. It is therefore able to see the radiation from the Milky Way’s most hidden places, opening a unique window onto our galactic surroundings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This gigantic dataset <a href="#1">[1]</a> covers an area of the sky equivalent to 8600 full moons, and contains about 10 times more objects than <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/images/eso1242a/">a previous map released by the same team</a> back in 2012. It includes newborn stars, which are often embedded in dusty cocoons, and globular clusters –– dense groups of millions of the oldest stars in the Milky Way. Observing infrared light means VISTA can also spot very cold objects, which glow at these wavelengths, like brown dwarfs (‘failed’ stars that do not have sustained nuclear fusion) or free-floating planets that don’t orbit a star.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The observations began in 2010 and ended in the first half of 2023, spanning a total of 420 nights. By observing each patch of the sky many times, the team was able to not only determine the locations of these objects, but also track how they move and whether their brightness changes. They charted stars whose luminosity changes periodically that can be used as cosmic rulers for measuring distances <a href="#2">[2]</a>. This has given us an accurate 3D view of the inner regions of the Milky Way, which were previously hidden by dust. The researchers also tracked hypervelocity stars — fast-moving stars catapulted from the central region of the Milky Way after a close encounter with the supermassive black hole lurking there.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The new map contains data gathered as part of the VISTA Variables in the Vía Láctea (<a href="https://vvvsurvey.org/about/about-vvv/">VVV</a>) survey <a href="#3">[3]</a> and its companion project, the VVV eXtended (VVVX) survey. “<em>The project was a monumental effort, made possible because we were surrounded by a great team</em>,” says Roberto Saito, an astrophysicist at the Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina in Brazil and lead author of the paper published today in <em>Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics</em> on the completion of the project.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The VVV and VVVX surveys have already led to more than 300 scientific articles. With the surveys now complete, the scientific exploration of the gathered data will continue for decades to come. Meanwhile, ESO’s Paranal Observatory is being prepared for the future: VISTA will be updated with its new instrument <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/surveytelescopes/vista/4most/">4MOST</a> and ESO's Very Large Telescope (<a href="https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/vlt/">VLT</a>) will receive its <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/vlt/vlt-instr/moons/">MOONS</a> instrument. Together, they will provide <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/technology/spectroscopy/">spectra</a> of millions of the objects surveyed here, with countless discoveries to be expected.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3><p dir="ltr"><a name="1"></a>[1] The dataset is too large to release as a single image, but the processed data and objects catalogue can be accessed in the <a href="https://archive.eso.org/scienceportal/home">ESO Science Portal</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a name="2"></a>[2] One way to measure the distance to a star is by comparing how bright it appears as seen from Earth to how intrinsically bright it is; but the latter is often unknown. Certain types of stars change their brightness periodically, and there is a very strong connection between how quickly they do this and how intrinsically luminous they are. Measuring these fluctuations allows astronomers to work out how luminous these stars are, and therefore how far away they lie.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The European Southern Observatory (ESO) enables scientists worldwide to discover the secrets of the Universe for the benefit of all. We design, build and operate world-class observatories on the ground — which astronomers use to tackle exciting questions and spread the fascination of astronomy — and promote international collaboration for astronomy. Established as an intergovernmental organisation in 1962, today ESO is supported by 16 Member States (Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom), along with the host state of Chile and with Australia as a Strategic Partner. ESO’s headquarters and its visitor centre and planetarium, the ESO Supernova, are located close to Munich in Germany, while the Chilean Atacama Desert, a marvellous place with unique conditions to observe the sky, hosts our telescopes. ESO operates three observing sites: La Silla, Paranal and Chajnantor. At Paranal, ESO operates the Very Large Telescope and its Very Large Telescope Interferometer, as well as survey telescopes such as VISTA. Also at Paranal ESO will host and operate the Cherenkov Telescope Array South, the world’s largest and most sensitive gamma-ray observatory. Together with international partners, ESO operates ALMA on Chajnantor, a facility that observes the skies in the millimetre and submillimetre range. At Cerro Armazones, near Paranal, we are building “the world’s biggest eye on the sky” — ESO’s Extremely Large Telescope. From our offices in Santiago, Chile we support our operations in the country and engage with Chilean partners and society.&nbsp;</p>

This meme is so true.

<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GYxoao2XQAUSgto?format=jpg&amp;name=large" width="600px">

How can the boxed price of a game (or software) be the same as its Steam or digital version?

When you buy a game digitally, it never truly belongs to you; services like Steam or PS Store only allow you to download and play it.

20 years later, you can plug in your Atari cartridge and play, but you can’t be sure that Steam won’t go bankrupt and deactivate its servers. (Nintendo recently closed its shops, including for the 3DS, PSP servers are shut down, etc.)

Right now, if you want to feel nostalgic and buy and play Need for Speed Underground 2, there's nowhere you can do that because it’s abandonware, a forgotten software.

Thousands of people are dumping and archiving games, shows, and movies, trying to keep them accessible with their own means, while companies and lobbies label them as criminals.

Neither side is innocent—piracy is not theft, but let's admit, it is unfair. (I’m excluding small indie developers here as they are both affordable and individual creators.) The companies, with their excessive pricing, instead of selling their products once, turn them into SaaS with lifetime monthly subscriptions. They sell games for $60 and then add microtransactions, turning them into service games. Due to their greed, when things go wrong, they protect themselves and secretly keep the rights to leave you at a loss.

The streaming platforms, for which you pay full price, don’t even let you choose the quality of the movie you want to watch. What you watch today might disappear from all platforms in two months.

Without the people who dump and archive these contents, the old series you love so much could disappear forever.

We pay dozens of lira for five streaming platforms per month, yet they still force us to watch from hdfilmcehennemi.

Look, no one pirates music anymore—first thanks to the iTunes revolution and then Spotify. Pirated music is almost gone (you can check torrent sites’ seed ratios in music versus games and movies categories).

The reason for this is simple: these applications make you feel like the money you pay is truly worth it. You can access almost the entire world archive with a search, and at a really affordable price.

Because of reasons like this, the piracy problem is still not solved. The people who do it are content with their situation. Are they doing the right thing? No. But the companies whining about this should look at themselves before blaming the users.

                                        <p>PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Dockworkers at ports from Maine to Texas began walking picket lines early Tuesday in a strike over wages and automation that <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/longshoremen-strike-retailers-ports-holiday-d926e9cfb3f10efb50af89d3c96bdc3d">could reignite inflation and cause shortages</a></span> of goods if it goes on more than a few weeks.</p><p>The contract between the ports and about 45,000 members of the International Longshoremen’s Association expired at midnight, and even though progress was reported in talks on Monday, the workers went on strike. The strike affecting 36 ports is the first by the union since 1977. </p><p>Workers began picketing at the Port of Philadelphia shortly after midnight, walking in a circle at a rail crossing outside the port and chanting “No work without a fair contract.”</p><p>The union had message boards on the side of a truck reading: “Automation Hurts Families: ILA Stands For Job Protection.”</p><p>Local ILA president Boise Butler said workers want a fair contract that doesn’t allow automation of their jobs.</p>
    

<p>Shipping companies made billions during the pandemic by charging high prices, he said. “Now we want them to pay back. They’re going to pay back,” Butler said.</p><p>He said the union will strike for as long as it needs to get a fair deal, and it has leverage over the companies. </p>



<p>“This is not something that you start and you stop,” he said. “We’re not weak,” he added, pointing to the union’s importance to the nation’s economy</p><p>At Port Houston, at least 50 workers started picketing around midnight local time carrying signs saying “No Work Without a Fair Contract.” </p>
    
<p>The U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents the ports, said Monday evening that both sides had moved off of their previous wage offers. But no deal was reached.</p><p>The union’s opening offer in the talks was for <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/longshoremen-strike-pay-automation-ports-jobs-consumers-3aa66e0a05db25a49645fad404a5f000">a 77% pay raise</a></span> over the six-year life of the contract, with President Harold Daggett saying it’s necessary to make up for inflation and years of small raises. ILA members make a base salary of about $81,000 per year, but some can pull in over $200,000 annually with large amounts of overtime.</p>
    

<p>But Monday evening, the alliance said it had increased its offer to 50% raises over six years, and it pledged to keep limits on automation in place from the old contract. The union wants a complete ban on automation. It wasn’t clear just how far apart both sides are.</p><p>“We are hopeful that this could allow us to fully resume collective bargaining around the other outstanding issues in an effort to reach an agreement,” the alliance statement said.</p><p>In a statement early Tuesday, the union said it rejected the alliance’s latest proposal because it “fell far short of what ILA rank-and-file members are demanding in wages and protections against automation.” The two sides had not held formal negotiations since June.</p><p>“We are prepared to fight as long as necessary, to stay out on strike for whatever period of time it takes, to get the wages and protections against automation our ILA members deserve,” Daggett said in the statement. “They must now meet our demands for this strike to end.”</p><p>The alliance said its offer tripled employer contributions to retirement plans and strengthened health care options.</p>
    

<p>Supply chain experts say consumers won’t see an immediate impact from the strike because most retailers stocked up on goods, moving ahead shipments of holiday gift items. </p><p>But if it goes more than a few weeks, a work stoppage would significantly snarl the nation’s supply chain, potentially leading to higher prices and delays in goods reaching households and businesses. </p><p>If drawn out, the strike will force businesses to pay shippers for delays and cause some goods to arrive late for peak holiday shopping season — potentially <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/longshoremen-strike-ports-pay-consumers-automation-october-77289c12bf3c3eff5e42cb6372126576">impacting delivery of anything</a></span> from toys or artificial Christmas trees to cars, coffee and fruit.</p><p>The strike will likely have an almost immediate impact on supplies of perishable imports like bananas, for example. The ports affected by the strike handle 3.8 million metric tons of bananas each year, or 75% of the nation’s supply, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.</p><p>It also could snarl exports from East Coast ports and create traffic jams at ports on the West Coast, where workers are represented by a different union. Railroads say they can ramp up to carry more freight from the West Coast, but analysts say they can’t move enough to make up for the closed Eastern ports. </p>
    

<p>“If the strikes go ahead, they will cause enormous delays across the supply chain, a ripple effect which will no doubt roll into 2025 and cause chaos across the industry,” noted Jay Dhokia, founder of supply chain management and logistics firm Pro3PL. </p><p>J.P. Morgan estimated that a strike that shuts down East and Gulf coast ports could cost the economy $3.8 billion to $4.5 billion per day, with some of that recovered over time after normal operations resume.</p><p>The strike comes just weeks before the presidential election and could become a factor if there are shortages. Retailers, auto parts suppliers and produce importers had hoped for a settlement or that President Joe Biden would intervene and end the strike using the Taft-Hartley Act, which allows him to seek an 80-day cooling off period. </p>
    

<p>But during an exchange with reporters on Sunday, Biden, who has worked to court union votes for Democrats, said “no” when asked if he planned to intervene in the potential work stoppage.</p><p>A White House official said Monday that at Biden’s direction, the administration has been in regular communication with the ILA and the alliance to keep the negotiations moving forward. The president directed Chief of Staff Jeff Zients and National Economic Council Director Lael Brainard to convene the alliance’s board members Monday afternoon and urge them to resolve the dispute fairly and quickly — in a way that accounts for the success of shipping companies in recent years and contributions of union workers.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Krisher in reported from Detroit. Associated Press journalists Ben Finley in Norfolk, Virginia, Mae Anderson and Wyatte Grantham-Philips in New York, Dee-Ann Durbin in Detroit, Josh Boak in Washington, and Annie Mulligan in Houston contributed to this report.</p>

Political organizations do it all the time, if you get on a list you're never getting off. Lookup the numbers sending to you (Twilio's own lookup tool works great for this) and it almost always comes back Twilio/Zipwhip.</p><p>I only recommend responding STOP to short codes since there's more investment and vetting on getting a short code. Carriers will intercept the request for TFN/local numbers sometimes but I don't really trust it. These numbers are all going to be spammers buying pools of numbers to churn and burn. They'll just import their list into a new account if it unsubs.</p><p>Oh and btw, it's actually easier now as a spammer to tell when numbers get burned. A few years back when the CTIA handover on regs happened (and sending costs went up) the carriers finally started to respond with the delivery status of the sent messages. Before this they didn't respond and you only knew your provider delivered the messages to the carrier, not whether the carrier delivered them to the handset.</p></div></td></tr>

It has a built-in Google Assistant mode that screens unknown callers with a robot voice picking up and asking them to describe what they're calling about.

The only network requests for the receiver are to Apple. Quoting from a January 2021 Project Zero blog post⁽¹⁾ on BlastDoor:</p><p><i>As an example, consider what happens when a user sends a link to a website over iMessage. In that case, the sending device will first render a preview of the webpage and collect some metadata about it (such as the title and page description), then pack those fields into an NSKeyedArchiver archive. This archive is then encrypted with a temporary key and uploaded to the iCloud servers. Finally, the link as well as the decryption key are sent to the receiver as part of the iMessage. In order to create a useful user notification about the incoming iMessage, this data has to be processed by the receiver on a 0-click code path. As that again involves a fair amount of complexity, it is also done inside BlastDoor: after receiving the BlastDoor reply from above and realizing that the message contains an attachment, imagent first instructs IMTransferAgent to download and decrypt the iCloud attachment.</i></p><p>⁽¹⁾ <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/01/a-look-at-imessage-in-ios-14.html" rel="nofollow">https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/01/a-look-at-ime...</a></p></div></td></tr>

There's plenty of legal entities that still will call you. If you answer, be polite, play the dope a bit to get the necessary unfortunately, ask how they got the number, then request a manager (yes, they have one, they will tell you they don't. Be polite but insist). When you get the manager politely ask for the company details, then tell them to immediately remove you from their list. Their business can be shut down for violations so once they know you know, they take you seriously (FCC takes reports more seriously when more detailed). They'll probably hang up on you, this is okay. Report them anyways (do this legal or not. They can get their voip removed and whatever shell they're using. It's still annoying for them and they might remove you because you're not worth it)</p><p>Second, don't answer phone calls. It is a practice to call, listen for a voice, then log that number as active.</p><p>Text messages are more difficult. It depends on the service but you can probably text stop. The difficulty of blocking is that legit services will use the same number to text you verification codes (can we fucking kill sms 2FA‽)</p><p>You can also sign up for a relay service (I use Firefox, but use whatever). I do this for email and every website has a unique email. Things like + for Gmail don't work and are filtered. You can also do this for phone numbers but it's more expensive.</p><p>Fourth, aggressively unsubscribe, report to FCC, change settings on devices, and so on. Do this for your non-tech savvy friends and family. Get them to use services like signal that are privacy preserving, don't leak metadata, AND is easy enough Grandma can use. Install ublock origin into their browsers and some other privacy preserving stuff and edit settings. Get them to use Firefox instead of Chrome if you can.</p><p>You need to do this to others because they will leak your information (most of my information leak comes from my parents. I even get emails in their names...)</p><p>If you want to take a step further, get a scrubbing service like optery. There's a lot of shady shit so be careful who you pick.</p><p>Edit: you can do a similar thing for mail. There is a $5 processing fee. Sucks, but sadly it's junk mail that keeps the post office alive (do not put "return to sender" unless it's prepaid. You need to give a reason otherwise your postal worker is just being nice and throwing it away for you. Don't create more work for them)</p><p><a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-stop-junk-mail" rel="nofollow">https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-stop-junk-mail</a></p></div></td></tr>

I've been on DNC for decades and, thankfully I do not receive many bad calls at all, but it's difficult to say how much to attribute to DNC itself.</p><p>I receive, however, a fair measure of suspicious SMS, real-estate scams, political campaigns both legit and sus, and some pretty slick "USPS shipping" RCS phishing messages.</p><p>Now my Pixel Pro has a lot of spam protections and I need to leave them all completely disabled, because I routinely need to answer inbound voice calls from sketchy numbers, time-sensitive, because they could be a delivery driver or a taxi service.

It's locked to a single device with a single SIM. They can't be categorized, organized, tagged, forwarded, managed en masse, exported, or anything. To me it's a single-stream jumble of electronic jerks demanding my immediate attention and reactions over a most impersonal medium.

These are potentially seemingly commercial platforms for spammers. Note that Sinch owns Mailgun and Mailjet too and has a long documented history of legal trouble due to spamming. Businesses should avoid using these platforms because their own reputation and delivery will be affected by being mixed with spammers.</p></div></td></tr>

            As an epic fantasy painter, Boris Vallejo had a great influence on 1980s and 90s fantasy book covers, computer game box art, and the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demoscene</a>. Through the decades, his works have been replicated by pixel artists. This article features fantasy art history, demoscene drama, and a lot of pixel art fun creating a Boris Vallejo imitation graphic using only four colors.

            Recently, I was going through the historical results of the <a href="https://www.demoparty.net/revision" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Revision</a> demoparty, as you do. I was looking
            for a subject to draw for a new pixel art piece. I had learned to appreciate the color limitations during
            the old-school graphics competition at <a href="https://www.demoparty.net/evoke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evoke</a>, where we could only use a predefined color palette. The
            first time I submitted an entry in 2022, I hated it. The second time, in 2023, I came to accept the
            limited color palette as a problem to solve. And by 2024, I actually started to enjoy the challenge.
          </p>
          <p>I wanted to create a new piece outside of competition and was looking for inspiration.</p>
          <p>
            In the
            <a href="https://2013.revision-party.net/history/2013.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">results.txt</a>
            file of Revision 2013, I found an interesting phrase. Right above the list of results for the graphics
            competition, it said:

          <h2 id="vallejo-01">Whatever Happened to Boris Vallejo?</h2>
          <p>
            I hadn't thought of Peruvian artist <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Vallejo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boris Vallejo</a> in ages. I remembered his slick fantasy artwork,
            featuring idealistically rendered warriors and princesses, muscular and scantily clad (but not indecent).
            If they weren't battling monsters, the figures wouldn't look out of place in a romance novel. Vallejo's
            paintings were always beautifully done, but they're a bit out of fashion these days.
          </p>
          <p>

            <em> Boris Vallejo, "Dragon Riders", 1982 </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Pixel artists copied his work in the late 1980s and 1990s. Vallejo's visual aesthetic was one that many
            <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demoscene</a> groups sought to replicate or pay homage to on the new 16-bit platforms like the Commodore
            Amiga, the Atari ST, and the PC with its wonderful VGA graphics.
          </p>

          </p>

          <p>
            Vallejo's art was filled with heroic characters, often set in mythical or alien worlds, similar to the
            themes explored in many demoscene productions. Demos in the 1990s, especially on platforms like the Amiga,
            frequently featured surreal landscapes, epic narratives, and fantastical characters reminiscent of
            Vallejo's paintings.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was a time when I loved Vallejo's art. It was a fascinating blend of imagination and breathtaking
            realism, with vivid portrayals of fantasy worlds populated by powerful, heroic figures and fantastical
            creatures. Vallejo's mastery of anatomy and attention to detail brought his subjects to life. I used to
            feel a true sense of awe and wonder when looking at his paintings. Back then, I felt that his work struck
            a balance between strength and beauty, craftsmanship and adventure.

          <p>
            These days, I'm not so sure. I've grown older, and my tastes have changed. I still admire Vallejo's work,
            but now I find it a bit too slick, idealized, and repetitive. I've come to appreciate rougher, more
            abstract, and more experimental art styles.
          </p>
          <p>
            I looked up Boris Vallejo, and by all accounts, he is in his 80s, alive and well. He collaborates with his artist wife <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Bell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Julie
            Bell</a>, continues to produce and successfully sell their artwork online:
            <a href="https://www.borisjulie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">borisjulie.com</a>.</p>
          <p>Yet, while
            reminiscing about Vallejo's paintings, I realized I might have found a topic for a drawing.

            submitted by sceners on Demozoo are tagged with "boris-vallejo" though the tagging is probably not comprehensive. Given his significant influence on the demoscene,
            Boris Vallejo even has entries on both

            The other artist mentioned in the results.txt was the Japanese artist <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajime_Sorayama" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hajime Sorayama</a>. He is best known
            for his hyper-realistic erotic robots and cyborgs. His work explores the fusion of man and machine, often
            focusing on eroticism, fetishism, and the beauty of artificial forms. Sorayama rose to international fame
            in the 1980s and has influenced various fields, from fine art to commercial design, including
            contributions to film, music, and fashion. For the young men in the demoscene, this was a perfect
            combination.

            Over the years, Boris Vallejo and his long-time collaborator Julie Bell had other intersections with
            computers in the 1990s. They painted box art for computer and video games such as the fantasy role-playing
            game <em>Dragon Wars</em>, the platform shooter <em>Turrican</em>, the side-scrolling fantasy beat-'em-up
            <em>Golden Axe</em>, and the delightful underwater adventure <em>Ecco the Dolphin</em>. Here is a

          <p>
            Vallejo's influence on sceners was unquestionable. Below are more examples of Vallejo's artwork used in
            demoscene productions. Many of these artworks were digitized or scanned, which doesn't require any
            artistry. It's a cheap and easy way to get good graphics for a demo.

              Turtletronic could pull off this scan or capture because their slideshow uses Amiga's HAM mode that

            Scanned paintings are quite controversial in the scene. In a blog post by a scener called <em>Danny</em>,
            who used to work for the computer game company Eidos Interactive, he does not like the practice of using scanned images of paintings and then declaring them as your own work. But he also does not find critics great who condemn sceners who copy paintings but delare that they are copies. He even
            wrote that it is the main reason he left the scene and would no longer submit any graphics for
            competitions. His post,
            <a href="http://www.kameli.net/nocopy/disint.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disintegration Of The Old Graphics Scene</a>, is worth reading. He wrote it in 1998, making it a reflection of that time period in the demoscene.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some of <em>Danny's</em> arguments sound distressingly familiar nowadays in the context of AI-generated
            art. In his post, he wrote:
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>
              "There are quite a number of artists (even some famous ones that get much respect) that have practiced
              so long on making a scanned image look hand drawn, that their lame efforts have become almost
              undetectable. There is almost no way of telling if the image is created through blood, sweat, and tears,
              or the powers of modern-day technology.
            </em>
          </p>

<p><em>Danny</em> does not outright condemn or defend copying. He just does not fully discount its value in a hobbyist community like the demoscene as long as it is clear that a work is a reproduction of another work. This is for me the culmination of his text:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>
"My point is that everybody copies. Some do it to learn, others do it to grasp a bit of fame in a very challenging environment. It's not just the artists that copy, it's the whole bloody scene. And everyone that makes any form of art. Artists just get all the crap for it because it's easiest to spot."
</em>

            <em>The history of the Amiga demoscene is paved with Vallejo immitations.</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            Some graphics based on Vallejo paintings were actually pixel painted by the sceners, as can be seen in
            this article in
            <a href="https://www.editions64k.fr/product/demoscene-the-amiga-years-vol-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Demoscene: the Amiga Years. Volume 1 1984-1993</a>

            <em>The Éditions64K book features three pages about the process that Suny used to hand-pixel a recreation of a Vallejo painting on the Commodore Amiga.</em>
          </p>

<p>It is amazing how many demoscene pixel artists in the 1990s got their inspiration or motives from Boris Vallejo. <em>Suny</em> wrote in the Éditions64K book about the Amiga demoscene:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>
"My main influence was Boris Vallejo who seems to have inspired a lot of artists at the time. I then got interested in design, photography, painting and animation."
</em>
</blockquote>

<p>Then <em>Suny</em> went on to close out his section of the Éditions64K book with the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>
"With time, I realized I was not a real artist. I had rached a very good technical level and could reproduce an existing image perfectly. However, this is not the definition of an artist, and I am not super creative. This is why I became a Technical Artist in the video game industry, and now I am working at Apple."
</em>
</blockquote>

<p>This started out somewhat discouraging, but then we see that his meticulous reproductions of Vallejo’s work and other pixel art helped him find his strengths and discover new professional roles.</p>

            In a post on
            <a href="https://m.pouet.net/topic.php?which=9040&amp;page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pouet.net</a>,
            user <em>friol</em> asked what the point of re-drawing paintings by others actually is. He even
            specifically refered to sceners who copy Boris Vallejo's work:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <em>
              "Oh well... I knew the demoscene was ripping Boris Vallejo, but not that much (we are talking of at
              least of one hundred pictures). But while some pictures are... I would call them "re-elaborations",
              others are 1-1 copies.<p>
              
              What's the point of that?"
            </p></em>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Another user, <em>gaspode</em> replied to <em>friol's</em> post:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <em>
              "That's the dark side of the scene, I think. I can not understand why obviously talented people copy
              pictures nearly 1:1. Even if they were re-drawn or re-pixeled or whatever, they are still copys for me
              (because the idea, colors and structure was stolen). Other people apparently don't have problems with
              that but for me everytime I discover such a thing my respect for the copying artist decreases and first
              of all I cannot enjoy their future artworks anymore, cause I always think they could have been copied."
            </em>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            This opinion is well-supported by many sceners. User <em>ok3anos</em> pointed out that there is another
            side to copying artwork as long as the original artist gets credited:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <em>
              "Well, consider this: In painting, masters have always been copied by the apprentices to let them learn
              the basis techniques.<br>
              It does not disturb me at all to see pixel artists copying Boris Vallejo or others to increase their
              pixel technique as long as the original artist is credited in a way or another.<br>
              Would be more annoying if some of the works were just simple scans reworked a bit (which I suspect
              some...)</em>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            <em>ok3anos</em> reply can be interpreted as a defense of copying artwork as long as the scener remains
            honest. A link can be found in this thread on pouet that points to the
            <a href="http://www.kameli.net/nocopy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No-Copy site</a>. You can find a
            gallery of images created by sceners but copied from other artists. There are a lot of examples of swiped
            Vallejo art.
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://marincomics.com/img/vallejo/no-copy.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the No Copy website showing how a scener copied Vallejo's painting of a merman and a mermaid copulating"><br>
            <em>The <a href="http://www.kameli.net/nocopy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No-Copy</a> website. If we
              disregard for a moment that there are so many examples of swipes of Vallejo's merman and mermaid image,
              and look closely at this particular copy, then we can see that it looks like an actual painstaking
              recreation and not a scan (though this is only my personal feeling).</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            The first thing that strikes me, just looking at the swipes on the
            <a href="http://www.kameli.net/nocopy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No-Copy</a> site, is how often
            Vallejo's painting of the merman and the mermaid was copied. I never wanted to know what it looks like
            when merpeople have sex. The second thing that strikes me is that many of the graphics definitely look
            like full scans or collages of partial scans.
          </p>

          <p>
            Yet, I think some of them are not scans but incredible reproductions. If my suspicion is true, I
            personally believe it takes a lot of craft to reproduce a painting as pixel art with the comparatively low
            resolution and limited color palette of a Commodore Amiga or a PC with VGA graphics. The most commonly
            used graphics mode for a regular Amiga was 320 x 256 with 32 colors (or 64 colors if extra halfbrite mode
            was used). The later AGA chipset in the Amiga 1200 and 4000 had a graphics mode comparable to the PC's VGA
            graphics. When the <a href="http://www.kameli.net/nocopy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No-Copy</a> site
            was published in the second half of the 1990s, the most common VGA mode used for pixel graphics was 320 x
            200 with 256 colors, though some people used the higher resolution of 640 x 480, also with 256 colors. It
            takes patience and a lot of precision to copy Vallejo's art in a pixel paint program like
            <em>Deluxe Paint</em> or <em>Brilliance</em>.
          </p>

<p>My journey through Vallejo's influence on the demoscene brought me to the essay <a href="https://tarnkappe.info/jurassic-pack/an-original-picture-253480.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An Original Picture</a> written in 2007 by <em>Lars <a href="https://demozoo.org/sceners/10963/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghandy</a> Sobiraj</em>, the main editor of the longest running Amiga diskmag <a href="https://demozoo.org/productions/tagged/jurassic-pack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jurassic Pack</a>. He is very critical of pixel artists and graphicians who copy art or photos. He not only condemns scans but even folks who hand pixel their graphics based on someone else's paintings. He mentions a traditional, analog technique in which a grid is overlaid on both the original image and the drawing surface. This allows the copying artist to focus on replicating one small part at a time. This method ensured accurate proportions and alignment, helping the artist recreate the image in precise detail. However, he does not consider this technique to be high art.</p>

<p>Lars Sobiraj writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>
"The biggest shame with copied motives are the artists never telling others if it was copied or not. They just secretly hope not to be discovered by the scene police."
</em>
</blockquote>

<p>I actually support this statement. If you copy something, then make it clear that you are. This is the bile-filled finale of <em>Lars Sobiraj's</em> essay, like a curse upon copying artists (the spelling is unchanged from the original):</p>

<blockquote>
<em>
"Here is a last message from me: You took the express road for your success. But you are worthless peace of junk. No own fantasies, using grids, copying ideas. Damn lame. You will never develop yourself, and even if you get place #1 in the charts or by your scene friends, that is nothing compared to real life true graphicians based on the bigger world outside the scene.<p>
(b)lame yourself"
</p></em>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand the feeling of betrayal one might feel when confronted with artists who so obviously cheat. Yet I feel that this is also a bit too harsh.</p>

          <p>
            All that being said, I don't think copying Vallejo's art is reprehensible as long as you credit the
            original artist and learn something from the recreation, perhaps by altering it enough to make it
            distinct.
          </p>

<p>
Criticizing other artists for copying the works of Boris Vallejo becomes somewhat ironic when we consider Vallejo's own creative process. Vallejo often uses models and bodybuilders as references, photographing them in specific poses, and then using these images as a foundation for his paintings. In this way, imitation plays a significant role even in his artistic method.</p>

<p>However, what distinguishes Vallejo is his remarkable ability to synthesize and transform these real-life references into something new and beautiful through his extraordinary skill with paint and brush. His artistry lies not just in copying but in elevating these references into highly imaginative and dynamic works, blending realism with fantasy. This process shows that while imitation may be part of art, true creativity comes from how those references are interpreted and reimagined.

          <h2 id="vallejo-03">How I Learned Not To Worry And Love Color Limitations</h2>
 
          <p>
            I wanted to copy a Vallejo painting in my own style, using a super limited color palette. And, of course,
            I'd give credit to good ole Boris! But first, I need to wax poetic about the beauty of limited color
            palettes.
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://marincomics.com/img/vallejo/ochre-palette.jpg" alt="The four shades of ochre that I wanted to use for my recreation of a Vallejo painting"><br>
            <em>I chose to use only these four colors for my recreation of a Vallejo painting.</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            I used to paint pixel art on an Atari ST, which was limited to 16 colors on screen at the same time from a
            palette of 512 available shades. I always found this limiting and frustrating, especially considering that
            the Atari ST's main competitor, the Commodore Amiga, could display 32 and even 64 colors from 4,096
            available shades.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then, I started participating in graphics competitions at demoparties, using ridiculously limited six- to
            eight-color palettes. That's when I discovered an interesting challenge.
          </p>

          <p>
            There's something exciting about working within a limited color palette. I found that the constraints
            forced me to focus more on composition, shapes, and contrast. I had to make the most of the few colors I
            had.
          </p>

          <p>
            It might be unfair to call the limited color palette required for the Evoke graphics compo "old school"
            (or "old skool," if you're too cool for "school"). There are no restrictions on resolution, meaning I can
            use much higher resolutions than any retro "old school" machine was capable of. The results can look quite
            modern, and the style can be deliberately atmospheric due to the limited color palette.
          </p>

          <h2 id="vallejo-05">Drawing A Vallejo in Line Art and Four Colors</h2>

          <p>
            So I decided to challenge myself by limiting a drawing to four colors. As a callback to the old days of
            the demoscene, I used a Boris Vallejo painting as my model. I chose Vallejo's "Gillkarth's Odyssey (The
            Axe Man)" from 1998. I used Procreate on my iPad Pro with the Apple Pencil. I absolutely adore Procreate.
            It is a phenomenally frictionless and intuitive painting tool.
          </p>

          <p>
            I ended up quite happy with my copy of it as line art. After a few dead ends in coloring, I was also
            pleased with how it turned out using only four colors.
          </p>

                <em>Step 4</em>
              </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            There was one odd thing I only realized while making the drawing: I have no idea what the barbarian fellow
            in the center is swinging his axe at. It might be that he's trying to chop into the snake, which is
            actually facing away from him and minding its own business. Or maybe he's attacking the viewer of the
            image. It could even be that he's being influenced by the two demon-like creatures behind him to attack.
            In the original image, his eyes are red, as though he's possessed. To this day, I don't know what this
            person is up to.
          </p>

          <p>
            I actually only learned that he's <em>not</em> Conan after I had started the drawing. I asked on the
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ConanTheBarbarian/comments/1fribzp/when_did_boris_vallejo_paint_this_picture_of/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conan Reddit,</a>
            if anyone had more information about the painting, and I was quickly corrected. Reddit user <em>mattmirth</em> provided the real name of the paintin. And another user wrote: <em>"Every Boris Vallejo painting is Conan, he just doesn't know it. /s".</em> This comment got the most upvotes.
          </p>

          <p>
            I had a lot of fun drawing this piece. I learned a lot about working within color limitations and how to
            make the most of them. I also rekindled my appreciation for the art of Boris Vallejo. While I might not be
            a fan of his work anymore, I can see why he was so popular and influential. I understand why so many pixel
            artists copied his work.
          </p>

<p>Compatibility notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>this is a major “breaking” release that is not compatible with existing repos.</p>
<p>We tried to put all the necessary “breaking” changes into this release, so we
hopefully do not need another breaking release in the near future. The changes
were necessary for improved security, improved speed and parallelism,
unblocking future improvements, getting rid of legacy crap and design
limitations, having less and simpler code to maintain.</p>
<p>You can use “borg transfer” to transfer archives from borg 1.2/1.4 repos to
a new borg 2.0 repo, but it will need some time and space.</p>
<p>Before using “borg transfer”, you must have upgraded to borg &gt;= 1.2.6 (or
another borg version that was patched to fix CVE-2023-CVE-2023-36811) and
you must have followed the upgrade instructions at top of the change log
relating to manifest and archive TAMs (borg2 just requires these TAMs now).</p>
</li>
<li><p>command line syntax was changed, scripts and wrappers will need changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>you will usually either export BORG_REPO=&lt;MYREPO&gt; into your environment or
call borg like: “borg -r &lt;MYREPO&gt; &lt;COMMAND&gt;”.
in the docs, we usually omit “-r …” for brevity.</p></li>
<li><p>the scp-style REPO syntax was removed, please use <a href="ssh://">ssh://</a>…, #6697</p></li>
<li><p><a href="ssh://">ssh://</a> URLs: removed support for /~otheruser/, #6855.
If you used this, just replace it by: <a href="ssh://user@host:port/home/otheruser/">ssh://user@host:port/home/otheruser/</a></p></li>
<li><p>-P / --prefix option was removed, please use the similar -a / --match-archives.</p></li>
<li><p>archive names don’t need to be unique anymore. to the contrary:
it is now strongly recommended to use the identical name for borg create
within the same series of archives to make borg work more efficiently.
the name now identifies a series of archive, to identify a single archive
please use aid:&lt;archive-hash-prefix&gt;, e.g.: borg delete aid:d34db33f</p></li>
<li><p>the archive id is always given separately from the repository
(differently than with borg 1.x you must not give repo::archive).</p></li>
<li><p>the series name or archive id is either given as a positional parameter,
like:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>borg create documents ~/Documents</p></li>
<li><p>borg diff aid:deadbeef aid:d34db33f</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>or, if the command makes sense for an arbitrary amount of archives, archives
can be selected using a glob pattern, like:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>borg delete -a ‘sh:myarchive-2024-??-??’</p></li>
<li><p>borg recreate -a ‘sh:myarchive-2024-??-??’</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>some borg 1.x commands that supported working on a repo AND on an archive
were split into 2 commands, some others were renamed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>borg 2 repo commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>borg repo-create  # was: borg init</p></li>
<li><p>borg repo-list</p></li>
<li><p>borg repo-info</p></li>
<li><p>borg repo-delete</p></li>
<li><p>borg repo-compress</p></li>
<li><p>borg repo-space</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>borg 2 archive commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>borg create NAME …</p></li>
<li><p>borg list ID</p></li>
<li><p>borg extract ID …</p></li>

<li><p>removed --save-space option (does not change behaviour)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>removed --bypass-lock option</p></li>
<li><p>removed borg config command (only worked locally anyway)</p></li>
<li><p>using --list together with --progress is now disallowed (except with --log-json), #7219</p></li>
<li><p>the --glob-archives option was renamed to --match-archives (the short option
name -a is unchanged) and extended to support different pattern styles:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>id: for identical string match (this is the new default!)</p></li>
<li><p>sh: for shell pattern / globbing match (this was used by --glob-archives)</p></li>
<li><p>re: for regular expression match</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So you might need to edit your scripts like e.g.:</p>

</pre></div>
</li>
<li><p>use platformdirs 3.x.x instead of home-grown code. Due to that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>XDG_*_HOME is not honoured on macOS and on Windows.</p></li>
<li><p>BORG_BASE_DIR can still be used to enforce some base dir + .config/ or .cache/.</p></li>
<li><p>the default macOS config and cache dir will now be in ~/Library/Application Support/borg/.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>create: different included/excluded status chars, #7321</p>
<ul>
<li><p>dry-run: now uses “+” (was: “-”) and “-” (was: “x”) for included/excluded status</p></li>
<li><p>non-dry-run: now uses “-” (was: “x”) for excluded files</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Option --filter=… might need an update, if you filter for the status chars
that were changed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>borg is now more strict and disallows giving some options multiple times -
if that makes no sense. Highlander options, see #6269. That might make scripts
fail now that somehow “worked” before (but maybe didn’t work as intended due to
the contradicting options).</p></li>

<section id="version-2-0-0b11-2024-09-26">
<h2>Version 2.0.0b11 (2024-09-26)<a href="#version-2-0-0b11-2024-09-26" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Please note:</p>
<p>Beta releases are only for testing on NEW repos - do not use for production.</p>
<p>For upgrade and compatibility hints, please also read the section “Upgrade Notes”
above.</p>
<p>New features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Support rclone:// URLs for borg repositories.</p>
<p>This enables 70+ cloud storage products, including Amazon S3, Backblaze B2,
Ceph, Dropbox, ftp(s), Google Cloud Storage, Google Drive, Microsoft Azure,
Microsoft OneDrive, OpenStack Swift, pCloud, Seafile, sftp, SMB / CIFS and
WebDAV!</p>
<p>See <a href="https://rclone.org/">https://rclone.org/</a> for more details.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Parallel operations in same repo from same client (same user/machine).</p></li>
<li><p>Archive series feature, #7930.</p>
<p>TL;DR: a NAME now identifies a series of identically named archives,
to identify a specific single archive, use aid:&lt;archive hash&gt;.</p>
<p>in borg 1.x, we used to put a timestamp into the archive name, because borg1
required unique archive names.</p>
<p>borg2 does not require unique archive names, but it encourages you to even
use a identical archive names within the same SERIES of archives, e.g. you
could backup user files to archives named “user-files” and system files to
archives named “system-files”.
that makes matching (e.g. for prune, for the files cache, …) much simpler
and borg now KNOWS which archives belong to the same series (because they all
have the same name).</p>
</li>
<li><p>info/delete/prune: allow positional NAME argument, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>borg prune --keep-daily 30 &lt;seriesname&gt;</p></li>
<li><p>borg delete aid:&lt;archive hash&gt;</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>create: also archive inode number, #8362</p>
<p>Borg can use this when using archive series to rebuild the local files cache
from the previous archive (of the same series) in the repository.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Remove superfluous repository.list() call. for high latency repos
(like sftp, cloud), this improves performance of borg check and compact.</p></li>
<li><p>repository.list: refresh lock more frequently</p></li>
<li><p>misc. commands fixed for non-unique archive names</p></li>
<li><p>remote: allow get_manifest method</p></li>
<li><p>files cache: fix rare race condition with data loss potential, #3536</p></li>
<li><p>storelocking: misc. fixes / cleanups</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Other changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cache the chunks index in the repository, #8397.
Improves high latency repo performance for most commands compared to b10.</p></li>
<li><p>repo-compress: faster by using chunks index rather than repository.list().</p></li>
<li><p>Files cache entries now have both ctime AND mtime.</p></li>
<li><p>Borg updates the ctime and mtime of known and “unchanged” files, #4915.</p></li>
<li><p>Rebuild files cache from previous archive in same series, #8385.</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce RAM usage by splitting the files cache by archive series, #5658.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove AdHocCache, remove BORG_CACHE_IMPL (we only have one implementation).</p></li>
<li><p>Docs: user@ and :port are optional in sftp and ssh URLs.</p></li>
<li><p>CI: re-enable windows build after fixing it.</p></li>
<li><p>Upgrade pyinstaller to 6.10.0.</p></li>
<li><p>Increase IDS_PER_CHUNK, #6945.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 2.0.0b10 (2024-09-09)<a href="#version-2-0-0b10-2024-09-09" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>New features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>borgstore based repository, file:, ssh: and sftp: for now, more possible.</p></li>
<li><p>repository stores objects separately now, not using segment files.
this has more fs overhead, but needs much less I/O because no segment
files compaction is required anymore. also, no repository index is
needed anymore because we can directly find the objects by their ID.</p></li>
<li><p>locking: new borgstore based repository locking with automatic stale
lock removal (if lock does not get refreshed, if lock owner process is dead).</p></li>
<li><p>simultaneous repository access for many borg commands except check/compact.
the cache lock for adhocwithfiles is still exclusive though, so use
BORG_CACHE_IMPL=adhoc if you want to try that out using only 1 machine
and 1 user (that implementation doesn’t use a cache lock). When using
multiple client machines or users, it also works with the default cache.</p></li>
<li><p>delete/prune: much quicker now and can be undone.</p></li>
<li><p>check --repair --undelete-archives: bring archives back from the dead.</p></li>
<li><p>repo-space: manage reserved space in repository (avoid dead-end situation if
repository filesystem runs full).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Bugs/issues fixed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a lot! all linked from PR #8332.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Other changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>repository: remove transactions, solved differently and much simpler now
(convergence and write order primarily).</p></li>
<li><p>repository: replaced precise reference counting with “object exists in repo?”
and “garbage collection of unused objects”.</p></li>
<li><p>cache: remove transactions, remove chunks cache.
removed LocalCache, BORG_CACHE_IMPL=local, solving all related issues.
as in beta 9, adhowwithfiles is the default implementation.</p></li>
<li><p>compact: needs the borg key now (run it clientside), -v gives nice stats.</p></li>
<li><p>transfer: archive transfers from borg 1.x need the --from-borg1 option</p></li>
<li><p>check: reimplemented / bigger changes.</p></li>
<li><p>code: got rid of a metric ton of not needed complexity.
when borg does not need to read borg 1.x repos/archives anymore, after
users have transferred their archives, even much more can be removed.</p></li>
<li><p>docs: updated / removed outdated stuff</p></li>
<li><p>renamed r* commands to repo-*</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 2.0.0b9 (2024-07-20)<a href="#version-2-0-0b9-2024-07-20" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>New features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>add BORG_CACHE_IMPL, default is “adhocwithfiles” to test the new cache
implementation, featuring an adhoc non-persistent chunks cache and a
persistent files cache. See the docs for other values.</p>
<p>Requires to run “borg check --repair --archives-only” to delete orphaned
chunks before running “borg compact” to free space! These orphans are
expected due to the simplified refcounting with the AdHocFilesCache.</p>
</li>
<li><p>make BORG_EXIT_CODES=”modern” the default, #8110</p></li>
<li><p>add BORG_USE_CHUNKS_ARCHIVE env var, #8280</p></li>
<li><p>automatically rebuild cache on exception, #5213</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>fix Ctrl-C / SIGINT behaviour for pyinstaller-made binaries, #8155</p></li>
<li><p>delete: fix error handling with Ctrl-C</p></li>
<li><p>rcompress: fix error handling with Ctrl-C</p></li>
<li><p>delete: fix error handling when no archive is specified, #8256</p></li>
<li><p>setup.py: fix import error reporting for cythonize import, see #8208</p></li>

</ul>
<p>Other changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>setup.py: detect noexec build fs issue, see #8208</p></li>
<li><p>improve acl_get / acl_set error handling (forward port from 1.4-maint)</p></li>
<li><p>allow msgpack 1.1.0</p></li>
<li><p>vagrant: use pyinstaller 6.7.0</p></li>
<li><p>use Python 3.11.9 for binary builds</p></li>
<li><p>require Cython 3.0.3 at least, #8133</p></li>

<h2>Version 2.0.0b8 (2024-02-20)<a href="#version-2-0-0b8-2024-02-20" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>New features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>create: add the slashdot hack, update docs, #4685</p></li>
<li><p>BORG_EXIT_CODES=modern: optional more specific return codes (for errors and warnings).</p>
<p>The default value of this new environment variable is “legacy”, which should result in
a behaviour similar to borg 1.2 and older (only using rc 0, 1 and 2).
“modern” exit codes are much more specific (see the internals/frontends docs).</p>
</li>
<li><p>implement “borg version” (shows client and server version), #7829</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>docs: CVE-2023-36811 upgrade steps: consider checkpoint archives, #7802</p></li>
<li><p>check/compact: fix spurious reappearance of orphan chunks since borg 1.2, #6687 -
this consists of 2 fixes:</p>
<ul>

<li><p>for newly created chunks: update shadow index when doing a double-put, #7896 #5661</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have experienced issue #6687, you may want to run borg check --repair
after upgrading to borg 1.2.7 to recreate the shadow index and get rid of the
issue for existing chunks.</p>

<h2>Version 2.0.0a3 (2022-07-04)<a href="#version-2-0-0a3-2022-07-04" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>check repo version, accept old repos only for --other-repo (e.g. rcreate/transfer).
v2 is the default repo version for borg 2.0. v1 repos must only be used in a
read-only way, e.g. for --other-repo=V1_REPO with borg init and borg transfer!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>New features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>transfer: --upgrader=NoOp is the default.
This is to support general-purpose transfer of archives between related borg2
repos.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>split repo and archive name into separate args, #948</p>
<ul>
<li><p>use -r or --repo or BORG_REPO env var to give the repository</p></li>

Item.chunks)</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>symmetric hlid (all hardlinks pointing to same inode have same hlid)</p></li>
<li><p>all archived hardlinked regular files have a chunks list</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>borg rcreate --other-repo=OTHER_REPO: reuse key material from OTHER_REPO, #6554.
This is useful if you want to use borg transfer to transfer archives from an
existing borg 1.1/1.2 repo. If the chunker secret and the id key and algorithm
stay the same, the deduplication will also work between past and future backups.</p></li>
<li><p>borg transfer:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>efficiently copy archives from a borg 1.1/1.2 repo to a new repo.

<p>Although this was released as 1.3.0a1, it can be also seen as 2.0.0a1 as it was
later decided to do breaking changes and thus the major release number had to
be increased (thus, there will not be a 1.3.0 release, but 2.0.0).</p>
<p>New features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>init: new --encryption=(repokey|keyfile)-[blake2-](aes-ocb|chacha20-poly1305)</p>

<li><p>New AEAD cipher suites: AES-OCB and CHACHA20-POLY1305.</p></li>
<li><p>Session keys are derived via HKDF from random session id and master key.</p></li>
<li><p>Nonces/MessageIVs are counters starting from 0 for each session.</p></li>
<li><p>AAD: chunk id, key type, messageIV, sessionID are now authenticated also.</p></li>
<li><p>Solves the potential AES-CTR mode counter management issues of the legacy crypto.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>init: --key-algorithm=argon2 (new default KDF, older pbkdf2 also still available)</p>
<p>borg key change-passphrase / change-location keeps the key algorithm unchanged.</p>
</li>
<li><p>key change-algorithm: to upgrade existing keys to argon2 or downgrade to pbkdf2.</p>
<p>We recommend you to upgrade unless you have to keep the key compatible with older versions of borg.</p>
</li>
<li><p>key change-location: usable for repokey &lt;-&gt; keyfile location change</p></li>
<li><p>benchmark cpu: display benchmarks of cpu bound stuff</p></li>

   <p>A tiny town in North Carolina that’s just been devastated by hurricane Helene could end up severely disrupting the global supply chain for microchips and solar panels.</p>   <p>Nestled in the Appalachian mountains, the community of Spruce Pine, population 2,194, is known for its hiking, local artists and as America’s sole source of high-purity quartz. Helene dumped more than 2 feet of rain on the town, destroying roads, shops and cutting power and water.</p>   <p>But its reach will likely be felt far beyond the small community.</p>   <p>Semiconductors are the brains of every computer-chip-enabled device, and solar panels are a key part of the global push to combat climate change. To make both semiconductors and solar panels, companies need crucibles and other equipment that both can withstand extraordinarily high heat and be kept absolutely clean. One material fits the bill: quartz. Pure quartz.</p>   
   <p>Quartz that comes, overwhelmingly, from Spruce Pine.</p>   <p>“As far as we know, there’s only a few places in the world that have ultra-high-quality quartz,” according to Ed Conway, author of <em>Material World: The Six Raw Materials That Shape Modern Civilization. </em>Russia and Brazil also supply high-quality quartz, he says, but<em> </em>“Spruce Pine has far and away the [largest amount] and highest quality.”</p>   <p>Conway says without super-pure quartz for the crucibles, which can often be used only a single time, it would be impossible to produce most semiconductors.</p>   <p>“Purity really does matter,” he says. “You're talking about a process to create the silicon wafers that later become silicon chips, where one single atom being in the wrong place” could derail production.</p>   <p>Companies have been pursuing artificial substitutes, but so far, those alternatives can't satisfy the world’s demand for this pure quartz.</p>   <p>According to an annual report from TECHCET, a market research firm, quartz equipment is a $2.12 billion industry <a href="https://techcet.com/semiconductor-quartz-equipment-components-forecast/"><u>and growing</u></a>.</p>   <p>What's unfolding in Spruce Pine isn't just a local emergency. Like many climate disasters, it has economic costs that could ripple around the world.<br></p>   <h3>Helene devastates town</h3>   <p>Spruce Pine received <a href="https://climate.ncsu.edu/blog/2024/09/rapid-reaction-historic-flooding-follows-helene-in-western-nc/"><u>24.12 inches of rain from Helene</u></a>, according to the National Weather Service. The massive inundation caused the North Toe River to flood, devastating the downtown area, according to Spencer Bost, the executive director of <a href="https://www.discoversprucepinenc.com/"><u>Downtown Spruce Pine</u></a>, the local business development association.</p>   
   <p>“It’s flooded up to the awnings, about 10 feet,” he says of the downtown’s lower street. “Lower street was destroyed.”</p>   <p>The town’s grocery store was also heavily damaged in the flooding. Power, water and cellular service are all down, Bost says. Fallen trees and washed-out roads have left the community isolated from the outside.</p>   <p>“We were there for about three days before we got enough chainsaws together to cut a path out of our neighborhood,” Bost says. He and his fiancée spent nine hours working their way to Greenville, N.C., where they’ve temporarily sought shelter.</p>   <p>The conditions at the mines that produce the quartz remain unclear. “We are in a phase of assessing the situation, and it is far too early to comment on the impact to high-purity quartz production,” Mary Kristin Haugen of the <a href="https://www.thequartzcorp.com/">Quartz Corporation</a> told NPR in a statement.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-25638">

   <p>A second major supplier, <a href="https://www.sibelco.com/en">Sibelco</a>, based in Antwerp, Belgium, told NPR its operations had also been disrupted since Sept. 26. "We are working closely with our local team to safely restart operations as soon as we can and are actively coordinating with local authorities and other partners to manage the situation," the company said in an e-mailed statement.</p>   <p>Images verified by NPR show that even if the mines are intact, getting quartz out of the region may be a challenge. The main CSX rail line in and out of Spruce Pine runs along the North Toe River and has been heavily damaged. The rail line was the primary shipping point for quartz from the mines.<br></p>   <h3>Fallout will depend on how long disruption lasts</h3>   <p>Conway says he believes chipmakers have stocks of ultra-pure quartz that would prevent a short-term supply chain disruption from hobbling production, but he adds that if Spruce Pine remains cut off from the rest of the world for long, it could have a big impact.</p>   
   <p>Previous disruptions to superconductor supply chains, from earthquakes to fires, have sent ripple effects across the many industries that rely on chips for their products and operations. A 2008 fire at a quartz refinery in Spruce Pine <a href="https://www.globalriskintel.com/insights/connecting-sand-mining-and-high-tech-industry"><u>impacted the market</u></a>.</p>   <p>Likewise, solar expert Johannes Bernreuter, head of Bernreuter Research says that if a disruption went on for “more than a few weeks,” it would “pose a serious problem for the production” of silicon ingots needed in the photovoltaic, or PV, industry.</p>   <p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/06/1013266774/how-did-china-become-the-worlds-dominant-polysilicon-producer"><u>China is the major producer of solar panels</u></a>, and it relies heavily on imports of high-quality quartz from Spruce Pine, he says.</p>   <p>Lita Shon-Roy, the president and CEO of market research firm TECHCET, has been tracking the supply chain for semiconductors for two decades. She says it’s amazing that the industry hasn’t been more concerned about the vulnerability created from relying on this one region of North Carolina for a crucial material.</p>   <p>“Every time I’ve asked in the last two decades, the question always comes back, ‘Well, where else are we supposed to get it?’ “ she says.</p>   <p>The United States and China are in a global competition to secure access to raw materials for semiconductors and green technology. Frantic searches are underway for new deposits and new methods, across a range of minerals.</p>   <p>But when it comes to pure quartz?</p>   <p>“I haven’t heard of any viable sources yet to replace what’s in North Carolina,” Shon-Roy says.</p>   <p><em>NPR's Michael Copley contributed to this report.</em></p>

However, Apple recently dropped out of the talks for reasons that remain unclear. The funding round is set to close this week.</p>
<p>The development comes just a month after <em>WSJ</em> reported that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/29/apple-reportedly-in-talks-to-invest-in-openai/">considering an investment in OpenAI</a> as part of a fundraising effort that could value the AI company at over $100 billion. The high valuation reflects the intense competition in the artificial intelligence sector that OpenAI helped ignite with ChatGPT's launch in late 2022.</p>
<p>While Apple has stepped away, other major tech companies remain involved. Microsoft, which has already invested $13 billion in OpenAI, is expected to contribute about $1 billion to this latest round. Nvidia is also reportedly in talks to participate.</p>
<p>The news of Apple's withdrawal may surprise some, given the company's recent moves in the AI space. Apple previously announced plans to integrate ChatGPT into Siri on iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia later this year. This integration will allow Siri to display ChatGPT responses directly with user permission. However, recent reports of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/open-ai-division-for-profit-da26c24b">turmoil within OpenAI's ranks</a> as it pursues a for-profit structure, may have factored into Apple's decision not to pursue the investment.</p>
<p>That said, Apple's planned ChatGPT integration for its platforms is still expected to proceed before the end of the year. The company has said that iPhone, iPad, and Mac users will be able to use ChatGPT for free without creating an account, while ChatGPT Plus subscribers will be able to access paid features on Apple devices.</p>
