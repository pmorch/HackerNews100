Lynch moved to Los Angeles in 1971 and studied film-making at the AFI Conservatory, where he began filming his first feature Eraserhead. Finally finishing it in 1976, the surreal black-and-white fable was received largely with bafflement, and rejected from most film festivals, but in the late 70s became something of a success on the late-night “midnight movie” circuit.</p><p>Eraserhead’s impact led to an offer from Mel Brooks’ production company to direct The Elephant Man; starring John Hurt in a biopic of Joseph Merrick, the film about the disfigured 19th-century man was nominated for eight Oscars and secured Lynch’s Hollywood status. After turning down an offer to direct Return of the Jedi, Lynch agreed to make an adaptation of Frank Herbert’s epic sci-fi novel Dune, but the film was substantially recut in postproduction and proved a commercial and critical disaster. Instead of a planned Dune sequel, Lynch decided to make a more personal film: his dark noir thriller Blue Velvet was a cult hit and a hugely influential critical success on its release in 1986, and it resulted in Lynch’s second best director Oscar nomination.</p><figure id="b50137f3-9b52-4019-804e-656b5f5888a3" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e946c39cc828e8fe73236d2370ed3462f231785/20_20_2422_1600/master/2422.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e946c39cc828e8fe73236d2370ed3462f231785/20_20_2422_1600/master/2422.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e946c39cc828e8fe73236d2370ed3462f231785/20_20_2422_1600/master/2422.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e946c39cc828e8fe73236d2370ed3462f231785/20_20_2422_1600/master/2422.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e946c39cc828e8fe73236d2370ed3462f231785/20_20_2422_1600/master/2422.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e946c39cc828e8fe73236d2370ed3462f231785/20_20_2422_1600/master/2422.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="David Lynch at Cannes film festival, 2002." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e946c39cc828e8fe73236d2370ed3462f231785/20_20_2422_1600/master/2422.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="293.9719240297275" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>David Lynch at Cannes film festival, 2002.</span> Photograph: Pool BENAINOUS/DUCLOS/Gamma-Rapho/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Lynch then embarked on another noirish project, the opaque and surreal murder-mystery Twin Peaks that – unusually for notable film directors of the period – was envisioned as a TV series; Lynch developed it with former Hill Street Blues writer Mark Frost. A mix of small town comedy, police procedural and surreal dreamworld, and described as “the most hauntingly original work ever done for American TV”, Twin Peaks defied early predictions of failure on its broadcast in 1990; as a pioneer of “high-end TV” it is arguably Lynch’s most influential work.

A noir-style mystery drama, it was another big critical success, secured Lynch a third best director Oscar nomination and in 2016 was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/23/mulholland-drive-david-lynch-21st-century-top-films-bbc-poll" data-link-name="in body link">voted the best film of the 21st century</a>. Lynch followed it in 2006 with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/mar/09/thriller" data-link-name="in body link">three-hour surreal thriller Inland Empire</a>, shot on video and starring Dern as an American movie star who appears to mysteriously transport into the Polish original of a film she is working on.</p><p>Thereafter Lynch appeared to step back from feature films, with only the third series of Twin Peaks in 2017 representing a big film-making project, although reports suggest he had been working on a series for Netflix. Lynch took acting roles in other people’s work, most notably as Gus the Bartender in Seth MacFarlane’s The Cleveland Show, and as legendary director John Ford in Steven Spielberg’s loosely autobiographical 2022 movie The Fabelmans.</p><p>Lynch was married four times and had a long-term relationship with his Blue Velvet star Isabella Rossellini.</p></div></div>]]></description>

                    <p>Git is hard: screwing up is easy, and figuring out how to fix your mistakes is fucking impossible. Git documentation has this chicken and egg problem where you can't search for how to get yourself out of a mess, <em>unless you already know the name of the thing you need to know about</em> in order to fix your problem.</p>

<p>So here are some bad situations I've gotten myself into, and how I eventually got myself out of them <em>in plain english</em>.</p>

                </section>

                
                
                    <section>
                        <h2><a href="#magic-time-machine" id="magic-time-machine">Oh shit, I did something terribly wrong, please tell me git has a magic time machine!?!</a></h2>
                        <pre><code>git reflog
# you will see a list of every thing you've 
# done in git, across all branches!
# each one has an index HEAD@{index}
# find the one before you broke everything
git reset HEAD@{index}
# magic time machine
</code></pre>
<p>You can use this to get back stuff you accidentally deleted, or just to remove some stuff you tried that broke the repo, or to recover after a bad merge, or just to go back to a time when things actually worked. I use <code>reflog</code> A LOT. Mega hat tip to the many many many many many people who suggested adding it!</p>

                    </section>
                
                    <section>
                        <h2><a href="#change-last-commit" id="change-last-commit">Oh shit, I committed and immediately realized I need to make one small change!</a></h2>
                        <pre><code># make your change
git add . # or add individual files
git commit --amend --no-edit
# now your last commit contains that change!
# WARNING: never amend public commits
</code></pre>
<p>This usually happens to me if I commit, then run tests/linters... and FML, I didn't put a space after an equals sign. You could also make the change as a new commit and then do <code>rebase -i</code> in order to squash them both together, but this is about a million times faster.</p>
<p><em>Warning: You should never amend commits that have been pushed up to a public/shared branch! Only amend commits that only exist in your local copy or you're gonna have a bad time.</em></p>

                    </section>
                
                    <section>
                        <h2><a href="#change-last-commit-message" id="change-last-commit-message">Oh shit, I need to change the message on my last commit!</a></h2>
                        <pre><code>git commit --amend
# follow prompts to change the commit message
</code></pre>
<p>Stupid commit message formatting requirements.</p>

                    </section>
                
                    <section>
                        <h2><a href="#accidental-commit-master" id="accidental-commit-master">Oh shit, I accidentally committed something to master that should have been on a brand new branch!</a></h2>
                        <pre><code># create a new branch from the current state of master
git branch some-new-branch-name
# remove the last commit from the master branch
git reset HEAD~ --hard
git checkout some-new-branch-name
# your commit lives in this branch now :)
</code></pre>
<p>Note: this doesn't work if you've already pushed the commit to a public/shared branch, and if you tried other things first, you might need to <code>git reset HEAD@{number-of-commits-back}</code> instead of <code>HEAD~</code>. Infinite sadness. Also, many many many people suggested an awesome way to make this shorter that I didn't know myself. Thank you all!</p>

                        <pre><code># undo the last commit, but leave the changes available
git reset HEAD~ --soft

# move to the correct branch
git checkout name-of-the-correct-branch
git stash pop
git add . # or add individual files
git commit -m "your message here";
# now your changes are on the correct branch
</code></pre>
<p>A lot of people have suggested using <code>cherry-pick</code> for this situation too, so take your pick on whatever one makes the most sense to you!</p>
<pre><code>git checkout name-of-the-correct-branch
# grab the last commit to master
git cherry-pick master
# delete it from master
git checkout master
git reset HEAD~ --hard
</code></pre>

                        <h2><a href="#dude-wheres-my-diff" id="dude-wheres-my-diff">Oh shit, I tried to run a diff but nothing happened?!</a></h2>
                        <p>If you know that you made changes to files, but <code>diff</code> is empty, you probably <code>add</code>-ed your files to staging and you need to use a special flag.</p>
<pre><code>git diff --staged
</code></pre>
<p>File under ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ (yes, I know this is a feature, not a bug, but it's fucking baffling and non-obvious the first time it happens to you!)</p>

                        <h2><a href="#undo-a-commit" id="undo-a-commit">Oh shit, I need to undo a commit from like 5 commits ago!</a></h2>
                        <pre><code># find the commit you need to undo
git log
# use the arrow keys to scroll up and down in history
# once you've found your commit, save the hash
git revert [saved hash]
# git will create a new commit that undoes that commit
# follow prompts to edit the commit message 
# or just save and commit
</code></pre>
<p>Turns out you don't have to track down and copy-paste the old file contents into the existing file in order to undo changes! If you committed a bug, you can undo the commit all in one go with <code>revert</code>.</p>
<p>You can also revert a single file instead of a full commit! But of course, in true git fashion, it's a completely different set of fucking commands...</p>

                    </section>
                
                    <section>
                        <h2><a href="#undo-a-file" id="undo-a-file">Oh shit, I need to undo my changes to a file!</a></h2>
                        <pre><code># find a hash for a commit before the file was changed
git log
# use the arrow keys to scroll up and down in history
# once you've found your commit, save the hash
git checkout [saved hash] -- path/to/file
# the old version of the file will be in your index
git commit -m "Wow, you don't have to copy-paste to undo"
</code></pre>
<p>When I finally figured this out it was HUGE. HUGE. H-U-G-E. But seriously though, on what fucking planet does <code>checkout --</code> make sense as the best way to undo a file? :shakes-fist-at-linus-torvalds:</p>

                    </section>

                        <h2><a href="#fuck-this-noise" id="fuck-this-noise">Fuck this noise, I give up.</a></h2>
                        <pre><code>cd ..
sudo rm -r fucking-git-repo-dir
git clone https://some.github.url/fucking-git-repo-dir.git
cd fucking-git-repo-dir
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks to Eric V. for this one. All complaints about the use of <code>sudo</code> in this joke can be directed to him.</p>
<p>For real though, if your branch is sooo borked that you need to reset the state of your repo to be the same as the remote repo in a "git-approved" way, try this, but beware these are destructive and unrecoverable actions!</p>
<pre><code># get the lastest state of origin
git fetch origin
git checkout master
git reset --hard origin/master
# delete untracked files and directories
git clean -d --force
# repeat checkout/reset/clean for each borked branch
</code></pre>

And yes, there are other ways to do these same things with more theoretical purity or whatever, but I've come to these steps through trial and error and lots of swearing and table flipping, and I had this crazy idea to share them with a healthy dose of levity and profanity. Take it or leave it as you will!</p>

	Director-writer <a href="https://variety.com/t/david-lynch/" id="auto-tag_david-lynch" data-tag="david-lynch">David Lynch</a>, who radicalized American film with with a dark, surrealistic artistic vision in films like “<a href="https://variety.com/t/blue-velvet/" id="auto-tag_blue-velvet" data-tag="blue-velvet">Blue Velvet</a>” and “Mulholland Drive” and network television with “<a href="https://variety.com/t/twin-peaks/" id="auto-tag_twin-peaks" data-tag="twin-peaks">Twin Peaks</a>,” has died. He was 78.</p>



<p>
	Lynch revealed in 2024 that he had been diagnosed with emphysema after a lifetime of smoking, and would likely not be able to leave his house to direct any longer. His family announced his death in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/davidlynchofficial/posts/pfbid04LuZED6SrWevszQ1UZoEED6x95znKc7scJxXFL5B1icBKgCiu4T2qYLHsErFNzELl?rdid=581XjlBlb3GqM8zP#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Facebook post</a>, writing, “There’s a big hole in the world now that he’s no longer with us. But, as he would say, ‘Keep your eye on the donut and not on the hole.'”</p>



<p>
	The “Twin Peaks” TV show and films such as “Blue Velvet,” “Lost Highway” and “Mulholland Drive” melded elements of horror, film noir, the whodunit and classical European surrealism. Lynch wove tales, not unlike those of his Spanish predecessor Luis Bunuel, which proceeded with their own impenetrable logic.

<p>
	A four-time Oscar nominee, Lynch received an honorary Oscar for lifetime achievement in 2020.</p>



<p>
	After years spent as a painter and a maker of short animated and live action films, Lynch burst onto the scene with his 1977 feature debut “Eraserhead,” a horrific, black-humored work that became a disturbing fixture on the midnight movie circuit. His outré and uncompromising style quickly won the attention of the Hollywood and international movie-making establishment.</p>



<p>
	He was hired by Mel Brooks’ production company to write and direct “The Elephant Man,” a deeply affecting drama about a horrifically deformed sideshow freak in Victorian England who became a national celebrity. The feature captured eight Academy Award nominations, including Lynch’s first for best director.</p>



<p>
	He found less success with his 1984 adaptation of Frank Herbert’s sprawling science fiction novel “Dune.” The production, made on a budget of $40 million during an arduous three-year shoot, was a colossal box office flop.</p>



<p>
	However, Lynch rebounded from the disaster with two films that defined his mature style: “Blue Velvet” (1986), a frightening hellride through the psychosexual underbelly of a small American town, and the sexed-up, violent road movie “Wild at Heart” (1990), which was honored with the Cannes Film Festival’s Palme d’Or.</p>



<p>
	In 1990, he revolutionized American episodic TV with “Twin Peaks,” a series he created with writer Mark Frost. With action springing from the investigation of a high school girl’s mysterious murder in a Washington lumber mill town, the weekly ABC show plumbed disquieting, theretofore taboo subject matter and made the inexplicable a fixture of modern narrative television.

	</p>




<p>
	A major hit in its first season, “Twin Peaks” lost its momentum and ultimately its audience in year two. However, it spawned a feature-length prequel, 1992’s over-the-top “Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me”; 25 years later, the ongoing affection of a loyal cult of viewers sparked a limited-run third season for Showtime that picked up where the second season left off.</p>



<p>
	Later in his career, in such features as “Lost Highway” (1997), “Mulholland Drive” (which won him the best director award at Cannes in 2001) and “Inland Empire” (2006), Lynch flexed a super-heated style that pivoted on plots emphasizing doubled personalities, unexplained transformations and shocking acts of violence. The quiet yet quirky “The Straight Story” (1999) harkened back to the more reserved emotional pull of “The Elephant Man.”</p>



<p>
	The director himself was consistently reticent about sorting the meaning of his work for his viewers. In the book-length collection of interviews “Lynch On Lynch” (2005), he addressed the enigmatic core of his work with writer Chris Rodley.</p>



<p>
	“Well,” Lynch said, “imagine if you did find a book of riddles, and you could start unraveling them, but they were really complicated. Mysteries would become apparent and thrill you. We all find this book of riddles and it’s just what’s going on. And you can figure them out. The problem is, you figure them out inside yourself, and even if you told somebody, they wouldn’t believe you or understand it in the same way you do.”</p>



<p>
	In addition to his honorary Oscar, Lynch’s one-of-a-kind career was acknowledged by a special award (shared with his frequent star Laura Dern) at the 2007 Independent Spirit Awards and a Golden Lion at the 2006 Venice Film Festival.</p>



<p>
	He was born Jan. 20, 1946, in Missoula, Montana. His father was a research scientist for the Department of Agriculture, and his peripatetic family lived in the plains states, the Pacific Northwest and the Southeast before settling in Alexandria, Virginia, where Lynch attended high school.</p>



<p>
	An indifferent student, Lynch focused on painting. A one-year stay at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and an abortive trip to Europe with his friend Jack Fisk (later a noted Hollywood production designer) were succeeded by his enrollment at Philadelphia’s Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in 1965.

	</p>




<p>
	Living in a forbidding Philly neighborhood with his first wife and infant daughter Jennifer (later a director herself), Lynch began to dabble in film, directing the animated shorts “Six Men Getting Sick (Six Times)” and “The Alphabet” (1968).</p>



<p>
	“The Grandmother” (1970), a combination of animation and live action, was filmed with money obtained from a grant by the newly founded American Film Institute. In 1971, Lynch moved to Los Angeles to study filmmaking at the AFI’s Conservatory for Advanced Film Studies, headquartered in the former Doheny mansion in Beverly Hills.</p>



<p>
	Beginning in 1972, Lynch began work on a feature at the AFI. Inspired by his bleak years as a print engraver and struggling artist in Philadelphia, a 21-page initial script began to take shape; Lynch would later say he had no memory of writing it. Over the course of the next five years, he made the film with several collaborators who would remain constants in his career, including sound designer Alan Splet, cinematographer Frederick Elmes and actor Jack Nance.</p>



<p>
	Shot laboriously, cheaply and on the fly for five years, “Eraserhead” was released by indie distributor Libra Films International in 1977. The disquieting black-and-white film followed the psychological descent of its maladroit hero Henry Spencer (Nance) after the birth of his monstrously malformed baby.</p>



<p>
	Critics were decidedly alarmed by the picture when it premiered at L.A.’s Filmex in 1977, but it took on a commercial life of its own when Libra opened the picture at midnight screenings in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Lynch would frequently appear at L.A. screenings, admonishing his mystified audiences, “Don’t ask about the baby.”</p>



<p>
	One enthusiastic viewer at a midnight show at L.A.’s Nuart Theatre was Stuart Cornfeld, a producer at Mel Brooks’ Brooksfilms. He urged Brooks to employ Lynch, and, after viewing “Eraserhead,” Brooks offered the director a job.</p>



<p>
	For his project, Lynch took on the story of John Merrick, whose sensational life story had already inspired Bernard Pomerance’s hit 1977 play. The film version of “The Elephant Man” was an entirely new enterprise, co-written by Lynch and starring a heavily made-up John Hurt as the sensitive Merrick, Anthony Hopkins as the London Hospital surgeon who became his guardian, and Brooks’ wife Anne Bancroft as a sympathetic West End stage star.

	</p>




<p>
	“The Elephant Man” had a powerful emotional impact, and became a box office and critical hit; Lynch received Oscar nods as best director and for best adapted screenplay, with the film also taking a nomination for best picture. The triumph led to a multiple-picture deal with Dino Di Laurentiis.</p>



<p>
	The sprawling space opera “Dune,” about galactic family dynasties warring over possession of a space-travel “spice” mined on a desert planet, had already defeated projected adaptations by Alejandro Jodorowsky and Ridley Scott when Lynch took on the material.</p>



<p>
	Filmed laboriously on Mexican soundstages with an enormous international cast, “Dune” sported an unusual Flash Gordon-meets-Antonio Gaudi production design, a memorable gallery of demented Lynchian villains and the director’s trademark amniotic visuals.</p>



<p>
	The picture satisfied no one: Both audiences attuned to the boisterous heroics of “Star Wars” and impatient critics rejected Lynch’s contorted, confusing and harshly digested reading of Herbert’s novel, and the film tanked on arrival. Lynch later told Chris Rodley that at the conclusion of the ordeal, “I was almost dead. Almost dead!”</p>



<p>
	However, Lynch’s second film for De Laurentiis defined the contours of his mature style. “Blue Velvet” starred Kyle McLachlan, who had played the messianic hero of “Dune,” as a small-town boy who is plunged into a whirlpool of sexual violence, murder and sadomasochism.</p>



<p>
	Featuring a potent cast that included Isabella Rossellini (with whom Lynch became involved romantically), Laura Dern, Dean Stockwell and, most notably, Dennis Hopper as its deranged, out-of-control villain, “Blue Velvet” polarized critics, but it cemented Lynch’s reputation as a fearless and daring film author. The film was the start of his collaboration with composer Angelo Badalamenti.</p>



<p>
	Four years later, the Lynch style was brought to the small screen with “Twin Peaks.” Starring McLachlan as eccentric FBI agent Dale Cooper, the series used the investigation of the murder of homecoming queen Laura Palmer as a springboard into a swirling narrative vortex involving sexual intrigue, drug addiction, prostitution, madness and demonic possession. TV audiences tuned in to track the mystery and remained for the series’ complexly interwoven characters and perverse, at times supernatural plot twists.

	</p>




<p>
	The show’s first season scored 14 Emmy nominations, including nods for Lynch for writing and directing the pilot, but declining ratings after the drawn-out revelation of Palmer’s killer and Lynch’s diminishing participation due to production of a new feature led to a cliffhanging wrap-up at the end of season two.</p>



<p>
	However, the “Twin Peaks” saga had legs. Actress Sheryl Lee was brought back from the dead to play Laura Palmer in “Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me,” which tracked the fateful last week of Palmer’s life in lurid, screaming detail. And Showtime cable audiences were baffled anew by 2017’s much-belated third season, which reunited McLachlan and several members of the original cast.</p>



<p>
	The truest legacy of “Twin Peaks” may have been its impact on the development of unusual long-form episodic series. Successors ranging from “Wild Palms” to “True Detective” all bore Lynch’s distinctive stylistic fingerprints.</p>



<p>
	Lynch’s first feature after “Twin Peaks,” 1990’s “Wild at Heart,” was an oddball exodus, based on a novel by Barry Gifford, in which an Elvis-fixated ex-con (Nicolas Cage) and his hot-to-trot girlfriend (Laura Dern) are pursued by the murderous minions of the girl’s jealous mother (Dern’s own mother Diane Ladd). Domestic reaction was mixed to the gory, sexually frank mix of “Detour” and “The Wizard of Oz,” but the Cannes jury was wowed.</p>



<p>
	Lynch’s association with Gifford continued with “Lost Highway,” for which the two collaborated on an original screenplay. A doppelganger murder mystery that foreshadowed “Mulholland Drive,” the disquieting, brutally effective thriller starred Bill Pullman, Balthazar Getty and Patricia Arquette as the players in a homicidal foursome.</p>



<p>
	After spending most of the decade on the far side of narrative coherence, Lynch came back down to earth with “The Straight Story,” the first feature in which he took no hand in writing. In the incongruously Disney-distributed picture, based on a true story, Richard Farnsworth starred as an Iowa man who drives from Iowa to Wisconsin on a power mower to visit his seriously ill brother.</p>



<p>
	Though not a major hit, the film was critically well received, and proved to Lynch’s naysayers that he was capable of bringing life to material that was not extravagantly outrageous. Farnsworth received an Oscar nomination for his performance; the veteran actor and stunt man, who was suffering from terminal prostate cancer during the production of the film, died by suicide in 2000.

	</p>




<p>
	An enlarged version of a prospective pilot for a new TV series became what may have been Lynch’s most widely acclaimed film, and a defining summation of the filmmaker’s themes and narrative obsessions.</p>



<p>
	“Mulholland Drive” served a darkly satirical comment on the ways of Hollywood in the story of a young actress (Naomi Watts) whose relationship with an amnesiac stranger (Laura Elena Harring) becomes a hall-of-mirrors story of manipulation, betrayal and suicide. Lynch was nominated for a 2002 best director Oscar.</p>



<p>
	Some of the same themes came to the fore in “Inland Empire,” Lynch’s first film to be shot entirely on digital video, with Laura Dern starring as an on-the-skids actress involved in typical Lynchian psychic disorder. Owing to its format, still a relative rarity theatrically in 2007, the three-hour feature was little seen after its 2007 premiere at the Venice Film Festival.</p>



<p>
	In 2022, he appeared as John Ford in Steven Spielberg’s “The Fablemans,” and also provided the voice of the mad scientist in “Robot Chicken.”</p>



<p>
	Beyond his work in film and TV, Lynch exhibited his paintings internationally and issued many solo and collaborative albums of music. He contributed a weekly comic strip, “The Angriest Dog in the World,” to the alternative weekly the Los Angeles Reader for eight years. His wry, deadpan weather reports were aired daily on the L.A. rock station Indie 103.1 for several years and continued on social media.</p>



<p>
	A devotee of transcendental meditation from the 1970s on, he established his David Lynch Foundation to promote the Eastern practice, and enlisted such stars as Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and Donovan for fund-raising concerts.</p>



<p>
	Despite persistent rumors of new feature and TV projects after “Twin Peaks” came to an end in 2017, Lynch focused on making music videos and composing music with collaborators including Christabell. He offered his name to the David Lynch Graduate School of Cinematic Arts at Maharishi University and a line of coffee beans and designed Silencio nightclubs in Paris and New York. </p>



<p>
	Lynch was married four times. He is survived by two daughters and two sons.</p>

	<article>
		<p>This year we will continue to pursue our commitment to improving the security of the Web PKI by introducing the option to get certificates with six-day lifetimes (“short-lived certificates”). We will also add support for IP addresses in addition to domain names. Our longer-lived certificates, which currently have a lifetime of 90 days, will continue to be available alongside our six-day offering. Subscribers will be able to opt in to short-lived certificates via a certificate profile mechanism being added to our ACME API.</p>
<h2 id="shorter-certificate-lifetimes-are-good-for-security">Shorter Certificate Lifetimes Are Good for Security</h2>
<p>When the private key associated with a certificate is compromised, the recommendation has always been to have the certificate revoked so that people will know not to use it. Unfortunately, certificate revocation doesn’t work very well. This means that certificates with compromised keys (or other issues) may continue to be used until they expire. The longer the lifetime of the certificate, the longer the potential for use of a problematic certificate.</p>
<p>The primary advantage of short-lived certificates is that they greatly reduce the potential compromise window because they expire relatively quickly. This reduces the need for certificate revocation, which has historically been unreliable. Our six-day certificates will not include OCSP or CRL URLs. Additionally, short-lived certificates practically require automation, and we believe that automating certificate issuance is important for security.</p>
<h2 id="ip-address-support-for-securing-additional-use-cases">IP Address Support For Securing Additional Use Cases</h2>
<p>We will support including IP addresses as Subject Alternative Names in our six-day certificates. This will enable secure TLS connections, with publicly trusted certificates, to services made available via IP address, without the need for a domain name.</p>
<p>Validation for IP addresses will work much the same as validation for domain names, though validation will be restricted to the <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/">http-01 and tls-alpn-01 challenge types</a>. The dns-01 challenge type will not be available because the DNS is not involved in validating IP addresses. Additionally, there is no mechanism to check CAA records for IP addresses.</p>
<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<p>We expect to issue the first valid short-lived certificates to ourselves in February of this year. Around April we will enable short-lived certificates for a small set of early adopting subscribers. We hope to make short-lived certificates generally available by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>The earliest short-lived certificates we issue may not support IP addresses, but we intend to enable IP address support by the time short-lived certificates reach general availability.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-six-day-and-ip-address-certificates">How To Get Six-Day and IP Address Certificates</h2>
<p>Once short-lived certificates are an option for you, you’ll need to use an ACME client that supports <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2025/01/09/acme-profiles/">ACME certificate profiles</a> and select the short-lived certificate profile (the name of which will be published at a later date).</p>
<p>Once IP address support is an option for you, requesting an IP address in a certificate will automatically select a short-lived certificate profile.</p>
<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>The best way to prepare to take advantage of short-lived certificates is to make sure your ACME client is reliably renewing certificates in an automated fashion. If that’s working well then there should be no costs to switching to short-lived certificates.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<article>
   
  <div><p>Welcome to the very first post in a new blog! Here I will discuss software development, SRE work, and other fun stuff. Sometimes an idea is just too good to pass up. I hope this blog will motivate me to turn sparks and little pieces into general knowledge in writing the words down.</p>
<p>The other day I was discussing <a href="https://www.tabbyml.com/">Tabby</a> with a coworker. We talked about whether we should consider AI-autocompleted code harmful and ditch everyone’s newfound habit due to LLM’s inherent unreliability and their tendency toward spaghetti code, throwing traditional software engineering principles like DRY out the window. I disagreed: what if we could have a framework that integrates AI development tooling while also making everything better and more reliable instead? This instantly reminds me of Test-Driven Development, or TDD, which I think is great when combined with the use of a Large Language Model.</p>
<p>TDD in essence is to write comprehensive unit tests before you work on the main program. Since you wrote so many test cases that they essentially become the full specification, having the tests pass at the end “proves” your program’s correctness. Despite its promise, a lot of people find it a ridiculously clumsy process, even a major drag on productivity. Days could pass when nothing useful gets done. LLMs, however, have fundamentally changed the economics of doing TDD.</p>
<h3 id="how-i-normally-code-with-an-llm">How I normally code with an LLM</h3>
<p>I used tools like Github Copilot heavily ever since they came along. They are good for finding repetitive patterns and helping us fill in the next few lines, but usually struggle to: look at a clear specification, think deeply about it, and produce a whole working module against said specification. Sometimes a problem is so easy I am positive Copilot must be capable of it, but it stops short of giving me the full solution, opting to generate a single line of code instead.</p>
<p>To achieve what I want, LLMs need to be given well-formed requests with necessary, but not overwhelming, contexts. Stuff every tool and library at our disposal inside a model’s context, then it is distracted and easily carried away from the specific problem at hand.</p>
<p>In the end, I find myself rephrasing and renaming project-specific things in more general terms, introducing additional pieces of project-specific context into the conversation only when I realize solving the task requires them after all.</p>
<p>Another observation I had working with LLMs is that they are great debuggers. I can often paste raw error outputs to an LLM, and more often than not, they succeed at guessing the cause.</p>
<p>At some point, I realized that the bulk of friction coding with an LLM came from the back-and-forth copy-pasting juggle between my IDE, shell terminal, and the chat interface.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-automate-it">Can I automate it?</h3>
<p>So I wrote a little <a href="https://github.com/yfzhou0904/tdd-with-llm-go">event loop</a> to automate this process.</p>
<p>In the first prompt we give to the LLM, we type in a specification of the function we want to implement and a function signature for extra stability. The LLM is expected to generate a good unit test followed by an implementation.</p>
<p>Let’s give it a non-trivial, real-world problem to be solved:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>% go run main.go <span>\
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>--spec <span>'develop a function to take in a large text, recognize and parse any and all ipv4 and ipv6 addresses and CIDRs contained within it (these may be surrounded by random words or symbols like commas), then return them as a list'</span> <span>\
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>--sig <span>'func ParseCidrs(input string) ([]*net.IPNet, error)'</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The model will happily give us a first draft, which we immediately parse and load into a “sandbox” subdirectory for automatic verification:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>% tree ./sandbox
</span></span><span><span>./sandbox
</span></span><span><span>├── go.mod
</span></span><span><span>├── go.sum
</span></span><span><span>├── main.go
</span></span><span><span>└── main_test.go
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><code>go mod tidy &amp;&amp; gotfmt -w . &amp;&amp; goimports -w .</code> is used to fix minor syntax issues, then <code>go test . -v</code> is run.</p>
<p>If things fail (totally expected at this point,) we make use of the second (iteration) prompt. Now that we are working on existing code, this prompt includes the code we just ran and, crucially, the actual command line output from running the test, which would be either a compiler error or information about some failed tests. The model is expected to think about what happened and iterate by producing a revised test + implementation in a loop until all tests are cleared.</p>
<p>The idea is that in most cases, sending the full debug session is not a very frugal use of the model’s context. A reasonably intelligent model can think about what went wrong and make incremental changes. We also get the benefit of way lower API bills by keeping the context length more or less constant, regardless of how many iterations we end up doing.</p>
<p>Sometimes the model does get stuck. In our CIDR example, claude-3.5-sonnet came very close to all-clear on its second attempt, but proceeded to fail the same test case twice in a row. This is when I come in to look at the code, realize the regexp is not matching the final ‘1’ in “2001:db8::1”, and then provide that as an explicit hint to the model:
<img alt="test fails" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.yfzhou.fyi/tdd-llm-test-output.png"></p>
<p>Claude makes progress and clears the tests with our help:
<img alt="test passed" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.yfzhou.fyi/tdd-llm-test-passes.png"></p>
<p>Now we must contend with the “who guards the guards” problem. Because LLMs are unreliable agents, it might so happen that Claude just scammed us by spitting out useless (or otherwise low-effort) test cases. Anyway, it is a good practice that whoever implements the code shouldn’t write their own tests, because <a href="https://hackernoon.com/test-driven-development-is-fundamentally-wrong-hor3z4d">the same blindspots in design will crop up in tests</a>. In our case, LLM generated both. So it’s time to introduce some <em>human</em> input in the form of additional test cases, which is made extra convenient since the model already provided the overall structure of our test. If those cases pass, we can be reasonably confident in integrating this function into our codebase. Theoretically, you might even invoke a third prompt to do some AI-powered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing">mutation testing</a> by asking for a subtle, but critical, change in the implementation that is supposed to break our tests, then find out if it did!</p>
<h3 id="llm-powered-development-and-cognitive-loadhttpsmindsmdzakirullincognitive">LLM-powered development and <a href="https://minds.md/zakirullin/cognitive">cognitive load</a></h3>
<p>So this method appears to reliably tackle leetcode-style questions, but would it work in a practical codebase with an actual dependency graph? I believe it can be made to work with some engineering effort, and it’s great news for the codebase’s long-term maintainability if you do. For best results, our project structure needs to be set up with LLM workflows in mind. Specifically, we should carefully manage and keep the cognitive load required to understand and contribute code to a project at a minimum.</p>
<p>Every package, or directory, should consist of several independently testable subsets of code, wherein each subset contains basically 3 files: <code>shared.go</code> for the package’s shared typedefs and globals, whereas <code>x.go</code> and <code>x_test.go</code> focus on a specific aspect of our functional logic, ideally just one public function per file. Sometimes we also have <code>main_test.go</code> supplying a <a href="https://medium.com/goingogo/why-use-testmain-for-testing-in-go-dafb52b406bc">TestMain</a> function for setting up test environments (e.g. <a href="https://testcontainers.com/">testcontainers</a>).</p>
<p>Recently I started a brand new software project at work, so I had the opportunity to design the code organization starting from a blank slate. I’m currently exploring an extension to the AI TDD workflow for larger projects. The whole project code would need to be copied to the sandbox for execution, but sending the entire codebase to an LLM is impractical and distract the model’s focus. Instead, we designate a specific package (subdirectory) that the LLM will work on at any given time, include a <a href="https://github.com/princjef/gomarkdoc">gomarkdoc</a>-generated documentation for each dependency package we think is helpful, and finally include a same-package example code (perhaps a tightly-coupled entity’s <em>finished</em> implementation). The model will produce a function and a test, just like before, but this time we write the files in our intended subdirectory deep inside the sandbox to run the unit test.</p>
<p>With this pattern, not only do we limit the chance of introducing problematic code into production with test coverage by default, but we also encourage aggressive de-coupling and a unit test-first project structure. Because adding additional context to a model incurs some inference (and human-psychological) cost, we are constantly nudged into maintaining our code as nice little chunks, each consuming only a small cognitive load to fully understand. Hopefully, this approach lets us end up with “deep” modules with rich functionalities but minimal surface area.</p>
<p>In closing, you should remember <a href="http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html">AI’s Bitter Lesson</a>. There is a non-zero chance that we wake up tomorrow to a major shift in AI architecture, eliminating the LLM limitations we talked about, and rendering our efforts meaningless. So perhaps don’t start refactoring right away your 100k-Line-of-Code projects following this advice!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Digital rights advocacy organizations contend that Apple has failed to comply with its interoperability obligations under the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA).</p>
<p>The groups made their case in a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.article19.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ARTICLE-19_Joint-submission_EC_PUBLIC-CONSULTATION_APPLE_ARTICLE-67.pdf">letter</a> [PDF] asking competition watchdogs to do more to ensure Apple's compliance with the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://publications.europa.eu/resource/cellar/b4326c28-49cd-11ed-92ed-01aa75ed71a1.0006.01/DOC_1">Article 6(7)</a> of the DMA.</p>
<p>The letter is the work of four groups - the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://fsfe.org/index.en.html">Free Software Foundation Europe</a>, freedom of expression advocates <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.article19.org/">ARTICLE 19</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://edri.org/">European Digital Rights</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.datarights.ngo/">Data Rights</a> - plus three independent researchers.</p>

    

<p>Article 6(7) matters because it requires companies designated as gatekeepers – Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta, and Microsoft – to provide non-discriminatory access to, or interoperation with, designated software and hardware, to promote competition.</p>

        


        

<p>In September 2024, the commission <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/19/apple_ios_ipad_os_eu/">opened two proceedings against Apple</a> covering its interoperability obligations with regard to iOS connectivity features like the peer-to-peer file exchange tech AirDrop and how the iCompany should accommodate developer requests for interoperability.</p>
<p>The letter’s signatories argue that the commission's approach so far, "as laid out in <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-markets-act-cases.ec.europa.eu/reports/compliance-reports">Apple’s compliance report</a> and as observed in practice so far, is clearly deficient and structurally incapable of delivering effective interoperability, as required by the DMA."</p>

        

<p>The rights groups list several recommendations they believe could help bring Apple into compliance.</p>
<p>First, they want the commission to forbid Apple from imposing Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) on developers solely at its own discretion. Any such agreement, they argue, should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, with developer input noted in case there's disagreement.</p>
<p>Second, they want a standardized interoperability request form that developers can submit to Apple. The signatories think that will improve transparency and reduce the delaying tactics that have been reported by devs seeking information from Apple about APIs intended to make an app or product work with the iOS ecosystem.</p>

        

<p>Third, they want the commission to revisit <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/document/download/45321658-26ce-4ae0-a66a-c5261de5a5a9_en?filename=DMA.100204%20-%20Proposed%20measures.pdf">Paragraph 20(B)(e)</a> [PDF] of the DMA, which grants Apple the discretion to conceal symbols or accompanying descriptions related to its frameworks and libraries based on security concerns.</p>
<p>"We maintain that Apple should not be permitted to rely on security by obscurity, even though it is presently practiced in iOS," the letter says. "On the contrary, the developer should be allowed to claim that the implementation of an interoperability solution is in place based on Open Standards and publicly available documentation, the burden would fall on Apple to prove otherwise."</p>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/08/uk_markets_watchdog/">UK digital markets watchdog expects to launch investigations within the month using new powers</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The signatories also take issue with Apple's "Feedback Assistant" through which developers are supposed to be able to communicate about interoperability issues. They want the commission to make clear that Apple cannot provide third-party APIs that are less effective than its own APIs, and to ensure that Apple makes its APIs flexible, per the commission's intent.</p>
<p>What's more, they contend, tracking interoperability requests is made harder by the lack of a public bug tracking system – a sore point in the Apple developer community since at least 2011 when Tim Burks and Chris Verwymeren set up Open Radar, an unofficial bug-report-sharing site for third-party Apple developers.</p>
<p>"Bugs and errors in APIs commonly arise and necessitate timely and effective fixes by Apple," the letter’s authors state. "We therefore suggest the commission mandates improvements to Apple’s existing bug reporting system or creates a dedicated infrastructure for bug reporting, which should be publicly available on their website."</p>
<p>The letter goes on to claim that Apple, through its app notarization process, "can leverage multiple channels under the current request-driven approach as a means to block interoperability."</p>
<p>Pointing to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://ish.app/blog/ish-jit-and-eu">Apple's denial</a> of an interoperability request to make its just-in-time (JIT) compilation APIs available to iSH, a Linux shell for iOS, the advocacy groups argue that the commission should reconsider how DMA obligations relate to one another lest Apple be allowed to continue strategically blocking interoperability.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors ask the commission to become more involved in the dispute resolution process, to reinforce the DMA's commitment to interoperability, and to promote a more open and transparent process – which has never been Apple's preferred approach to communication.</p>
<p>For its part, Apple last month published a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.apple.com/support/downloads/DMA-Interoperability-Dec-2024.pdf">document</a> [PDF] warning that the DMA's interoperability requirements <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/19/apple_meta_interoperability/">could expose</a> personal information to the likes of Meta.</p>
<p>"As an example of our concerns, Meta has made 15 requests (and counting) for potentially far-reaching access to Apple's technology stack that, if granted as sought, would reduce the protections around personal data that our users have come to expect from their devices," the company said.</p>
<p>Were Apple to grant these requests, the iBiz said, Meta's apps would have access to all sorts of data that Apple itself has chosen not to access for the sake of privacy – much of which we suspect Apple could access via iCloud or other means if presented with a lawful demand for access.</p>
<p>Meta communications director Andy Stone <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/andymstone/status/1869553546380898609">responded</a> with his opinion that Apple is really saying “They don't believe in interoperability. In fact, every time Apple is called out for anti-competitive behavior, they defend themselves on privacy grounds that have no basis in reality." ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Early on Thursday morning, a Saturn V-sized rocket ignited its seven main engines, a prelude to lifting off from Earth.</p>
<p>But then, the New Glenn rocket didn't move.</p>
<p>And still, the engines produced their blue flame, furiously burning away methane.</p>
<p>The thrust-to-weight of the rocket must have been in the vicinity of 1.0 to 1.2, so the booster had to burn a little liquid methane and oxygen before it could begin to climb appreciably. But finally, seconds into the mission, New Glenn did begin to climb. It was slow, ever so slow. But it flew true.</p>
<h2>Flying safe</h2>
<p>After that the vehicle performed like a champion. The first stage burned for more than three minutes before the second stage separated at an altitude of 70 km. Then, the upper stage's two BE-3U engines appeared to perform flawlessly, pushing the Blue Ring pathfinder payload toward orbit. These engines burned very nearly for 10 minutes before shutting down, having reached an orbital velocity of 28,800 kph.</p>
<p>For the first time since its founding, nearly a quarter of a century ago, Blue Origin had reached orbit. The long-awaited debut launch of the New Glenn rocket, a super-heavy lift vehicle developed largely with private funding, had come. And it was a smashing success.</p>
<p>The only downer came a little bit later when Blue Origin's Ariane Cornell confirmed that the first stage did not successfully return to Earth. "We did in fact lose the booster," Cornell said during the company's webcast. Far below in the Atlantic Ocean the drone ship <em>Jacklyn</em> awaited, a lone and lonely sentinel, with no rocket to catch.</p>

			<p><em><span>Contributed by Deb Chatterjee, Intel</span></em></p>
<p><span>We are excited to usher in the dawn of a new era for the P4 programming language. For many years, the Tofino family of programmable Ethernet switches, powered by P4, has represented the cutting edge of network innovation. Tofino’s unprecedented levels of programmability have enabled organizations to shape their networks like never before. But there was always one limitation: the software driving this groundbreaking hardware remained closed source. Today, that changes. The Tofino P4 software is being open-sourced, and it’s about to revolutionize how we think about programmable networks.</span></p>
<p><span>This bold move from Intel to open-source the Tofino P4 software is more than just a licensing decision; it’s a call to action for the global developer community. It invites everyone—from seasoned network engineers to aspiring students—to participate, innovate, and contribute to shaping the future of networking. The open-sourcing of Tofino P4 code democratizes access to some of the most powerful tools in networking. Developers can now dive deep into the workings of Tofino switches, experiment with custom data plane designs without restrictions, and share and build upon others’ innovations to create groundbreaking solutions, utilizing the power and strength of an open-source community.</span></p>
<p><span>Open source thrives on collaboration. By releasing the Tofino P4 code, we’re creating a community where developers can propose and implement new features, researchers can experiment with cutting-edge ideas in programmable networking, and educators can use open-source tools to train the next generation of network engineers. Traditionally, access to high-performance network programming tools has been limited by closed-source software, high costs, or proprietary restrictions. Open-sourcing Tofino P4 removes these barriers, allowing anyone with the curiosity and skills to participate. This democratization is a game-changer for startups, academic institutions, and developers in underrepresented regions. Aspiring P4 developers can now explore, dissect, and learn from production-grade software. This real-world exposure will be valuable for understanding how P4 programming operates at scale. Educational institutions can even build programming curricula around this. In the words of Brad Burres, Intel Senior Fellow, “open sourcing software is the best way to accelerate industry innovation and lift all boats”.&nbsp; Nanda Kuruganti, Intel VP of Networking SW, points out that “P4 programming and an open ecosystem are the cornerstones of our networking strategy. By open-sourcing Tofino P4 software, we aim to empower the community to drive innovation and unlock the full potential of programmable networks.”</span></p>
<p><span>Developers now have access to the entire source code, which is organized in two main repos inside the p4lang structure. The p4c repo now additionally contains the Tofino compiler components, with subfolders such as arch, common, control-plane, driver, midend, test and docs. The <a href="https://github.com/p4lang/p4c/tree/main/backends/tofino" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tofino backend</a> is hierarchically at the same level as bmv2, ubpf and other backends. The newly introduced <a href="https://github.com/p4lang/open-p4studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open-p4studio repo</a> contains all the other components of the Tofino P4 Studio, such as bf_driver, bf_diags, bf_utils and tofino_model.</span></p>
<p><span>We are immensely grateful to the following individuals within Intel who worked on the open sourcing effort – Glen Gibb, Han Wang, Prathima Kotikalapudi, Anil Samal, Vaishnavi Tipireddy, Shiv Kumar, Shuai Zhang, Rohit Nair, and Sai Pracheetha Beeyam. We also benefited immensely from the guidance from the P4 Technical Steering Committee members, Fabian Ruffy and Andy Fingerhut.</span></p>
<p><span>The open-sourcing of Tofino P4 software is not just a milestone—it’s an invitation. It’s a call for developers, researchers, educators, and network enthusiasts to come together and shape the future of programmable networking. We encourage developers to dive into the repository, read the code, and understand how Tofino P4 works. The more they learn, the more they can contribute. Whether it’s fixing bugs, adding features, or improving documentation, every contribution helps the community grow.</span></p>
<p><span>We are asking P4 enthusiasts all over the world to spread the word about the open-sourcing of Tofino P4, and encourage their peers, colleagues, and organizations to join the P4 movement.</span></p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Over more than a decade there has been an extensive research effort on how to effectively utilize recurrent models and attention. While recurrent models aim to compress the data into a fixed-size memory (called hidden state), attention allows attending to the entire context window, capturing the direct dependencies of all tokens. This more accurate modeling of dependencies, however, comes with a quadratic cost, limiting the model to a fixed-length context. We present a new neural long-term memory module that learns to memorize historical context and helps attention to attend to the current context while utilizing long past information. We show that this neural memory has the advantage of fast parallelizable training while maintaining a fast inference. From a memory perspective, we argue that attention due to its limited context but accurate dependency modeling performs as a short-term memory, while neural memory due to its ability to memorize the data, acts as a long-term, more persistent, memory. Based on these two modules, we introduce a new family of architectures, called Titans, and present three variants to address how one can effectively incorporate memory into this architecture. Our experimental results on language modeling, common-sense reasoning, genomics, and time series tasks show that Titans are more effective than Transformers and recent modern linear recurrent models. They further can effectively scale to larger than 2M context window size with higher accuracy in needle-in-haystack tasks compared to baselines.
