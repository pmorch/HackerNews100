            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://turso.tech/blog/introducing-limbo-a-complete-rewrite-of-sqlite-in-rust">https://turso.tech/blog/introducing-limbo-a-complete-rewrite-of-sqlite-in-rust</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42378843">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2 years ago, we forked SQLite. We were huge fans of the embedded nature of SQLite, but longed for a more open model of development. <a href="https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql">libSQL</a> was born as an Open Contribution project, and we invited the community to build it with us.</p>
<p>As a result, libSQL is an astounding success. With over 12k Github stars, 85 contributors, and features like native replication and vector search, libSQL is the engine that powers the <a href="https://turso.tech/">Turso</a> platform.</p>
<p>Today we are announcing a more ambitious experiment: what could we achieve, if we were to completely <em>rewrite</em> SQLite in a memory-safe language (Rust)? With the Limbo project, now available at <a href="https://github.com/tursodatabase/limbo">github.com/tursodatabase/limbo</a>, we are now trying to answer that question.</p>
<h2 id="the-pros-and-cons-of-forking"><a href="#the-pros-and-cons-of-forking">#</a>The pros and cons of forking</h2>
<p>When we forked SQLite, forking was not the only alternative. We considered rewriting it entirely, but were concerned about the huge lead time needed to have something production-ready, and the toil involved in keeping compatibility. A fork would also allow us to keep back-merging from SQLite, adopting new features as they come.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are disadvantages as well: SQLite‚Äôs test suite is proprietary, meaning that it is hard to achieve the confidence to make very large changes. It is also written in C, an unsafe language, which makes evolving the codebase with confidence even harder.</p>
<p>Weighing the pros and cons, forking was the way to go, and the libSQL project was born.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-approach"><a href="#a-new-approach">#</a>A new approach</h2>
<p>Adding Vector search to SQLite was an eye opener. We didn‚Äôt want to do this as an extension, since we wanted to make the syntax as straightforward and natural as possible. That would require changes to the bytecode generation, which we did. We are able to expose vectors as a data type, query relational and vector data together in the same table, and as long as the query doesn‚Äôt need an index, use perfectly boring SQL syntax.</p>
<p>But for searches with an index, without making very invasive changes, it was hard to achieve the syntax that we wanted:</p>
<pre><code><span>SELECT</span> title, <span>year</span>
   <span>FROM</span> movies
   <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> vector_distance_cos(embedding, vector(<span>'[4,5,6]'</span>))
   LIMIT <span>3</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>And we ended up settling for</p>
<pre><code><span>SELECT</span> title, <span>year</span>
   <span>FROM</span> vector_top_k(<span>'movies_idx'</span>, vector(<span>'[4,5,6]'</span>), <span>3</span>)
   <span>JOIN</span> movies
   <span>ON</span> movies.rowid <span>=</span> id;
</code></pre>
<p>The index is represented as a separate table, and we have to explicitly join it with the main table.</p>
<p>At that point, we decided to try a new approach and answer the question: how much effort was it <em>really</em> involved in rewriting SQLite from scratch ? And can we do it in a way that effortlessly keeps compatibility? Would that make it easier for us to be more aggressive and do some of the things we wanted to do in our fork (like asynchronous I/O) with a high degree of confidence?</p>
<p>To answer those questions, Pekka started an ambitious experiment on hist <a href="https://github.com/penberg/limbo">personal github account</a>. It was named Limbo as a codename temporarily, and it did extremely well. Without much press, just me talking about it on ùïè, the project grew to 1,000 github stars, and attracted more than 30 contributors organically.</p>
<h2 id="the-next-step"><a href="#the-next-step">#</a>The next step</h2>
<p>With the success of this experiment, we have decided to turn Limbo into an official project at Turso. It is still an experiment, but now an official Turso experiment, which will allow us to pour more resources into it, including more time from other engineers in the company.</p>
<p>Our goal is to build a reimplementation of SQLite from scratch, fully compatible at the language and file format level,  with the same or higher reliability SQLite is known for, but with full memory safety and on a new, modern architecture.</p>
<p>That is not to say that we‚Äôre building a competitor or alternative to libSQL: if it succeeds, this codebase just becomes libSQL. The code is available under the same license as libSQL (MIT), and with the same community-friendly attitude that defined our project.</p>
<h2 id="can-we-match-sqlite-s-world-famous-reliability-"><a href="#can-we-match-sqlite-s-world-famous-reliability-">#</a>Can we match SQLite‚Äôs world-famous reliability?</h2>
<p>Since this is a reimplementation, doesn‚Äôt that mean that testing is now even harder? The reality is that it is the other way around. Since we are reimplementing it from scratch, we are doing it with Deterministic Simulation Testing (DST) built-in from the get-go. We have both added DST facilities to the core of the database, and partnered with Antithesis to achieve a level of reliability in the database that lives up to SQLite‚Äôs reputation.</p>
<p>Deterministic Simulation Testing is a paradigm made famous by the folks at <a href="https://tigerbeetle.com/">TigerBeetle</a>, that we at Turso already dipped our toes into with our <a href="https://turso.tech/blog/a-deep-look-into-our-new-massive-multitenant-architecture">server-side code</a>. With DST, we believe we can achieve an even higher degree of robustness than SQLite, since it is easier to simulate unlikely scenarios in a simulator, test years of execution with different event orderings, and upon finding issues, reproduce them 100% reliably.</p>
<p>In the DST world, writing our own simulator is akin to writing unit tests: they allow us to move fast, experiment easily, and stress changes thoroughly. But much as unit testing does not do away with the need for higher level integration testing that tests the behavior of the system at a higher level, we felt like we needed to go the extra mile to achieve the levels of reliability that we wanted.</p>
<p>To complete the puzzle, we wanted to deterministically test the behavior of the database when interacting with the operating system and other components. To do that, we are partnering with <a href="https://antithesis.com/">Antithesis</a>, a company that provides a system-level Deterministic Simulation Testing framework, and can simulate all sorts of hardware and software failures. Antithesis does that by providing a deterministic hypervisor that runs many fuzzing threads in parallel, allowing us to quickly search the input space.</p>
<p>As an example of why this is important, they have already helped us find issues in our <code>io_uring</code> implementation under partial writes. Our own DST framework would not have caught this, since the actual I/O loop is replaced by the simulated I/O loop in testing. Partial writes are an extremely rare condition, and therefore, hard to test in an automated fashion.</p>
<p>Aside from Deterministic simulation testing, we also routinely fuzz inputs, and then make sure that the generated bytecode is the same, for both Limbo and SQLite.</p>
<h2 id="the-current-status"><a href="#the-current-status">#</a>The current status</h2>
<p>While Limbo is still in early stages, it has already achieved some important milestones that are already a couple of things worth noting:</p>
<h3 id="fully-asynchronous-i-o"><a href="#fully-asynchronous-i-o">#</a>Fully asynchronous I/O</h3>
<p>Limbo is designed to be fully asynchronous. SQLite itself has a synchronous interface, meaning driver authors who want asynchronous behavior need to have the extra complication of using helper threads. Because SQLite queries <em>tend</em> to be fast, since no network round trips are involved, a lot of those drivers just settle for a synchronous interface. However, this has two fundamental problems:
Not all SQLite queries are fast. Aggregations over large data, for example, will always be slow, even if the data is fully local.
In modern environments, it is actually desirable that queries go over the network. One example is Turso, which serves SQLite over HTTP. Another example are implementations of SQLite over S3 providing the illusion of infinite storage space, where data <em>can</em> be cached locally, but parts of it may be remote.</p>
<p>Limbo is designed to be asynchronous from the ground up. It extends <code>sqlite3_step</code>, the main entry point API to SQLite, to be asynchronous, allowing it to return to the caller if data is not ready to consume immediately. On Linux, Limbo uses <code>io_uring</code>, a performant API for asynchronous system calls.</p>
<h3 id="designed-for-wasm"><a href="#designed-for-wasm">#</a>Designed for WASM</h3>
<p>While SQLite can compile to WASM, it is mostly an afterthought for SQLite. In practice, projects like wa-sqlite exist to extend SQLite and allow it to function in WASM environments like <a href="https://stackblitz.com/">Stackblitz</a> . Limbo is designed from the ground up to have a WASM build, and already has a VFS implementation that works with popular tools like Drizzle without any changes. For example, it is possible to write:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> { drizzle } <span>from</span> <span>'drizzle-orm/better-sqlite3'</span>;
<span>import</span> * <span>as</span> s <span>from</span> <span>'drizzle-orm/sqlite-core'</span>;
<span>import</span> { <span>Database</span> } <span>from</span> <span>'limbo-wasm'</span>;

<span>const</span> sqlite = <span>new</span> <span>Database</span>(<span>'sqlite.db'</span>);
<span>const</span> db = <span>drizzle</span>({ <span>client</span>: sqlite });
<span>const</span> users = s.<span>sqliteTable</span>(<span>"users"</span>, {
  <span>id</span>: s.<span>integer</span>(),
  <span>name</span>: s.<span>text</span>(),
})

<span>const</span> result = db.<span>select</span>().<span>from</span>(users).<span>all</span>();

<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(result);
</code></pre>
<p>Browser support is in the works.</p>
<h3 id="performance"><a href="#performance">#</a>Performance</h3>
<p>SQLite is known for its stellar performance, but in many operations, Limbo is already on par or faster than SQLite. Executing <code>cargo bench</code> on Limbo‚Äôs main directory, we can compare SQLite running <code>SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 1</code> (620ns on my Macbook Air M2), with Limbo executing the same query (506ns), which is 20% faster.</p>
<h3 id="simplicity"><a href="#simplicity">#</a>Simplicity</h3>
<p>Despite the fact that SQLite‚Äôs file-based nature makes working with it extremely simple, SQLite grew a considerable amount of tunables over the years, which make getting top performance out of it non-obvious (the SQLite numbers on the benchmark above are after tuning). For maximum performance, users have to choose WAL mode over journal mode, disable POSIX advisory locks, etc.</p>
<p>Limbo, while maintaining compatibility with SQLite‚Äôs bytecode and file format, drops a lot of the features that we consider less important for modern environments (including SQLite‚Äôs ‚Äúamalgamation‚Äù, the build system that generates a single C file), providing a better out-of-the-box experience.</p>
<h2 id="interested-in-learning-more-"><a href="#interested-in-learning-more-">#</a>Interested in learning more?</h2>
<p>Limbo is available under the MIT license <a href="https://github.com/tursodatabase/limbo">on our Github</a>. If you are interested in building an embedded database with the bold vision of taking the promise of SQLite to the next level, come build with us.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Almost as soon as it closed, a website for the Tidings reemerged, boasting a team of eight reporters, Minihane included, who cranked out densely reported stories every few days. </p><p>And those reporters were covering a lot more than local news. They dove into Oregon‚Äôs fentanyl crisis (‚ÄúMeasure 110 might be in for a repeal‚Äù), homelessness in Eugene (‚ÄúAll In Lane County homeless program delivers impressive results‚Äù), and the food scene in Portland (‚ÄúThe fourth best burger in the U.S. is in Portland‚Äù) ‚Äî essentially any issue that might draw attention from Oregonians. </p><p>The reality was that none of the people allegedly working for the Ashland Daily Tidings existed, or at least were who they claimed to be.

Most analyses of this era point to the rise of consumer-focused tools like Craigslist, which took a <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/03/craigslist-saved-consumers-a-lot-of-money-while-crippling-newspapers"><u>roughly $5 billion bite out of local news</u></a> through the loss of classified ads, as the start of a long slide in the news business. Fact-based news reporting, which takes time, also has <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/03/31/out-of-print"><u>failed to keep up with online demands</u></a> for the latest content available at the touch of a device. Readers and the advertising dollars that follow them have flocked to social media and other online platforms. </p><p>Jackson County‚Äôs current phase of local media, including the ongoing, bizarre operation of the Ashland Daily Tidings, could be seen as beginning in 2017. That‚Äôs when Rosebud Media and its owner ‚Äî an entrepreneur with technology, broadcast and advertising experience ‚Äî <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2023/01/mail-tribune-owners-push-to-reshape-local-news-cost-medford-its-daily-newspaper.html"><u>plucked the Mail Tribune and the Daily Tidings</u></a> from the grip of the hedge fund-backed GateHouse Media, which later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/business/media/gannett-gatehouse-merger.html" rel="" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/business/media/gannett-gatehouse-merger.html">merged with another powerhouse publisher</a>, Gannett. </p><p>The move offered some hope that Rosebud Media‚Äôs vision would preserve what remained of the local journalism that had been pared back by large companies focused primarily on profits. </p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2024/12/09/local-news-job-loss-oregon/">The state of Oregon's local media in 4 charts</a></p><p>The hope didn‚Äôt last. In January 2023, after several initiatives meant to stabilize the papers, Rosebud Media <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2023/01/mail-tribune-storied-newspaper-in-medford-to-abruptly-shut-down.html"><u>closed down </u></a>both for good. The move meant an unceremonious end to Oregon‚Äôs first Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaper, the Mail Tribune, which earned the award in 1934 for public service by condemning local politicians who supported racial grievances of the Ku Klux Klan and the violent takeover of local government coming out of the Great Depression. </p><p>The East Oregonian Media Group ‚Äî a family-owned newspaper chain across rural parts of Oregon and Southwest Washington ‚Äî stepped in after Rosebud‚Äôs closure, and earned heaps of praise when it announced plans to open a local newspaper that would replace the Mail Tribune. </p><figure><picture><img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/YCFFR7JUQBGBLBA67TOGSA4VN4.jpg?auth=ae6d70e658a5a8c372127b4a91da37ff8f8582e5059f7729e22756c2bdd41a48&amp;width=150" alt="The Ashland Tidings, Dec. 23, 1912, part of the Library of Congress Chronicling America online collection."></picture><figcaption><p>The Ashland Tidings, Dec. 23, 1912, part of the Library of Congress Chronicling America online collection.</p><p><em>Courtesy of Library of Congress</em></p></figcaption></figure><p>That hope didn‚Äôt last either. In late October, EO Media Group announced it was <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2024/10/23/east-oregon-bulletin-bend-eo-media-group/"><u>selling its roughly dozen newspapers</u></a>, including the Rogue Valley Times in Medford, to Carpenter Media Group. The Mississippi-based company ‚Äî now the fourth-largest newspaper owner in the country ‚Äî had been on a Northwest newspaper buying spree and boasted of its commitment to ‚Äú<a href="https://www.nna.org/carpenter-media-group-to-acquire-eo-media-group#:~:text=PENDLETON%2C%20Oregon%20%E2%80%93%20Carpenter%20Media%20Group,roots%20in%20the%20Pacific%20Northwest."><u>high quality, community focused journalism</u></a>‚Äù before laying off an untold number of reporters and editors in the <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2024/07/new-owner-of-portland-tribune-other-oregon-newspapers-lays-off-some-staff.html"><u>Portland suburbs</u></a>, Central Oregon, Eastern Oregon, Southern Oregon and <a href="https://www.heraldnet.com/news/everett-herald-newsroom-strikes-amid-layoffs/"><u>Everett, Washington</u></a>. </p><p>This cycle of a new owner buying a local newspaper every few years ‚Äî only for more journalists to lose their jobs shortly after the sale ‚Äî is not unique to Jackson County. Northwestern University‚Äôs Medill School of Journalism, which tracks media outlet sales and layoffs in an annual report, estimates the year from 2022 to 2023 saw a rapid loss of 7,000 newspaper-related jobs across the country compared to just a few hundred the year before. According to Medill‚Äôs data, nearly every county east of the Cascades in Oregon has <a href="https://localnewsinitiative.northwestern.edu/projects/state-of-local-news/explore/#/state-localnewslandscape?state=OR&amp;stateCode=41"><u>two or fewer local news sources</u></a>. Most have a single source, and six counties have no local news outlet at all. </p><p>The result of all these consolidations and job losses is less information being reported locally for Oregonians, particularly those in rural communities who are seeing papers close at troubling rates, according to Medill‚Äôs mapping of news deserts. </p><h2>Plagiarism, by any other name</h2><p>The mysterious emergence of AI invaders on the local news scene is a new development in Oregon, and the Ashland Daily Tidings website appears designed to hide its true operators.</p><p>After Rosebud Media closed in 2023, the Daily Tidings website emerged again with a claimed staff of eight contributors, none of whom are reporters working in Southern Oregon. Two of the writers have sparse social media presences that suggest they live in South Africa. Neither responded to a request for comment from OPB, though one did share a social media post in November praising artificial intelligence. ‚ÄúTry to learn Artificial intelligence and don‚Äôt curse in AI. Do your hard work and Update your skills,‚Äù they wrote in a LinkedIn post. </p><p>Two of the writers on the Daily Tidings website are actually correspondents for the London-based Daily Mail. Another two have actually worked as journalists in Southern Oregon. One supposed writer has no online presence as a journalist outside the Daily Tidings website.</p><figure><picture><img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/OA7IBK6IR5D2HNGZHI5KKXBAFM.jpg?auth=b30b3a1c583fc5a1a115f9515fa0ab3d9578a0bca4de00e7e2cd32c373290508&amp;width=150" alt="An Oct. 25, 2024, screenshot of the Ashland Daily Tidings' contributor page.

After OPB began reaching out to people credited on the Tidings‚Äô stories, more than half the staff disappeared from the page and their bylines were replaced on existing stories. Three journalists who responded to OPB‚Äôs requests for comment said they had no idea their names or images were being used to produce stories for the Daily Tidings. </p><p>‚ÄúPlagiarism, I think it‚Äôs called,‚Äù quipped Bert Etling, the former editor of the Daily Tidings who now runs the digital nonprofit media outlet <a href="https://ashland.news/" title="https://ashland.news/"><u>Ashland.news</u></a>. </p><p>Etling, who started his local journalism career in 1982 and was laid off in 2019 by Rosebud Media, noticed the revived Daily Tidings soon after it emerged because his own reporters saw work remarkably similar to their own appearing on the webpage. The stories would have fresh headlines and the writing would be tweaked, but the reporting and quotes from sources would closely match work Ashland.news had previously published. OPB staff members have also <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2024/10/03/josephine-county-jail-wellpath/"><u>had their work</u></a> taken and <a href="https://www.dailytidings.com/court-finds-oregon-healthcare-provider-destroyed-evidence/"><u>republished on the Daily Tidings</u></a> website with marginally changed sentences. </p><p>‚ÄúThey just put it in a blender and then pour it out on their page,‚Äù Etling said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs maddening.‚Äù</p><figure><picture><img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/6NX5HUYVR5FJROAZ24DYGEKZJQ.jpg?auth=c375a0f6c300e10f18ba0cacfb8ed320b531482f5adf249add13eb5385e96a32&amp;width=150" alt="Ashland News Executive Editor Bert Etling at an announcement for the launch of the news site."></picture><figcaption><p>Ashland News Executive Editor Bert Etling at an announcement Dec. 17, 2021, for the launch of the news site.</p><p><em>Erik Neumann  / JPR News</em></p></figcaption></figure><p>Since artificial intelligence‚Äôs wider adoption by the public in the past two years, journalism has been a regular target for scams that further threaten the business of producing news. A New York-based journalist collective, 404 Media, was <a href="https://www.404media.co/why-404-media-needs-your-email-address/"><u>among the first to notice a trend of fraudulent websites</u></a> taking real stories and using AI ‚Äúspinners‚Äù to rewrite the articles with the goal of grabbing web traffic. Other reporting revealed a Serbian DJ who <a href="https://racketmn.com/southwest-journal-minneapolis-mn-vujo-ai"><u>pretended to operate a news outlet in a Minneapolis suburb</u></a>, only to leave local readers confused when they‚Äôd click stories to find AI-generated content that had nothing to do with Minnesota.</p><p>The Daily Tidings appears to be the first time an Oregon news outlet has stolen the identities of real journalists to trick local readers with AI-generated content. The goal is apparently to deceive Oregonians into giving clicks ‚Äî and the resulting ad revenue ‚Äî to whoever is behind the website. </p><h2>The source</h2><p>The Daily Tidings wasn‚Äôt the first time Joe Minihane had his work, or his identity, ripped off using AI. </p><p>In March, someone took over the webpage domain for Minihane‚Äôs personal website after he didn‚Äôt pay to renew his ownership. Whoever grabbed the site filled it with mundane prose that vaunted Minihane‚Äôs ability as a journalist ‚Äî and his ability to write essays. The purpose for the website takeover appears in links subtly embedded throughout, which offer to sell high school students essays for their homework. </p><p>‚ÄúI find it fascinating when the bots write about you in the third person,‚Äù he told OPB. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt get to the bottom of these things.‚Äù</p><p>A similar type of theft may be behind whatever is happening at the Ashland Daily Tidings. </p><p>The Daily Tidings claims on its website that it was acquired by Difference Media, LLC, in 2021. Difference Media was founded by a father and son in Texas to promote Christian music. Speaking to OPB, a company official said they were not aware of the Daily Tidings and that the company owns no newspapers. </p><p>OPB reached out to the operators of the Daily Tidings through the website‚Äôs contact form and listed email for the paper‚Äôs news desk, but received no reply. </p><p>The alleged timeline of the Difference Media purchase also does not line up with the Daily Tidings‚Äô prior ownership. </p><p>When owner Steve Saslow closed Rosebud Media in 2023, the web domain for the Ashland Daily Tidings and the Medford Mail Tribune became inactive, creating an opportunity for the fraudulent version to replace it.</p><p>In his first interview since closing the papers, Saslow told OPB he had his attorneys pursue litigation against whomever is behind the AI-written stories for copyright infringement. The lawyers told him the fraudulent acts are coming from outside the United States, likely in China, and they described the legal quest as akin to ‚Äúpursuing a phantom.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúThey do this apparently with either existing or defunct newspapers around the world,‚Äù Saslow said. ‚Äú[My lawyers] said you could go and spend all kinds of money, and trying to find them would be a needle in a haystack if we could do it at all.‚Äù</p><p>Saslow opted not to spend that money chasing down the fraudsters. There‚Äôs little doubt money is the reason behind the fraud, however. </p><p>The Daily Tidings website, despite its reliance on copyright infringement and stolen identities, presents readers with banners and pop-up videos from major advertisement-serving companies on the internet, such as Google, YieldMo and the Trade Desk. Display ads like those on the website can earn the site‚Äôs operators a few dollars for each 1,000 appearances the ads make, potentially making the endless churn of stolen stories a lucrative business. It‚Äôs unclear exactly how much money the Daily Tidings is generating each year from such ad placements. </p><p>After being alerted to the scam by OPB, Google took action against the Daily Tidings website by removing its ads from specific pages on the website the tech giant viewed as violating its terms of service. </p><p>‚ÄúWe have strict publisher policies that govern the types of content we allow to monetize. Upon reviewing the site in question, we have taken action to demonetize the pages where we identified violations of these policies,‚Äù spokesperson Nate Funkhouser said in an email. </p><p>The main landing page of the Daily Tidings continued to serve advertisements from Google and other companies as of Dec. 2. Other advertisement-serving companies that appear to be providing income to the Daily Tidings did not respond to OPB‚Äôs requests for comment. </p><h2>The future of local journalism</h2><p>Saslow said he started Rosebud Media because he saw the old models for local journalism had created a business that only seemed to recede as online platforms advanced. From his perspective, local readers would be the big losers if nothing changed.</p><p>‚ÄúIt really was about the true sense of journalism,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I named the thing Rosebud. It was a joke from the movie ‚ÄòCitizen Kane.‚Äô He thought he could control everything and the answer was no, that‚Äôs what you don‚Äôt want.‚Äù</p><p>A desire to experiment led Saslow to partner with Sinclair Broadcast Group to produce some video content with his former reporters. Saslow hoped the experimentation with print, video and online stories would be an attractive package for advertisers who want the maximum number of eyeballs for their dollars. While that effort didn‚Äôt translate to advertisers writing bigger checks, Saslow said he isn‚Äôt giving up his goal of finding a formula that makes local journalism financially stable. As early as 2025, he said, he‚Äôd like to return to Southern Oregon with a new venture that ties together local and national issues in a way that could be a single stop for readers inundated with information. </p><p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to have this mix of everything that would affect a person‚Äôs life,‚Äù Saslow said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs going to be a breakthrough where somebody basically is able to evolve news to something that is completely different.‚Äù</p><p>The future of local journalism in Oregon likely depends on whether its decadeslong retrenchment continues under the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/01/technology/google-ai-search-publishers.html"><u>growing pressures of Silicon Valley‚Äôs push into artificial intelligence</u></a>, or if the remaining media outlets in the state can convince their readers that human-verified information is a necessity. Ashland.news, the digital startup led by Etling, is taking some decidedly old-school approaches to help his publication. Even as his reporters are competing with social media posts from the zombified Daily Tidings, Etling said he is constantly thinking about how he can prove to the people living in the Rogue Valley that local journalism is worth saving. </p><p>‚ÄúPeople had it easy with the subsidized newspaper,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt was subsidized by capitalism-assisted democracy ‚Äî by selling sofas and mattresses on the pages of your newspaper and making it really cheap to get. That‚Äôs gone away, and it‚Äôs not coming back.‚Äù</p><p>Etling doesn‚Äôt know what will replace journalism‚Äôs long dead revenue sources of classified advertisements and public notices, but he believes the nonprofit model Ashland.news follows ‚Äî one built on giving well-reported local stories to a local audience ‚Äî could hold some clues. </p><p>Rather than chasing profits, the company has tried to offer its readers a simple value proposition: We live here, and we want to tell you stories about this community. </p><p>Ashland.news doesn‚Äôt have billions of dollars in venture capital behind it like the largest artificial intelligence companies, but it does have an edge those companies don‚Äôt have: people who live in the community they‚Äôre covering. This year, the outlet‚Äôs staff marched in the Fourth of July parade. The response surprised Etling. </p><p>‚ÄúPeople were hollering out, ‚ÄòWe love Ashland News!‚Äô and ‚ÄòThank you!‚Äô‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt was really gratifying.‚Äù</p><p>The company also recently sent a print edition ‚Äî a surprising move for a digital outlet ‚Äî to 17,000 mailboxes in Ashland and nearby Talent as another way to reach people who may not know their local journalism is at risk of going away. </p><p>Those curated appeals to local readers may be working, too. Etling estimates Ashland.news has around 4,750 newsletter subscribers ‚Äî more than three times the number of people who subscribed to the Daily Tidings when he was editor. </p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://antirez.com/news/144">https://antirez.com/news/144</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42378488">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article data-comment-id="144-" id="144-"><span><span><a href="https://antirez.com/user/antirez">antirez</a></span> 51 minutes ago. 15113 views.  </span><pre>I‚Äôm not the kind of person that develops a strong attachment to their own work. When I decided to leave Redis, about 1620 days ago (~ 4.44 years), I never looked at the source code, commit messages, or anything related to Redis again. From time to time, when I needed Redis, I just downloaded it and compiled it. I just typed ‚Äúmake‚Äù and I was very happy to see that, after many years, building Redis was still so simple.

My detachment was not the result of me hating my past work. While in the long run my creative work was less and less important and the ‚Äúhandling the project‚Äù activities became more and more substantial ‚Äî a shift that many programmers are able to do, but that‚Äôs not my bread and butter ‚Äî well, I still enjoyed doing Redis stuff when I left. However, I don‚Äôt share the vision that most people at my age (I‚Äôm 47 now) have: that they are still young. I wanted to do new stuff, especially writing. I wanted to stay more with my family and help my relatives. I definitely needed a break.

However, during the ‚Äúwriting years‚Äù (I‚Äôm still writing, by the way), I often returned to coding, as a way to take breaks from intense writing sessions (writing is the only mental activity I found to be a great deal more taxing than coding): I did a few embedded projects; played more with neural networks; built Telegram bots: a bit of everything. Hacking randomly was cool but, in the long run, my feeling was that I was lacking a real purpose, and every day I started to feel a bigger urgency to be part of the tech world again. At the same time, I saw the Redis community fragmenting, something that was a bit concerning to me, even as an outsider.

So I started to think that maybe, after all, I could have a role back in the Redis ecosystem. Perhaps I could be able to reshape the company's attitude towards the community. Maybe I could even help to take back the role of the Redis core as the primary focus of new developments. Basically I could be some kind of ‚Äúevangelist‚Äù (I don‚Äôt love the name of this role, but‚Ä¶ well, you get it), that is, on one side, a bridge between the company and the community, but also somebody that could produce programming demos, invent and describe new patterns, write documentation, videos and blog posts about new and old stuff. And, what about the design of new stuff? I could learn from the work of people in the wild, from their difficulties, distill it, and report back design ideas, in order for Redis to evolve.

# Time in NY

At some point my daughter, who is now 12, and is a crucial person in my life, enlightening my days with her intelligence, creativity and love, wanted to visit NYC for her birthday. We decided that yes, this was a good idea after all, we had a couple very difficult years recently, so, why not? My daughter is now more of a girl than a child. So, in NYC, I thought: maybe this is the right time, I can do a part time job. I met the new Redis CEO, Rowan Trollope, very recently, in a video call. I had the feeling that I could work with him to tune the future of the company‚Äôs relationships with the community and the codebase direction. So I wrote him an email saying: do you think I could be back in some kind of capacity? Rowan showed interest in my proposal, and quickly we found some agreement.

# About the license switch

People will ask questions about why I *actually* did this, whether there is some back story other than what I just wrote above, if there is some agreement involved, or a big amount of money; something odd or unclear. But sometimes things are very boring: 1. I contacted the company, not the reverse. 2. I‚Äôm not getting crazy money to re-enter, it‚Äôs not about exploiting some situation ‚Äî normal salary (but, disclaimer: yes, I have Redis stock options like I had before, no less, no more). 3. I don‚Äôt have huge issues with Redis changing its license; Specifically I don‚Äôt think the fracture with the community is *really* about this. But since people will ask me about that very important matter, it is better to tell you all the truth immediately.

# The licensing dilemma

I wrote open source software for almost my whole life. Yet, as I‚Äôm an atheist and still I‚Äôm happy when I see other people believing in God, if this helps them to survive life‚Äôs hardships, I also don‚Äôt believe that open source is the only way to write software. When I started to develop Redis in the context of a company where I was one of the two founders and where we kept the software code closed (Redis was opened as it was considered not part of the core product). We didn't want our services to be copied by others, as simple as that. So I‚Äôm not an extremist in this regard ‚Äì I‚Äôm an extremist only about software design.

Moreover, I don‚Äôt believe that openness and licensing are only what the OSI tells us they are. I see licensing as a spectrum of things you can and can‚Äôt do. At the same time, I‚Äôm truly concerned that big cloud providers have changed the incentives in the system software arena. Redis was not the only project to change license, it was actually the last one‚Ä¶ of a big pile. And I have the feeling that in recent years many projects didn‚Äôt even start because of a lack of a clear potential business model. So, the Redis license switch was not my decision and perhaps I would have chosen a different license? I‚Äôm not sure, it‚Äôs too easy to relitigate right now, far from the scene for many years and without business pressures. But in general, I can understand the choice.

Moreover, if you read the new Redis license, sure, it‚Äôs not BSD, but basically as long as you don‚Äôt sell Redis as a service, you can use it in very similar ways and with similar freedoms as before (what I mean is that you can still modify Redis, redistribute it, use Redis commercially, in your for-profit company, for free, and so forth). You can *even* still sell Redis as a service if you want, as long as you release all the orchestration systems under the same license (something that nobody would likely do, but this shows the copyleft approach of the license). The license language is almost the same as the AGPL, with changes regarding the SAAS stuff. So, not OSI approved? Yes, but I have issues calling the SSPL a closed license.

You will say (I can hear you): the real problem is that there are companies controlling OSS projects‚Äô direction! So eventually the interests get more aligned with companies and less with the user base. I‚Äôm grateful there are many projects out there with zero direct companies involvement (if not external sponsorship), but well, you know what? Involvement of companies, in many large projects, actually slows down this process of skewing the right path. This surely happened in the case of Redis.

# The Robin Hood of software

Let's jump back into the past, to the first days of Redis.

When Redis started to become popular, I wanted to find a way to continue working on it. This was before VMware offered me to sponsor my work. I started to play with the idea of a business model, and guess what? It was in the form of closed source products that would kinda help people running Redis, in some way or the other. (Amazingly, one of the repositories associated with this idea is still online, showing commits of *15* years ago: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/antirez/redis-tools">https://github.com/antirez/redis-tools</a>)

I was about to try some kind of open core approach; I also remember I was thinking about delaying the BSD license for new code for six months, in order to create some kind of advantage for paying users. Now I don‚Äôt believe I would be a jerk and do strange games with my users, but I would not be what I was able to be thanks to VMware and, later, more extensively thanks to Redis Labs later: a freaking Robin Hood of open source software, where I was well compensated by a company and no, not to do the interests of the company itself, but only to make the best interests of the Redis community. This is a better setup than having your own company, I‚Äôm sure about that.

VMWare, and later Redis Labs, didn‚Äôt pay just for me. If you give a quick look at the repository contributions history, you‚Äôll see the second all time contributor to be Oran Agra (Redis) then there is Pieter Noordhuis (VMWare) and so forth.

So basically I think that 12 years of BSD code written just focusing on the user base is a good deal, and it‚Äôs something to be happy about. And right now for me the most important part is that the fracture with the community is not about licensing, or at least it‚Äôs not mainly about licensing. Actually the new license can solve some part of it: now there is no longer an incentive to just leave the core in maintenance mode and put the new developments into modules. With the new license, cloud providers can‚Äôt just cut and paste the Redis code base and sell it without any revenue sharing (was this really asking for too much? This could have prevented all the license switches you saw lately, not just Redis). With the new license, the spotlight can be back on the Redis core, with new, exciting features in the hands of the developers around the world. With tens of people well compensated for their work pushing useful, well documented changes in the GitHub repository. This is also one of the things I would like to help the company with, and I‚Äôll try hard. We need to make the license switch having good effects on the user base and features: that‚Äôs my idea.

# About AI, LLMs and vector indexing

But there is more: Redis is getting interested in developing vector capabilities, and in general to support the kind of programming you can do with AI. Now, every day, I read Hacker News, and I see a huge amount of technical people who dislike AI and the new developments. I also see a lot of people who don't even care to really try the latest models available in depth (hint: Claude AI is in its own league) and still dismiss them as kinda useless. For me, it‚Äôs different. I always loved neural networks. I wrote my first NN library in 2003 and was totally shocked by how powerful and cool the whole concept was. And now, at the end of 2024, I‚Äôm finally seeing incredible results in the field, things that looked like sci-fi a few years ago are now possible: Claude AI is my reasoning / editor / coding partner lately. I‚Äôm able to accomplish a lot more than I was able to do in the past. I often do *more work* because of AI, but I do better work. Recently I wrote a sci-fi short story for an Italian publisher, and thanks to Claude criticizing parts of it I rewrote the ending and produced a much better work (I didn‚Äôt let Claude write a single line of the story or the plot: great use of AI is not making machines do what you can do better).

Yesterday I needed to evaluate how much faster dot product could be computed with 8 bit quantization of my vectors; I told Claude I needed a benchmark designed in a specific way, and two minutes later I could test it, modify it, and understand whether it was worthwhile or not. Basically, AI didn‚Äôt replace me, AI accelerated me or improved me with feedback about my work. And I believe that (regardless of the popularity of RAG, which is not necessarily the main application, nor the most future proof or useful, as models contexts are becoming larger and larger, and soon popular models attention may have linear complexity), sorry for the digression, I was saying that I believe that learned embeddings are here to stay, and vector search is something that belongs to Redis for several reasons: first because vector indexes are data structures, particularly slow data structures, and such data structures can work very well in memory. Also, because I think I found the perfect API to expose them.

During my work in designing Redis, I always showed some contradictory tendencies. I was always ready to say ‚Äúno‚Äù to certain things that looked like perfect fits for the project (named Lua scripts, hash fields expires, that are both part of Redis now, btw) but at the same time I added Lua scripting capabilities ‚Äî when it looked like nuts, an interpreter inside Redis?! ‚Äî, the Pub/Sub capability, that seemed out of context, then streams, and even synthetic data structures that don‚Äôt exist in computer science books, like sorted sets. Because, for me, the fitness of new features into Redis was about two things: use cases and internal design fit. Redis, for me, is lego for programmers, not a ‚Äúproduct‚Äù.

# Vector sets

So recently I started to think that sorted sets can inspire a new data type, where the score is actually a vector. And while I was in talks with Rowan, I started to write a design document, then I started to implement a proof of concept of the new data structure, reimplementing HNSWs from scratch (instead of using one of the available libraries, since I wanted to tune every little bit), the Redis way, and well, I‚Äôm not sure how this will end, I‚Äôm still in the early stages of coding, but perhaps I may end up contributing code again, if this proposal gets accepted. The module I implemented (that would be later merged into the core ‚Äì for now it‚Äôs a module just for the sake of simplicity) implements new commands that manipulate embeddings directly. I‚Äôll show you just that as a hint:


VSIM top_1000_movies_imdb ELE "The Matrix"  WITHSCORES
 1) "The Matrix"
 2) "0.9999999403953552"
 3) "Ex Machina"
 4) "0.8680362105369568"
 5) "Akira"
 6) "0.8635441958904266"
 7) "District 9"
 8) "0.8631418347358704"
 9) "The Martian"
10) "0.8608670234680176"
11) "The Bourne Ultimatum"
12) "0.8599717319011688"
13) "The Bourne Supremacy"
14) "0.8591427505016327"
15) "Blade Runner"
16) "0.8585404753684998"
17) "Metropolis"
18) "0.8572960793972015"
19) "Inception"
20) "0.8521313071250916"

So you have VSIM, VADD, VCARD, all the obvious stuff. It‚Äôs exactly the idea of sorted sets, but with multi-dimensional scores (embeddings!) and K-NN matches. What do you think? And, of course, on top of that there are many implementation tricks to make stuff more efficient. But for now it‚Äôs proof of concept code, let me work a bit more on it. I‚Äôm implementing threading, dimensionality reduction, quantization, and many more things. Quite fun, to be honest.

As you can see, there is no mention of hybrid search, the recent buzzword about vector stores. Again, this is the Redis way: to let the developer have a role and decide on their tradeoffs: they know what they are modeling, after all. You have a vector index per key, and like what programmers were able to do with sorted sets, they will invent interesting splitting strategies, new schemas, Lua scripts, patterns and all that is required in order to model their use cases.

Still, while normally the associated item will likely be a small string or a document ID, nothing prevents it from being something more complex, with metadata that can be filtered later (but I‚Äôll resist). I just have the feeling that many use cases don‚Äôt really need complex server-side filtering, and can be modeled by pre-partitioning data.

What I see with great interest is the addition of a potential STORE option, to store the result into a sorted set instead of returning it to the user, where the score is the similarity, of course. All this also has complex and interesting effects on efficiency, scalability, ability to use scripting, and so forth: I hope I‚Äôll have the opportunity to talk more about it in the next weeks and months.

Ok, ok: back to the point of this blog post. But perhaps the above is the *real* point, having new ideas that can be exciting.

# So, I‚Äôm back üôÇ

All this to say that, I‚Äôm back. I think it‚Äôs the right moment for a big thank you to all the Redis community, for what it has done over the years. See you around, I hope there is something more to add to this journey.

P.S. I‚Äôm active on BlueSky, if you want to follow the developments of all this. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://bsky.app/profile/antirez.bsky.social">https://bsky.app/profile/antirez.bsky.social</a></pre></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-8525">
				
<p>Yesterday I arrived in Santa Clara for the <a href="https://q2b.qcware.com/2024-conferences/silicon-valley/">Q2B (Quantum 2 Business) conference</a>, which starts this morning, and where I‚Äôll be speaking Thursday on ‚ÄúQuantum Algorithms in 2024: How Should We Feel?‚Äù and also closing the conference via an Ask-Us-Anything session with John Preskill.  (If you‚Äôre at Q2B, reader, come and say hi!)</p>



<p>And to coincide with Q2B, yesterday Google‚Äôs Quantum group <a href="https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/">officially announced ‚ÄúWillow,‚Äù</a> its new 105-qubit superconducting chip with which it‚Äôs demonstrated an error-corrected surface code qubit as well as a new, bigger quantum supremacy experiment based on Random Circuit Sampling. I was lucky to be able to attend Google‚Äôs announcement ceremony yesterday afternoon at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, where <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=88">friend-of-the-blog-for-decades Dave Bacon</a> and other Google quantum people explained exactly what was done and took questions (the technical level was surprisingly high for this sort of event). I was also lucky to get a personal briefing last week from Google‚Äôs Sergio Boixo on what happened.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, yesterday Sundar Pichai <a href="https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/1866167429367468422">tweeted about Willow</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1866170803051499874">Elon Musk replied ‚ÄúWow.‚Äù</a>  It cannot be denied that those are both things that happened.</p>



<p>Anyway, all yesterday, I then read comments on Twitter, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42367649">Hacker News</a>, etc. complaining that, since there wasn‚Äôt yet a post on <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em>, how could anyone possibly know what to think of this?? For 20 years I‚Äôve been trying to teach the world how to fish in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space">Hilbert space</a>, but (sigh) I suppose I‚Äôll just hand out some more fish. So, here are my comments:</p>



<ol>
<li>Yes, this is great. Yes, it‚Äôs a real milestone for the field. To be clear: for anyone who‚Äôs been following experimental quantum computing these past five years (say, since Google‚Äôs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/opinion/google-quantum-computer-sycamore.html">original quantum supremacy milestone</a> in 2019), there‚Äôs no particular shock here. Since 2019, Google has roughly doubled the number of qubits on its chip and, more importantly, increased the qubits‚Äô coherence time by a factor of 5. Meanwhile, their 2-qubit gate fidelity is now roughly 99.7% (for controlled-Z gates) or 99.85% (for ‚Äúiswap‚Äù gates), compared to ~99.5% in 2019. They then did the more impressive demonstrations that predictably become possible with more and better qubits. And yet, even if the progress is broadly in line with what most of us expected, it‚Äôs still of course immensely gratifying to see everything actually work! Huge congratulations to everyone on the Google team for a well-deserved success.<br></li>



<li>I <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=8310">already blogged about this!!!</a> Specifically, I blogged about Google‚Äôs fault-tolerance milestone when its <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13687">preprint appeared on the arXiv</a> back in August. To clarify, what we‚Äôre all talking about now is the same basic technical advance that Google already reported in August, except now with the PR blitz from Sundar Pichai on down, a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08449-y"><em>Nature</em> paper</a>, an official name for the chip (‚ÄúWillow‚Äù), and a bunch of additional details about it.<br></li>



<li>Scientifically, the headline result is that, as they increase the size of their surface code, from 3√ó3 to 5√ó5 to 7√ó7, Google finds that their encoded logical qubit stays alive for <em>longer</em> rather than shorter.  So, this is a very important threshold that‚Äôs now been crossed.  As Dave Bacon put it to me, ‚Äúeddies are now forming‚Äù‚Äîor, to switch metaphors, after 30 years we‚Äôre now finally tickling the tail of the dragon of quantum fault-tolerance, the dragon that (once fully awoken) will let logical qubits be preserved and acted on for basically arbitrary amounts of time, allowing scalable quantum computation.<br></li>



<li>Having said that, Sergio Boixo tells me that Google will only consider itself to have created a ‚Äútrue‚Äù fault-tolerant qubit, once it can do fault-tolerant two-qubit gates with an error of ~10<sup>-6</sup> (and thus, on the order of a million fault-tolerant operations before suffering a single error).  We‚Äôre still some ways from <em>that</em> milestone: after all, in this experiment Google created only a <em>single</em> encoded qubit, and didn‚Äôt even try to do encoded operations on it, let alone on multiple encoded qubits.  But all in good time.  Please don‚Äôt ask me to predict how long, though empirically, the time from one major experimental QC milestone to the next now seems to be measured in years, which are longer than weeks but shorter than decades.<br></li>



<li>Google has also announced a new quantum supremacy experiment on its 105-qubit chip, based on <a href="http://Random Circuit Sampling">Random Circuit Sampling</a> with 40 layers of gates.  Notably, they say that, if you use the best currently-known simulation algorithms (based on Johnnie Gray‚Äôs optimized tensor network contraction), as well as an exascale supercomputer, their new experiment would take ~300 million years to simulate classically if memory is not an issue, or ~10<sup>25</sup> years if memory <em>is</em> an issue (note that a mere ~10<sup>10</sup> years have elapsed since the Big Bang).  Probably some people have come here expecting me to debunk those numbers, but as far as I know they‚Äôre entirely correct, with the caveats stated.  Naturally it‚Äôs possible that better classical simulation methods will be discovered, but meanwhile the experiments themselves will also rapidly improve.<br></li>



<li>Having said that, the <em>biggest</em> caveat to the ‚Äú10<sup>25</sup> years‚Äù result is one to which I fear Google drew insufficient attention. Namely, for the exact same reason why (as far as anyone knows) this quantum computation would take ~10<sup>25</sup> years for a classical computer to simulate, <strong>it would also take ~10<sup>25</sup> years for a classical computer to directly verify the quantum computer‚Äôs results!!</strong> (For example, by computing the ‚ÄúLinear Cross-Entropy‚Äù score of the quantum computer‚Äôs outputs.) For this reason, all validation of Google‚Äôs new supremacy experiment is indirect, based on extrapolations from smaller circuits, ones for which a classical computer <em>can</em> feasibly check the results. To be clear, I <em>personally</em> see no reason to doubt those extrapolations. But for anyone who wonders why I‚Äôve been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6YPAQlGejo">obsessing for years</a> about the need to design <em>efficiently</em> <em>verifiable</em> near-term quantum supremacy experiments: well, this is why! We‚Äôre now deeply into the unverifiable regime that I warned about.<br></li>



<li>In his remarks yesterday, Google Quantum AI leader Hartmut Neven talked about David Deutsch‚Äôs argument, way back in the 1990s, that quantum computers should force us to accept the reality of the Everettian multiverse, since ‚Äúwhere else could the computation have happened, if it wasn‚Äôt being farmed out to parallel universes?‚Äù And naturally there was lots of debate about that on Hacker News and so forth. Let me confine myself here to saying that, in my view, the new experiment doesn‚Äôt add anything <em>new</em> to this old debate. It‚Äôs yet another confirmation of the predictions of quantum mechanics. What those predictions <em>mean</em> for our understanding of reality can continue to argued as it‚Äôs been since the 1920s.<br></li>



<li>Cade Metz did a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/technology/google-quantum-computing.html">piece about Google‚Äôs announcement</a> for the <em>New York Times</em>.  Alas, when Cade reached out to me for comment, I decided that it would be too awkward, after what Cade <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=5310">did to my friend Scott Alexander</a> almost four years ago.  I talked to several other journalists, such as <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/google-passes-milestone-road-error-free-quantum-computer">Adrian Cho for <em>Science</em></a>.<br></li>



<li>No doubt people will ask me what this means for superconducting qubits versus trapped-ion or neutral-atom or photonic qubits, or for Google versus its many competitors in experimental QC. And, I mean, it‚Äôs not <em>bad</em> for Google or for superconducting QC! These past couple years I‚Äôd sometimes commented that, since Google‚Äôs 2019 announcement of quantum supremacy via superconducting qubits, the trapped-ion and neutral-atom approaches had seemed to be pulling ahead, with spectacular results from Quantinuum (trapped-ion) and QuEra (neutral atoms) among others. One could think of Willow as Google‚Äôs reply, putting the ball in competitors‚Äô courts likewise to demonstrate better logical qubit lifetime with increasing code size (or, better yet, full operations on logical qubits exceeding that threshold, without resorting to postselection).  The great advantage of trapped-ion qubits continues to be that you can move the qubits around (and also, the two-qubit gate fidelities seem somewhat ahead of superconducting).  But to compensate, superconducting qubits have the advantage that the gates are a thousand times faster, which makes feasible to do experiments that require collecting millions of samples.<br></li>



<li>Of course the <em>big</em> question, the one on everyone‚Äôs lips, was always how quantum computing skeptic Gil Kalai was going to respond.  But we need not wonder!  On his blog, <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2024/12/09/the-case-against-googles-claims-of-quantum-supremacy-a-very-short-introduction/">Gil writes</a>: ‚ÄúWe did not study yet these particular claims by Google Quantum AI but my general conclusion apply to them ‚ÄòGoogle Quantum AI‚Äôs claims (including published ones) should be approached with caution, particularly those of an extraordinary nature. These claims may stem from significant methodological errors and, as such, may reflect the researchers‚Äô expectations more than objective scientific reality.‚Äô ‚Äù&nbsp; Most of Gil‚Äôs post is devoted to re-analyzing data from Google‚Äôs 2019 quantum supremacy experiment, which Gil continues to believe can‚Äôt possibly have done what was claimed.  Gil‚Äôs problem is that the 2019 experiment was long ago superseded anyway: besides the new and more inarguable Google result, IBM, Quantinuum, QuEra, and USTC have now all <em>also</em> reported Random Circuit Sampling experiments with good results.  I predict that Gil, and others who take it as axiomatic that scalable quantum computing is impossible, will continue to have their work cut out for them in this new world.</li>

<p><strong><mark>Update:</mark></strong> <a href="https://x.com/skdh/status/1866352680899104960">Here‚Äôs Sabine Hossenfelder‚Äôs take.</a>  I don‚Äôt think she and I disagree about any of the actual facts; she just decided to frame things much more negatively.  Ironically, I guess 20 years of covering hyped, dishonestly-presented non-milestones in quantum computing has inclined me to be pretty positive when a group puts in this much work, demonstrates a <em>real</em> milestone, and talks about it without obvious falsehoods.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Large language models (LLMs) are restricted to reason in the "language space", where they typically express the reasoning process with a chain-of-thought (CoT) to solve a complex reasoning problem. However, we argue that language space may not always be optimal for reasoning. For example, most word tokens are primarily for textual coherence and not essential for reasoning, while some critical tokens require complex planning and pose huge challenges to LLMs. To explore the potential of LLM reasoning in an unrestricted latent space instead of using natural language, we introduce a new paradigm Coconut (Chain of Continuous Thought). We utilize the last hidden state of the LLM as a representation of the reasoning state (termed "continuous thought"). Rather than decoding this into a word token, we feed it back to the LLM as the subsequent input embedding directly in the continuous space. Experiments show that Coconut can effectively augment the LLM on several reasoning tasks. This novel latent reasoning paradigm leads to emergent advanced reasoning patterns: the continuous thought can encode multiple alternative next reasoning steps, allowing the model to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) to solve the problem, rather than prematurely committing to a single deterministic path like CoT. Coconut outperforms CoT in certain logical reasoning tasks that require substantial backtracking during planning, with fewer thinking tokens during inference. These findings demonstrate the promise of latent reasoning and offer valuable insights for future research.

				<div>
											<div><p><strong>Asterisk: </strong><em>You're famous for the Depths of Wikipedia account, where you share factoids from some of the most arcane, interesting, and surprising pages on Wikipedia. But you're also now a part of the broader Wikipedia community. How did you first get interested in the site, and how has your involvement changed over time?&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>Annie Rauwerda: </strong>I started back in high school editing typos and adding things that I noticed were missing ‚Äî like items to lists. But I had never done anything more than that because I was afraid of it because there are so many rules. Like, I'd seen the talk pages. And many of Wikipedia‚Äôs policies and guidelines and essays are very wordy.</p><p>Then I started the account ‚Äî even though I felt a little like a phony. But I remember the first time I felt really excited about the Wikipedia community was when I got on a call with the president of Wikimedia, New York City, back in 2020. And she had told me about a guy named Jim who retired from working at the phone company. He worked in that big AT&amp;T building that doesn't have windows. I don't know exactly what he did in there ‚Äî but cables and stuff. Anyway, he's retired now, and he spends all day biking around New York City and taking photos of infrastructure for Wikipedia, because Google Maps photos ‚Äî and so many other photos ‚Äî aren't freely licensed. And I was like, that's amazing.</p><p>So I kept hearing about more and more individual people and their shticks. There are a lot of generalists who edit Wikipedia, but there's something so endearing about the people who have just one thing. That's the first time I got excited. That was when I was brave enough to start making bolder changes and writing my own articles.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>Wikipedia's tagline is the </em>‚Äú<em>free encyclopedia, created and edited by volunteers around the world,</em>‚Äù<em> which makes it sound like a cohesive, happy little family. But as you alluded to, there's a lot of rules. It‚Äôs intimidating to write articles. Is it actually the case that there is a Wikipedia community, or is it more accurate to talk about communities within Wikipedia?</em></p><p><strong>AR: </strong>The answer is both, of course, but when people talk about Wikipedia as a decision making entity, usually they're talking about 300 people ‚Äî the people that weigh in to the very serious and (in my opinion) rather arcane, boring, arduous discussions. There's not that many of them.&nbsp;</p><p>There are also a lot of islands. There is one woman who mostly edits about hamsters, and always on her phone. She has never interacted with anyone else. Who is she? She's not part of any community that we can tell.</p><p>But then there are hundreds of thousands of editors on English Wikipedia. And within that there are very specific communities that are really interesting. There's the military history WikiProject. Maybe this makes sense because of the whole military thing, but they are very hierarchical. They have a lot of rules. They're very efficient in reviewing articles. Also Wikipedia has a pretty outdated rating system for articles ‚Äî one of which just got deprecated when ‚ÄúFeatured Articles‚Äù and ‚ÄúGood Articles‚Äù became a thing ‚Äî except for in military history, because that community was like, well, we need to have every level.&nbsp;</p><p>The same thing is true of the tropical cyclones community. They also do a lot of reviewing, and they also tend to skew very young. It's a lot of teenage boys in tropical cyclones. There's also a very strong anti-vandal community, who similarly skew very young.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>Before I had Wikipedia friends, I did not really understand how many different silos there were.</em></p><p><strong>AR: </strong>So many. There are acronyms that I hear that I do not know. The anti-vandal people especially are really off in their own world. One of the most effective, consistent, long serving anti-vandalism patrollers is not a teenager. He's a PhD-level material scientist who used to write very high quality articles about chemicals. And then he just got too upset about vandalism and decided ‚ÄúI have to devote hours of my life ‚Äî even though I have a family and a really demanding job ‚Äî to this.‚Äù</p></div>

											<div><p><strong>A: </strong><em>What is your sense of the people who do get drawn in and commit so much time. We hear about these people who've edited over three million Wikipedia articles. What's driving them?</em></p><p><strong>AR: </strong>Well ‚Äî two things. The three million articles guy, that's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pruitt">Stephen Pruitt</a>. He's wonderful. He kind of became the face of super editors. And it's because the edit count on Wikipedia is an imperfect proxy. Stephen uses bot-assisted editing ‚Äî which might be something like doing categorization ‚Äî and so he can do a lot of edits at one time.&nbsp; And so like, yeah, he's made an edit to a bunch of articles, but it's not the same as writing three million articles. But then again, he also writes a lot of articles.</p><p>As to what makes people get sucked in? I think that one shared quality of every single person I've met who has stuck around Wikipedia for a long time is that they have very little hesitation to work hard, and they put a low value on their own time. Maybe they are even willing to waste time. Like, people are very willing to raise concerns and discuss and accept critiques. I also think people tend to care a lot about precise language and about being correct. Some of that comes from the culture of Wikipedia, but I think it's also what predisposes them to edit it in the first place.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>Editing can seem incredibly inefficient sometimes, given that Wikipedia is so democratic and anyone can enter into any discussion. Take the page for </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogurt"><em>yogurt.</em></a><em> The debate over whether to call it ‚Äúyogurt‚Äù or ‚Äúyoghurt‚Äù lasted </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Yogurt/yogurtspellinghistory"><em>seven years</em></a><em> and totaled over 140,000 </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Yogurt/Archive_2%23Requested_move_revisited"><em>words</em></a><em>. What happened there specifically, and what makes the process so inefficient in general?</em>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AR: </strong>I have not read all 140,000 words. That's multiple Shakespeare plays ‚Äî which I would rather read.&nbsp;</p><p>My impression is that for the debates that last for so many years, people will tap in for a couple of months, and then things will kind of settle, and then they'll tap out and let other people argue. I don't really know what's going on there. I wonder if maybe it's just because people feel so invested because they've already sunk so much time and energy in and think they need to ‚Äúwin.‚Äù</p><p>But also ‚Äî to the yogurt example specifically ‚Äî when it comes to British versus American English, or Australian or Nigerian or Indian English, basically, the policy is kind of a free-for-all, and that's how it's been for a long time. It usually comes down to whether the topic has to deal with Nigeria or India. If it's about George Bush, then, like, please write it in American English. If not, the rule is to stick with whatever the original writer used. And so that's not always very satisfying. And then there's yogurt. That's not tied to any one country.</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>You had a </em><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@depthsofwikipedia/video/7373142677350829358?lang=en"><em>TikTok</em></a><em> about another internal Wikipedia debate. Until 2018, there were no freely licensed photos of Kim Jong Un. No one wanted to violate Korean copyright law (though there was a debate about that). And no media outlets freely licensed any photos. And this never got resolved, and so we had hand-drawn images of Kim Jong Un instead.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>All of which leads to my larger question, which is ‚Äî is the writing and editing process working?</em> &nbsp;</p><p><strong>AR: </strong>I mean, the answer is no. There are people who just kind of wait for their opponent to get carpal tunnel ‚Äî and that's not productive for anyone. I would call those sorts of debates tendentious. You're not trying to find consensus. &nbsp;</p><p>I think when it comes to Wikipedia rules and interpreting the rules, it's impossible. You can't follow every single rule. And I'm using the word ‚Äúrule,‚Äù but, on Wikipedia there are ‚Äúpolicies,‚Äù which are like the Bible. But they change all the time because people work on them. And if you're going to change a policy, then it has to be discussed. And that happens all the time.</p><p>But then there are essays which are just written by a person. And they look a lot like policies! They just have a little thing on the top that says: ‚ÄúThis is an essay.‚Äù And then there are guidelines! They basically look like rules, and people kind of treat them like rules. And so you can't really follow all of them because there's stuff that contradicts other stuff. It's a Catch-22.</p><p>Back in the day, there were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars">five</a> ‚Äî call them guidelines, decrees, commandments ‚Äî sent down from on high from the less good co-founder, Larry Sanger. And the last one was: ‚ÄúIgnore all rules.‚Äù And ha! That's still there.&nbsp;</p><p>But within that, there‚Äôs a guideline: ‚ÄúBe bold.‚Äù And people still talk about both of those all the time. But there are rules where, if you don't follow them, and you don't have good standing or a good reputation, you're gonna get immediately blocked. And so ‚ÄúIgnore all the rules‚Äù and ‚ÄúBe bold‚Äù aren't actually true.&nbsp;</p><p>And that's the unfortunate thing about growing and becoming a massive encyclopedia that's more respected than it was in 2004. It's a lot harder to truly be this free-for-all, libertarian utopia that the founders thought it might be.</p></div>

											<div><p><strong>A: </strong><em>You said there's, like, 300 people who are really making a lot of the decisions about Wikipedia editing. Who are they?&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>AR: </strong>I threw 300 out there because ‚Äî if there's a big, big vote ‚Äî it's generally about 300 people who show up. About two years ago, they changed the Wikipedia skin, and so the table of contents appeared differently, and there was more white space, which people care a lot about. More than 300 people showed up for those votes ‚Äî and that's about what you can expect for big votes. Usually those people are either administrators, of which, on English Wikipedia, there are fewer than a thousand active. And sometimes they're just people who care a lot about policies.&nbsp;</p><p>Who are they? I think that I can generalize because I go to a lot of meetups. There's a bimodal age distribution. There's a lot of students, very bright college students, grad students, and sometimes a precocious high schooler. (They're the best ‚Äî I love them.) And then, there's a bunch of retirees. I think common professions are software and computer engineering.&nbsp;</p><p>A lot of people work blue-collar jobs. Wikipedia is like their intellectual outlet. And there are some people who are severely disabled in some way, so they don't leave the house for a traditional job ‚Äî and that gives them more time to edit Wikipedia. It's more male than female.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>You‚Äôve said that the Jimmy Wales, aughts-era goal of ‚Äúbuilding the sum of all human knowledge‚Äù was perhaps not the right goal. Why?</em></p><p><strong>AR: </strong>There are seven million articles on the English Wikipedia ‚Äî which is, I think, the biggest Wikipedia. So many of them are getting dusty. They are outdated. They are suffering from, uh, a not very ethical PR person going in there. Basically, it's a lot to maintain. Do you remember Aaron Swartz?</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>Sure.</em></p><p><strong>AR: </strong>Okay. So he was a Wikipedian. Back in 2006 he put out a <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia">blog post</a> that made a splash because it wasn't what people expected. The thinking back then was ‚Äî okay, we have these few thousand people that are quite active on Wikipedia ‚Äî they‚Äôre the ones doing all the work, right? And he was like, no. The bulk of Wikipedia's work is very much the people in the background that just see when something's wrong and fix it. Like what I did when I was 18.&nbsp;</p><p>So if the article is cottage cheese, and someone comes in and replaces it with ‚Äúpoop,‚Äù those will get fixed right away because first of all, there's anti-vandalism people watching, but also, even if they miss it, people are looking up cottage cheese a lot.&nbsp;</p><p>But if you're vandalizing or if you're doing something sketchy in an article about some&nbsp; really obscure person that doesn't totally meet notability standards and who isn't getting any page views, it's just impossible to maintain that stuff.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>What's the process for something getting deleted?</em></p><p><strong>AR: </strong>There's this place. We all solemnly march down to it. Anyone who wants to show up can, and then we just vote. It's called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_for_deletion">articles for deletion</a>. Let's see what's up right now. The most recent thing I deleted was a page that had barely been changed from the 1911 encyclopedia, which was totally plundered back in the day when they were just trying to fill Wikipedia.</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>Because it was public domain.</em></p><p><strong>AR: </strong>Right. And it was a term for a mountain that hadn't been in use since the ‚Äò30s. It was what colonists called it. So it was a duplicate article, essentially.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, you nominate something for deletion, and people vote. Your vote really doesn't count very much if you don't add a reason. But then, once there's been a little bit of discussion, like, I don't know, usually if five people weigh in, that's sufficient. If it's a weird name of an old mountain, people don't really care. But if it's a big deletion, they get really huge.&nbsp;</p><p>I think more than half of the things that get nominated end up getting deleted but I need to double check that. And then, if people don't participate very much for some reason, which usually happens when it's a really boring topic that no one cares about, or it's boring and it's not clear whether or not it should be deleted ‚Äî then it gets re-listed.</p><p>The standards change sometimes. Once in a blue moon, you'll have a huge deletion event, like ‚Äî I don't know ‚Äî we're deleting all the Olympians that don't have sources apart from this one register. So goodbye curlers from 1930! We actually do not know who you are.</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>Speaking of sources, we are both editors. We've had the debate, sometimes, over whether or not we should cite Wikipedia. Can you answer this for us?</em>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AR: </strong>If you're putting anything out into the world, please do not cite Wikipedia! Do not do that. I don't trust it. Ever. That's why you check all the sources. Ideally, every single thing, every single piece of information besides, like, ‚Äúthe sky is blue‚Äù-type stuff should be tied to a source. I would say, just cite those because people interpret things weirdly sometimes, and you never know.</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>I'm actually surprised to hear you say that though maybe I shouldn‚Äôt be. I've definitely had conversations with people that assume that there's been so much work put into Wikipedia at this point ‚Äî especially on really well sourced articles ‚Äî that it's trustworthy enough.</em>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AR: </strong>If it's a featured article, I trust it a little bit more. But I still wouldn't ever do MLA formatting with Wikipedia. But I love to trust Wikipedia when I'm just doing cursory reading about things I am interested in.</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>This gets to areas where Wikipedia is strong. The Napoleon page, for instance, has over 500 sources. And you've touched on Wikipedia article grades. Where is Wikipedia strong and where does it need work?</em>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AR: </strong>Okay, strong suits. Military ships of history. So strong. Tropical storms, strong. US military history, British military history. I would say, generally, it's pretty good on US politics ‚Äî even local politics. There are articles about pretty much all the recent elections in random counties for the past, like, 75 years.</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>This fits with my theory that these are the same people who are going to city council meetings.</em></p></div>
											<div><p><strong>AR </strong>Yeah. Things that are bad? I don't really talk about this as much as I should, but as an editor, I am very passionate about the articles that have a lot of page views but get very little attention from editors. Those often are things that are low-brow pop culture topics that are not naturally interesting to the median Wikipedia editor. For me, the one that I always notice is influencers. Influencers often have horrendous articles. You can tell that somebody that didn't really get the norms of Wikipedia went in there and added ‚Äî&nbsp; I don't know ‚Äî&nbsp; six paragraphs about the most minor scandal, all of which cited tabloids.&nbsp;</p><p>Also business articles. Or pages on CEOs. Sometimes those articles are really unbalanced, poorly written, weird, or outdated. That's not good. If they're a powerful person, we should know more about them.</p><p>And then of course people talk about the gender gap. There's been this huge push to write articles about women, and that's been pretty successful. One thing that doesn't really get at, though, is articles about hobbies or topics that are traditionally more popular among females.</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>I have some friends who are very into this, and they're going back and fixing the textile history articles.</em></p><p><strong>AR: </strong>Yes, textiles! It's really amazing how much hasn't changed since 2003, when one Australian woman basically did it all. And then there haven't been a lot of contributions since, which is a huge bummer.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>Are there any internal mechanisms in Wikipedia for the allocation of attention beyond just the natural interests of the editors? A clearinghouse for saying: ‚ÄúThis thing needs help. Go fix that‚Äù?</em>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AR: </strong>There's the Signpost newspaper, which is Wikipedia's internal newspaper. That always has an ‚Äúarticle for improvement‚Äù or whatever. There's daily tips that you can sign up for. And then there are big campaigns that come from on high from The Foundation. And those are almost always something like ‚Äúphotograph a monument‚Äù because people love to do that and it's a good gateway activity. Or ‚Äúwrite a biography about a woman,‚Äù which is good. Sometimes there are photograph campaigns for culture or heritage. But you can only nominate so many topics, and they'll only get attention for a week.</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>It sounds like Wikipedia needs to bring in newer, different demographics of writers and editors ‚Äî but you've also alluded to the fact it's very intimidating to start up. Is there a process for acculturating new writers?&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>AR: </strong>Yeah, definitely. I care a lot about holding newbies‚Äô hands. A lot of the old timers that came up in 2004 ‚Äî when there were people who actually believed the ‚ÄúIgnore all rules‚Äù thing ‚Äî they never had to deal with all of the norms that exist now. Even if you're a Nobel Prize winner, just getting all the norms takes a minute. You have to learn it. There are some people who are truly so welcoming and kind that it makes me feel very, very excited and hopeful about the future. And then there are others that are total assholes. And that's how it goes, I guess.&nbsp;</p><p>This happens in a lot of organizations. It's not just Wikipedia. There are people who are very good at what they do, but they're also unpleasant and gruff. They get called ‚Äúunblockable‚Äù because they don't violate the rules enough. But ‚Äî and I don't know if this is really a trend ‚Äî from my vantage point it seems like people are less tolerant of the old school, laddish internet type trolling. And that is exciting too.</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>Wikipedia is unique in that it still feels very web 1.0 in its design and aesthetics. But it has attracted, like you said, lots of younger editors. You are Gen Z and you are both internet native and also Wikipedia native. How intergenerational is it?</em></p><p><strong>AR: </strong>The stats on Wikipedia editors are so bad that they're almost useless because people tend to be quite private. And if it's a survey that's coming from the Foundation, there's a whole mistrust of the authority thing. People don't really like to fill those out. But that's the best, objective guess at how multi-generational it is. And that is showing that people are aging. The median, and probably average, Wikipedia editor appears to be older now than ten years ago.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>Okay, you've alluded to the Foundation a couple times, and the tone of it has made it sound like the Capitol in the Hunger Games.</em></p><p><strong>AR: </strong>It's not that. So there's a lot of overlap. If you love Wikipedia, working at the Foundation is probably your dream job. It's amazing. But people butt heads with the Foundation a lot. It's fun to complain about The Man. That's definitely part of it.&nbsp;</p><p>A major factor is that, maybe four years ago, there was a big flare-up called Forum Gate, which people haven't quite recovered from. Wikipedia has this arbitration committee, and the executives at the Foundation permanently banned a guy who ‚Äî while he is in the category of gruff, not friendly, not the most empathetic ‚Äî was a very effective editor on the site. And tons of people either stepped back for a while or resigned in protest.</p><p>Also the Foundation is big now. And I think that some people, even if they don't admit it, hold some jealousy and resentment that there's this fancy office in San Francisco. For a nonprofit job, it's a good one. Whereas the people who actually make the product? They don't make any money. It doesn't always feel like we're trusted by the Foundation.&nbsp;</p><p>But I like the Foundation. There's a natural animosity that comes up sometimes ‚Äî but overall, we work together. And more than half of the Foundation staff works on the tech ‚Äî servers, MediaWiki ‚Äî because you can't get enough volunteers to do that.&nbsp;</p></div>
											
											<div><p><strong>A:</strong> <em>How much authority does the Foundation have over the site?</em>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AR: </strong>The Foundation doesn't really know what it's there to do. That's kind of what people have been saying for, like, 20 years. Some roles are very clear.&nbsp; If someone is threatening violence, give them to the trust and safety division. If there's a major tech problem, that's the Foundation. The volunteers just don't have the bandwidth for all that. But the patrolling, the determining of the rules, the participating in discussions ‚Äî the Foundation is very hands off for all of that.</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>The Did You Know section on Wikipedia features a trove of random facts every day, and that's run by a bureaucracy of volunteers. But it's not neutrally curated. It's an area for editors to show off their special interests, which has resulted in some topics being, I think, restricted. And some of those are ones you would expect, like Taylor Swift. But apparently, also, such topics as Gibraltar and German hymns?</em>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AR: </strong>So it's not like German hymns is ‚Äúbanned,‚Äù and neither is Taylor Swift, or even Gibraltar ‚Äî although that one was a bit more firm. It's mostly just like ‚Äî hey, can we cool it? Can we cool it with the German hymns?&nbsp;</p><p>The idea behind the Did You Know section is to be interesting for readers, sort of. But really it's there because people want to show off their brand new articles, and we want to let people feel the pride of showing off their new articles. It's also a way to get a mini-review process ‚Äî to make sure everything in there is cited ‚Äî and it will get copy-edited for you. It's a good way to get people used to getting edited and reviewed.</p><p>But it's mostly the same squad that does the reviewing. So there are some people who never submit to the Did You Know section, and there are a lot of people that submit everything. So if you pay attention to it consistently you'll be, like, oh, another New Zealand coin. (There's a girl who's been doing lots of those, and she rocks.) Or another article about a time zone! It makes me feel a little tender. It's kind of cute.</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>People are going to ChatGPT now as their first place to learn about a topic, compared to Wikipedia. I'm curious as to your thoughts on how LLMs are going to shift what Wikipedia feels like, and what you see as the future there.</em></p><p><strong>AR: </strong>The traffic to Wikipedia has not taken a dramatic hit.<strong> </strong>Maybe that will change in the future. The Foundation talks about coming opportunities, or the threat of LLMs. With my friends that edit a lot, it hasn't really come up a ton because I don't think they care. It doesn't affect us. We're doing the same thing. Like if all the large language models eat up the stuff we wrote and make it easier for people to get information ‚Äî great. We made it easier for people to get information.</p><p>And if LLMs end up training on blogs made by AI slop and having as their basis this ouroboros of generated text, then it's possible that a Wikipedia-type thing ‚Äî written and curated by a human ‚Äî could become even more valuable.&nbsp;</p></div>

<p>Mozilla is removing the Do Not Track (DNT) setting from the Firefox browser. This change will take effect in version 135 and beyond, where the DNT setting will no longer be available. The change is already live and can be seen in the Nightly version.</p>



<p>Do Not Track (DNT) is a browser setting that allows users to signal their preference not to be tracked by websites. When enabled, it sends a special <a href="https://windowsreport.com/activate-do-not-track-to-secure-your-browsing-data/">HTTP header to websites indicating the user‚Äôs choice to opt out of tracking.</a></p>



<figure><a href="https://windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/send-websites-a-do-not-track-request-setting-in-Firefox.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="543" src="https://windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/send-websites-a-do-not-track-request-setting-in-Firefox-1024x543.png" alt="" srcset="https://windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/send-websites-a-do-not-track-request-setting-in-Firefox-1024x543.png 1024w, https://windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/send-websites-a-do-not-track-request-setting-in-Firefox-300x159.png 300w, https://windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/send-websites-a-do-not-track-request-setting-in-Firefox-768x407.png 768w, https://windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/send-websites-a-do-not-track-request-setting-in-Firefox-700x371.png 700w, https://windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/send-websites-a-do-not-track-request-setting-in-Firefox-415x220.png 415w, https://windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/send-websites-a-do-not-track-request-setting-in-Firefox.png 1365w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>send websites a do not track request setting in Firefox. Image credit: WindowsReport.</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">Wikipedia</a>, DNT was introduced in 2009 by researchers Christopher Soghoian and Sid Stamm, and Mozilla Firefox was the first browser to implement this feature.</p>



<p>However, as we approach 2025, with growing concerns about online privacy and data protection, Mozilla believes that DNT is no longer an effective privacy measure.<a href="https://windowsreport.com/web-browser-do-not-track-settings-will-no-longer-be-honored-yahoo/"> Many websites ignore the DNT signal</a>. Therefore, Mozilla has removed the DNT signal from Firefox version 135.</p>



<p>We verified the Nightly build‚Äôs ‚ÄúWebsite Privacy Preferences‚Äù and confirmed that the option to ‚ÄúSend websites a ‚ÄòDo Not Track‚Äô request‚Äù is no longer present. This is also confirmed by <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1928087">the bug</a> ‚ÄúRemove DNT control from about:preferences#privacy.‚Äù</p>



<figure><a href="https://windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Do-Not-Track-setting-removed.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="675" src="https://windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Do-Not-Track-setting-removed-1024x675.png" alt="" srcset="https://windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Do-Not-Track-setting-removed-1024x675.png 1024w, https://windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Do-Not-Track-setting-removed-300x198.png 300w, https://windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Do-Not-Track-setting-removed-768x506.png 768w, https://windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Do-Not-Track-setting-removed-700x462.png 700w, https://windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Do-Not-Track-setting-removed-334x220.png 334w, https://windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Do-Not-Track-setting-removed.png 1098w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Firefox Nightly without the Do Not Track Setting. Image Credit: WindowsReport.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Mozilla believes that privacy preference is not honored by websites and that sending the Do Not Track signal may impact your privacy. The company has updated Firefox‚Äôs Do Not Track <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-turn-do-not-track-feature">help support page</a> to confirm that.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Starting in <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/find-what-version-firefox-you-are-using">Firefox version</a> 135, the ‚ÄúDo Not Track‚Äù checkbox will be removed. Many sites do not respect this indication of a person‚Äôs privacy preferences, and, in some cases, it can reduce privacy.</p>
</blockquote>



<h3 id="h-do-not-track-alternative-global-privacy-control">Do Not Track Alternative: Global Privacy Control</h3>



<p>The company recommends using the<a href="https://windowsreport.com/firefox-global-privacy-control/"> Global Privacy Control </a>setting as an alternative to prevent websites from tracking user data.</p>



<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you wish to ask websites to respect your privacy, you can use the ‚ÄúTell websites not to sell or share my data‚Äù setting. This option is built on top of the Global Privacy Control (GPC). GPC is respected by increasing numbers of sites and enforced with legislation in some regions. To learn more about this, please read <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/global-privacy-control">Global Privacy Control</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It‚Äôs unclear what will happen to users who have DNT enabled when they upgrade to the affected Firefox version. They may see a message stating that ‚ÄúFirefox no longer supports Do Not Track,‚Äù or the signal may still be sent to websites. We have asked Mozilla to clarify this and will provide an update when we receive a response.</p>



<p>While Mozilla has removed DNT, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and other browsers still offer this setting. We will have to see if this move impacts these browser vendors to pull DNT support as well.</p>



<p><strong>To enable Do Not Track in Chrome:</strong></p>



<p>Go to Settings &gt; Privacy and Security &gt; Send a ‚ÄúDo Not Track‚Äù request with your browsing traffic.</p>



<p><strong>To enable Do Not Track in Microsoft Edge:</strong></p>



<p>Navigate to Settings &gt; Privacy, Search, and Services &gt; Toggle ‚ÄúSend Do Not Track requests‚Äù to ‚Äúon.‚Äù</p>



<p>While Firefox itself recommends GPC, you can enhance your privacy by using privacy-focused browsers like Brave and DuckDuckGo, ad blockers, VPN services, and browser extensions such as Privacy Badger.</p>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://windowsreport.com/mozillas-controversial-experiment-to-set-firefox-as-default-browser-during-installation-on-windows-11/">Mozilla started planning to run a bold experiment for Windows </a>that would make Firefox the default browser. This experiment involves a clever trick that affects the Firefox download page and installer.</p>

Banks are inherently in the business of gambling. Since time immemorial the defining characteristic of a bank is to convert short-term liabilities (deposits) to long-term assets (loans).

There, I said it. [Source: I have 10 years of HFT / market making experience]</p><p>PFOF is misunderstood, as others pointed out here. However, it's not a 'win win win'; it's more like a 'win win lose'. This is something even media gets wrong <i>all</i> the time. I've only seen this mentioned as a footnote in Matt Levine.</p><p>[Note: I don't know if Double is doing it, or if they plan to - this is just a general summary].</p><p>So:</p><p>* Win: Citadel (etc.) make money by trading against order flow that's more benign than the resting orders in public exchanges.</p><p>* Win: The client gets a better execution price than the publicly displayed bid/ask. Back when I started (20+ years ago, yes, I'm old) this was 1/100 of a penny, the legal minimum (due to minimum tick print size). But recently, the market orders in my personal account have been getting price improvement of almost half the spread.</p><p>Things are a bit different in some <i>options</i> exchanges, where retail flow gets some priority, regardless of when you joined a given price point at the order book queue. But almost all equity exchanges use price-time priority, you're almost guaranteed adverse selection.</p><p>Example for those who may need it: if you place a buy limit @ $1.07 in a 1.07 (bid) - 1.08 (ask) market. Then, the bids at 1.07 slowly disappear, because firms such as "Shark Holdings, LLC" (the trading firm consisting solely of quants with unpronounceable foreign-sounding names) will cancel their bids if they sense the market is going down, e.g. if they observe a lot of trades at the bid. Then, the new market will be 1.06-1.07, and you will have sold at the ask.</p><p>OK, so here's who <i>loses</i>: any large orders that have to trade in the open markets (not 'dark pools', ATS, etc.) will be stuck with more 'toxic' orders, and get worse execution. The question is: do I gain more as an <i>individual</i> from having my (quasi-entertainment-value, usually small) personal account orders get better execution? or do I lose more by having my <i>indirect</i> trading (possibly an index fund that I hold my retirement money in) get worse execution? I think it's the latter. But nobody connects the dots and/or seems to care. [Of course, this is more complicated, because large institutional orders aren't 100% on behalf of small investors.]</p><p>You may say this component of market structure is stupid/wrong/suboptimal. I personally think so. But this is the reality of it. It's encased in rules. There was some attempt to get rid of PFOF a couple of years ago, but it failed. So that's not going away.</p><p>So this is a win-win-lose: it's globally suboptimal, but for the 2 first 'wins', it's locally optimal.</p><p>Summary: although PFOF has bad optics and stimulates pitchfork-y instincts ("big bad evil companies are out to gitcha", etc.), if your broker doesn't do it, you're both leaving money on the table - and guess what, they'd have to charge you some other way.</p></div></td></tr>

I'm also worried about exposing myself to your organizational risk (e.g. your internal controls failing and an employe running off with the money, your accountant falling victim to a deepfake scam, etc.) which I suspect is going to be much higher than your competitors.

The market size is obviously tantalizing but I feel like the segments are all reasonably well served as it stands. For the folks that you're really targeting, I think it's very hard to beat Vanguard.

                  <p>Cool product! But I would love for this to have a decentralized backend using tokenized assets as the securities. It would help me solve the trust issue with yet another new FinTech startup and then I wouldn't mind letting you collect the PFOF if I could swap out backends if needed. Or can let the community develop the best strategies/factor tilts/tax alpha for each individual's unique situation.</p>

<!-- <div style="text-align:center;opacity:30%;">Tree Calculus is the most compact Turing complete and intensional logic</div> -->
<!-- <div style="text-align:center;opacity:30%;">One operator. Trivial semantics. Turing complete. Intensional.</div> -->










<ul>
  <li><a name="intensional"></a>
    <h2>Intensional</h2>
    <p>Tree Calculus can perform <strong>program analysis without quotation</strong>:
  The ability to reflect on programs is built right into the reduction rules. This means that anything from type checking to compilation and optimization can happen from within programs and without additional external tools (<a href="https://treecalcul.us/live/?example=demo-program-optimization">üöÄdemo</a>, <a href="https://treecalcul.us/live/?example=demo-fusion">üöÄfusion demo</a>).
  In particular, this supports arbitrary type systems and <strong>truly gradual typing or verification</strong>: Static vs dynamic checks are one and the same function call, just at different points in time (<a href="https://treecalcul.us/live/?example=demo-gradual-typing">üöÄdemo</a>).</p>

    <p>Furthermore, intensionality allows compiling and deploying programs (or elaborate combinations like <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Tier-splitting-through-declarative-annotation-To-begin-the-partitioning-we-first_fig3_3249568" target="_blank">tier splitting</a>) right from the program itself<!-- (demo TODO)-->. This makes for all-powerful REPLs; translated to Python, imagine using nothing but a Jupyter Notebook for an entire product lifecycle, from prototyping to productionization.</p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="powerful"></a>
    <h2>Powerful</h2>
    <p>Tree Calculus is Turing-complete and intensional (<a href="https://treecalcul.us/live/?example=demo-turing-intensional">üöÄdemo</a>).
  Combined with its trivial abstract syntax, it becomes easy to serialize any value, including programs (<a href="https://treecalcul.us/live/?example=demo-serialize-anything">üöÄdemo</a>).</p>

    <p>But furthermore, there is in fact <strong>no distinction between a program and its encoding</strong>.
  Such distinctions complicate descriptions and formal proofs of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem" target="_blank">Halting Problem</a>, whereas with Tree Calculus as the substrate, Halting Problem formulations become more straightforward (<a href="https://treecalcul.us/live/?example=demo-halting-problem">üöÄdemo</a>).</p>

    <p>Despite its simplicity, Tree Calculus is not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_tarpit" target="_blank">Turing tarpit</a>. Data encodings and algorithms are <strong>asymptotically optimal</strong>. In practice:
  Typical functions to manipliate lists (map, filter, concat, fold, ‚Ä¶) are binary trees with a few hundred nodes (<a href="https://treecalcul.us/live/?example=demo-size-of-meaningful-programs">üöÄdemo</a>).
  The compiler used in all demos is also written in Tree Calculus, not particularly optimized, yet quite efficient<!-- (demo TODO)-->.</p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="concise"></a>
    <h2>Concise</h2>
    <p>The <a href="https://treecalcul.us/specification">abstract syntax of Tree Calculus</a> is trivial: <strong>Values are unlabeled binary trees</strong>.
  The reduction rules act on trees of higher degree, until they are binary.
  (Bonus for readers familiar with Œª-calculus: Recursive functions have normal form/are values in Tree Calculus.)
  The definition is compact, precise and imports no other ‚Äúwell known‚Äù definitions or standards,
  such as JSON, UTF8, two‚Äôs complement integers, IEEE floats or their respective arithmetic operations, which have tricky corner cases.</p>

    <p>However, arbitrary concepts like that can be bootstrapped in Tree Calculus swiftly and explicitly (<a href="https://treecalcul.us/live/?example=demo-bootstrap-basics">üöÄdemo</a>).
  This makes Tree Calculus a great language for <strong>modeling and formal specifications</strong>,
  but also very suitable for <strong>education</strong>: There are no incumbent towers of abstraction, but they can be introduced and modeled incrementally<!-- (demo TODO)-->.</p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="portable"></a>
    <h2>Portable</h2>
    <p>The <a href="https://treecalcul.us/specification">syntax and semantics of Tree Calculus</a> are <strong>minimal and self-contained</strong>,
  relying on no platform-specific concepts or abstractions.
  As a result, it is trivial to write interpreters on any platform or in any programming language (<a href="https://treecalcul.us/live/?example=demo-portability">üöÄdemo</a>).
  Such interpreters are effectively safe by construction, since the reduction rules are simple (resulting in little code) and pure (no inherent access to the environment or resources).</p>

    

    <p>The ability to bootstrap the full power of Tree Calculus anywhere makes it an
  excellent <strong>configuration as code</strong> language in a heterogeneous system.
  Developers could write Tree Calculus programs that generate, say, JSON,
  and use an interpreter (that is tiny compared to a JSON parser) to materialize
  the configuration anywhere (<a href="https://treecalcul.us/live/?example=demo-emit-json">üöÄdemo</a>).
  <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2016/05/27/production-engineering/python-in-production-engineering/" target="_blank">This article</a> describes how Meta uses Python for a similar purpose.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<!--* <h3>Education</h3> In a world of ever-growing abstractions, the distance between low-level (e.g. hardware, bits) and high-level (e.g. WebRTC, syscalls) can seem unsurmountable for new learners. Tree Calculus lives entirely outside of this stack and has no trouble modeling anything from hardware to complex abstractions. Where real world technology is often opaque, resorts to imprecise specifications (if at all) or assumes familiarity with other concepts (sometimes recursively), Tree Calculus is transparent throughout: Everything is a tree, everything follows the same rules. -->

We also provide plastic cards (think: gift card) for people who don't want to use their phone but we see 80%+ of people interact completely on their phone/online. We have an app and website (same codebase, Quasar framework) and for in-person payment (entry, bar) we provide iPads with connected CC readers.</p><p>My best advice is this: your hardest challenges will not be technical in nature. The hardest part is the equipment, dealing with customers, hand-holding the festival organizers. I don't say any of that as some gross thing or bad thing, just reality. In fact, I think I've succeeded larged based on the in-person aspect (We travel to the event and are on-site for the event) and being the "I have all the answers for your festival payments"-person. Rolling with the punches is a huge part of it.</p><p>The whole thing runs on AWS Lambda with a postgres DB from Neon.tech. I'll be honest, it's incredibly over-architected, the whole thing could run a a couple (or even 1) servers as a traditional NodeJS app without issue (and with less complexity) but I used this project as learning experience and a chance to try our some technology I was interested in. Lambda is incredibly cool and I think I might have one of the best use-cases for it (incredibly spikey load: no traffic for 9 mo, tiny traffic for presales for 1-2 months, 1 month with higher sales, then 1-2 days of the event with crazy sales) but the debugging story isn't the best. SST makes it 10000x better than anything else I've tried and the developer experience is bar-none for writing lambdas but all the other crap (CloudFormation, logs, monitoring, etc) is so much overhead. If I was writing this again today I'd probably look at something like NestJS but I won't let myself re-write the code (again) without a pressing reason and if I need to spend time anywhere it's sales/marketing.</p><p>Here is my, crappy, "marketing" website: <a href="https://grubbux.com/" rel="nofollow">https://grubbux.com/</a></p></div></td></tr>

It's similar to escape games, but it's more story driven and easy to do in short sessions and at your own pace.
It started with my wife making the first magazine pretty much by herself. Since then we've made more magazines together and the business is slowly growing.</p><p>We're selling them mainly on our custom lightweight online store. It's done with minimal JS and Node as backend, Stripe as payment provider. We have a Meta pixel to help us track our advertising conversion, but we've disabled cookies, they just felt somehow dirty... It's nice to have power over these things when running your own business. As a next step for the website I'm thinking of including a templating language in the workflow, now I'm still doing edits with search and replace, sometimes missing things... but I do enjoy the simplicity.</p><p>The actual business has two main challenges: 
First is discoverability. It's a pretty unique product, an adventure escape game in a magazine. It doesn't sell well in physical game shops since it doesn't look like a game. We sell well in conventions where we get to explain what the product is, but we also want some weekends for ourselves! Meta ads for our online shop are working surprisingly well though.</p><p>The second and bigger challenge is shipping. Our flat is filled with boxes, and the time I spend sorting magazines, enveloping them, printing address labels, carrying them to the post office... it's really not worth my hourly rate as an engineer (Nor my wife's, but I do it since my schedule is more flexible, and I've automated some parts of the process with a string of incredibly user hostile shell scripts). And the shipping costs are downputting to many, we're quite cornered here in Finland. We are slowly gaining some distribution partners in Europe, but we should also be looking into better shipping options, like perhaps some kind of shipping warehouse exist? Our volume is slowly getting big enough so that it might be feasible. I've only done some cursory googling on this but don't exactly know what I'm even looking for, and there's only so many hours in a day.</p><p>A lot of work, small margins (ads+printing+misc takes a big slice), but around $500 profit per month. Feels absolutely fantastic to have an actual concrete business we own!</p><p><a href="https://cluehound.com/" rel="nofollow">https://cluehound.com</a></p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>Thank you!
That's the sort of game that springs to mind for many when we explain the concept, and they were definitely an inspiration for us. This however is a more linear adventure, focused around solving enigmas. No choices and no way to lose. Once you know the answer to the puzzle, like "whose fingerprints are on the gun", you turn the next page and the story continues.</p>

<h2>Musicians for Fairness &amp; Preservation Open Letter</h2>



<div><p>It‚Äôs time for the music industry to support the artistic legacies and futures of working musicians‚Äînot shareholder profits.&nbsp;</p><p>We, the undersigned musicians, wholeheartedly oppose major record labels‚Äô unjust lawsuit targeting the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/internet-archive-major-label-music-lawsuit-1235105273/">Internet Archive,</a> a crucial non profit cultural institution. We don‚Äôt believe that the Internet Archive should be destroyed <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/20/nx-s1-5159000/internet-archive-hack-leak-wayback-machine">in our name</a>. The biggest players of our industry clearly need better ideas for supporting us, the artists, and in this letter we are offering them.</p><p>By 2031, music industry revenues will exceed <a href="https://musicindustryblog.wordpress.com/2024/05/23/midia-research-2024-2031-global-music-forecasts-rise-of-the-global-south/">100 billion dollars</a>, yet the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2023/02/04/spotify-grammys-songwriters-payment-musicians/">average musician</a> is struggling to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/may/14/people-are-forfeiting-meals-musicians-on-the-struggle-to-financially-survive">survive</a>. We‚Äôre <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/apr/25/shocking-truth-money-bands-make-on-tour-taylor-swift">priced out </a>of touring by LiveNation‚Äôs <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/23/nx-s1-4977330/live-nation-ticketmaster-sued">abusive monopolies</a>, and screwed over on royalties as <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2015/02/05/yes-major-record-labels-are-keeping-nearly-all-money-they-get-spotify-rather-than-giving-it-to-artists/">big labels</a> profit from Spotify‚Äôs <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/28/new-law-how-musicians-make-money-streaming">unfair streaming</a> revenue model.&nbsp;</p><p>Music is <a href="https://weareumaw.org/justice-at-spotify">demonetized</a> and <a href="https://variety.com/2024/music/news/spotify-artists-streaming-fraud-1235965379/">censored</a> by DSPs, sued off the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/08/record-labels-sue-internet-archive-for-digitizing-obsolete-vintage-records/">Internet Archive</a> by major labels, and physical archives have gone up <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2049197/universal-warehouse-fire-artist-list-additions/news/">in flames</a> because of corporate profiteering. It‚Äôs no surprise that <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/mental-illness-independent-musicians-study-73-percent-record-union-8509490/#!">mental health</a> is a crisis among musicians‚Äîwe‚Äôre sick with worry wondering if anything will be left of our life‚Äôs work.</p><p><strong>The music industry is </strong><a href="https://www.billboard.com/business/business-news/ifpi-global-report-2024-music-business-revenue-market-share-1235637873/"><strong>not struggling</strong></a><strong> anymore. Only musicians are. </strong>We demand a course-correction now, focused on the legacies and futures of working musicians. We call on all record labels, streaming platforms, ticketing outlets, and venues to immediately align on the following goals:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. Protect our diverse music legacy.</strong></p><p>The music industry has a moral imperative to keep its history archived, but we can‚Äôt trust it to do so. Old records are falling to pieces, and without proper digital preservation, they‚Äôll be gone for good. The masters of big money-making recordings are going <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/neamxm/what-is-a-master-recording-why-are-masters-important-universal-music-group-fire-umg">up in flames</a>, and lesser-known musicians are even more vulnerable to erasure.&nbsp;</p><p>Incredible music and culture is getting lost forever, even though we have the <a href="https://thevinylfactory.com/features/great-78-project-archive-interview/">technology</a> to preserve it. Thanks to the nonprofit Internet Archive‚Äôs Wayback Machine, almost half a million <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/mtv-news-saved-internet-archive-1235051776/">MTV News articles</a> were spared permanent deletion. But when their Great 78 Project rescued over 400,000 recordings, major labels responded with a <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2023/08/14/internet-archive-responds-to-recording-industry-lawsuit-targeting-obsolete-media/">lawsuit</a> against the Internet Archive for <a href="https://great78.archive.org/">research library</a> streams of old vinyl records. Going back to the opening of the library in 2006, the suit seeks <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/internet-archive-major-label-music-lawsuit-1235105273/">$621,300,000</a> in damages. In Spotify bucks, $621,300,000 is <a href="https://soundcamps.com/spotify-royalties-calculator/">261 billion streams</a>‚Äîwildly higher than the ‚Äúmillions‚Äù of research library streams alleged in the lawsuit. When songs streamed 10 million times would only pay out <a href="https://soundcamps.com/spotify-royalties-calculator/">$23,800</a>, we have to wonder how much our music is really worth.&nbsp;</p><p>Artists and labels alike should partner with valuable cultural stewards like the Internet Archive‚Äînot sue them. It‚Äôs time to support nonprofit music preservation to ensure that <a href="https://michigantoday.umich.edu/2024/02/23/george-gershwins-first-musical-rediscovered-after-nearly-a-century/">our music</a> and our stories aren‚Äôt lost to history.<br><strong><br>2. Invest in living, working musicians‚Äìnot back catalogs or monopolies.<br></strong><br>In 2022, music rights was a <a href="https://pivotaleconomics.com/undercurrents/music-copyright-2022">40 billion dollar</a> business. But a disproportionate cut of those billions are made by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/18/opinion/private-equity-music-spotify.html">private equity</a> exploiting the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/music-catalogs-value-keeps-rising-could-it-change-the-face-of-the-entire-industry-1056229/">back catalogs</a> of legacy musicians, many of whom are no longer living. Working artists took home <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/musicians-received-12-percent-43-billion-generated-by-music-industry-study-2018-8?op=1">as little as 12%</a> of music industry revenue, even before COVID decimated touring. Meanwhile CEOs hire <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@fightfortheftr/video/7267303386683297067">lawyers</a>, <a href="https://loudandclear.byspotify.com/#takeaway-7">publicists</a>, and <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/recording-industry-assn-of-america/summary?id=D000000581">lobbyists</a> to convince the public that music is <a href="https://themusic.com.au/industry/spotify-ceo-faces-backlash-after-saying-the-cost-of-making-content-is-close-to-zero/CpqwHB8eAQA/03-06-24">essentially worthless</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, we‚Äôre shut out of sharing in today‚Äôs <a href="https://www.iq-mag.net/2019/09/global-live-music-ticket-sales-top-25bn-pwc-outlook-2019/#.XYvSoZNKjOQ">historic highs in live concert revenue</a>. Musicians, including big-name artists like <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2205718/lorde-concert-industry-explainer-email-touring/news/">Lorde</a> and <a href="https://torontolife.com/city/musicians-like-me-can-no-longer-afford-to-tour-live-music-wont-survive-unless-the-industry-changes/">Animal Collective</a>, shouldn‚Äôt lose money self-funding tours that cost <a href="https://www.kcrw.com/news/shows/press-play-with-madeleine-brand/reproductive-rights-india-lds-music/touring-money">40% more</a> post-pandemic. This exploitation comes at the hands of <a href="https://prospect.org/power/2024-05-24-how-live-nations-monopoly-works/">monopolies</a> double-dipping into both ticketing and venue income, and gravely harms the workers and independent live music spaces that also comprise the touring ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><p>Venues and ticketing retailers must set a precedent to ensure that artists get a fairer deal, including keeping <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/article/artist-merch-cuts-venues/">100% of merchandise</a> sales, as suggested by the Featured Artist Coalition &amp; United Musicians and Allied Workers‚Äô #MyMerch campaign. We need transparent ticketing practices that prioritize income for artists and clarity for fans, so that live music work can actually make artists a living.<br><strong><br>3. Make streaming services pay fair compensation.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The music industry must put musicians before big tech. Lobbyist organizations should redirect their power into making the government <a href="https://tlaib.house.gov/posts/tlaib-introduces-living-wage-for-musicians-act">appropriately tax</a> streaming platforms to fund artists, rather than side with monopolistic corporate players.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, representatives Rashida Tlaib and Jamaal Bowman introduced the Living Wage for Musicians Act in partnership with United Musicians and Allied Workers to fight for fair pay in streaming. <a href="https://weareumaw.org/news/justiceatspotify-a-year-in-review">30,000 working musicians and counting</a> also signed onto UMAW‚Äôs #JusticeatSpotify campaign, demanding similar goals of fair compensation from DSPs. Artists have clearly voiced concern that <a href="https://thehustle.co/the-economics-of-spotify">the numbers</a> aren‚Äôt adding up in our favor.&nbsp;</p><p>Major labels must put forth a public plan with a concrete timeline to end their vertical investment in platforms like Spotify, whose CEO Daniel Ek profits more <a href="https://www.musicradar.com/news/daniel-ek-spotify-earnings">in one year</a> than Taylor Swift has in her lifetime. The music we make today is valuable, and it‚Äôs time for the industry to treat it that way and invest in working musicians by paying fair royalties for streams.&nbsp;</p><p>We demand that the music industry stop treating the history and future of musicians as expendable. Thanks to many self-organized groups and collectives, music workers are better organized now than at any other point in history. The inequity that permeates the lives of working artists, <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/Authors-For-Libraries">in all media</a>, will end. Through the collective power of artists and those that love our work, we will build a sustainable future where our wellbeing and dignity come first.&nbsp;</p><p>The music industry cannot survive without musicians. The only way it can continue is with immediate and sustained action to protect artists‚Äô futures, and the long-term preservation of their works. We implore our labels, our agents, our publishers, and our venues to stand with us in demanding fairness for the artists on which this industry is built.&nbsp;</p><p>Sincerely,</p></div>

<p>Compilers have always been surrounded by an air of mystery and magic. This has
led many of us to believe that they do things (well) that they don't, or that
they don't do things (well) that they do.<a href="#footnote1" id="footnote1-back">1</a>
</p>
<p>In this article is one some way a follow-up of a previous one on <a target="_blank" href="https://sbaziotis.com/compilers/compiler-opt.html">compiler optimization</a>. Here, I've collected some misconceptions I've come across over the
years (many of them mine), doing my best to clear up any confusions. As a heads
up, this article is only about large-scale, mainstream, general-purpose
compilers like LLVM, GCC, and ICX. Some of the statements don't apply e.g., to
domain-specific compilers<a href="#footnote2" id="footnote2-back">2</a> or small-to-medium-scale compilers.<a href="#footnote3" id="footnote3-back">3</a> Please do let me know if you'd like to see an article
on other classes of compilers.

<p>First, optimal according to which metric? For example, one metric is code size.
But usually the metric compilers target is running time (i.e., latency of
a single run of the program). In any case, though, ‚Äúoptimization‚Äù is a misnomer.
Compilers don't even try to find the optimal program. Instead, they first lower
the program in a very <a target="_blank" href="https://sbaziotis.com/compilers/compiler-opt.html#unoptimized-builds">simple manner</a>,
and then they just try to <i>improve</i> that. ‚ÄúImproving‚Äù is much weaker than ‚Äúoptimizing‚Äù,
but it is accurate.
</p>
<p>But why don't we get the optimal program? Well, it's very hard and slow. For
code size there may be some hope of producing optimal programs in a reasonable
time some day because code size as a metric has a bunch of nice properties. For
example, we can measure code size extremely accurately and reliably; it's
basically just the file size of the generated program. Also, different
measurements give you the same exact value (i.e., if you measure the size now
and after a minute, you'll get the same value). Finally, code size has
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_substructure">optimal
substructure</a>. <b>UPDATE: Actually, I seem to have proved myself wrong here.
See <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42375191">this comment</a>.
Hopefully, I will find some time to revisit this.</b><s>
To see what this means in practice, let's say you have a function <code>A</code> whose
size you want to minimize (i.e., find the minimum size). Now, let's say
you split the function in two parts and you find their minimums independently.
Optimal substructure tells us that if you just merge these two, you'll
get the minimum version of the whole function. In other words, combining
individual minimums gives you a global minimum.</s>
</p>
<p>Running time, on the other hand, has none of that. First, you can't measure it
accurately. Different runs of the program will have slightly different running
times. Worse yet, the factors that impact the running time are <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1145/1508284.1508275">many and subtle</a>.
Moreover, improving the running time doesn't have optimal substructure. For example,
you have the optimal version two loops individually, but the global minimum
may require fusing these two loops. Finally, <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/p15qRHZ_Leg?t=951">‚Äúwe have absolutely no proper models of the machines we're compiling for‚Äù</a>. This is something recent academic work discovered
the hard way. <a target="_blank" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3276480">goSLP</a> generates globally optimized
SLP-vectorized code. But optimized according to what? According to hardware models. Because
these models are bad<a href="#footnote4" id="footnote4-back">4</a>, the authors discovered that the generated programs were not only <i>not</i> optimal, but they could be <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/wiwloa0g02g?t=1946">slower than LLVM</a>!

      <p><span id="branch-weights-and-the-cpus-branch-predictor">Branch weights and the CPU's branch predictor</span> <span><a href="#branch-weights-and-the-cpus-branch-predictor"></a></span></p>
    </div><br>

<div>
<p>In most modern compilers, including GCC, LLVM, and ICX, conditional branches can
have weights. These are basically probabilities of whether the branch will be
taken or not. Such weights are added either by profile-guided optimization
(PGO), or by the programmer using intrinsics such as <code>__builtin_expect</code>:
</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>__builtin_expect</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>==</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>))</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>// The branch is likely to be taken</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The misconception here is that for x86 architectures, the compiler generates
branch hints for the <i>CPU</i>'s branch predictor. Until pretty recently, that was
simply not the case. Even though Intel introduced branch hints in Pentium 4,
they found that in practice there was no performance benefit and they just
increased code size.<a href="#footnote5" id="footnote5-back">5</a>
You can still include branch hints in your assembly, but the CPU simply ignores them.
</p>
<p>So, what are these hints/weights used for? They are hints to the <i>compiler</i>'s
‚Äúbranch predictor‚Äù which it uses primarily to place code blocks effectively. For
example, if a branch is likely, the compiler places its target block directly
below the current block so that execution falls through to it, to increase
instruction cache locality.
</p>
<p>But, Intel recently introduced an architecture, Redwood Cove, in which branch
hints are relevant again.<a href="#footnote6" id="footnote6-back">6</a>
So, the compiler will theoretically generate these hints for this architecture.
</p>
<p>However, it's hard to see it in practice. I couldn't produce any example where
you give a C example to the compiler and with some combination of flags, it
gives you x86 assembly that has branch hints; for any of: GCC, LLVM, or ICX.
I don't even know how to specifically target Redwood Cove. But,
we <i>can</i> make it generate the hints. We take this LLVM IR code:<a href="#footnote7" id="footnote7-back">7</a>
</p>

<span>;</span>

<p>Line 3 has the branch hint.
</p>
<p>The story may be different for other architectures, but I am mostly familiar with x86.
</p>

    <div>
      <p><span id="-o3-produces-much-faster-code-than--o2">-O3 produces much faster code than -O2</span> <span><a href="#-o3-produces-much-faster-code-than--o2"></a></span></p>
    </div><br>

<div>
<p>In 2019, which is not that long ago in compiler years, Emery Berger gave a talk
at the Strange Loop Conference. In that talk, he showed evidence for the
following stark statement: there's no statistical difference between <code>-O2</code> and
<code>-O3</code> in Clang!<a href="#footnote9" id="footnote9-back">9</a> 
That's also what I've found in my experience, especially with Clang. GCC's <code>-O2</code> is less aggressive
than Clang's, so there is some difference there, but not a big one. Also,
<code>-O3</code> ignores the code size almost completely, and that can get you into trouble
with the instruction cache.
</p>
<p>The moral of the story is: this is not a rule. It's one of these cases that it pays
to benchmark.
</p>

  </div>
  <br>
  
    <div>
      <p><span id="javascript-interpreters-jit-at-runtime-because-they-dont-know-which-paths-are-hot-ahead-of-time">Javascript interpreters JIT at runtime because they don't know which paths are hot ahead of time</span> <span><a href="#javascript-interpreters-jit-at-runtime-because-they-dont-know-which-paths-are-hot-ahead-of-time"></a></span></p>
    </div><br>

<div>
  <p>Knowing which paths are hot in any Javascript bytecode is not enough to produce
optimized code; you also need to know the types. And you only know the types at
runtime. This is the main reason why JIT compilers compile code at runtime.
</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  
    <div>
      <p><span id="if-you-have-a-compiler,-you-dont-need-an-interpreter">If you have a compiler, you don't need an interpreter</span> <span><a href="#if-you-have-a-compiler,-you-dont-need-an-interpreter"></a></span></p>
    </div><br>

<div>
<p>This depends a lot on the case. Yeah, probably for C/C++ pipelines, an
interpreter won't be super useful anywhere, and good lucking making one anyway.
But there are cases where an interpreter can be useful. One interesting case is
that of WebAssembly.
</p>
<p>Recently, Ben Titzer published a paper titled: <a target="_blank" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3563311">A Fast In-Place Interpreter for WebAssembly</a>. In this paper, Titzer tells us Œ± story about WebAssembly implementations.
</p>
<p>You see, for non-native languages, you usually develop an interpreter first, and
<i>then</i> a (JIT) compiler. This is because an interpreter is usually easier to
develop and use, while the compiler is something you need for performance.
Interestingly, however, in WebAssembly ecosystem, JIT compilers were developed
first. As far as I can understand, that was a factor of three things, discussed
next.
</p>
<p><strong>Designed for Compilation</strong>. WebAssembly was designed for compilation and
that's because performance was a core goal, not an after-thought. Performance,
in this case, means both performance of the produced code, but also efficiency
of the compilation. For example, WebAssembly can be type-checked in a single
pass.
</p>
<p><strong>Convince</strong>. Even though WebAssembly had ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù power from the
beginning<a href="#footnote10" id="footnote10-back">10</a>, the designers
still wanted to convince folks and give evidence that WebAssembly is indeed a viable option
for users who care about performance. And you can't give evidence for that
without a compiler.
</p>
<p><strong>Not Ideal for Interpretation</strong>. The design for compilation brought about
some features that made it hard to implement an interpreter. Most notably,
structured control flow. In the paper, Titzer describes the pain points very well.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, folks eventually realized that interpreters had a bunch of
advantages. Titzer gives a nice account of six advantages in Section 1.1 of the
paper. The gist of the matter is that while you can't usually beat a compiled
binary's performance, there are other practical reasons to have an interpreter.

<div>
<p>Almost certainly not!<a href="#footnote11" id="footnote11-back">11</a> Yes, compilers
will optimize for <i>instruction</i> cache locality; we saw that <a href="#branch-weights-and-the-cpus-branch-predictor">earlier</a>. There is
also a long history of compiler research for cache optimizations<a href="#footnote12" id="footnote12-back">12</a>;
none of it has made it into mainstream compilers. <a target="_blank" href="https://polly.llvm.org/">Polly</a>
is the most serious case (I know) of a data-locality optimization framework<a href="#footnote13" id="footnote13-back">13</a> becoming part of
a big mainstream compiler. Still, it is not turned on by default in LLVM.
</p>
<p>Mike Acton has gathered himself some 690 thousand views in his CppCon talk
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc">Data-Oriented Design and C++</a> in
no small part because he drove the point home that a C++ compiler won't optimize
cache locality for you. This talk basically started<a href="#footnote14" id="footnote14-back">14</a> the movement of data-oriented design, whose
main goal is to write code that makes good use of the cache.
</p>
<p>But, you may be asking <i>why</i> the compiler won't do it for you. Unfortunately, it
cannot. First, optimizing for data locality requires mass-scale intrusive
changes to the program. For example, let's say you have an open-addressing hash
table. More specifically, here's how LLVM <code>DenseMap</code>'s data layout looks like:
</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>DenseMap</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>  </span><span>struct</span><span> </span><span>BucketT</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>KeyT</span><span> </span><span>Key</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>ValueT</span><span> </span><span>Value</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>};</span>
<span>  </span><span>unsigned</span><span> </span><span>NumBuckets</span><span>;</span>
<span>  </span><span>BucketT</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span>Buckets</span><span>;</span>
<span>...</span>
</pre></div>
<p>So, we have a single array in which every entry has the key and the value paired
together. But, during lookups, we only care about the keys. The way the data is
structured, we keep loading the values into the cache, wasting cache space and
cycles. One way to improve that is to split this into two arrays: one for the
keys and one for the values.
</p>
<p>To keep the code behavior the same, we would have to change <i>every</i> place in
which this original array is used: the allocations, where we get a key, where we
set a value, etc. In C/C++, this is very hard to do reliably. But most
importantly, the compiler is plainly not allowed to do it. Generally, a C/C++
compiler is simply not allowed to re-order the struct fields.<a href="#footnote15" id="footnote15-back">15</a>
</p>
<p>Last but not least, even if the compiler was allowed to do it, the abstractions
in C/C++ programs are too impoverished in information for the compiler to identify such
opportunities.<a href="#footnote16" id="footnote16-back">16</a> In simple terms, the compiler has a very imprecise
view of a program's memory accesses to have any good idea of what layout
optimizations would be beneficial.

<div>
<p>Mainstream compilers like Clang and GCC are very slow, so it's more accurate to
think that <code>-O0</code> gives you debuggable and predictable code, rather than that it
will give you the code fast.
</p>
<p>Generally speaking, yes <code>-O0</code> is faster than say <code>-O2</code>, although I don't have a
large-scale experiment to back this up. But for example, compiling a <code>Release</code>
build of <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/facebook/zstd">zstd</a> takes ~34s, while a <code>Debug</code>
build takes ~11s. Something similar is true for <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/baziotis/minijava-cpp">one of my projects</a>
which uses a unity build and has about 5K lines of code. However, even saying
that <code>-O0</code> is always faster than <code>-O2</code> is not true. As an example, in my
desktop, it takes ~25min to compile a <code>Debug</code> version of LLVM,  but ~23min to
compile a <code>Release</code> version.<a href="#footnote17" id="footnote17-back">17</a>
</p>
<p>Point being, if really want fast compilation, you need to somehow bypass the
standard compilation pipeline, especially if you're starting from C++. One
option is to just use a smaller compiler, as these are usually faster (e.g.,
TinyCC). Another option is to at least skip <i>some</i> of the compilation stages.
One way to do that is to directly generate LLVM IR, something databases
researchers have observed too. In a popular 2011<a href="#footnote18" id="footnote18-back">18</a> query compilation paper,<a href="#footnote19" id="footnote19-back">19</a>, the authors say:
</p>
<p>[Compiling LLVM IR] usually requires only a few milliseconds for query compilation, while C or C++ compilers would need seconds</p>
<p>And query compilation is one use case where fast compilation matters since it's
online.
</p>
<p>It is easy to see why the quote is true if the compiler we use is Clang because
Clang anyway needs to go through LLVM IR. Also, C/C++ doesn't have a binary
format, which would speed up processing, only a textual format. However, LLVM IR
does.

<p>Not really... <i>C++</i> templates are slow to compile because C++'s compilation
model is terrible.<a href="#footnote20" id="footnote20-back">20</a> Templates, of course, increase
the compilation complexity, but not in a way that makes them impractical.
</p>
<p>A case in point is Dlang's standard library,
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dlang/phobos">Phobos</a>. In my not-particularly-fast laptop,
compiling Phobos takes about 12 seconds even though it has more than 250
<i>thousand</i> of lines of code <i>full</i> of templates in an <i>optimized</i> build.<a href="#footnote21" id="footnote21-back">21</a> Note that DMD, D's main compiler, doesn't do
anything particularly fancy. Of course, Walter Bright‚Äîthe mastermind
behind D and DMD‚Äîis one of the best compiler engineers ever and he
definitely knows more than a thing or two about how to make a compiler run fast.
But DMD doesn't do anything crazy; it's not even multi-threaded.

    </div><br>

<div>
<p>Separate compilation is the idea that you compile a different object file for
each source file.<a href="#footnote22" id="footnote22-back">22</a> The
reasoning of why this is beneficial is that if you change one source file, you
only have to re-compile that one file and "just" link it with the other object
files; you don't have to re-compile the whole project.
</p>
<p>This sounds attractive and has become some kind of sacred creed in computer
science education,<a href="#footnote23" id="footnote23-back">23</a>
and from there has crept into production environments. The problem is that in
practice, linking is incredibly slow. Unfortunately, I have not studied linking
deeply enough to comment on whether the problem is inherent or not.<a href="#footnote24" id="footnote24-back">24</a> But little does that
matter; reality is what it is.
</p>
<p>So, for <i>many</i> projects, separate compilation is not worth it. Instead, a unity
build‚Äîwhere you just include everything into a single file‚Äîis
usually a much better option. Let me give you some examples. First, I have
confirmed that it's not worth it for <i>every</i> C/C++ project I have written. So,
say up to 20K lines of code in a single project. For example,
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/baziotis/minijava-cpp">minijava-cpp</a> is a MiniJava compiler
written in C++ which has some pretty heavy code in it. It compiles in ~0.7s in
my laptop, while linking all these separate files takes much longer. In short, I
have never come across a case in my projects where separate compilation is
better than a unity build.
</p>
<p>Beyond personal experience, Ubisoft has also
<a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/qYN6eduU06s?t=601">reported</a> using unity builds to improve
compilation times of its games.<a href="#footnote25" id="footnote25-back">25</a> SQLite, too, compiles
everything into a single <code>.c</code> program.
</p>
<p>Beyond compilation times, unity builds have other advantages. For example, you
get whole-program optimization without needing to apply link-time optimization
(see below). Also, everything is compiled only once, something that contributes
a lot both to faster compilation speeds and nicer error logs. With C++'s
compilation model (see <a href="#templates-are-slow-to-compile">above</a>), if you
include the same file in different translation units (or files for simplicity),
it will get compiled once for every unit. If you now add on top that templates
generate many versions of the same thing, you have the same code being
re-compiled over and over.
</p>
<p>In conclusion, I cannot make the statement that separate compilation is never
useful, because I don't have the evidence to support that. But, I have never
found it to be a win in my projects, and that seems to be the case for some big
projects too. So, give unity builds a try.

    </div><br>

<div>
<p>Here's a story. Two years ago, I was auditing Vikram Adve's<a href="#footnote26" id="footnote26-back">26</a> course ‚ÄúAdvanced Compiler
Construction‚Äù. At some point during the class, Vikram posed the million dollar
question: why does link-time optimization happen at link-time? This may sound
like an oxymoron, but in reality the question is: why does whole-program
optimization happen at link-time?
</p>
<p>This is a very reasonable question because no one actually cares about link-time
optimization; people care about whole-program optimization. And linkers are
generally not optimizers, it is not their job. In fact, theoretically it makes
much more sense for whole-program optimization to happen in the middle-end.
First, the middle-end's job <i>is</i> optimization. Second, the middle-end
operates in an IR made for optimization, contrary to the assembly that object
files normally have. Furthermore, nothing prevents the compiler from having a global view
of the program. It can just translate all the input C/C++ files to LLVM IR, and
then has a view over the whole program. Then, Dear God, why does it happen at
link-time? I should say, no one knew the answer. Thankfully, Dear God
illuminated us.
</p>
<p>Vikram explained (well, I'm paraphrasing) that the answer lies in the sad
reality of C/C++ build systems. In huge projects, good luck finding the source
C/C++ files and figuring out what calls what. The C++ tooling is just not made
for that. On the other hand, it's necessary that a linker be able to find all
the object files. So, the tooling is such that a linker <i>can</i> gather all the
code for a project. Of course, normally object files contain assembly and no one
wants to work on that. So, the compiler just sticks e.g., the LLVM IR into the
object file for the compiler to access it.

    </div><br>

<div>
<p>Avoiding a call instruction (sequence) is beneficial, but even that is partly
beneficial due to instruction cache locality, not because the instruction is
that slow. Most importantly, though, inlining's biggest benefit (by far) is that
it's an enabling transformation, meaning it enables other optimizations. I have
a more detailed explanation <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/I4Iv-HefknA?t=1084">here</a>, but let
me highlight one frequently overlooked effect of inlining.
</p>
<p>Inlining enables interprocedrural optimization without actually the need for any
interprocedural compiler techniques (apart from inlining itself).
Interprocedural optimization techniques are those that involve more than one
procedure (i.e., function), i.e., they optimize <i>across</i> functions.
Interprocedural optimizations are difficult to implement exactly because they
involve multiple functions. Optimizations are anyway usually difficult to extend
beyond a small set of basic blocks or a single loop, let alone beyond function
boundaries. Inlining, however, in effect allows interprocedural optimization to
happen. For example, suppose you have the following code:
</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>sat_div</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>num</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>denom</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>denom</span><span> </span><span>==</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>?</span><span> </span><span>INT_MAX</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>INT_MIN</span><span>;</span>
<span>  </span><span>}</span>
<span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>num</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>denom</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>int</span><span> </span><span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>  </span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>sat_div</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>);</span>
<span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>After optimization, the code for <code>foo</code> looks like (<a target="_blank" href="https://godbolt.org/z/Gfr1rjMvj">godbolt</a>):
</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>// ... sat_div is the same</span>

<span>int</span><span> </span><span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>  </span><span>// The generated code for this looks confusing because</span>
<span>  </span><span>// the compiler has turned a division into a multiplication.</span>
<span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>So, the compiler performed constant propagation, by propagating the constant <code>3</code>
to <code>denom</code>, it eliminated the dead <code>if</code> as the condition is false in this case,
and it turned the division into a multiplication. But how did it do it? Well,
not through interprocedural versions of constant propagation<a href="#footnote27" id="footnote27-back">27</a>, dead-code elimination, or instruction
combining. No, the effect happened because the compiler first inlined the call
to <code>sat_div</code> (<a target="_blank" href="https://godbolt.org/z/4TdaG9Wz7">godbolt</a>), which then <i>enabled</i>
the <i>intra</i>procedural<a href="#footnote28" id="footnote28-back">28</a> versions of these
transformations. In other words, inlining brought everything into a single
function, which allowed the conventional transformations to work. This is why inlining is considered by many
(e.g., <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/FnGCDLhaxKU?t=1580">Chandler Carruth</a>) the single most
important optimization in optimizing compilers.<a href="#footnote29" id="footnote29-back">29</a>
</p>
<p>Does that mean that inlining is the only approach to interprocedural optimization? Well, on the
one hand, there is a long literature of interprocedural optimizations, and some
of it has made it into production compilers.<a href="#footnote30" id="footnote30-back">30</a> On the other hand, for
most mainstream compilers, almost all the interprocedural work is done by
inlining. This is also why virtually all recent research on compiler cost models
that that related to interprocedural optimization target inlining.<a href="#footnote31" id="footnote31-back">31</a>

<p>Most of the documentation on this keyword is devoted to its role in linking. And
indeed, this is where it matters semantically. But the question I'm here to
answer is: Does it have to do anything with the inlining optimization?
</p>
<p>This was supposed to be an easy one. After all, Chandler Carruth <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/FnGCDLhaxKU?t=1560">told
us</a> that ‚Äúthe <code>inline</code> keyword in C++ has
possibly nothing to do with optimization‚Äù.<a href="#footnote32" id="footnote32-back">32</a> But the story is not so simple. On the one hand, cppreference tells us
that:
</p>
<p>The original intent of the inline keyword was to serve as an indicator to the optimizer that inline substitution of a function is preferred over function call.</p>
<p>and if we look at the
<a target="_blank" href="https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2024/n4993.pdf">latest</a> C++
standard draft<a href="#footnote33" id="footnote33-back">33</a>, it
says<a href="#footnote34" id="footnote34-back">34</a>:
</p>
<p>The inline specifier indicates to the implementation that inline substitution of the function body at the point of call is to be preferred to the usual function call mechanism. An implementation is not required to perform this inline substitution at the point of call.</p>
<p>On the other hand, cppreference also tells us:
</p>
<p>[...] the meaning of the keyword inline for functions came to mean "multiple definitions are permitted" rather than "inlining is preferred" since C++98, that meaning was extended to variables.</p>
<p>With all these conflicting statements by credible sources<a href="#footnote35" id="footnote35-back">35</a>, it's reasonable to expect a confusion. So, what is the
truth? As with many things in C++, the ‚Äútruth‚Äù is whatever the implementation
has chosen. Since I am most familiar with LLVM, we'll take a look at that.
</p>
<p>So, LLVM does pay attention to the <code>inline</code> keyword, and has been doing so since at least 2010. LLVM IR has the <code>inlinehint</code><a href="#footnote36" id="footnote36-back">36</a> attribute which Clang will add to your function
definition if you add the <code>inline</code>
keyword.<a href="#footnote37" id="footnote37-back">37</a>. For example, in this <a target="_blank" href="https://godbolt.org/z/jfo35vvzf">snippet</a>, Clang adds the <code>inlinehint</code> attribute to <code>int_run</code>. According to the LLVM IR reference on <code>inlinehint</code>:
</p>
<p>This attribute indicates that the source code contained a hint that inlining this function is desirable (such as the ‚Äúinline‚Äù keyword in C/C++). It is just a hint; it imposes no requirements on the inliner.</p>
<p>Indeed, the optimizer increases the inline threshold for functions that have the <code>inlinehint</code> attribute.<a href="#footnote38" id="footnote38-back">38</a> But the change is relatively small. So, yes the <code>inline</code> keyword has something to do with optimization, and yes the optimizer will care if you add it; but not too much (sorry!). I guess if you really want a function to be inlined, you should add the <code>always_inline</code> specifier, which is a totally different story: the compiler will always inline these functions, no matter what, unless it's impossible.

<div>
<p>Look, I love LLVM!<a href="#footnote39" id="footnote39-back">39</a> In many ways, it's pretty educational. But it's a monstrosity! That's because LLVM is applied to <i>so many</i> use cases. LLVM is used from embedded systems to Google's data centers, from JIT compilers to aggressive high-performance scenarios, and from Zig to Rust to &lt;name the next new language&gt;. So, unavoidably, if you study LLVM, you'll come across <i>a lot</i> of edge and special cases it tries to handle which are of little educational value. You will also see a bunch of advanced algorithms. For example, the standard <a target="_blank" href="https://sbaziotis.com/compilers/semidominators-proof.html">Lengauer-Tarjan Algorithm</a> is already hard to understand. LLVM uses an even more advanced <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNV18Wy-J0U">algorithm</a> that was introduced recently.
</p>
<p>So, while I definitely suggest that you take a serious look at LLVM internals at
some point, I don't suggest that you start there. Just to be clear: this is if you are
interested in learning about compiler <i>development</i>. If you are a user, LLVM is
probably the best choice. So, to <i>learn</i> compilers, as I suggested in a Reddit
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Compilers/comments/1h4qscz/comment/m02plue/">comment</a>,
you can take a look at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNV18Wy-J0U">Go compiler</a>.
It's a production compiler, with some <i>very</i> serious people behind it, but it's not the monstrosity
that LLVM is. I also learned a lot from the folks at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc">LDC</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dlang/dmd">DMD</a>.

    </div><br>

<div>
<p>Generally speaking, a compiler is always allowed to define undefined
behavior.<a href="#footnote40" id="footnote40-back">40</a> For example, the compiler is allowed to define a dereference from a
<code>int*</code> pointer that points to <code>NULL</code> to be <code>0</code>. But, this has performance
repercussions, as that would e.g., require that the compiler insert <code>if</code>s in
every pointer dereference.
</p>
<p>A more subtle argument is that the compiler can define all undefined behavior to
be the platform's behavior. This would kill two birds with one stone. First, the
compiler wouldn't need to add any extra code because the behavior it would have
chosen would be what the target would do anyway. As such, there would be no extra
overheads. Second, suddenly as a programmer you would know <i>exactly</i> what would
happen. While this argument sounds great, it is truly not that simple. I wrote
an
<a target="_blank" href="https://sbaziotis.com/compilers/defining-all-undefined-behavior-and-leveraging-compiler-transformation-apis.html">article</a>
that examines this suggestion seriously and in detail.

<p>The recent explosion in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has not left compilers
untouched. In many cases, for a good reason. For example, cost models are one
plausible application of machine learning. For simplicity, here's how a cost
model works: it is given a space of possible solutions and it chooses one them.
For example, let's say you have a loop that can be tiled be a factor of 16, 32,
or 64. You may, then, have a cost model that is asked to choose among the four
options: not tile at all, or tile by any of the three factors.
</p>
<p>For the longest time, cost models have been written and maintained by hand.
However, hand-tuned cost models are often boring to make, hard to scale
(especially as the number of architectures increases), and anyway hardware
vendors tell us so little about their architectures that hand-tuned cost models
are (as machine-learning-based ones) black magic; they are not interpretable or
intuitive. In other words, a great case for machine learning and neural
networks because they can automate the process. Indeed, a lot of research on machine-learning cost models has appeared the last decade, and some have even made into production. For example, recently Google adopted a neural network <a target="_blank" href="https://proceedings.mlsys.org/paper_files/paper/2021/file/6bcfac823d40046dca25ef6d6d59cc3f-Paper.pdf">cost model</a>
for its XLA compiler.
</p>
<p>But there's a catch. Cost models are good application of neural networks because
you don't need any strict guarantees. In particular, the way to think about it
is that cost models are given a set of <i>correct</i> programs to choose from. As such, <i>no matter</i>
which choice the cost model makes, the generated code will be correct!<a href="#footnote41" id="footnote41-back">41</a> So, even though neural networks currently have this ‚Äúminor‚Äù issue that we
have no idea how they work and they have no guarantees, this is fine e.g., for cost models.
However, it is <i>not</i> fine for code generation!<a href="#footnote42" id="footnote42-back">42</a> This used to be obvious, but recently my
impression is that it's not anymore. For example, recently we got a comment from
one of the reviewers of <a target="_blank" href="https://sbaziotis.com/compilers/dias.html">Dias</a> which
basically asked ‚Äúcan't you just use an LLM?‚Äù No! Please allow me to take a
moment to explain why using LLMs for code generation is not (at least currently)
ok at all.
</p>
<p>Here's the question this boils down to: Is it ok if the code generated from the
compiler is correct, say, 99% of the time? We need to clarify this a bit. Does
that mean that out of 100 generated programs, 99 are fully correct and the one
is near-total garbage? Obviously not, this not realistic. A more realistic
version would be something like this: Out of 100 lines of code, the compiler
generates correct code for 99 of them. I know this is still pretty simplistic
but I think it's good enough for this argument. So, is that ok?
</p>
<p>I hope that your answer is no. From a compiler developer's standpoint, this
absolute garbage. Basically such a compiler is unusable. At best, it is some
kind of research artifact that helps you explore an idea. But forget production.
It's not even ok for debugging. To see why, consider a small project with say
5000 lines of code. With 99% correctness rate, this means that in every
compilation, 50 lines of code are incorrect. Fifty! And the worst part is: you
don't know which and they can be different with every code change. You probably
have had the experience of tracking down a bug in a <i>single line</i> of code, which
can be both frustrating and time-consuming. Image how it is debugging 50
changing lines of code! Now, imagine moving this to a large-scale project, with
possibly millions of lines of code.<a href="#footnote43" id="footnote43-back">43</a> No, thanks.
</p>
<p>A final note: Even if LLMs were producing correct code, they are currently
<i>extremely slow</i> compared to compilers. I know, I said compilers are not that
fast in previous sections. But, compared to LLMs, mainstream compilers are
blazingly fast. So, even though LLMs have a promising future, and already a
bright present, there are some things they currently don't solve. One of them is
(online) code generation.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) comprises various diseases of the heart and blood vessels and is currently the leading cause of death and disease burden in Europe, primarily by stroke and ischemic heart disease (<a href="#B1">1</a>, <a href="#B2">2</a>). Despite diet being one of the main modifiable risk factors of many CVDs (<a href="#B2">2</a>), the evidence regarding added sugar intake and CVD risk is scarce and inconclusive (<a href="#B3">3</a>‚Äì<a href="#B7">7</a>). Furthermore, most studies have primarily focused on sugar-sweetened beverage consumption rather than overall added sugar intake even though sugar-sweetened beverages make up only ~14% of added sugar intake in Sweden and ~25% in the United States (<a href="#B8">8</a>, <a href="#B9">9</a>).</p>
<p>The guidelines for sugar intake vary between different authoritative bodies globally, both with regards to the recommendation thresholds and the basis of the guidelines, with some being based mainly on micronutrient dilution (i.e., the displacement of nutrient-dense food intake by overconsumption of energy-dense foods poor in nutrients), while others are based mainly on the established risks of caries and overweight (<a href="#B6">6</a>). The Nordic nutrition recommendations recommend limiting added sugar and free sugar (all added sugar as well as naturally occurring sugars in honey, syrups, fruit juices, and fruit juice concentrates) intake to &lt; 10% of energy intake (E%), based on the risk of micronutrient dilution and developing chronic metabolic diseases and dental caries (<a href="#B10">10</a>). The American dietary guidelines have a similar recommendation for added sugar intake based on the risk of micronutrient dilution, overweight and obesity, as well as related chronic metabolic diseases (<a href="#B11">11</a>), and The World Health Organization has a similar recommendation for free sugar intake based on the risk of dental caries and overweight. The World Health Organization also further suggest reducing the intake to below 5 E% for additional benefits for dental health (<a href="#B12">12</a>).</p>
<p>The European Food Safety Authority's (EFSA) scientific opinion on a tolerable upper intake level for dietary sugars published in 2022 (<a href="#B6">6</a>) reported moderate evidence for a dose-response relationship between added and free sugar intake and obesity and dyslipidemia, as well as evidence of high certainty pointing toward associations between intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and CVD incidence. However, no conclusion could be drawn about the associations between added and free sugar intake and CVD risk due to the lack of studies available (<a href="#B6">6</a>).</p>
<p>Most studies on added sugar intake and CVD risk have studied CVD as a composite endpoint, but previous findings of ours indicate that the association between added sugar and CVD incidence varies between different CVDs (<a href="#B13">13</a>), thus highlighting the importance of studying different CVDs separately. Research on the associations between added sugar intake and most individual CVDs such as for example abdominal aortic aneurysm and atrial fibrillation is lacking, and the very few studies that have investigated the associations with for example myocardial infarction or stroke present inconsistent findings (<a href="#B13">13</a>‚Äì<a href="#B15">15</a>). In addition to the lack of studies investigating the long-term effects of added sugar intake and the insufficient evidence regarding overall added sugar intake and CVD risk (<a href="#B3">3</a>, <a href="#B16">16</a>), many studies only include a single dietary assessment at baseline, meaning that the assumption has to be made that this single assessment is representative of the participants' diets over time. In this study, diet was assessed at two time-points (in years 1997 and 2009) for the majority of the participants.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was therefore to examine whether there are associations between intake of added sugar, sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, and risk of several types of CVD (i.e., ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, and abdominal aortic aneurysm) among 69,705 participants in two Swedish cohorts, with time-updated data for a majority of the participants in the study. Discerning whether there are associations between added sugar intake and CVD risk could help inform future nutritional recommendations.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<h3>Study population</h3>
<p>The study population consists of female participants from the Swedish Mammography Cohort (SMC) and male participants from the Cohort of Swedish Men (COSM), both of which are population‚Äìbased prospective cohort studies in Central Sweden and part of the national research infrastructure SIMPLER (Swedish Infrastructure for Medical Population-based Life-course Environmental Research). Invitations were sent by mail to all women born between 1914‚Äì1948 living in Uppsala county and V√§stmanland county, and to all men born between 1918‚Äì1952 living in √ñrebro county and V√§stmanland county (<a href="#B17">17</a>).</p>
<p>The participants of SMC and COSM completed identical questionnaires (except for some sex-specific questions) regarding diet, health, and lifestyle factors in the years 1987‚Äì1990 (SMC only), 1997, 2008, and 2009. Ultimately, 66,651 women participated in SMC in 1987‚Äì1990 (74% response rate). During 1997, which serves as the baseline of our study as it was the first assessment that included both cohorts, the response rate was 70% of the still living participants from 1987 in SMC (<i>n</i> = 39,227), and 49% in COSM (<i>n</i> = 48,850) (<a href="#B17">17</a>). The study was approved by The Swedish Ethical Review Authority (dnr: 2019-03986) and completion of the self-administered questionnaire was considered to convey informed consent.</p>
<p>In 2008, all participants of SMC and COSM were sent a health and lifestyle questionnaire, and those who responded received an expanded semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) in 2009. In total, 47,918 participants responded to the 2009 questionnaire, and 42,327 participants (19,598 women and 22,729 men) remained after baseline exclusions (61% of participants from 1997) (<a href="#F1">Figure 1</a>).</p>

<h3>Baseline exclusions</h3>
<p>As SMC originally only included women without cancer, participants in both cohorts with cancer recorded in Swedish registers prior to the baseline were excluded from the present study. Further exclusions were made of those with prevalent CVD (identified using national registers), self-reported diabetes at baseline, death prior to January 1<sup>st</sup>, 1998, missing or incorrect ID, and those deemed to have had extreme energy intakes, since it could indicate misreporting. Extreme energy intake was defined as being outside of 3 standard deviations (SDs) below and above the log<sub>e</sub>-transformed mean energy intake, corresponding to below 470 kcal and above 12,790 kcal in COSM and below 263 kcal and above 9,647 kcal in SMC. Thus, 32,934 participants from SMC and 36,771 participants from COSM remained (69,705 participants in total) in 1997. For the assessment in 2009, individuals deemed to have had extreme energy intakes (i.e., outside of 3 SDs below and above the log<sub>e</sub>-transformed mean energy intake, corresponding to below 580 kcal and above 5,687 kcal in SMC and below 787 kcal and above 7,932 kcal in COSM) were excluded, resulting in 19,598 participants in SMC and 22,729 participants in COSM remaining. In total, 42,327 participants responded to the 2009 questionnaire and remained after exclusions (<a href="#F1">Figure 1</a>).</p>
<h3>Dietary assessment</h3>
<p>Dietary information at baseline (in 1997) was obtained using a 96-item validated semi-quantitative FFQ covering average intakes of various foods and beverages during the preceding year. For all food items and for alcohol intake, the participants could choose between 8 or 9 predetermined consumption frequencies, and portion sizes were either specified as standardized portions or self-reported (as was the case for alcohol consumption). The questions regarding frequency of beverage consumption (including sweetened beverages, tea, and coffee) and table sugar and honey intakes were posed as open-ended questions about the number of daily or weekly servings consumed in the preceding year.</p>
<p>In 2009, a 132-item semi-quantitative FFQ was distributed to COSM and SMC participants in order to obtain updated dietary information. The 132-item FFQ included additional foods and was designed to capture the consumption of specific foods and diets that were consumed more frequently in 2009 than in 1997. Nutrient intakes were estimated by multiplying the consumption frequency of each food item with the nutrient content of sex- and age-specific portion sizes obtained from weighed food records in a subgroup of 152 men from COSM and 129 women from SMC. The nutrient values were derived from the Swedish Food Composition Database (<a href="#B18">18</a>). Participants with missing information about individual foods were interpreted as non-consumers.</p>
<p>The 1997 dietary assessment was validated against 14 24-h recall interviews among 248 Swedish men living in central Sweden, randomly selected from the Swedish population register, with a Spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0.70 being reported for sucrose (<a href="#B19">19</a>). Further, a validation study was carried out among 129 randomly selected women from SMC using four 1-week records that were completed 3‚Äì4 months apart. The reported correlation coefficients were 0.6 for sweetened beverages, 0.5 for jams and marmalades, and 0.4 for sweets (A. Wolk, unpublished observations, 1992).</p>
<h4>Added sugar estimation</h4>
<p>The participants' total added sugar intakes were estimated by subtracting their intakes of naturally occurring sugars in fruit, vegetables, fruit juices, and jams from their total intake of sucrose and monosaccharides. The amounts of naturally occurring monosaccharides and sucrose were estimated using the Swedish Food Composition Database (<a href="#B18">18</a>) (<a href="#SM1">Supplementary Table S1</a>). The added sugar intakes (g/day) were then converted into percentages of non-alcoholic energy intakes. This added sugar density variable was further categorized into ‚â§ 5 E%, &gt;5‚Äì7.5 E%, &gt;7.5‚Äì10 E%, &gt;10‚Äì15 E%, &gt;15‚Äì20 E%, and &gt;20 E%. The categories were designed to allow a wide range of sugar intakes to be studied, including those commonly used in nutritional recommendations as well as extreme intakes.</p>
<h4>Sugar-sweetened foods and beverages</h4>
<p>As the macronutrient distribution, energy density, and consumption patterns vary between different sources of added sugar, sugar-sweetened foods and beverages were studied in groups of treats (pastries, ice cream, sweets, and chocolate), toppings (table sugar, honey, jams, and marmalades), and sweetened beverages (all sweetened sodas and fruit drinks but not pure fruit juices). Notable differences are that toppings generally have negligible fat and protein contents, whereas treats tend to have a higher fat content, and we additionally hypothesized that treats were more likely to be overconsumed than toppings. As liquid sugar has been suggested to be metabolized differently than solid sugar and to consequently cause different health outcomes (<a href="#B20">20</a>), a category of sweetened beverages was also created. The dietary questionnaire from 1997 asked about overall sweetened beverage intake, while the 2009 questionnaire differentiated between sugar-sweetened beverages and artificially sweetened beverages, which were combined to create the sweetened beverage variable in the 2009 data. Participants with missing information about individual foods were interpreted as non-consumers (<a href="#SM1">Supplementary Table S2</a>).</p>
<p>Intake of sweetened beverages was divided into categories of ‚â§ 1, &gt;1‚Äì3, &gt;3‚Äì5, &gt;5‚Äì8, and &gt;8 servings/week, intake of treats was divided into categories of ‚â§ 2, &gt;2‚Äì5, &gt;5‚Äì8, &gt;8‚Äì14, and &gt;14 servings/week, and intake of toppings was divided into categories of ‚â§ 2, &gt;2‚Äì7, &gt;7‚Äì14, &gt;14‚Äì28, and &gt;28 servings/week. The categories for the sugar-sweetened foods and beverages were set based on categories previously used in two other Swedish cohorts carried out around the same period as the baseline of COSM and SMC, and were determined by examining the restricted cubic spline curves of association between added sugar intake and total mortality (<a href="#B21">21</a>, <a href="#B22">22</a>).</p>
<h3>Case ascertainment</h3>
<p>The participants were followed until diagnosis of the studied outcome, death, or the end of the follow-up period (December 31<sup>st</sup>, 2019), whichever occurred first. The participants' Swedish personal identification numbers were used to identify cases of the studied outcomes between 1998 and 2019 in the Swedish National Inpatient Register and the Cause of Death Register, according to the International Classification of Diseases 10 (ICD‚àí10) and corresponding codes in earlier editions. The Swedish National Inpatient Register has been reported to have high diagnostic validity, with positive predictive values of &gt;90% being reported for most of the studied outcomes (<a href="#B23">23</a>). The studied outcomes and their ICD-10 codes were ischemic stroke (I63), myocardial infarction (I21), heart failure (I50 and I11.0), atrial fibrillation (I48), aortic valve stenosis (I35.0 and I35.2), and abdominal aortic aneurysm (I71.3 and I71.4). As it has been indicated that ischemic stroke incidence is affected more by lifestyle factors than hemorrhagic stroke (<a href="#B24">24</a>), ischemic stroke cases and hemorrhagic stroke cases were studied separately, with the variable for hemorrhagic stroke including cases of intracerebral hemorrhage (I61) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (I60).</p>
<h3>Statistical analyses</h3>
<p>All analyses were conducted using R version 4.0.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), with <i>P</i>‚Äìvalues &lt; 0.05 denoting statistical significance. The population baseline characteristics were tested across the added sugar intake categories, with normally distributed continuous variables presented as mean with SD, skewed continuous variables presented as median with interquartile range (IQR), and categorical variables presented as number of participants with proportion of total participants.</p>
<p>Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to investigate the associations between the studied exposures and outcomes using the <i>survival</i> R package (<a href="#B25">25</a>) with the time of follow-up being used as the time variable. Time-updated exposures and covariates were incorporated in the Cox regression for participants who responded to both the 1997 and 2009 questionnaires (<i>n</i> = 42,327). This was done by dividing the follow-up period into two intervals (1997‚Äì2009 and 2009‚Äì2019), with the 1997 data being used in the first interval and the updated data from 2009 being used in the second interval. For those who only completed the 1997 questionnaires (<i>n</i> = 27,378), the data from 1997 was used in both intervals (<a href="#F1">Figure 1</a>). The <i>P</i>-values for the trends were analyzed using the medians of the exposure categories in the models, using the lowest intake category as a reference.</p>
<p>Associations between added sugar intake and incident disease outcomes were investigated using several different models that were adjusted for factors that are established risk factors for CVDs and are associated with added sugar intake. The first model was adjusted for age (years), sex, and total energy intake (kilocalories/day). The second model was additionally adjusted for lifestyle factors as categorical variables: smoking status [current, former, never, missing (n<sub>1997</sub> = 1,086, n<sub>2009</sub> = 1,218)], educational level [less than high school, high school, university, missing (n<sub>1997</sub> = 279, n<sub>2009</sub> = 88)], alcohol consumption (non-consumers and quintiles of sex-specific intakes), as well as walking/cycling [almost never, &lt; 20 min/day, 20‚Äì40 min/day, 40‚Äì60 min/day, 1‚Äì1.5 h/day, &gt;1.5 h/day, missing (n<sub>1997</sub> = 6,084, n<sub>2009</sub> = 676)], and exercise (type of exercise not specified) [ &lt; 1 h/week, 1‚Äì2 h/week, 3‚Äì4 h/week or ‚â•5 h/week, missing (n<sub>1997</sub> = 7,385, n<sub>2009</sub> = 917)]. The smoking variable was modified so that all participants who indicated years since they stopped smoking were recorded as former smokers. The main model was additionally adjusted for body mass index (BMI) (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and dietary factors, including consumption of processed meat (g/day), coffee (g/day), as well as energy adjusted saturated fatty acid and fiber intakes (using the nutrient residual model). The proportional hazards assumptions were tested using Schoenfeld residuals, and the models were stratified for age, sex, and walking/cycling to attain proportionality. Missing values were included as a separate category for each of the categorical variables, while missing values for continuous dietary covariates were interpreted as zero-consumption. Non-linear trends of CVDs were assessed using restricted cubic splines and the rms R package with 5 knots placed at the 5<sup>th</sup>, 27.5<sup>th</sup>, 50<sup>th</sup>, 72.5<sup>th</sup>, and 95<sup>th</sup> percentiles of added sugar intake with 10 E% as reference (<a href="#B26">26</a>).</p>
<h4>Sensitivity analyses</h4>
<p>Interactions between sex and added sugar intake, as well as BMI and added sugar intake, were studied by adding them as continuous interaction terms in the main model for each of the outcomes. For the associations with statistically significant interactions, stratified analyses were conducted.</p>
<p>Since the 1997 questionnaire only asked about overall sweetened beverage intake (i.e., sugar-sweetened beverages and artificially sweetened beverages combined), dietary data from 2009 was used to study consumption of artificially sweetened beverages and sugar-sweetened beverages separately, using 2009 as a baseline, among participants who responded to the 2009 questionnaire (<i>n</i> = 42,327).</p>
<p>Comorbidities are prevalent with many CVDs (<a href="#B27">27</a>, <a href="#B28">28</a>). To take comorbidity into consideration, a sensitivity analysis was conducted in which all participants with incidence of any of the other studied CVDs prior to incidence of the outcome of interest were excluded from the analysis.</p>
<p>As there are several different methods for energy adjustment in epidemiological studies (<a href="#B29">29</a>), sensitivity analyses were conducted using additional energy-adjustment methods. For added sugar, the residual method were used in addition to the nutrient density method (as used in the main analyses) (<a href="#B29">29</a>). For sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, the nutrient density method and the residual method were used in addition to the standard multivariate method (as used in the main analyses). The energy-adjusted intakes using the nutrient density method and the residual method were standardized to the study population's mean energy intake.</p>
<p>To evaluate how the addition of the 2009 diet assessment affected the risk estimates in the main analyses for added sugar intake, a sensitivity analysis using only the 1997 baseline dietary data was conducted.</p>
<p>Further, to reduce bias by reverse causality, a sensitivity analysis was conducted where we excluded cases of the studied outcome that occurred within the first 3 years of the follow-up period.</p>
<p>Finally, to investigate how including missing data may have affected the results for added sugar, we conducted a sensitivity analysis in which only participants with complete data for all sugar-sweetened foods and beverages and categorical covariates were included. Similarly, we conducted sensitivity analyses for treats, toppings, and sweetened beverage intake, including only participants with complete data for the respective variables and categorical covariates.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<h3>Study population characteristics</h3>
<p>The study population consisted of 69,705 participants (47.2% female), with a mean BMI of 25.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, mean age of 59.9 years (ranging between 45 and 83 years) and mean added sugar intake of 9.1 E% at baseline (<a href="#T1">Table 1</a>). Higher added sugar consumers tended to be male, with higher exercise levels and with lower education levels than lower added sugar consumers. Furthermore, those consuming high amounts of added sugar were generally older, had higher energy intakes, and had higher intakes of toppings and sweetened beverages. The intake of treats was more evenly distributed across the added sugar intake groups than the other sugar-sweetened foods and beverages (<a href="#T2">Table 2</a>).</p>

<p><b>Table 2</b>. Baseline characteristics of the study population according to the added sugar intake categories.</p></div>


<h3>Added sugar intake and CVD risk</h3>
<p>During the follow-up period, 25,739 participants were diagnosed with at least one CVD, including 6,912 cases of ischemic stroke, 1,664 cases of hemorrhagic stroke, 6,635 cases of myocardial infarction, 10,090 cases of heart failure, 1,872 cases of aortic stenosis, 13,167 cases of atrial fibrillation, and 1,575 cases of abdominal aortic aneurysm. The associations between the added sugar intake and the studied outcomes were generally stronger in the first model (adjusted for age, sex, and total energy intake), but attenuated in the second model (additionally adjusted for lifestyle factors), and further attenuated in the main model (additionally adjusted for lifestyle factors, BMI, and dietary factors) (<a href="#SM1">Supplementary</a> <a href="#SM1">Tables S3</a>‚Äì<a href="#SM1">S9</a>).</p>
<p>Indications of positive linear associations (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub> &lt; 0.01) were found between added sugar intake and risk of ischemic stroke and abdominal aortic aneurysm in the main model. For abdominal aortic aneurysm, a 31% (95% CI: 5‚Äì65%) higher risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm was found for added sugar intakes of &gt;20E%, and for ischemic stroke, a 9% (95% CI: 0‚Äì19%) higher risk was found for intakes of &gt;15‚Äì20 E%, compared to the lowest intake category of ‚â§ 5 E%. For a majority of the outcomes, however, the highest risks were found in the lowest intake category, whereas the lowest risks were found for low- to moderate intakes. Compared to the lowest intake category ( ‚â§ 5 E%), added sugar intake of &gt;5‚Äì7.5 E% was linked with statistically significant lower risks of ischemic stroke [8% (95% CI: 2-13%)], myocardial infarction [5% (95% CI: 0‚Äì11%)], heart failure [9% (95% CI: 5‚Äì13%)], aortic stenosis [9% (95% CI: 0‚Äì18%)], and atrial fibrillation [7% (95% CI: 3‚Äì11%)]. Furthermore, compared to added sugar intakes ‚â§ 5 E%, lower risks of heart failure and atrial fibrillation were found for intakes of &gt;7.5‚Äì10 E% [6% (95% CI: 1‚Äì10%), and 4% (95% CI: 0‚Äì8%), respectively], as well as of heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and aortic stenosis for intakes of &gt;10‚Äì15 E% [5% (95% CI: 0‚Äì10%), 4% (95% CI: 0‚Äì8%), and 17% (95% CI: 7‚Äì26%), respectively]. No associations were found between added sugar intake and hemorrhagic stroke risk (<a href="#F2">Figure 2</a>, <a href="#T3">Table 3</a>).</p>

<h3>Sugar-sweetened foods and beverages and CVDs</h3>
<p>For sweetened beverages, positive linear associations were found for ischemic stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and abdominal aortic aneurysm (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub> &lt; 0.001). Intake of &gt;8 servings per week of sweetened beverages was associated with a 19% (95% CI: 11‚Äì27%) higher risk of ischemic stroke, an 18% (95% CI: 11‚Äì24%) higher risk of heart failure, an 11% (95% CI: 6‚Äì17%) higher risk of atrial fibrillation, and a 31% (95% CI: 15‚Äì50%) higher risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm (<a href="#SM1">Supplementary Tables S3</a>‚Äì<a href="#SM1">S9</a>).</p>
<p>For treats, negative linear associations were found with all outcomes (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub> &lt; 0.01), with the highest risks being found among consumers of ‚â§ 2 servings/week (<a href="#SM1">Supplementary Tables S3</a>‚Äì<a href="#SM1">S9</a>).</p>
<p>For toppings, negative linear associations were found with heart failure, and aortic stenosis, while a positive linear association was found with abdominal aortic aneurysm (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub> &lt; 0.01). Specifically, ~10% lower risks of heart failure were found for all intake categories compared to the lowest intake category ( ‚â§ 2 servings/week). A 34% (95% CI: 18‚Äì51%) higher risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm was found for the highest intake category of toppings (&gt;28 servings/week) compared to the lowest intake category.

<p>The associations for sugar-sweetened beverage and artificially sweetened beverage intake were studied separately among the 42,327 participants who had answered the 2009 dietary assessment. Among these participants, 10,843 individuals reported consumption of at least 1 serving/week of sugar-sweetened beverages, and 5,727 participants reported consumption of at least 1 serving/week of artificially sweetened beverages. Positive linear associations were observed between intake of artificially sweetened beverages and risk of ischemic stroke (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub> &lt; 0.01) and heart failure (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub> &lt; 0.01) (<a href="#SM1">Supplementary Table S12</a>), while intake of sugar-sweetened beverages was not associated with CVD risk (<a href="#SM1">Supplementary Table S13</a>).</p>
<p>To take comorbidity into consideration, all participants with prior incidence of the other studied CVDs during the follow-up period were excluded for each studied outcome. This resulted in slightly attenuated associations between added sugar intake and most of the studied outcomes; however, the tendencies and directions of the previously linear associations remained, as positive linear associations were observed for ischemic stroke (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub> = 0.05) and abdominal aortic aneurysm (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub> &lt; 0.01), while a negative linear association was observed between added sugar intake and incident aortic stenosis (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub> = 0.04) (<a href="#SM1">Supplementary Table S14</a>).</p>
<p>The risk estimates did not differ notably when testing the associations for added sugar and sugar-sweetened food and beverage intake with energy adjustments using the nutrient density method or the residual method for added sugar intake, nor between the standard multivariate method, nutrient density method, or residual method for sugar-sweetened foods and beverages (<a href="#SM1">Supplementary Tables S15</a>‚Äì<a href="#SM1">S18</a>).</p>
<p>When studying the associations between added sugar and CVD incidence using the 1997 dietary data only, the results were similar to the main results but with lower precision (<a href="#SM1">Supplementary Table S19</a>). Similarly, excluding cases of the studied outcomes within the first 3 years of the follow-up period did not alter the results (<a href="#SM1">Supplementary Table S20</a>).</p>
<p>When only including the participants with complete data for sugar-sweetened foods and beverages and categorical covariates, the overall results remained similar to the main analyses (<a href="#SM1">Supplementary Tables S21</a>‚Äì<a href="#SM1">S24</a>).</p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The findings of this study on the associations between added sugar and CVD risk indicate that the associations vary depending on the disease and the source of added sugar, demonstrating the importance of studying them separately. There were statistically significant linear associations between total added sugar intake and ischemic stroke and abdominal aortic aneurysm, but the highest risk of most of the studied outcomes were found in the lowest intake category. High intake of sweetened beverages was associated with higher risk for most of the studied outcomes, for which positive linear associations were found. In contrast, a low intake of treats was associated with a higher risk of all the studied outcomes. Incorporating the time-updated 2009 information in the analyses resulted in higher precision of the results.</p>
<p>Very few studies have investigated the associations between added sugar intake and incidence of specific CVDs, and this study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first one to investigate the associations with many of the studied outcomes such as for example abdominal aortic aneurysm and atrial fibrillation. Results from the Women's Health Initiative did not show associations between added sugar intake and incident heart failure nor stroke (<a href="#B14">14</a>). In the Swedish Malm√∂ Diet and Cancer Study, the associations for sugar intake also varied depending on CVD disease and source of added sugar (<a href="#B13">13</a>, <a href="#B21">21</a>). In that study, U-shaped associations were found between added sugar intake and overall stroke risk (<a href="#B13">13</a>). In a study of UK biobank participants, free sugar intake was linearly associated with overall stroke risk (<a href="#B15">15</a>). In the current cohort we divided stroke into subtypes and found a positive linear association with ischemic stroke (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub> &lt; 0.01) but no associations with hemorrhagic stroke. The non-linear associations between added sugar intake and atrial fibrillation and aortic stenosis were comparable between the Malm√∂ Diet and Cancer Study and this study, with the highest relative risk found in the lowest intake category for both outcomes.</p>
<p>Although mechanisms explaining the associations between added sugar intake and CVD risk are not well-established, several biological mechanisms have been proposed. One hypothesis is based on the distinct metabolism of fructose, a component of the common added sugar sucrose. Fructose is metabolized in the liver and converted to glycerol-3-phosphate, which serves as a backbone for triacylglycerol synthesis, leading to increased triacylglycerol synthesis and ultimately increased CVD risk (<a href="#B20">20</a>, <a href="#B30">30</a>). It is important to highlight that the notion of adverse metabolic effects of fructose has been questioned, as many studies on the topic refer to very high intakes of fructose (&gt;95th percentile) which do not reflect the metabolic effects of normal dietary intakes (<a href="#B31">31</a>, <a href="#B32">32</a>). The EFSA scientific opinion on a tolerable upper intake level for dietary sugars does however state that evidence from prospective cohort studies suggest positive and causal relationship between the intake of fructose and risk of cardiovascular diseases, albeit with a low level of certainty (<a href="#B6">6</a>).</p>
<p>Relationships between added sugar intake and CVD risk factors such as dyslipidaemia (<a href="#B5">5</a>, <a href="#B6">6</a>), hypertension (<a href="#B6">6</a>), and obesity, have been shown in both randomized controlled trials and observational studies, and could help explain the associations found between added sugar intake and some of the studied CVDs. Although the mentioned CVD risk factors affect all of the studied CVDs to some extent, one explanation for the findings for the different CVDs may be that the risk factors affect the diseases to varying degrees. For example, aortic stenosis can be caused by congenital heart defects and hemorrhagic stroke can be caused by head injuries, whereas ischemic stroke and abdominal aortic aneurysm might be more dependent on atherosclerotic processes. This could result in the potential effect of dietary factors on disease incidence being smaller and more difficult to discern for some of the studied outcomes. This would however not explain the lack of associations found with for example myocardial infarction, as it is also a highly atherosclerotic disease. Consequently, more research is needed to gain deeper understanding of the possible associations and mechanisms of added sugar intake and CVD risk.</p>
<p>The results for the associations between added sugar and some CVDs in individuals with overweight and obesity in this study suggest that BMI may be an effect modifier of the associations, which could explain some of the discrepancies between studies as the rates of overweight or obesity vary in different populations. The role of BMI as a potential effect modifier of the associations between added sugar intake and CVD risk consequently warrants further investigation. Further, although consumption of &lt; 5 E% of added sugar was associated with a higher risk of several CVDs, it is important to highlight that there are no well-established biological mechanistic explanations for these associations. Findings from the Australian Health Survey 2011‚Äì2012 (weighted <i>n</i> = 6,150) did however indicate that added sugar intakes below 5 E% were associated with lower micronutrient intakes (<a href="#B33">33</a>), and it is also possible that the added sugar is substituted by other nutrients such as for example saturated fats. Both of these factors could contribute to adverse cardiovascular health. On the other hand, results from two Swedish populations (<i>n</i> = 12,238 and <i>n</i> = 1,797) indicated an inverse association between added sugar intake and micronutrient intake, contradicting the micronutrient dilution theory (<a href="#B34">34</a>). Finally, methodological limitations such as residual confounding and misreporting could affect the results and explain some of the findings. The overall findings based on CVD health do not support lowering the recommendations for added sugar intake to below 5 E%, although they do indicate lower risks of CVDs among consumers of &gt;5‚Äì7.5 E% than among consumers of 10 E% of added sugar.</p>
<p>The clear associations between overall sweetened beverage intake and a higher risk of several CVDs (i.e., ischemic stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and abdominal aortic aneurysm) found in this study are supported by previous findings. However, the findings specifically for artificially sweetened beverages and sugar-sweetened beverages are not as congruous with existing literature which points toward them being associated with CVD risk as well as risk markers for CVD (<a href="#B6">6</a>, <a href="#B35">35</a>‚Äì<a href="#B37">37</a>). In this study, however, higher intake of artificially sweetened beverages was associated with increased risks of ischemic stroke and heart failure, while no associations were found between intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and CVD risk. This could be explained by a relatively low frequency of sugar- and artificially sweetened beverage consumption, as 10,843 (26%) and 5,727 (14%) individuals, respectively, reported consumption of at least 1 serving/week. Only 2,499 (6%) individuals consumed &gt;8 servings/week of sugar-sweetened beverages and 1,660 (4%) individuals consumed &gt;8 servings/week of artificially sweetened beverages. To put it into perspective, a review article reported an 8% increased CVD risk with each additional consumed serving of sugar-sweetened beverages per day (<a href="#B38">38</a>), thus it is possible that there were too few sugar- and artificially sweetened beverage consumers, and in particular, too few high-frequency consumers, to detect similar associations. It should also be mentioned, however, that it has been suggested that associations found with artificially sweetened beverages could be affected by reverse causality (<a href="#B36">36</a>). It should also be noted that while some literature suggests that consumption of artificial sweeteners could impact cardiovascular health negatively by alteration of the gut microbiota, the collected body of evidence does not indicate adverse effects of artificially sweetened beverage intake on CVD risk (<a href="#B39">39</a>).</p>
<p>The findings for treats are consistent with previous findings in the Malm√∂ Diet and Cancer Study, in which the highest risks of stroke, coronary events, atrial fibrillation, and aortic stenosis were found in the lowest intake category ( ‚â§ 2 servings/week) (<a href="#B13">13</a>). Similar findings were reported for all-cause mortality in the Malm√∂ Diet and Cancer Study and the Northern Swedish Health and Disease Study, where inverse associations were reported with intake of treats (<a href="#B21">21</a>). The findings for toppings are less uniform, as the results from this study indicated positive associations between intake of toppings and risk of heart failure and aortic stenosis, and negatively associated with risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm, while no associations were found with intake of toppings and CVD risk in Malm√∂ Diet and Cancer Study (<a href="#B13">13</a>). Given that this study has more than twice as many participants as the Malm√∂ Diet and Cancer Study, it is possible that the discrepancy could be due to a higher power to detect associations.</p>
<p>The findings of this study indicate that not all sources of added sugar are equally harmful to health, as sugar-sweetened beverages are the primary source of added sugar associated with increased CVD risk. Possible explanations of the discrepancies between the associations for sweetened beverages and treats and toppings include liquid calories providing lower satiety and insufficient compensatory reduction of caloric intake, thus promoting overweight and obesity, which are established risk factors for CVD (<a href="#B40">40</a>). It should be noted that there are currently no mechanistic explanations for the negative linear associations found for treats. One aspect to take into consideration is however that there is a social tradition of ‚Äúfika‚Äù in Sweden, where people get together with friends, relatives, or coworkers for coffee and pastries (<a href="#B41">41</a>). Thus, one could hypothesize that the intake of treats is part of many people's everyday lives without necessarily being related with overall poor dietary or lifestyle patterns, and that it might be a marker of social life. Consumption of sweetened beverages, one the other hand, has been linked to lower overall dietary quality (<a href="#B42">42</a>).</p>
<p>Despite adjusting for plausible confounders, we cannot rule out the presence of confounders due to the observational nature of this study and the complexity of diet as an exposure. The confounders are also likely to differ between the outcomes. In this study, while adjustments were made for processed meat consumption, a significant contributor to sodium intake in Sweden, direct sodium intake was not accounted for. The FFQ used in the cohorts did not account for salt used in cooking or at the table, and therefore, dietary sodium intake could not be estimated. Moreover, existing literature indicates poor agreement between sodium intake estimated from FFQs and urinary sodium excretion (<a href="#B43">43</a>), highlighting the need for future research to incorporate more accurate measures, such as urinary sodium excretion, to more precisely assess the impact of sodium intake as a potential confounding factor. Further, we did not adjust for factors accounting for social networks, which is something that should be further explored in future studies. As inverse associations have been found between intake of treats and CVD incidence in these cohorts as well as others (<a href="#B21">21</a>), intake of treats should be studied closer with regards to biological mechanisms as well as possible correlations with other factors that could impact the observed associations. Other limitations of this study include the self-reported dietary information, which may introduce some misreporting and, as a result, misclassification of exposure. Although we excluded individuals deemed to have implausible energy intakes, some misclassification of exposure may remain. Additionally, approximately 39% of the participants did not complete the 2009 assessment, meaning that information on diet and covariates was only available during baseline for those participants.</p>
<p>In comparison to the national mean added sugar intake of 9.6 E% in Sweden in 2010‚Äì2011 (<a href="#B8">8</a>), the mean added sugar intakes in the study population were lower, estimated to be 9.0 E% in 1997 and 6.7 E% in 2009. In this study population, the intakes of sugar-sweetened foods and beverages were also lower in 2009 than in 1997, despite the national intake levels of sweetened beverages and treats increasing throughout the same period (<a href="#B44">44</a>). Aside from an actual difference in sugar intake between 1997 and 2009 in SMC and COSM, one possible explanation for this difference is that the general perception of the health effects of added sugar differed during those time periods, and thus it could be theorized that misreporting of added sugar was more prevalent in 2009 than in 1997. Despite this, the precision of the results was higher when incorporating the updated information from 2009.</p>
<p>Strengths of this study include the large study population of 69,705 individuals as well as the repeated assessments for the majority of the participants, which allowed us to gain insights into the participants' diets at two separate time-points, leading to higher precision and likely reducing misclassification of exposure, though this cannot be completely ruled out. Finally, because the associations between added sugar intake and different CVD outcomes can vary, this study investigated the risk of the CVDs separately. We also studied added sugar intake as a whole and in groups of sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, providing higher granularity and further insights into how different forms of added sugar intake associate with CVD risk. Due to the large number of statistical tests performed in this study, there is a risk of chance findings. The findings of this study could help inform future dietary guidelines and recommendations which could guide policies to reduce CVD incidence and ultimately improve public health.</p>
<p>The results of this study are consistent with previous findings in another Swedish middle-aged population (<a href="#B13">13</a>), but the associations between added sugar intake and CVD risk cannot necessarily be generalized to other populations as the consumption patterns of added sugar and sugar-sweetened foods and beverages may vary across countries and age groups. More research is needed to discern whether the observed associations, and the findings for treats in particular, can be replicated in other populations, and future research should be conducted to explore potential mechanisms and associations with intermediary risk factors. To acquire a better understanding of the associations between added sugar intake and CVD risk, other methods such as using objective biomarkers or Mendelian randomizations could be used to investigate any causal links between added sugar intake and CVD risk in observational studies.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>According to the findings of this study, the associations between added sugar intake and CVDs vary substantially depending on the disease and source of added sugar. Finally, the findings of this study emphasize the adverse health effects associated with sweetened beverage consumption and indicate higher CVD risks among individuals with low intakes of treats.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Recently, noted VC Marc Andreessen kicked off a discussion about debanking, in a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1s7bWdn9JEz2Cm7f0duV9J">podcast</a> with his co-founder Ben Horowitz (begins at <a href="https://overcast.fm/+ABEkhc21e20/7:42">7:42</a>) and in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye8MOfxD5nU">appearance</a> on Joe Rogan‚Äôs podcast. The venture firm they founded, a16z, also published a <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/debanking-explained/">brief</a> on this topic.</p><p>The central thrust, quoting a16z‚Äôs brief (ellipsis in original): ‚Äú<em>Debanking can therefore be used as a tool or weapon systemically wielded by specific political actors / agencies against private individuals or industries without due process. Imagine if the government decided who could or couldn‚Äôt get electricity merely because of their politics, or some arbitrary reason‚Ä¶ without having to explain, notify, or offer recourse. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening with debanking.</em>‚Äù</p><p>If you are new here, you are presently reading a column which routinely covers compliance-oriented topics at the intersection of the financial system and technology companies. This topic is pretty central to my beat, and I have some relevant personal knowledge.</p><p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a conspiracy theory if people <em>really are</em> out to get you.‚Äù sums up part of my reaction to this, but only part. There exists some amount of conflation between what private actors are doing, what state actors have de facto or de jure commanded that they do, and which <em>particular</em> state and political actors have their fingers on the keyboard. These create a complex system; the threads are not entirely divorced from each other.</p><p><strong>A few disclaimers:</strong></p><p>I previously worked for Stripe, and am currently an advisor there. Stripe is not a bank, but many regulated financial institutions have similar considerations. I‚Äôm not speaking for them. Stripe does not necessarily endorse things I say in my own spaces.</p><p>The recent debanking discourse focuses (and overfocuses; see below) on crypto. I am (somewhat notoriously) a crypto skeptic. Arguments aren‚Äôt soldiers; the truth is the truth. The truth sometimes favors crypto advocates in this discussion, and where it does, I will cite sources extensively. Where it doesn‚Äôt, I will mostly cite sources extensively.</p><p>The debanking discussion arises from an explicitly political project. Moreover, questions of public policy are frequently political in a democracy. The ballot box is the ultimate check on government abuse of power. While I have no project here, and try to be non-partisan in professional spaces, to ease the fears of crypto fans: I‚Äôm <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1322074">definitely not</a> a secret Warrenite.</p><h2 id="closing-bank-accounts">Closing bank accounts</h2><p>‚ÄúDebanking‚Äù describes a cluster of behaviors.</p><p>The most salient one is involuntarily closing a customer‚Äôs bank account, often a long-established one, optionally without presenting a reason. Because ‚Äúdebanking‚Äù is an advocacy term, that often gets conflated with <em>declining to open</em> an account for a person or a business.</p><p>These two things are very different in their impact on the person/firm and in our moral intuitions. It‚Äôs the difference between getting divorced and being turned down for a date.</p><p>Advocates often invoke a user-centric perspective of debanking, focusing on the impact on individuals/firms. Then, they conflate it with regulators‚Äô decisions regarding <em>bank supervision</em>, in ways which are <em>facially not</em> about direct user impact. We will return to bank supervision later.</p><p>Industry doesn‚Äôt call it ‚Äúdebanking.‚Äù This is partly for the usual corporate euphemism reasons. This is partly because industry does not always share assumptions of how the world <em>should</em> work with advocates, and is concerned that ‚Äúdebanking‚Äù smuggles in those assumptions.</p><p>So when one discusses this with colleagues, one might use words like offboarding, derisking, closing the accounts of a customer, etc.</p><p>There is often an implication, and much rarer a reality, that the debanking decision is not one of a single financial institution. Sufficiently correlated ‚Äúindependent‚Äù decisions by financial institutions could deprive a firm or individual of access to banking services. We will explore some <em>coordination</em> mechanisms, which are overstated, and some <em>correlation</em> mechanisms, which are poorly understood.</p><p>We‚Äôre hearing about debanking because it sometimes affects socially established wealthy entrepreneurs and their companies. Some people it happened to are densely networked and also affiliated with talented communicators that have (in the parlance of our times) a platform. It is important to say from the jump that <em>this is not the typical profile</em>.</p><p>A huge majority of all people who find their accounts involuntarily closed will have been let go for credit risk or operational cost reasons. Overdraft your account repeatedly and look unlikely to be able to pay the fee for this service? Expect to lose that account, and probably all other accounts at that institution.</p><p>Do you know anyone with a parent advanced in years, who is dealing with challenges of aging, perhaps has gotten scammed a time or three, and might occasionally lash out at customer service employees? Debanking is more relevant to their interests than they might currently appreciate.</p><p>Decisions to debank an individual will often debank their controlled entities, and vice versa. Debanking will also not infrequently swiftly cascade to accounts in the same household, regardless of title (non-specialists can round this to ‚Äúname on the account‚Äù; industry can‚Äôt). Banks institutionally consider those accounts in the same household to be highly likely to be under common control, regardless of what paperwork, account holders, or politically influential subcultures believe. This is an area in which the mores of the banking industry are much closer to the traditional middle class than to coastal elites.</p><p>Sometimes, though, one gets one‚Äôs accounts closed because one has activities which are outside a bank‚Äôs risk tolerance or contrary to their compliance posture. This was cited to me both times I was debanked.</p><h3 id="two-debanking-anecdotes-explained">Two debanking anecdotes explained</h3><p>Once upon a time, I had a U.S. checking account. One day, the bank called me, and asked me why I was averaging two incoming ACH transfers a day. I told them that I ran a sole proprietorship selling software over the Internet. The ACH transfers were from from my two payment providers, which paid me out my sales (less fees) once per business day. The bank thanked me for my explanation and told me they thought the business sounded legitimate. Then they said I had 30 days to move the business‚Äô funds flow to a different bank, or they would close all my accounts.</p><p>‚ÄúBanksplain that offboarding?‚Äù Typical retail consumer checking accounts are, on the spectrum of the full menu of banking services, extremely low-risk, not a focus of bank examiner time, and institutionally preferred by both banks and regulators because of core financial access concerns. Accordingly, the amount and degree of monitoring a bank invests in the consumer checking line of business will be relatively low, in line with a risk analysis it performed. Its regulator has read that analysis and decision, and expressed no objection to it.</p><p>This particular bank did not, at the time, have a small business practice within its personal banking division. Very many banks do, but this <em>particular</em> bank did not. And thus <em>this bank</em> had not built out the higher degree of policies and procedures that would support small business banking. A surprising example of a small business that demands drastically more thought than you would think is discussed in detail below. The bank, on learning I had a sole proprietorship banked with them, considered that behavior <em>innocent</em> but not <em>supportable, </em>not because it didn't like <em>my</em> business but because it knew it had no built out infrastructure to support <em>any</em> business.</p><p>At the second institution, I once checked my U.S.-organized individual retirement account from a Japanese IP address. I had done that many times, but I did it one last time, too. This caused a short phone call, where the bank‚Äôs affiliate confirmed that I indeed lived in Japan, then informed me the account would be immediately restricted and then closed. I would need to make arrangements to request my shares be transferred to a new (U.S.) brokerage account, or authorize them to sell and mail me a check.</p><p>‚ÄúBanksplain that offboarding?‚Äù This was likely downstream of a procedure implemented to ensure that the institution‚Äôs affiliated securities firm did not act outside the scope of its broker-dealer licenses, which (the institution was aware) did not include any with Japanese regulators.</p><p>When these events happened, it was <em>very annoying</em>. I did not contemporaneously understand why they were happening. They required me to take time away from life, my day job, and business to make more phone calls, learn more things about the financial industry, and ultimately open new accounts.</p><p>That is the typical end to a debanking story. ‚ÄúAnd then, I opened a new account.‚Äù</p><p>Immigrant communities keep lists of which banks most want their business. So does the community of people who run small software businesses online. And so, while immigrants and small software companies deal with substantially more banking friction than the typical American working for Google or a university does, they are both very bankable.</p><p>Consider crypto entrepreneurs who have received an offer of investment of several million dollars. One might be able to hold the ideas in one mind simultaneously that a) there is some diversity of life experiences in that group but b) on average though, they are very socially advantaged, when considered on most of the usual axes. Despite those substantial advantages, it has been persuasively alleged that their companies and the entrepreneurs themselves <em>routinely</em> suffer debanking.&nbsp;</p><p>I also understand this to be true, in large part downstream of one risk factor that they hit more than <em>almost </em>all legal businesses of comparable scale and sophistication. There have been times and places where this challenge made crypto <em>firms</em> almost unbankable to the extent banks knew what they were doing. And it directly drives decisions against crypto<em> founders and employees</em>.</p><h2 id="debanking-specifically-for-aml-risk">Debanking specifically for AML risk</h2><p>I‚Äôve written extensively about <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/kyc-and-aml-beyond-the-acronyms/">KYC</a> and <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/money-laundering-and-aml-compliance/">AML</a> and will not recap all of it here. Banks have a panoply of obligations under regulation. One of those is that they have to write AML policies, including policies which identify high-risk activities. Then they <em>have to follow those policies</em>. You can overpromise but <em>you cannot underdeliver; </em>after you‚Äôve told a regulator you will do X, not doing X can result in fines and other punishments,<em> even if the regulator did not tell you to do (specifically) X</em>.</p><p>Before we reach crypto, consider AML risk and its consequences among money services businesses.</p><p>Running a <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/money-services-business-definition">money services business</a> (MSB) is virtually universally called out as a high-risk activity by banks‚Äô internal AML policies. Explaining <em>why</em> would require explaining the entire history and object of AML. Please just take as writ for the moment: all banks have a list, those lists rhyme with some variation, and MSBs are on <em>all the lists</em>.</p><p><em>Some banks</em> have built out so-called enhanced due diligence (EDD) programs under which they will bank MSBs. Many banks <em>have not</em>; if a business banking at one identifies itself as an MSB, or if their ongoing monitoring of transactions suggests one is probably an MSB (for example, if there are ACH pull from Western Union for tens of thousands of dollars, which will suggest to an analyst that the business is probably a Western Union agent transaction above the de minimis threshold), the bank intends that business to get a letter.</p><p>Whether they successfully execute on the letter, and the decision the letter announces, varies, but in terms of intent, they intend to consistently reach the decision given similar facts.</p><p>That letter will, in all likelihood, not be candid as to what is happening or why. It may not cite that the customer is an MSB. It may not cite why the bank believes that. It will not recount the bank‚Äôs internal AML policies which identify being an MSB as a high-risk activity, though it <em>might</em> say four or five templated words about risk. It will not explain the bank‚Äôs strategic decision to not invest in a compliant EDD program that would allow it to service MSBs.</p><p>No, the letter will say that the bank is closing the customer's accounts.</p><p>It may describe this as a "business decision", using those two words, of the bank. It will <em>often</em> say that this decision is final. The decision is <em>probably</em> <em>not actually final</em>. That is an opening negotiating position, like ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt negotiate salaries.‚Äù If you don‚Äôt argue the point, it has achieved its objective. The grain of truth within it is ‚ÄúWe probabilistically think that talking with the typical recipient of this letter is negative expected value.‚Äù</p><p>Why doesn‚Äôt the bank want to talk with the typical recipient about it? Because the typical MSB is a bodega with a sideline in alternative financial services.</p><p>You might think that it is absurd that the government would concern itself with MSBs that are clearly the sideline of the local bodega. Without reaching the question of whether this priority is absurd, I invite you to peruse the Financial Crime Enforcement Network‚Äôs <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/enforcement-actions-failure-register-money-services-business">Enforcement Actions For Failure To Register As A Money Services Business</a>. These are a<em> small sample</em> of real enforcement actions. That sample was chosen by FINCEN and I think reasonable people understand it was not chosen by FINCEN with a goal of embarrassing FINCEN or the entire AML regime that ensures FINCEN employees will have a job tomorrow.</p><p>I will take the liberty of fictionalizing names here, to give you the flavor of real people with real businesses that FINCEN both a) prosecuted and b) posted trophies of <em>pour encourager les autres</em> : Bob Smith d/b/a Bob‚Äôs Fast Gas. Taro‚Äôs Snack Shop, Inc. Cheap Phonez 4 U, Inc. Ben Goldberg d/b/a Kosher Foods.</p><p>FINCEN has posted the full text of each settlement, frequently including a restatement of their alleged violations. In many of those documents (not all of them!), if one credits FINCEN‚Äôs narrative as Gospel truth, one will believe: yeah, this is <em>absolutely a bodega</em>. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has jammed up the guy behind the counter because he failed to have a written AML/KYC policy and because when he traveled overseas the person he hired to mind the store was not trained in AML. Having won the case, they fined him $10,000. Given that, a fair-minded reader immediately assumes the bodega is probably <em>not actually a front</em> for the Colombian drug cartels, Hamas, or a foreign intelligence operation.</p><p>With this well-evidenced understanding of FINCEN‚Äôs‚Ä¶ quixotic interest in the crime of selling money orders and also laundry detergent and delicious sandwiches, you can understand why a bank, attentive to FINCEN‚Äôs desires here, is doing something that strikes many people <em>as insane</em>. It has employed teams of people whose job is to make sure it sifts the rogue bodegas from the garden-variety bodegas before FINCEN asks ‚ÄúWhy did you move money for <em>a rogue bodega!</em>? How many times do we have to tell you people! BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR ROGUE BODEGAS.‚Äù</p><p>Running EDD processes and ongoing monitoring is expensive. Banking a bodega isn‚Äôt very lucrative. And thus most banks won‚Äôt bank a bodega that is also an MSB, despite them having no particular malice against bodegas or the people who run them. This won‚Äôt change if the bodega owner calls to them to protest that he is a legitimate businessman, that this debanking is un-American, or that he feels like they are discriminating against him for being an immigrant. That‚Äôs a conversation the bank has had a thousand times and never want to have again‚Ä¶ <em>with a bodega owner</em>.</p><p>Some MSBs are fintechs. They have teams of people who are extremely aware of financial regulation. Those professionals intentionally chose a bank which was capable of banking at least some MSBs. They then had a laborious bespoke conversation about risk tolerance and mutually agreed-upon compliance procedures.</p><p>More than zero fintechs have been debanked over the years, but they <em>probably don‚Äôt first learn about it from a paper letter.</em> Their team of people who do bank things all day would have heard from the team of people that do fintech things all day, likely beginning many moons ago. And if they got the letter, they would understand generally <em>why</em> they got the letter, and not be so oblivious as to <em>trust the literal text of the letter</em>.</p><p>Class is an interconnected set of culture, scripted behaviors, and the advantages and disadvantages that attach to them. The culture that is the American professional-managerial class has a relationship with truth which occasionally confounds outsiders to it. An American PMC member, particularly one with a professional specialization in banking, understands an offboarding letter to be a ritual object rather than something meant to be taken literally.</p><p>Many regular people who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/05/business/banks-accounts-close-suddenly.html">get the offboarding letter</a> are confused and upset. Most people who get this letter are insufficiently expert in the financial system to understand what is going on. Many of them are (perhaps sensibly) enraged that the bank seems reluctant to offer answers. If they successfully pry answers out of the bank, the answers sound like nonsense or change constantly.</p><p>Here, advocates often say that banks lack fundamental humanity, regard for their customers, or simple competence. I‚Äôd tell them that is neither here nor there, but the challenges described in <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/seeing-like-a-bank/">Seeing like a Bank</a> drive far more of this than malice, apathy, or incompetence <em>as such</em>. It is a systems issue.</p><p>But <em>AML-driven offboarding has one particular spectral signature</em> which is worse than normal debanking, which will always be a confusing, unpleasant experience for most customers.</p><p><em>Some</em> of these customers are getting the letter because the bank looked into their account after a transaction was flagged as suspicious. This generally happens because an automated system twinged on it. Most of the so-called ‚Äúalerts‚Äù are false positives, but banks are required to have and follow a procedure to triage them. That procedure is typically ‚ÄúSend a tweet-length summary of the alert to an analyst and have them eyeball things.‚Äù Every bank needs at least one person triaging alerts; the largest banks have <em>thousands</em>.</p><p>What if the analyst, on the basis of their training, experience, and data available from the alert system and from the account history they can access, decides that a transaction has‚Ä¶ more than nothing irregular about it? Then they compose a specially formatted memo.</p><p>That memo is called a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR). The bank files it with FINCEN, via a computer talking to a computer after the analyst pushes some buttons. Then the analyst goes back to triaging incoming alerts.</p><p>Busting bodegas is a sideline for FINCEN; receiving SARs is their main job.</p><p>A SAR is not a conviction of a crime. It isn‚Äôt even an <em>accusation</em> of a crime. It is an interoffice memo documenting an irregularity, about 2-3 pages long. Banks file about <a href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/investigation-fraud-and-risk/special-report-suspicious-activity-reports/#:~:text=Financial%20institutions%20operating%20in%20the,from%20pre%2Dpandemic%202019%20levels.">4 million</a> per year. (There are some non-bank businesses also obliged to file them, but nobody is presently complaining about decasinoing, so ignore that detail. Banks are the <em>central</em> filers of SARs.) For flavor: <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/reports/sar-stats">about 10%</a> are in the bucket Transaction With No Apparent Economic, Business, or Lawful Purpose. FINCEN has <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/frequently-asked-questions">~300 employees</a> and so cannot possibly read any significant portion of these memos. They mostly just maintain the system which puts them in a database which is searchable by many law enforcement agencies. The overwhelming majority are write-once read-never.</p><p>Banks are extremely aware that most SARs are low signal, and that a good customer might wander into getting one filed on them. But there are thresholds and risk tolerance levels. And SARs will sometimes, fairly mechanically, cause banks to decide that they probably don‚Äôt want to be holding a hot potato. It‚Äôs risky, plausibly, and expensive, certainly. At many institutions, for retail accounts, the institution will have serious questions about whether it wants to continue working with you on the second SAR. It will <em>probably</em> not spend that much time thinking deeply about the answer.</p><p>So can the bank <em>simply explain</em> to the customer that staff time preparing SARs is expensive and that routinely banking customers who turn out to be <em>real</em> money launderers is a great way to end up with <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/hsbc-holdings-plc-and-hsbc-bank-usa-na-admit-anti-money-laundering-and-sanctions-violations">billion</a> <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/standard-chartered-bank-admits-illegally-processing-transactions-violation-iranian-sanctions">dollar</a> <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/td-bank-hit-with-3b-penalty-in-u-s-money-laundering-settlement/">fines</a>? No, they cannot.</p><p>The typical individual named in a SAR is low-sophistication and cannot meaningfully participate in a discussion with a Compliance officer, because they‚Äôre very probably at the social margins. Do you have a favorite axis of disadvantage? Immigrant, no financial background, limited English ability, small business owner, socioeconomic class, etc? The axis has non-zero relevance to one‚Äôs probability of getting a SAR filed on oneself due to innocent behavior. Very many people who have SARs filed on them are disadvantaged on several axes simultaneously.</p><p>No, the bank cannot explain why SARs triggered a debanking, because <em>disclosing the existence of a SAR is illegal</em>. <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-12/chapter-I/part-21/subpart-B/section-21.11">12 CFR 21.11(k)</a> Yes, it is the law in the United States that a private non-court, in possession of a memo written by a non-intelligence analyst, cannot describe the nature of the non-accusation the memo makes. Nor can it confirm or deny the existence of the memo. This is not a James Bond film. This is not a farce about the security state. This is not a right-wing conspiracy. <strong>This is <em>very much</em> the law.</strong></p><p>If you work at a regulated financial institution, in the U.S. or any allied country, you will be read into SAR (and broader AML) confidentiality within days of joining. You will be instructed to comply with it, very diligently. If you do not, your employer may suffer consequences. You personally are subject to private sanction by your employer (up to and including termination) <em>and also</em> the potential for criminal prosecution. If your trainer speaks with a British accent, they will phrase the offense as ‚Äú<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/29/section/333A">tipping off</a>.‚Äù</p><p>It‚Äôs not just illegal to disclose a SAR to the customer. It is extremely discouraged, by Compliance, to allow there to be an information flow <em>within the bank itself</em> that would allow most employees who interact directly with customers, like call center reps or their branch banker, to learn the existence of SAR. This is out of the concern that they would provide a customer with a responsive answer to the question ‚ÄúWhy are you closing my account?!‚Äù And so this is one case where in <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/seeing-like-a-bank/">Seeing like a Bank</a> the institution intentionally blinds <em>itself</em>. Very soon after making the decision to close your account the bank <em>does not know specifically why</em> it chose to close your account.</p><p>This strikes many people as Kafkaesque. (Me, too!) It is the long-standing practice of banking in the U.S. and allied countries. It is downstream of laws passed by duly elected representatives. It was not capriciously developed as a political tool in the last few years. (We‚Äôll get to those.)</p><p>Crypto-investing VCs are not low-sophistication operators of the corner bodega. They are extremely aware that crypto is on the high-risk list at many institutions. They would prefer this were not so.</p><p>Their preferences regarding the high-risk list at, say, portfolio fintech companies <em>are sophisticated and nuanced</em>. For example, they will (accurately!) say that the high-risk list authored by a company socially close to them did not arise in a vacuum. Certain entries were foisted upon them by financial partners. Their financial partners will, over drinks at the bar, very quietly, say that they can relate to occasionally feeling powerless. And, though many will find this dumbfounding, their <em>regulators will frequently say the same thing</em>.</p><p>Occasionally. About some entries. We shall return to the mechanisms.</p><h3 id="debankings-of-founders-as-opposed-to-firms">Debankings of founders as opposed to firms</h3><p>Plausibly some crypto founders are low-sophistication about the finance industry in their early days as founders. This is not a judgement about one's character. Nobody is born knowing everything, and <em>very few people</em> will have a serious and informed encounter with this topic <em>ever, </em>not in school, not at work, not in being a generally well-read individual, unless and until it is professionally relevant to them.</p><p>Perhaps a founder might ask a friend: ‚ÄúI run a legitimate business which happens to be in crypto and suddenly found my personal accounts closed. Why did this happen? <em>I did nothing wrong.</em>‚Äù</p><p>Playing the odds? The bank thinks there is an unacceptable risk that you will use your personal accounts to launder money on behalf of the business (and/or its customers, etc). The bank has insufficient controls to give them an appropriate level of certainty as to whether you‚Äôre doing this or not. They are disinclined to find out the hard way, so they invite you to find another bank.</p><p>Why do they think you might launder on behalf of the business? In part because of <em>the extensive history</em> of crypto companies laundering funds through the accounts of their founders and employees, specifically, and the banking industry‚Äôs highly-evidenced belief that businesses and their owners routinely commingle funds, generally.</p><p>Tether <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/crypto-companies-behind-tether-used-falsified-documents-and-shell-companies-to-get-bank-accounts-f798b0a5">maintained access</a> to the banking system by, among other mechanisms, having their executives establish accounts in their own names, stashing funds in the name of a lawyer, and using their non-executive employees as money mules. SBF had many talents but one of the main ones was money laundering. A major mechanism for that was loaning money (mostly customer assets and mostly sham loans) to employees then representing to banks (and others) that the employee was making an independent transaction not affiliated with FTX/Alameda/etc.</p><p>One would have to be <em>very new</em> or <em>very incurious</em> to be interested in crypto companies and be unaware of this history. Banks were rarely incorporated yesterday, and certain varieties of incuriosity-with-benefits are extremely frowned upon.</p><h2 id="presumption-of-innocence-by-commercial-providers">Presumption of innocence by commercial providers</h2><p>But there is <em>something</em> to the critique, by advocates, that rampant lawlessness within crypto for a decade and a half shouldn‚Äôt cause an institution to stereotype an innocent crypto founder. Advocates want debanking to only follow an investigation uncovering a) strong evidence there exists b) a particular articulable risk which c) society actually cares about.</p><p>Part of it is philosophical: they believe they are entitled to something like individualized attention and a presumption of innocence. This assumption is deeply embedded in our legal system.</p><p>We <strong><em>do not</em> </strong>have this assumption embedded in our banking system.</p><p>It would be laughable for credit accounts: ‚Äú<em>I</em> have never defaulted on a loan from <em>you</em>, and therefore, you <em>must</em> give me the benefit of the doubt, and issue this loan.‚Äù No intellectually serious person expects that from banks. No, we construct probabilistic models about who is likely to repay based on observable factors, less some factors which society has disallowed us from using under the law. If we deem you insufficiently likely to repay the loan, even if you are <em>still</em> <em>very likely</em> to repay the loan, you don‚Äôt get the loan. Finance is not high school; 92% is not an A- anymore. We don‚Äôt have to wait for you to default, or have any individualized suspicion about you, or conduct a years-long fact-finding process.</p><p>One <em>is</em> prohibited in discrimination in lending on basis of, for example, race. Why? The American people feel quite strongly that they want this to be true, and so their representatives passed a series of laws. Those laws are well-established and uncontroversial. You also, as young data scientists quickly learn, can‚Äôt use customer zip codes, no matter how probative they are. This is because they have a very high risk of being an effective proxy for race. (Aside: this is why California <a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-story-of-vaccinateca/">used zip codes</a> when it wanted to prioritize the delivery of lifesaving healthcare to patients of favored races, primarily for political reasons.)</p><p>One is not prohibited from using someone‚Äôs occupation or ownership of a business as underwriting criteria. Those happen to be <em>incredibly probative</em> and, not incidentally, <em>separate rules literally require that we ask</em>. (AML rules require a bank opening an account with ongoing transaction capability to ask for what your source of funds will be, which will often include wages and/or business income, and banks then generally need to know ‚Äú... OK, wages for what?‚Äù)</p><p>Is there a built-out appeals process or higher authority with respect to being declined banking services? Don‚Äôt our moral intuitions require there to be one?</p><p>Many people with ‚Äúcapitalist‚Äù in their job title will tell you that there is, indeed, a higher authority to complain to if a capital allocator rejects your pitch. It is Mr. Market. That capital allocator has competitors. Go pitch them. Are there projects that <em>no</em> capital allocator will fund? <em>Absolutely</em>. That‚Äôs an important part of why we pay allocators: they assist us in not frittering away resources society expects to fund e.g. teachers' retirements on non-productive uses. </p><p>And so allocators will tell you: If you can‚Äôt find any allocator who will back you, despite your belief you have a good business plan, and your business plan requires capital to execute, <em>you do not have a good business plan</em>, and you should do something else with your life.</p><p>I have yet to meet a venture capitalist who believes that passing <em>on a pitch</em> should be subject to review by a higher authority than their partnership. Many do not, as routine practice, tell entrepreneurs why they passed. <em>Pure downside.</em> Passing is not an invitation for the founder to work their persuasive magic on you. The <em>meeting</em> was the opportunity for that; the meeting <em>is over</em>.</p><p>But banks are, certainly, not venture capitalists. There is an aspect to banks which is not exactly dissimilar in character to infrastructure providers. Utilities are frequently invoked as an example here. Why would we construct a society in which power companies needed to make investment decisions in supplying power?! (I think people surprised there may be surprised to do deep dives into e.g. negotiating power purchase agreements.)</p><p>Banks, in addition to providing infrastructure, are also <em>neck deep in capital allocation</em>. Some bits of the bank might be more like one's conception of a power company, and some bits of the bank might be more like one's conception of a venture capitalist. And some bits might be confusing hybrids of two intuitions.</p><p>It may surprise you that a simple vanilla deposit account is <em>both</em> infrastructure <em>and also</em> a capital allocation decision.</p><p>For one thing, typical deposit accounts in the U.S. <em>are </em><a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/the-long-shadow-of-checks/"><em>actually</em></a><em> credit products</em>. It's baked in and can't be baked out without making them unfit for purpose.</p><p>For another:</p><h2 id="banking-reputable-legal-crypto-businesses-is-a-risky-endeavor">Banking reputable, legal crypto businesses is a risky endeavor</h2><p>Sources of credit risk to the bank are substantially broader than simple non-repayment of funds borrowed. A financial institution can take a credit loss on banking a business <em>without</em> having what most non-specialists would consider a credit relationship. This is particularly true when banking financial service providers.</p><p>Here‚Äôs a worked example:</p><p>Suppose a crypto exchange blows up out of nowhere, in an absolutely freak accident that happens in about 20% of all exchange-years. The last financial institution banking them can end up holding the bag.</p><p>Voyager Digital was a regulated institution that was <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/voyager-digital-begins-trading-on-toronto-stock-exchange-2021-09-20">publicly traded</a>. It had adults at the helm, a Compliance department, some level of written risk processes, and legitimate backers, including well-known venture capitalists.</p><p>Voyager blew up, because none of the above are sufficient to prevent you from blowing up.</p><p>When they blew up, their bank (Metropolitan Commercial) received a slew of ACH reversals. Customers (often quite reasonably!) felt that they had sent in money to buy crypto, but they hadn‚Äôt received their crypto, which feels <em>quite a bit like fraud</em>, and so they complained to <em>their (the customer‚Äôs)</em> bank.</p><p>Metropolitan characterizes that complaint as fraudulent behavior. There are certainly fraudulent accusations of fraud made to abuse cryptocurrency exchanges, by paying for crypto, claiming you didn‚Äôt get the crypto, and then getting your money back while you keep the crypto. However, the customers Metropolitan wanted permission to stiff perceive themselves as having no money <em>and also</em> no crypto. The customers had traded money for a claim against a bankruptcy estate. </p><p>Crypto is a product with widespread adoption across the socioeconomic spectrum, I am told. Do you think a random person off the street would, on being asked "Define a claim against a bankruptcy estate?", have a really confident, automatic answer to that question? I think they would probably have a more confident answer to the question "Have you ever tried to buy a claim against a bankruptcy estate?"</p><p>So what happens if one calls one's bank and says ‚ÄúI opened an app on my phone. I tried to buy something. I didn‚Äôt get it. Those bastards kept my money.‚Äù Very frequently, your bank‚Äôs customer service rep will type some brief notes into a web application then hit a button. The customer service rep is trained to sound helpful when this happens. Their skill with that... varies. They make, oh, $15 an hour and are not trained like a district court judge. They will conduct no real investigation nor careful balancing of facts and circumstances. They are likely entirely unaware of notorious bankruptcies in the crypto industry, which are an <em>infintessimally small</em> portion of all complaints that reach their telephone queue. Customer didn‚Äôt get something from an Internet merchant? Push the button, read the script to the customer, disconnect, immediately serve next caller.</p><p>That button will, some steps later, mechanically cause Metropolitan to transfer back some money to Voyager‚Äôs now aggrieved customer, which (importantly) Voyager did not actually have to distribute, because it was in bankruptcy. Whose balance sheet did it come off of, then? <em>Metropolitan‚Äôs</em>. Their shareholders had just performed the sacred duty of equity: taking the credit loss so that depositors didn‚Äôt have to.</p><p>If you are banking a quickly growing financial services firm which has large daily funds flows, and charging small per-transaction fees and/or earning net interest on deposits, the total amount of money at risk (within the chargeback or reversal window) as of time T can be <em>vastly larger than</em> the total revenue charged for services at all times 0 through T inclusive. A handwavy approximation for it: number of days in the relevant chargeback/dispute window times average daily transaction volume times dispute percentage. (This will be in the low to high tens of percent. It depends on many factors, including the sophistication of your customer base, whether well-informed guides to consumer rights in banking go viral within it, and similar.)&nbsp;</p><p>And thus banks are <em>very selective</em> with respect to what financial services firms they bank. Because one blowing up, <em>just one</em>, can sink the entire related business line.</p><p>Voyager and Metropolitan ended up <a href="https://f16c0eccd54007287fb794f9a3d05f2a.cdn.bubble.io/f1698430248752x773632316049114100/10.pdf">asking the court</a> to change the rules of the ACH protocol in their favor. Then banking technologists told the court that the ACH protocol was computer code maintained in a decentralized fashion and thus beyond the purview of any court.

A major aspect of the lawsuit: Voyager intimated to customers that they would be covered by FDIC insurance and so their funds on deposit were safe. Voyager‚Äôs CEO has alleged that Metropolitan‚Äôs management suggested this selling point. Voyager‚Äôs marketing department published <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/10/ftc-reaches-settlement-crypto-company-voyager-digital-charges-former-executive-falsely-claiming">objectively false</a> statements regarding FDIC coverage. ‚Äú[FDIC coverage] means that in the rare event your USD funds are compromised due to the company or our banking partner‚Äôs failure, you are guaranteed a full reimbursement (up to $250,000).‚Äù</p><p>Marketing departments frequently misunderstand fine distinctions here, which is why, at well-operated financial technology firms, Legal does not let marketing write <em>one single word</em> about FDIC insurance without their sign-off. The fateful two words above are ‚Äúthe company‚Äù: FDIC insurance <em>does not and has never</em> backstopped the obligations of non-insured <em>clients</em> of the banking system. It only backstops the obligations of <em>insured financial institutions</em>. (Had <em>Metropolitan</em> failed, Voyager‚Äôs customers may have had recourse to FDIC insurance, but Metropolitan <em>did not fail</em>.)&nbsp;</p><p>And so the FDIC has not paid Voyager‚Äôs customers one thin dime, nor will it ever. It has neither obligation nor legal authority to do so.</p><p>The FDIC is institutionally <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2022/pr22056.html"><em>very opposed</em></a> to fraudulently inducing customers to transact via claiming FDIC coverage. The FDIC is a banking regulator, among other things, and we‚Äôll discuss them more in a moment. But they are, first and foremost, in charge of the deposit insurance fund. Crypto‚Äôs history of falsely promising that the FDIC will make customers whole for its own failures is one reason why the FDIC is institutionally wary of crypto.</p><p>Metropolitan then <a href="https://www.bankingdive.com/news/metropolitan-commercial-bank-backs-out-of-crypto-voyager-digital-partner/639956/">ceased</a> crypto banking.

See the above piece for elaboration at length.</p><p>Now, banks who bank debt collectors can math out how many of their ACH payments are complained about. One can make an argument that those banks might not have <em>institutional knowledge</em> that complaints about debt collectors are structurally anomalously high, for <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/seeing-like-a-bank/">Seeing like a Bank</a> reasons. One could further argue that a regulator can licitly tell a bank something they don‚Äôt know. <em>That</em> sounds reasonable and an appropriate use of a public servant‚Äôs time.</p><p>Those banks that would open accounts for debt collectors (n.b. not all banks!) are OK with having that business. Debt collection, while not salubrious, is legal and regulated in the United States. Banks are not one-stop monitoring shops for all of their customers‚Äô various obligations under the law.</p><p>But working through legislatures and courts is slow and expensive. Why not simply <em>deputize the banks</em>?<em> </em>We already have them run private intelligence agencies! How much of a reach is it for them to also run private consumer protection bureaus?</p><p>The Obama administration didn‚Äôt like debt collectors, for very similar reasons to why I don‚Äôt like debt collectors. And so they broadened the critique: the risk in banking bad guys was broader than the (known, accepted, controlled, and <em>certainly not existential</em>) risk of ACH reversals. Those customer complaints, those complaints could harm the bank‚Äôs standing in the community. That could result in e.g. a withdrawal of customer deposits. This would imperil the bank, for the usual reason. And if something could imperil banks, why, that should <em>naturally</em> cause the FDIC to make its opinions known.</p><p><em>Get out of peril</em>, by kicking debt collectors to the curb.</p><p>But the FDIC had to be persuaded into that point of view, by a cadre of very talented people.</p><p>The Department of Justice had a legal theory, which it was <a href="https://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/ChokePointOPRReport.pdf">quite proud of.</a> The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) gives the DOJ a hunting license for any fraud (and many other crimes) which affects a federally insured financial institution. FIRREA was passed after the savings and loan crisis, to protect small financial institutions from peril and thereby avoid another crisis.</p><p>Now your common sense understanding might be ‚ÄúOh, Congress probably intended on cracking down on fraud targeting banks which, I don‚Äôt know, was big enough to imperil a small community institution? I could see a really large fraudulent bank loan imperiling a small bank. And checking the history books, there were some wildly fraudulent bank loans mixed up in the S&amp;L crisis. OK, so we federalized prosecution of defrauding a bank like that? Sounds reasonable.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>If you have that intuition, you are apparently not creative enough to have worked as a lawyer in the Obama admin DOJ. No, their thought was that if you provide rails which facilitate fraud, such as giving a fraudster a bank account, <em>you</em> are affecting a financial institution: <em>yourself</em>. And so, the DOJ can go after <em>you</em>, for <em>self-harm</em>. Note that you do not need to <em>lose money</em>, oh no, the DOJ can also go after you because the way you <em>affected yourself</em> was to<em> cause your regulator to like you less</em>. When you settle with the DOJ, it will extract an enforceable promise in writing that you will stop your campaign of self-harm, and also stop banking specifically enumerated industries, like payday loans.</p><p>I realize that this sounds unlikely. The following is a direct quote (expanding acronyms) from the DOJ Office of Professional Responsibility, in the <a href="https://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/ChokePointOPRReport.pdf">report</a> (pg 16) where they exonerated DOJ lawyers.</p><p><em>As more fully explained below, the [Consumer Protection Branch] has relied on the ‚Äúself-affecting‚Äù theory, as well as additional theories of liability, in three cases arising from the Operation Choke Point initiative.</em></p><p>Now when the DOJ or FDIC tells you, a bank, to do something, or <em>strongly suggests</em> that you do something, that usually isn‚Äôt the end of the argument. You <em>can</em> certainly haggle. You can even fight‚Ä¶ <em>to a degree</em>.</p><p>This is a multi-year iterated game with repeat players, each of whom has limited resources and very complicated preferences. Both sides are <em>constantly</em> picking their battles. There is give and take. When your counterparty is happy with you, your emails get returned faster, you get more of your asks, and you can report smooth sailing to your boss. Both banks and regulators are ultimately made up of people, with emotions, career paths, and annual performance reviews.</p><p>Banks do not actually make a lot of money from servicing debt collectors. The culture that is banking looks at the culture that is debt collection and sees slimy people <em>who are beneath it</em>. And so the banks frequently obliged. Many of them, in their offboarding letters to debt collectors, were unusually candid relative to the standards of offboarding letters: it‚Äôs not you, and we apologize for this, but we‚Äôve received regulatory guidance about your industry, and as a result our appetite to serve your industry no longer exists.</p><p>As it turns out, the Obama administration had <em>many diverse</em> policy preferences.</p><p>It wasn‚Äôt particularly in favor of guns, for example.</p><p>Gun sellers <strong>don‚Äôt</strong> use banks in the way that debt collectors use banks. They do not routinely trick customers into the gun-for-money transaction. They don‚Äôt make particularly intense use of ACH pulls (confidence: 99%, on general industry knowledge) and don‚Äôt have particularly high dispute rates (confidence: 95%, same).</p><p>But regulators, having discovered that ‚Äúreputational risk‚Äù attached to anyone you didn‚Äôt like with nary a whisper of complaint, believed that banking gun sellers was high-risk. Haven‚Äôt you read the newspapers? School shootings. Do you want any of that sticking to you? You are imperiling your good name, and therefore the stability of your deposit base, and therefore your bank, and therefore the insurance fund, by accepting the business of gun sellers.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-113hhrg91154/html/CHRG-113hhrg91154.htm">Congressional testimony</a>, the FDIC said that it hadn‚Äôt <em>ordered</em> anyone to debank disfavored businesses.</p><p><em>What we have done is we have tried to be very clear in putting out our guidance to&nbsp;say very publicly and clearly that as long as banks have appropriate risk mitigation measures in place, we are not going to prohibit or discourage them from doing business with anyone with whom they want to do business</em>.</p><p>One may be surprised that this individual might perceive themselves as telling the truth here. Because ‚ÄúJustify to me why the payday lenders are not on your high-risk list.‚Äù and then ‚ÄúDo you have a built-out EDD program for the deposit risk caused by payday lenders?‚Äù followed by ‚ÄúThen are you sure you should accept that business?‚Äù are consistent with this statement, individually and as a script. (Those are not quotes, but rather indicative summaries of stages in a conversation. I believe them to fairly characterize conversations that the record abundantly shows happened.)</p><p>The FDIC Office of the Inspector General, in an <a href="https://www.fdicoig.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2022-08/15-008AUD.pdf">investigatory report</a>, attempted to shift all blame for Operation Choke Point to the DOJ.</p><p><em>We found no evidence that the FDIC used the high-risk list to target financial institutions. However, references to specific merchant types in the summer 2011 edition of the FDIC‚Äôs Supervisory Insights Journal and in supervisory guidance created a perception among some bank executives that we spoke with that the FDIC discouraged institutions from conducting business with those merchants. This perception was most prevalent with respect to payday lenders</em></p><p>When a regulator publishes position papers that it wants you to do something, and reiterates this in individualized supervisory guidance, that tends to <em>create a perception</em> in this author that the communicated policy direction was not YOLOed onto the Internet by a room full of monkeys banging keyboards randomly.</p><p>As frequently happens, the individual officials who had instructed banks to debank the targeted industries ignored <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBdGOrcUEg8">Stringer Bell‚Äôs dictum</a> on taking notes on a criminal conspiracy. Emails sent within the FDIC and DOJ were routinely archived, and banks (of course) keep copies of correspondence from their regulators. Those emails said what they said, and what they said was <em>pretty damning</em>.</p><p>For example, the Department of Justice‚Äôs internal Six Month Status Report On Operation Choke Point (excerpted in <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Staff-Report-Operation-Choke-Point1.pdf">Congressional reporting</a>) said:</p><p><em>Finding substantial questions concerning the legality of the Internet payday lending business models and the loans underlying debits to consumers‚Äô bank accounts, many banks have decided to stop processing transactions in support of Internet payday lenders. We consider this to be a significant accomplishment and positive change for consumers&nbsp; . . . Although we recognize the possibility that banks may have therefore decided to stop doing business with legitimate lenders, we do not believe that such decisions should alter our investigative plans.</em></p><p>Not once, not twice, not a handful of times, not a loose confederation of rogue examiners. Three of six regional directors of the FDIC offices told the OIG that they understood Washington to want payday lending discouraged and two of them said there was an expectation to, in the words of the OIG, direct institutions that facilitated payday lending to ‚Äúpursue an exit strategy.‚Äù</p><p>Did that require top-down direction? You can, in fact, generate nationwide programs with local offices doing strikingly similar things without top-down direction. The combination of a monoculture plus a policy direction that lower-level staffers believe in is often sufficient to make it happen. We have extensive experience of this in tech and finance, as discussed later.</p><p>Japanese has a beautiful world, sontaku, for the attitude and actions a diligent subordinate would take without his superior‚Äôs explicit instruction, believing them to anticipate his boss‚Äô desires. Sontaku is a core skill in the American professional class. People possessing it are sometimes described as ‚Äúmotivated self-starters‚Äù, ‚Äúhigh-agency‚Äù, ‚Äúbold‚Äù, ‚Äùtakes initiative‚Äù, ‚Äùacts like an owner‚Äù, etc. You are a very, very bad Compliance professional if you aren‚Äôt constantly sontaku-ing your regulator. You are also a bad Regional Director of the FDIC if you aren‚Äôt constantly sontaku-ing Washington.</p><p>But Operation Choke Point, specifically, simply <em>was </em>official policy. If it wasn't, no entity as complicated as the United States can ever be described as having even once had an official policy.</p><p>As the former Chairman of the FDIC <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/william-isaac-dont-like-an-industry-send-a-message-to-its-bankers-1416613023">wrote</a> in a WSJ editorial:</p><p><em>Internal Justice Department papers released by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee make it clear that Justice prefers coercing banks to drop customers through Operation Choke Point rather than prosecuting illegal or fraudulent businesses directly because it‚Äôs easier, faster and requires fewer resources.</em></p><p>Operation Choke Point wasn‚Äôt just targeting debt collectors, gun sellers, and payday lenders. No, the FDIC‚Äôs bullet-pointed list was 30 entries long. They range from clearly abusive and illegal (scams) to ‚ÄúOne could construct a narrative by which banking that industry is challenging‚Äù (pornography) to ‚Äúa grab bag of things we dislike‚Äù (racism and‚Ä¶ fireworks? <em>Really</em>?)</p><p>Operation Choke Point, once it came to light, caused a media and Congressional furor, because it was arbitrary and lawless. (I am using that in the ordinary sense of an American who took civics, not in the specialized sense of a DOJ lawyer, who might bristle for being called ‚Äúlawless‚Äù when they had three court cases and one 25 year old statute which are clearly explained in the memo as adding up to them being able to do everything they did.)</p><p>The architects of Operation Choke Point steadfastly denied it was designed to do what it was manifestly designed to do. They denied it did what it manifestly did.</p><p>The agencies were then pointedly accused of lack of candor with Congress. If you tell a Congressman he isn‚Äôt reading the WSJ right, but internally your bosses are high-fiving themselves over WSJ article, and they are high-fiving themselves because finally the WSJ is covering their important work accurately, Congress will not be pleased. Then they will show you a copy of your bosses‚Äô emails, which they can subpoena, because they are Congress. (House Oversight Committee report, ibid, pg 10)</p><p>Some scholarly <a href="https://administrativelawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/ALR-75.2_Stevenson.pdf#page=27">literature</a> is sympathetic to the regulators‚Äô point of view. (More is not.)</p><p>If you want a steelman, that‚Äôs the best one you‚Äôll likely find. It acknowledges the DOJ‚Äôs efforts to interdict fraud by creatively interpreting FIRREA and targeting third-party payment processors and banks, accuses the financial industry of making a fuss over this for self-interested commercial reasons, performs a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_hangout">modified limited hangout</a> of the high-risk list, and claims that the gun industry cynically glommed onto the news cycle for political reasons despite no actual enforcement specifically addressed against it.</p><p>My point of view? I can read emails. They say what they say, even when acknowledging what they say would cost a public servant their job. I read the postmortems (including many years ago; this sort of thing was my hobby before it was my job). I view them as face-saving exercises written, in no small part, by civil servants <em>mortified</em> that their peers could lose jobs and pensions simply for implementing the Administration‚Äôs policy preferences using colorable authority.</p><p>Sometimes, people have been known to lie in politics. Sometimes justice is not done. I know, try to weather the shock you must feel.</p><p>Operation Choke Point was mostly forgotten, except by banking nerds.</p><p>Until‚Ä¶</p><h2 id="so-called-choke-point-20">So-called Choke Point 2.0</h2><p>Nic Carter, a crypto <a href="https://castleisland.vc/" rel="noreferrer">VC</a> and <a href="https://castleisland.libsyn.com/">podcaster</a>, who occasionally does very good work, has been steadfastly attempting to brand a constellation of regulatory activities regarding crypto as Choke Point 2.0. This branding is an attempt to delegitimize them by associating them with politically-motivated lawlessness. It has since become popular among crypto advocates.</p><p>Unlike Operation Choke Point, which <em>actually was</em> a centrally directed operation with written project plans, status meetings, ongoing progress reports, and a code name decided by the participants (who, in hindsight, should have talked to their own Comms department and picked something that didn‚Äôt sound nefarious to describe their plans), Choke Point 2.0 stretches like taffy to attach to any recent regulatory activity crypto advocates don‚Äôt like. So we‚Äôll have to review <em>quite an involved history of very disparate issues</em> to give advocates a fair hearing.</p><p>Carters' work, which is extensive on this topic, exists in pieces like <a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/2023-banking-crisis">Did the government start a global financial crisis to destroy crypto?</a></p><p>To answer the question in the title: no, it did not. We started a financial crisis which to-date is mercifully narrow as an <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/banking-in-very-uncertain-times/">underappreciated side effect of interest rate hikes to tame inflation</a>.</p><p><strong>Silvergate: Crypto had a bank, doesn‚Äôt now, and misses the good days</strong></p><p>Crypto advocates have specific and general concerns about banking supervision at a small cadre of banks acutely relevant to their interests. <em>They have tied these concerns to the debanking narrative</em>.</p><p>They do not evince attention to detail or familiarity with the procedural history of specific examples they invoke, though some have attempted some original reporting with respect to these issues. That is to their credit.</p><p>As we‚Äôve established, almost all banks consider crypto businesses to be high-risk, and avoid them. There was a small cadre of banks which had active crypto practices. Those banks purported, to the public and their regulators, to have the EDD required to bank them compliantly. This was incredibly operationally useful for crypto, for one very obvious reason (substantially every business needs a bank account) and one less obvious one.</p><p>Crypto talks a great game about decentralization, but centralized systems are more efficient than decentralized systems. When riding banking rails, making transfers outside of regular banking hours (which have five <em>twos</em> of uptime) is difficult. This exposes firms to risk and acts as a constant cost of capital.&nbsp;</p><p>Crypto trades 24/7. Crypto firms would like to settle crypto trades, particularly between stablecoins and the USD backing them, 24/7. Crypto‚Äôs solution to this was to all bank at the same bank, Silvergate, which I <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1193626583774351361">described</a> (with some surprise, when they <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1312109/000119312518329074/d568616ds1.htm">IPOed</a>) as the First National Bank of Crypto.</p><p>Silvergate had a particular product called the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN). SEN was both a) boring infrastructural plumbing and b) extremely important to the crypto industry. Oh boy, do crypto companies miss SEN. In sum, SEN would allow substantially 24/7 book transfers between Silvergate customers to shift USD balances between their bank accounts. This would let them constantly settle the USD leg of crypto trades between each other.</p><p>This was particularly important for stablecoin issuers, like Circle, which issues USDC. Circle‚Äôs main custodial bank for USDC was SVB. Circle wanted to be able to issue marketmakers like DRW and Alameda Research hundreds of millions of USDC 24/7 at any hour on any day with no more than a few minutes of latency, or redeem USDC for greenbacks in a similar fashion.</p><p>Now, a thing you will frequently see in fintech banking, and which is not itself at all inappropriate, is a fintech having multiple banks with a division of labor. One of those banks might agree to have a fintech‚Äôs customer-facing high-velocity low-EOD-balance <em>transactional</em> activity. And one of those banks might agree to have a fintech‚Äôs low-velocity high-EOD-balance <em>deposits</em>. These are very different business propositions for the banks! They imply different risks, different core competencies, and different revenue opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are running businesses which both a) have high daily inflows and outflows and also b) want to keep billions of dollars in the regulated banking perimeter, you very much need partners comfortable with both halves.</p><p>The argument you make, as a fintech, to the bank with your deposit business is that <em>the other bank </em>is also a competent, U.S.-regulated financial institution, with good AML and KYC controls (among others). <em>Therefore,</em> when your business makes <em>one</em> wire at the end of the day to settle up with its omnibus account at that bank, netting over several hundred thousand customer transactions, perhaps for <em>several hundred million dollars</em>, your bank <em>should be comfortable, </em>even if it has very little exact knowledge about what happened today<em>.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>Probably the same story as yesterday, and tomorrow, and Compliance can sleep the sleep of the righteous, because <em>their trusted peers</em> have an appropriate degree of controls in place. The bank custodying the money mountain is thus <em>certainly</em> not aiding and abetting money laundering. It can rely on the second bank‚Äôs own surveillance and controls, in addition to the crypto firm‚Äôs compliance department. There will be many formal contractual promises and informal verbal or written assurances made about this. And <em>this works </em>and <em>serious people can accept it</em> but the <strong>factual probity of the high-velocity transactional bank is extremely load-bearing</strong>.</p><p>Silvergate was not a competently run institution.</p><p>SEN <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/enf20240701a1.pdf">did not</a>, in fact, have a robust controls environment. It, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2024/comp-pr2024-82.pdf">in fact</a> (para 70), had functionally no transaction monitoring. Silvergate had bought a standard package that a lot of banks use for automated monitoring, but due a configuration issue, it <em>was off</em> for SEN transactions.</p><p>Carter <a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/inside-biden-admin-plot-to-destroy-silvergate-and-debank-crypto-for-good-nic-carter">describes</a> this state of affairs as follows: ‚ÄúSilvergate‚Äôs transaction monitoring system for SEN had gone through an upgrade and experienced an outage.‚Äù</p><p>Silvergate was institutionally aware of the ‚Äúoutage‚Äù but unable to remediate it.</p><p>I have an engineering degree, have founded five software companies, have worked in the tech industry, and in my entire career, I have never described an engineering investment I failed to make for <strong>fifteen months</strong> as an ‚Äúoutage.‚Äù After a day it is an outage, after a week it‚Äôs a human competence issue, but after a year it ferments into sparkling tech strategy.</p><p>During that period, SEN transacted over <em>a trillion dollars</em>. Silvergate was not unaware that SEN had an up-and-to-the-right usage graph (congratulations!). They were just <strong>routinely ignorant of funds flows they were facilitating with their banking license, sized in the billions of dollars per day</strong>. We know this because of Silvergate‚Äôs contemporaneous internal communications, the technical reality of the artifacts they had purchased and implemented, and sworn statements in litigation and to regulators. It is beyond intellectually serious dispute.</p><p>What of it, though? Is that just a harmless paperwork glitch? I'm glad you asked.</p><p>Intrabank book transfers are historically low-risk for money laundering because they‚Äôre ineffective at accomplishing <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/money-laundering-and-aml-compliance/">layering</a>: the same Compliance department can see both legs. Moreover, the majority of them are between entities known to be under common control. The purpose of layering is to break the chain of surveillance; swapping between your left pocket and your right pocket in front of a Compliance officer doesn‚Äôt accomplish this. This assumption of low-risk was apparently, per Silvergate‚Äôs employees, baked <em>very hard</em> into ATMS-B, the new-and-improved monitoring suite Silvergate had implemented.</p><p>However, SEN transactions, while implemented as intrabank book transfers, are <em>in fact</em> high-risk. The designed intent of SEN is to allow counterparties <em>not</em> under common control to settle <em>one half of</em> a transaction, at very high velocity. The other half generally occurs on a blockchain, unsurveilled by the bank. If you can‚Äôt see <em>that</em> half, and you can‚Äôt see <em>your</em> half, why, that sounds like you are swapping bank deposits for cash equivalents sized in the billions of dollars per day with no functional AML monitoring program in place.</p><p>This is not just me saying it. Kathleen Fischer, Chief Risk Office of Silvergate, said internally, of the lack of SEN monitoring: ‚ÄúWe have known of this issue and either we have established other controls to account for it or we haven‚Äôt, and we have to take our lumps.‚Äù</p><p>Silvergate had not, in fact, established other controls.</p><p>Carter claims that all clients of the bank had gone through rigorous KYC and onboarding processes. Silvergate may have consistently conducted KYC and onboarding processes, but one could forgive a skeptic for believing them to be pro forma.</p><p>Silvergate <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060.21.0_1.pdf">onboarded</a> several entities relating to Binance, a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/binance-and-ceo-plead-guilty-federal-charges-4b-resolution">confessed criminal conspiracy which extensively engaged in money laundering</a>. Binance and its management are <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/bond-villain-compliance-strategy/">Bond villains</a>; they gleefully flouted the law and engaged in jurisdictional gamesmanship to avoid financial regulation, for years. Binance et al transacted <em>$22 billion</em> through Silvergate.</p><p>Mandatory compliance training is such a drag, and sometimes we like to spice it up with fun games. Let's play Spot the Red Flags together.</p><p>We have just received an account application from a Seychelles-docimiled corporation beneficially owned by a globally notorious billionaire. He disclaims any permanent address. The beneficial owner receives regular negative news coverage. He and his company have received multiple orders to cease business from peer nations. Those orders cite offering financial services without a license, suspicion of money laundering, willfully non-compliant posture, and extensive documented lies to regulators. The corporation has no operations or employees; it is strictly a shell. The planned funds flow is receiving inbound wire transfers, including international wire transfers, from counterparties which the bank will have only fragmentary third degree knowledge of. The corporation intends to <em>immediately</em> transfer those deposits to a third-party financial institution. This is to facilitate those counterparties‚Äô purchase of pseudonymous bearer instruments, specifically, cash equivalents. The corporation anticipates billions of dollars of volume, in transaction sizes up to eight figures.</p><p>Silvergate happily <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060.21.0_1.pdf">opened an account</a> (pg 4) for Key Vision Development Limited, the above-described shell company, and allowed it to deposit and withdraw over <em>$11 billion</em>. Now, credit where credit is due, Silvergate <em>did</em> debank Key Vision Development Limited in 2021. The record doesn‚Äôt say why, but perceptive readers may be able to <em>hazard a guess</em>. But Binance‚Äôs main entities still enjoyed attentive service, or perhaps more to the point they enjoyed all the <em>inattention</em> they were getting with their service, until the bank folded.</p><p>But the main rake Silvergate stepped on, repeatedly, was its relationship with FTX/Alameda and its executives. They were collectively the bank‚Äôs largest client and comprised tens of percent of its deposits. Silvergate‚Äôs monitoring of their usage was <em>minimally</em> grossly inadequate, as the bank and its executives admit.</p><p>Carter quotes an unnamed Silvergate executive as saying the following, which is roughly consistent with their prior statements to the media and to regulators.</p><p><em>Where we were not as buttoned up as we should have been was in regards to the FTX/Alameda clients. That was a function of the bank growing incredibly quickly[.] ‚Ä¶ Probably we could have figured out FTX was brokering deposits via Alameda. In retrospect I think we could have pieced this together and figured it out. But this is not a legal failure and we‚Äôre not required to catch everything. Our program passed legal muster. That‚Äôs something we could have done a better job of. But there was no intentional wrongdoing or cooperation with the bad guys.</em></p><p>This is <em>consistent</em> with things they have said previously, but does not demand unlimited deference.</p><p>Ryan Salame, a subject matter expert in laundering crypto money through the banking system (skills described by <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590939/gov.uscourts.nysd.590939.433.0_1.pdf">his lawyers</a>, see pg 7 and onwards), <a href="https://x.com/rsalame7926/status/1812711148128796817">tweeted</a> that it beggars belief that Silvergate did not know that Alameda Research and North Dimension were in fact receiving FTX customer funds flow. Salame has repeatedly stated that Silvergate intentionally orchestrated that funds flow in concert with him. <em>Even if it had not</em>, Salame is just <em>right</em>: even if FTX concocted the scheme internally and even if Salame somehow managed to push all the buttons himself, Silvergate <em>had to know</em>.</p><p>But suppose you credit neither Salame nor I with understanding how banks work, or you demand unquestioning deference to executives‚Äô denials, perhaps because one believes that a bank executive <em>would never ever lie</em>. The picture <em>most favorable</em> to Silvergate is that, during multiple years of being monomaniacally focused on growth to the neglect of its responsibilities under the law, it routinely underperformed the competence bar required of regulated financial institutions in the United States.</p><p>Silvergate voluntarily liquidated in the wake of the FTX implosion. Limited props for them here: they managed to do this in a mostly orderly fashion, as opposed to Signature, which had substantially less crypto exposure but blew up. (Signature had an analogous book transfer API product, called Signet. It is a smaller part of their story.)</p><p>Carter has a number of complaints with regards to supervisory activities relating to Silvergate Bank. One of those is that he <a href="https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1836858979026358388">alleges</a> the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency disallowed Silvergate from selling SEN. I find this allegation <em>very plausible</em>, if not specifically <em>evidenced</em>. Silvergate was operating a trillion dollar laundering machine which had drawn immediate demands for corrective action for an extended period, had not taken aggressive corrective action, and then <em>had proximately caused enormous consumer harm </em>in a way which was <em>maximally embarrassing to many policy actors</em>. When the bank‚Äôs Chief Risk Officer predicted incoming lumps, <em>these were the sort of lumps she was predicting</em>.</p><p>Carter further alleges, and I think this is substantially original reporting (and good on him for it), that the FDIC and other banking regulators gave verbal guidance that banks should get crypto deposits below 15% to be ‚Äúsafe and sound.‚Äù If a banking regulator invokes those words, <em>they are not making a suggestion</em>. Carter complains that there is no statutory authority to pick this arbitrary number, that this threshold makes banking crypto functionally impossible, and that it is specifically chosen to kill targeted banks.</p><p>Some regulators are disclosure regulators. The SEC comes to mind. Some regulators are prudential regulators. The ordinary operation of prudential regulators is to take broad statutory direction and transform it, sometimes via the rulemaking process and sometimes via more informal guidance (and, even the FDIC will tell you, ‚Äúmoral suasion‚Äù). This process yields both concrete asks and fuzzier spectral ranges subject to ongoing negotiation between regulators and the regulated.</p><p>Does the FDIC have statutory authority to pick magic numbers?

Not obviously so! Look at the above description of Operation Choke Point and their theory of regulatory authority there. It requires <em>magical thinking</em> to connect banking a payday lender, reputational risk, a run on your bank, and endangering the deposit insurance fund. It very much does not require magical thinking to think that crypto deposits are flighty, correlated, and could cause a run! <strong>We were experiencing <em>actual</em> crypto-induced runs!&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A reasonable argument can be made that the problem with regulators was not abuse of discretion. It was needing to pay for past regulatory mistakes and/or missed opportunities with overcorrection following substantial consumer harm.

Empirically not; other bank‚Äôs crypto practices are well beneath that threshold, which <em>likely informed how it was chosen</em>. Metropolitan, for example, had about <a href="https://www.bankingdive.com/news/metropolitan-commercial-bank-backs-out-of-crypto-voyager-digital-partner/639956/">25% at the peak and then drew down to 6%</a>. It fairly persuasively told stakeholders that it had done a good job of risk management. And, not incidentally, Metropolitan <em>is still with us</em>. And so regulators could very reasonably say: ‚ÄúOK! 6% is all-else-equal green, 14% is yellow, we don‚Äôt want you spiking to 25% anymore, 96% is deep #%*(#(ing don‚Äôt even think about it red.‚Äù</p><p>And you could make this same observation about many banks with a crypto practice.

Silvergate, subsequent to that letter, <em>did repay</em> those advances, and said in a <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001312109/14a9b861-b10a-458d-8f9d-44f0d18bc75e.pdf">securities filing</a> that this required them to accelerate securities sales, leading to rumors in the industry that this forced their hand on deciding to close. FHLBSF has <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/15/silvergate-was-not-cut-off-from-fhlb-loans-bank-says">squarely denied</a> pressuring them to accelerate repayment.</p><p>Short sellers made a killing on Silvergate, certainly. I absolutely believe that short sellers<em> communicated with</em> Senator Warren and regulators and additionally would credit that <em>they did this strategically</em> to bring pressure to bear against the bank. Evidence in favor: they say they did and bragged about it, while nailing Silvergate's hide to the wall.</p><p>But the reason short sellers made billions shorting Silvergate is primarily <strong>because they were right and early about Silvergate</strong>.</p><p>Marc Cohodes (a noted short who was deeply short Silvergate) and Ram Ahluwalia (a crypto investor with a very good understanding of bank regulation) had a <a href="https://unchainedcrypto.com/how-will-the-ftx-collapse-affect-silvergate-a-bear-and-a-bull-debate-ep-431-2/">debate about Silvergate</a> prior to its collapse. I will not recount it for you on a line-by-line basis, but on listening to it at release, I felt ‚ÄúCohodes is winning this by a mile, despite Ahluwalia being better calibrated on whether banking a single money launderer would indict a compliance program in the eyes of a regulator.‚Äù (I was at the time effectively constrained from trading in bank stocks, but I took professionally significant action after listening to that podcast.)</p><p>I think one could make some criticisms of Cohodes, or of short sellers generally, but ‚ÄúThey were fundamentally wrong more wrong than right about the short thesis, and needed government intervention to make it pay out‚Äù requires ignoring <em>mountains</em> of evidence. You are invited to look back, with <em>full oracular</em> <em>hindsight</em>, on what Cohodes said in that presentation.</p><p>A heuristic I have long used, as a once-upon-a-time debater: if one side is impressively detail oriented, and randomly selected details are trivially sustained, and the other side doesn‚Äôt allege details but pounds the table a lot, <em>bet on the first team</em>.</p><p>Or, if you want, you can bet on their former executives. Their former CTO (after being Chief Operations Officer), who is also the CEO‚Äôs son, has a Twitter account. You can <a href="https://twitter.com/D_CentralBanker/status/1865091418810626064">find his side of the story</a> on it. For a bank executive he is <em>remarkably cavalier </em>with characterizing the contents of communications from his regulators.</p><p>For example, he writes ‚ÄúThe Sunday after Thanksgiving in 2022, regulators went after 5 banks simultaneously[.] Up to that point the regulators were not objecting, Silvergate brought them along, and suddenly everything changed[.]‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, in April 2022, Silvergate had received a Matters Requiring Immediate Attention (MRIA) from the Federal Reserve specifically concerning the adequacy of its BSA/AML monitoring program. They received a similar MRIA in November, but by that time, they were cooked. See <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2024/comp26044.pdf">SEC</a> complaint, para 80, substantially confirming representations made in a deposition by ‚ÄúFormer Employee 5‚Äù (a Compliance official) in <a href="https://static.blbglaw.com/docs/May%2011%2C%202023%20-%20Amended%20Consolidated%20Class%20Action%20Complaint.pdf">this lawsuit</a>, which explicitly allege MRIAs. A MRIA, as distinct from a Matters Requiring Attention (MRA; a formalized supervisory directive which they expect you to pay substantial attention to in the ordinary course of business), is a drop-everything-and-fix-immediately command.</p><p>The Federal Reserve has <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/sr1313a1.pdf">required language</a> (pg 3) for when it communicates MRIAs. The Federal Reserve supervises many banks, at all levels of scale and sophistication. This includes small town community banks where board members are typically local real estate developers. To ensure that low-sophistication bank executives or board members do not miss the fact that an MRIA <em>is both an order and a </em><a href="https://www.historyextra.com/period/georgian/why-do-we-say-shot-across-the-bows/"><em>shot across the bows</em></a><em> and should be understood as such, </em>that language is: ‚ÄúThe board of directors (or executive-level committee of the board) is <strong>required to immediately</strong>‚Ä¶‚Äù (bolded in original)</p><p>The SEC has since <a href="https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-26044">charged</a> Silvergate executives with misrepresenting the truth to investors about the depth of their liquidity problems in the immediate wake of the FTX collapse.</p><p>Suppose one believes, arguendo, the protestations of Silvergate management that it had seen the implosion of their largest customer, and a ~70% outflow of deposits, and was still ready to keep chugging along.</p><p>In that world, is the regulator saying (approximately) ‚ÄúWe support banking legal industries, given an adequate controls environment. However, you must get your crypto deposit concentration to below 15%?‚Äù compatible with the continued existence of<em> Silvergate specifically, after early November 2022</em>?</p><p>I agree here with Carter and crypto advocates: no meaningful concentration limit on crypto is compatible with the continued existence of Silvergate after early November 2022. Even a 50% concentration limit is impossible; 15% is worse.</p><p>Simple math: for each dollar of deposits that you don‚Äôt bleed off, and you really can‚Äôt bleed off many post-run, you need to find someone willing to deposit about $5. Even if your sales pitch made angels weep to hear it, that is an impossibly tall order. Silvergate had no path to swiftly raising many billions of dollars of deposits from non-crypto depositors.</p><p>Silvergate had attracted its existing deposits via what would most charitably be described as intense attention to the needs of the crypto industry. It had no advantage over any bank in the U.S. vis banking any other individual or industry, and it had many disadvantages. It was under a PR cloud, because facts about its behavior over the last few years were being reported. It was obviously wobbling as an enterprise.</p><p>Most deposits are attracted by offering routine bank services (the sort that Silvergate had no edge on providing to non-crypto clients). This is referred to in industry as the ‚Äú<a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/deposit-franchises-as-natural-hedges/">deposit franchise</a>.‚Äù Banks have an immediate option to raise deposits in a hurry, forgoing years of sponsoring Little League teams, showing up for the annual town festival, and asking about your holiday plans over a coffee. You can skip the sweat-and-smiles business and proceed directly to <em>paying through the nose</em>, by attracting the custom of sophisticated financial professionals who place money at the banks bidding highest for it in the country. This is called deposit brokering.</p><p>At any price Silvergate was capable of paying for deposits, there was a regional bank that would have matched or exceeded it, because (unlike Silvergate) many regional banks have a material first-party loan book (and ongoing origination apparatus) which they reasonably believed would continue to exist, and deposits are a funding source for that loan book (and apparatus). </p><p>A deposit broker would reasonably model that hypothetical replacement bank as being a higher priority for receiving extraordinary backstopping if that ended up being necessary. This would play into their credit analysis of that replacement bank if the deposit broker was trying to place, for example, a $200 million certificate of deposit, almost all of which is uninsured (subject to bank credit risk) absent extraordinary government backstop.</p><p>Crypto advocates are notably incurious about non-crypto banking and <em>don‚Äôt seem to understand</em> why non-crypto regional banks were being heavily shorted in late 2022 and early 2023. I believe that, for many crypto advocates, including some who are well-educated financial service professionals, including some whose portfolio include many financial services companies, this is <em>not</em> very cynically ignoring background unfavorable to their narrative. Rather, it is because they <em>genuinely do not understand </em>what a sudden hike in interest rates would do to the balance sheet of a bank, in the same way that <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1215559661773967361">many software engineers do not understand what a sudden interest rate hike will do</a> to the value of their equity. I would credit the possibility that <em>some</em> crypto advocates <em>do</em> understand how bank balance sheets are affected by interest rates, and are choosing to not contradict their standard bearers in public.</p><p>I am unconvinced that the concentration limit was the but-for cause of Silvergate‚Äôs demise, though I <em>could be</em> persuaded to that view.</p><p>My default view is that if every government employee had been furloughed on Thanksgiving Silvergate would likely still have closed. Its regulators had utterly lost confidence in it, true, but <em>its customers</em> had also lost confidence in it, in no small part because a) they knew they had wired money to Silvergate and b) they knew they now didn‚Äôt have their money. That‚Äôs a bad set of facts for a long, happy banking relationship.</p><p>I also think, and won‚Äôt ask advocates to acknowledge this, that a post-investigation Silvergate which managed to exist would be unable to offer the product that people were really buying. It was the Schelling point for everybody in crypto. That is <em>why SEN worked</em>. In no conceivable universe does Silvergate keep Binance as a client after it gets put under the microscope. A crypto Schelling point which Binance can‚Äôt touch is not a crypto Schelling point. Absent that Schelling point, if Silvergate was simply a bank that would let you park a $3 million seed round and cut paychecks while you worked on your <a href="https://soliditylang.org/">solidity</a>‚Ä¶ that Silvergate is <em>not a business</em>. And it‚Äôs a bad time to not be a business while you‚Äôre sitting on a portfolio of MBS in late 2022 and early 2023.</p><p>But suppose arguendo that the government intentionally precipitated conditions incompatible with Silvergate continuing to remain in business <strong>and also</strong> that this was the but-for cause of Silvergate‚Äôs demise.</p><p>Is that a norms violation? <em>Do we allow the government to close banks?</em></p><p>If you‚Äôve worked in the financial industry in any capacity, you went to mandatory Compliance training. Attendance is taken and you likely had a refresher annually. And there were smirks, and jokes. And your trainer said, very seriously, ‚ÄúPay attention. This is important. If we eff this up, they can do <em>anything</em> to us, most likely large fines but up to and including closing this firm. You, personally, could go to jail.‚Äù</p><p>Most people in finance heed this lesson. Every year, some don‚Äôt, and they learn why this training is mandatory.</p><p><em>Should</em> we allow government to close banks? Yes.</p><p>Reasonable people can disagree as to the thresholds that extraordinary remedy should require and the procedural form it should take.</p><p>If we were still on debate team, you might ask me for a concession ‚ÄúGovernment needs to specifically admit that Silvergate was intentionally closed‚Äù and I‚Äôd counter ‚ÄúSure, will trade you: opposition needs to concede that Silvergate was <em>actively aware including at the executive level</em> that Alameda and North Dimension were intentionally receiving incoming FTX customer funds flows.‚Äù About fifteen minutes later, I think neither side is thrilled, both sides learned something they find edifying, and there probably exists mutual agreement that either <em>Silvergate had to go. </em>or in the alternative <em>Absent extraordinary government support, Silvergate was doomed after the FTX fiasco.</em>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Complaints that Signature Bank did not need to be placed in receivership&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Carter believes Signature was targeted in an analogous fashion. In part this is in reliance on their board member Barney Frank, who maintained (in media interviews contemporaneous with the collapse, and after it) that Signature was solvent and had sufficient liquidity at the end of a week which had seen a bank run.</p><p>Perhaps some have forgotten the context of that week. On March 8, Wednesday, Silvergate announced it was closing. On March 10th, Friday, SVB was placed into receivership, after the most explosive bank run in history. On March 10th, <em>still that same Friday</em>, Signature experienced a run of $18.6 billion of deposits <em>in the space of hours</em>.</p><p>That context refreshed, let‚Äôs review where Signature believed its business was on March 11th and 12th, over that weekend.</p><p>Signature experienced <a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2023/04/nydfs_internal_review_rpt_signature_bank_20230428.pdf">difficulties telling a plausible story involving numbers which added up </a>&nbsp;(pg 35) that weekend. Quoting that postmortem:</p><p><em>Signature needed to provide reliable and realistic data, particularly concerning immediately available liquidity and ongoing deposit withdrawals, to inform the analysis the Regulators and Signature needed to perform to understand the Bank‚Äôs liquidity position. Once Signature began providing any data on these key issues, the Regulators found the data was inconsistent and that it continuously changed in material ways.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>Signature execs, et al, were on a series of conference calls with regulators for an entire weekend. They began with regulators taking note of the bank run and candidly announcing the bank was in mortal peril. Signature proceeded, in the regulators‚Äô view, to<em> confabulate</em> about liquidity sources, composition and quality of assets, and current withdrawal requests pending, through either malfeasance or spectacularly poorly timed technical incompetence. Regulators felt that, at this pivotal moment, Signature was dangerously disconnected with reality, like an executive describing the weekend as (this <em>is a quote</em>) ‚Äúuneventful thus far.‚Äù</p><p>It is a serious accusation to say Signature was confabulating. Banking regulators are (mostly) serious people.</p><p>Quoting the postmortem again:</p><p><em>For example, through Sunday afternoon, Signature represented to the Regulators that nearly $6 billion in liquidity from its commercial real estate portfolio would ‚ÄúVery Likely‚Äù be available to the Bank on Monday. The Regulators were aware, however, that it would take weeks for the FRBNY to review and value that portfolio.</em></p><p>Was <em>Signature</em> aware that its commercial real estate portfolio could not possibly be good collateral on Monday? Manifestly so.</p><p>A brief explanation for the benefit of readers unfamiliar with commercial real estate (CRE) banking:</p><p>Signature‚Äôs plan was to pledge portions of its CRE loan portfolio to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York the Monday after the critical weekend. It thought that the Fed would credit them for the value of the portfolio less some haircut. Signature would then immediately wire what the Fed credited them to the customers demanding their deposits. Simple as.</p><p>However, CRE loans are not fungible, easy-to-analyze assets like e.g. Treasury bills or even mortgage-backed securities. They‚Äôre complex, bespoke legal agreements, <em>in the best of times</em>. 2023 was not the best of times for the New York commercial real estate market, as anyone who <a href="https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/the-clearest-sign-yet-that-commercial-real-estate-is-in-trouble-cb8dfafa">reads the newspaper</a> is aware, and so you can‚Äôt simply value those loans by copying outstanding balances into Excel then chugging a tiny bit of math. You‚Äôve got to <em>read the darn things</em>, construct a model (which, if you were someone with skin in the game, would asymptotically approach re-underwriting those loans because New York CRE <em>is that bad</em>), come up with your impaired valuation, and then, haircut <em>that</em>.</p><p>Signature Bank had a crypto sideline but its beating heart was the New York CRE market. This is a bank that <em>breathed</em> New York real estate. It beggars belief that they thought that portfolio would be Very Likely to be good collateral in merely wall-clock <em>hours of work</em>.</p><p>You know what this reminds me of? This reminds me of one Sam Bankman-Fried who, on finding himself in what he believed to be a survivable liquidity crisis, began wildly writing indicative numbers down on napkins and/or Google Sheets. SBF still doesn‚Äôt understand why nobody believed him. Just <em>look at the napkins</em>!</p><p>We are not required to <em>believe</em> your napkins, Signature, if they contain obvious untruths, or if the napkins evolve wildly in inconsistent ways over the course of a single meeting.</p><p>The most critical question for Signature‚Äôs liquidity position was ‚ÄúHow much money will customers wire out on Monday?‚Äù This is straightforward banking, which regulators pressed them to do all weekend: a) sum up how much money customers have asked for on Monday, in the hundreds of <em>current</em> pending wire requests b) project a <em>worst case scenario</em> for how that number will evolve, as more customers put in wire requests, before Monday morning.</p><p>Here is the time series (taken from above report, pg 40) of those two questions being asked repeatedly in a 48 hour window. Observe how often,<em> a few hours</em> after Signature has made a (new, even-more-worst-than-previous) worst case scenario, the <em>known</em> wire requests have <em>already</em> <em>exceeded</em> that worst case scenario.&nbsp;</p><p>Signature then communicated a new worst case scenario, which felicitously was only as far away from known wire requests as their previous worst case scenario had been, almost as if they were learning nothing from repeatedly being wrong.</p><p>This played out <em>multiple times</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdTdoLsRO2UWjrlTNI-ud8kjHXEWOF6GjLng_G5xWdOuyxhlh3CrlfzXHBssOeHBaIbLouamPpxIYWtejWJURePJ6ei1-YLqbI55MtKCB-aN9TMJA_jCFO_pGxQvVoYzVbZtYbZ?key=m_5iVFuPFfjZmBNHQWxeSWkk" alt="" loading="lazy" width="624" height="521"></figure><p>Signature believes it understood where it was that weekend. The above picture is almost proof positive that it did not. They also understood their experience of the weekend to be signaling how <em>the worst was over</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Quoting postmortem again (pg 6):</p><p><em>Over the weekend, Signature‚Äôs estimates of pending deposit withdrawals increased, going from $2 billion on Saturday evening to $4 billion Sunday morning, and then to $7.4 billion to $7.9 billion by Sunday evening. These numbers represented known deposit withdrawals. <strong>Despite the run on Friday, March 10 and the negative news over the weekend, Signature insisted that additional withdrawals would be minimal on Monday</strong>. The Regulators assessed this projection as unrealistic and that the Bank needed to be prepared to handle another significant deposit run. </em>(emphasis added)</p><p>Signature believes it could have white knuckled through the hurricane and emerged victorious on Monday. Then it had projections by which it would suddenly, indeed<em> miraculously</em>, have sufficient liquidity on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. And then <em>the hard work</em> would start. It would bank the heck out of its remaining customers, start finding buyers for its valuable assets over the ensuing months, and <em>somehow pull this off</em>. Because it was solvent!</p><p>Signature had critical liquidity issues, no real path to solving them, and lost the confidence of its regulators, during a bank run which was worsening by the hour. That is a recipe for receivership. No conspiracy is necessary to explain what happened.</p><p>The rest of the postmortem is worth reading, too, and deeply wonky in the way that excites banking nerds. Where else can you read a scintillating discussion on what capital call loans are acceptable collateral at the Fed emergency window?</p><p><strong>Crypto likes novel crypto-using banking products</strong></p><p>In 2022, the FDIC sent out a <a href="https://downloads.ctfassets.net/c5bd0wqjc7v0/6y0GZ2y2LzOZi1gUnCTtxh/55bf6ae9665ca12b9fe7bdfb3ebe746b/-26-1-_Exhibit_A_-_Redacted_Pause_Letters.pdf">wave of letters</a> to banks. Prying these letters from the FDIC has been a bit of a project, requiring Coinbase and other interested parties to do quite a bit of arm wrestling. The letters which have been released, grudgingly, are heavily redacted.</p><p>A brief commentary on transparency: democratic governance simultaneously requires substantial transparency <em>and also</em> requires the government to be able to have private conversations.</p><p>Curtains of secrecy <em>are</em> frequently invoked cynically to cover abuses. For example, you could say ‚ÄúThat protest is a foreign influence operation! I cannot disclose my basis for thinking that, for reasons of national security! You should therefore act as my proxy to suppress this protest!‚Äù&nbsp;(Uh, spoiler alert, we will return to this later.)</p><p>In the culture that is banking supervision, however, privilege will frequently be asserted fairly maximally on routine supervisory communications with banks. This is because they are institutionally wary of causing risk to banks by signaling to the market or depositors that those banks have lost the confidence of regulators. Banking regulators are terrified of ‚Äúself-fulfilling prophecies.‚Äù</p><p>You need to be able to have candid conversations with regulated entities for the same reason coworkers need to be able to have candid conversations with each other. Privacy enhances candor, even when those conversations implicate third parties, even when third parties would really love to be a fly on the wall.</p><p>And so I think there is a legitimate balancing act to be done here. But I‚Äôm <em>sympathetic</em> to crypto advocates who say (paraphrase) ‚ÄúThis is backroom maneuvering to do something we don‚Äôt like. You won‚Äôt even admit the thing you are doing! And, confound you, after you are dragged kicking and screaming to admitting the thing, you‚Äôll probably claim it is good! <em>Like they did after Operation Choke Point!</em>‚Äù</p><p>Conversely, when the government is capable of publishing extensively researched position papers and extensively footnoted indictments, that should give you more confidence that it is less likely to be engaged in lawless, arbitrary behavior. Not <em>limitless</em> confidence, certainly, but it is evidence in a direction.</p><p>Carter <a href="https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1863719625852063974">surmises</a> that the expurgated supervisory letters are regarding <a href="https://www.nydig.com/">NYDIG‚Äô</a>s proposed product which would <a href="https://bankingjournal.aba.com/2022/01/why-aba-invested-in-nydig-supporting-banks-as-they-help-customers-access-cryptocurrency/">allow banks and credit unions to offer customers direct Bitcoin exposure</a>. You can analogize this to the feature in Cash App which allows you to buy Bitcoin, without being able to transfer it, except it would happen in your banking app.</p><p>I think Carter is very likely (90%+) correct with respect to identifying the subject of these letters. Much of the pack is dated shortly before the FDIC did, indeed, publish <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/news/financial-institution-letters/2022/fil22016.html">public guidance</a> about banks directly offering crypto products. NYDIG was the firm with the most progress against the opportunity (source: general industry knowledge) that otherwise fits with what we can read of the letters.</p><p>So: is this a stunning inversion of our democratic norms? No. Banking regulators get to weigh in on proposed banking products. That is <em>the absolute core of the job</em>.<em> </em>That will extremely routinely result in saying something which rounds, like many of the letters do, to ‚ÄúWe are going to have a considered think about this and get back to you, but in the meanwhile, please don‚Äôt roll this out widely.‚Äù (The think was had; the results <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/news/financial-institution-letters/2023/fil23001.html">were published</a>. Many crypto advocates do not <em>like</em> those results, and are asserting procedural irregularities because of that.)</p><p>Does this meaningfully prohibit the crypto industry from offering retail users financial services? No. You can buy Bitcoin exposure in Cash App, Venmo, Robinhood, Coinbase, Fidelity, Interactive Brokers, any brokerage account capable of trading U.S. ETFs, and <em>many more places besides</em>. Crypto advocates cheerfully blast out press releases about how many ways are coming online every week to buy their tokens from them at very reasonable prices prior to lunar travel .</p><p>Is there a facially plausible reason for attempting to institute a consistent policy among regulated banks, in a way there <em>was not </em>for Operation Choke Point? Again, a core concern for the FDIC is that unsophisticated customers don‚Äôt assume that their risk assets get FDIC insurance. Customers naturally assume their bank app gives them FDIC protected things. For those bank apps which include non-FDIC insured products, like insurance offerings or e.g. affiliated brokerage accounts, the disclosures are bespoke and extensive.</p><p>Some crypto advocates would prefer to have screen real estate in community banking apps. I bet FanDuel would, too. But them being disappointed is not the claimed threat to democracy.</p><p><strong>Some politicians exercised extraprocedural influence</strong></p><p>Some readers might remember Libra, Facebook‚Äôs attempt at creating a (substantially) worldwide economic network with a token which was variously described as a USD stablecoin or perhaps some sort of currency basket. Libra was a consortium project, with Facebook as the de facto anchor and a number of industry partners. (Stripe, my former employer, was a consortium member at one time. I reiterate the above disclaimer that they do not necessarily endorse things I say in my personal spaces.)&nbsp;</p><p>Libra did not live to see the light of day. Some time later the project was abandoned by Facebook and the technology <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/31/silvergate-bank-confirms-diem-tech-acquisition">was sold</a>. It sold to Silvergate, back when Silvergate felt like despite the stupendous growth in the core business, sure, it had managerial attention to devote to M&amp;A, what else would bank management possibly find to fill its time?</p><p>David Marcus, who lead Libra, recently <a href="https://twitter.com/davidmarcus/status/1862654506774810641">wrote</a> that Libra was killed by extraprocedural influence aimed at consortium members. He specifically identified Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yallen as directing the Chair of the Federal Reserve Jay Powell to kill the project. He then alleges that, quote:</p><p><em>Shortly thereafter, the Fed organized calls with all the participating banks, and the Fed‚Äôs general counsel read a prepared statement to each of them, saying: ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt stop you from moving forward and launching, but we are not comfortable with you doing so.‚Äù And just like that, it was over.</em></p><p>I have never worked at a bank and so never been a fly on the wall with a conversation with the Fed‚Äôs general counsel. I can, however, read. I have read many letters in my life written by serious people in positions of authority. And I once happened to read one which threatened the recipients in a clumsy, unambiguous way.</p><p>That letter was sent to all members of the Libra consortium. The letter is mostly about Facebook, rather than Libra. A representative sample:</p><p><em>Facebook is currently struggling to tackle massive issues, such as privacy violations, disinformation, election interference, discrimination, and fraud, and it has not demonstrated an ability to bring those failures under control. You should be concerned that any weaknesses in Facebook‚Äôs risk management systems will become weaknesses in your systems that you may not be able to effectively mitigate.</em></p><p>This was written after the Cambridge Analytica affair, when the security state and New York media mutually convinced each other that it is possible to steal a U.S. presidential national election with a copy of the social graph and an advertising budget of approximately $180,000. They seemed <em>quite sure</em> Russia had already shipped a working proof of concept. Of course, after 2020, we know that only enemies of democracy make specious and unevidenced accusations of fraud in U.S. elections. The rules change so quickly in Washington, it sometimes confounds my poor techie mind.</p><p>But this letter was <em>written in 2019</em> and democracy still hung in the balance like an embattled chad (apologies to younger readers: your central association with that word is not the <a href="https://www.polyas.com/election-glossary/hanging-chad">central association</a> of older millennials). And so the authors of that letter, Senators Schatz and Brown (who sits on the <a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/about/membership">Financial Services Committee</a>), observed that the recipients had an excellent business and it would be a shame if something happened to it. And <em>something would certainly happen to it </em>if they went forward with Libra.</p><p>I realize this sounds like paranoiac ramblings. Here‚Äôs the exact money quote:</p><p><em>If you take this on, you can expect a high level of scrutiny from regulators not only on Libra-related payment activities, but on all payment activities.</em></p><p>It would be grossly improper for me to use non-public information about what a <em>particular</em> payments company understood that to mean. But, in my capacity as your friendly neighborhood financial infrastructure commentator, I <em>predict</em> that a <em>typical</em> financial industry CEO, threatened in that fashion by two senators, would be <em>appropriately alarmed</em>.</p><p>Threatening the core business over Libra hits partners with reverse operating leverage, a concept which more people in startups and finance should be aware of. One reason for the Innovator‚Äôs Dilemma isn‚Äôt within the four corners of the innovation itself, and it isn‚Äôt simply that the incumbent firm has gotten fat and happy, and wants to enjoy its margins rather than cannibalize them. It is that the innovation may require taking a risk that, if it blows up, blows up not just the (tiny, at the margins) innovation but the (gigantic) existing business which incubated it.</p><p>Google invented transformers, and they are more interesting than anything Google has done since Search, but you use ChatGPT and Claude because no Google exec was willing to blow up Search or AdWords over the geeks‚Äô shiny new toy. It was the largest missed opportunity in the history of capitalism and they did it entirely to themselves, in (relatively tiny) part out of fear of what Washington would say. In the worst scenario of the government relations team, I doubt they conjured up ‚ÄúOh two U.S. senators will explicitly threaten us with being dismantled brick by brick before this even gets to alpha.‚Äù</p><p>It is sometimes said that the dictionary definition of chutzpah is murdering your parents and then begging clemency from the judge because you are an orphan.

And yeah, it happened. I have no strong view on whether the Fed calls also happened but, uh, that claim sort of rhymes with the letter, doesn‚Äôt it.</p><p>I will say one positive thing about the Senators writing the letter: they were sufficiently proud of their work that they posted a <a href="https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/brown-schatz-warn-payments-providers-of-risks-with-libra-association">contemporaneous press release</a> with the full text. Transparency is not dispositive proof of virtue. The extraprocedural threat is <em>right there in the text</em>. But a democracy should naturally prefer transparency, and for political decisions to be made by elected officials, over  secret decisions by people who will, even in the event of extraordinary malfeasance, still have a job, a pension, and power after the inquiry.</p><h3 id="the-cfpb">The CFPB</h3><p>Andreessen also claimed (to Rogan) that Senator Warren created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and that its purview is doing, quote, ‚ÄúWhatever [she] wants.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>‚Ä¶ Yeah, that‚Äôs pretty much my read, too.</p><p>I agree with some of their substantive positions and disagree with others, but it seems like a cadre of young, ambitious acolytes who understand their founder‚Äôs vision and are eager to implement it.

There is overwhelming evidence that this happened systemically at the formal direction of national political authorities‚Ä¶ in Canada.</p><p>Briefly, 2020 and 2021 saw substantial disruptive political protests. One of them, chiefly targeted at pandemic lockdowns, was conducted by truckers in Canada. It was unusually effective, in part because the so-called Freedom Convoy physically blocked roads in Ottowa, the capital, and at at least one border crossing to the U.S.</p><p>Blocking roads is a protesting tactic frequently employed by a variety of (mostly left-wing) activists. It is extremely annoying, arguably ineffective, and <em>sometimes</em> results in punishment. Punishment in a democracy customarily follows the ordinary operation of the judicial process. In the classical case, there is a formal particularized accusation, a trial, and a conviction, and only then, punishment.</p><p>Blocking roads sometimes suffers no real sanctions, because annoying and ineffective left-wing protesters still have expressive rights. Sometimes, prosecutors exercise their discretion to favor those rights over the freedom of movement and economic activity implicitly granted to other members of society.</p><p>So that was two scenarios for how things <em>normally</em> play out: punishment under the law, or, no punishment. Not this time, though.</p><p>Prime Minister Trudeau reacted to this protest as if it were a prompt national emergency and/or state-sponsored terrorism (a claim which was contemporaneously made about it, out of the side of officials‚Äô mouths). He <a href="https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/section58.html">invoked the Emergencies Act</a>, which would have the effect of awarding temporary, extraordinary executive power. The government then <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2022-22/page-1.html" rel="noreferrer">directed</a> the immediate freezing of the financial accounts anyone connected to the protests, at banks and non-bank financial platforms which Canada believed had been used to fund the protest. There were also some ancillary actions, like directing the truckers‚Äô insurance companies to suspend their driving insurance.</p><p>Officials in Canada claimed that they were selectively targeting the ring leaders or organizers of the protest narrowly, and were not attempting to consequence people for protected political speech. These claims were lies.</p><p>The orders were, in fact, not narrowly drafted.</p><p>The assistant deputy finance minister <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/video/1.6654994">admitted to an inquiry</a> that the government had contemporaneous knowledge that it named accountholders who were not present at the protests, and ignored this to prioritize speed of implementation. She further said, and <a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/bureaucrats-who-froze-bank-accounts-of-freedom-convoy-leaders-werent-trying-to-get-at-the-family">this is a quote</a>, ‚ÄúThe intent was not to get at the families‚Äù, and when a democratic government starts a sentence that way <em>something deeply #*&amp;$#ed up has happened</em>. Canada believes <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/emergency-bank-measures-finance-committee-1.6360769">more than 200 accounts were frozen</a>, and that is an interesting selectivity for ‚Äúringleaders‚Äù or ‚Äúorganizers‚Äù of a protest. (By my count, <em>Canada itself</em> has only a <a href="https://learn.parl.ca/understanding-comprendre/en/people-in-parliament">few hundred ringleaders</a>.)</p><p>This is almost certainly an undercount, and if one does not understand the mechanism, one is not competent to work in or regulate the financial industry.</p><p>Pop quiz to see you whether you were paying attention in Compliance training: Abel transfers Bob $25, ostensibly for charitable or political purposes. Bob is specifically identified to you by the government as a terrorist later that week, his charitable fundraising apparatus is specifically called out as a concern, and you are directed to move with the utmost urgency to interdict all financial activities of Bob in any form whatsoever. Abel is not mentioned to you by name. And thus the question: this a) should have no impact on your relationship with Abel, b) should have an immediate, profound impact on your relationship with Abel, or c) I don‚Äôt know.</p><p>The government‚Äôs answer whether individuals not named by the government specifically were impacted was (paraphrasing) ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know whether any donors were impacted. I certainly wouldn‚Äôt expect anyone to have understood our intent to be applying the text of the order to the sender of a $25 donation. I don‚Äôt know if anyone did.</p><p>I don‚Äôt know if shooting someone will injure them or not. One might miss. I <em>do</em> know that my estimate of them being severely injured that day moves substantially up relative to similarly situated individuals one did not shoot. That is, presumably, why one chose to shoot them.</p><p>The invocation of a national emergency was pretextural. In the parliamentary inquiry, the deputy minister of finance said that the protests were a, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/finance-emergencies-act-us-1.6654795">this is a quote</a>, ‚Äúfirst-tier issue‚Äù because they‚Ä¶ threatened U.S./Canadian negotiations on subsidies for electric vehicles.</p><p>And so when people say that targeted debanking can be used, even in a democracy, for arbitrary and capricious punishment of disfavored individuals on the political speech, laundered through the banking system, with no substantial procedural recourse, I agree with those people that that is a risk.</p><p>We<em> just watched </em>it happen.</p><h3 id="politically-motivated-debanking-of-individuals-by-firms">Politically-motivated debanking of individuals by firms</h3><p>Some people claim politically-motivated debanking is not merely a risk but is, in fact, the ordinary practice <em>of</em> the United States.</p><p>It is not.</p><p>Some people claim it is the ordinary practice <em>within</em> the United States to debank political conservatives, to cause them to be unable to purchase food, to interdict their child support payments (as happened in Canada).</p><p>This does not happen <em>as a matter of routine</em> in the United States. Some people passionately believe that unarmed black men are routinely murdered by police officers. That <em>is untrue</em>, no matter how passionately it is believed, no matter how central that narrative is to a political project, no matter whether one supports the broader aims of that political project. That <em>is not to say</em> that it has never happened.</p><p>Michael Jordan once had a great line, explaining his political neutrality: ‚ÄúRepublicans buy sneakers.‚Äù Imagine, for just one moment, what it would look like to live in a nation where Republicans <em>actually</em> <em>were</em> at constant and material risk of being debanked for their political views.</p><p>Republicans would, <em>notoriously</em>, only buy their sneakers in cash. Fundraising dinners would customarily have large burlap sacks next to the swanky tablecloths. You yourself, because you have at least one conservative friend, would have had an awkward conversation at some point where you suggested splitting a dinner with Venmo or tried to swap investing tips, and then realized this was a faux paus, because as everyone knows, conservatives are routinely denied access to the financial system.</p><p><strong><em>This </em>is not the world you live in. </strong>You would only need to trust your own eyes and common sense to comfortably exclude it<strong>.</strong></p><p>There exist occasional abuses by <em>individuals at private actors</em> which are politically motivated. There exist <em>some</em> private actors who have made policy decisions, sometimes accidentally and sometimes because they have corporate (or influential-subgroup-within-the-corporation) preferences, which structurally disadvantage certain relatively narrow segments of the political spectrum.</p><p>In a world where that <em>much more limited claim</em> is happening, one will be able to assemble some data points to <em>tell a story</em> about the much larger claim. It‚Äôs important to understand what the actual <em>true</em> story is, because we should want to invest our collective efforts in avoiding abuses, and that requires one to know <em>how they actually happen</em>.</p><h3 id="politically-exposed-persons">Politically exposed persons</h3><p>Andreessen said the following to Joe Rogan:</p><p>‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a great thing. Under current banking, regardless, regulations, after all the reforms of the last 20 years, there's now a category called a Politically Exposed Person (PEP). And if you were a PEP, you are required by financial regulators to kick them off, to kick them out of your bank. You're not allowed to have‚Ä¶‚Äù</p><p>Rogan interjected:</p><p>‚ÄúWhat if you're politically on the left?‚Äù</p><p>Andreessen answered:</p><p>‚ÄúWell, that's fine. No, because they're not politically exposed.‚Äù</p><p>I have some challenges in life. One of those is that sometimes I am unable to tell if someone is making a claim about the reality we live in, or if they‚Äôre bullshitting with a bro. This has, over the years, caused me much embarrassment. You obviously do not want to intrude on a bullshitting session and say ‚ÄúThat isn‚Äôt true!‚Äù, because truth is not the point of a bullshitting session. And you don‚Äôt want to say ‚ÄúAnd once a monkey flew out of my butt!‚Äù if someone is trying to describe reality. They will not laugh, and you will be sad.</p><p>So I recuse myself from the above conversation, that I have no usable bead on, and will take this opportunity to lecture the Internet about PEPs.</p><p>Politically Exposed Person (PEP) is a term of art in Compliance, arising from Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) reporting requirements. It means a national-level senior official, <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/sites/default/files/2024-03/pr20092a.pdf">most typically in U.S. usage</a>, one attached to <em>a foreign government</em>. Quote: ‚ÄúThe Agencies do not interpret the term ‚Äòpolitically exposed persons‚Äô to include U.S. public officials.‚Äù (Like many financial regulations, the U.S. has intentionally caused its concern with PEPs to metastasize to aligned countries. In some of those countries, financial institutions are obliged to treat from-their-perspective-domestic senior political officials/etc as PEPs.)</p><p>PEP status also attaches to the close family members and close associates of a PEP. Who is a ‚Äúclose associate‚Äù? Write down your understanding of that, run it by your regulator, and then comport your affairs consistently with your written understanding. Lots of banking regulation works like this: plodding, iterative development of internal policies, with occasional spot checks on performance under those policies, including as part of scheduled bank examinations.</p><p>PEPs are believed to present elevated money laundering risk. Some of them control national resources directly, and others may be at risk of e.g. bribery.</p><p>There is not an official regulator-blessed list of which positions are presumptive proof of PEPiness. This is one of those things that banks need to write down in their procedures then run past their regulator, who will either say ‚ÄúSounds good! Definitely EDD those PEPs!‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI dunno. I know it‚Äôs a schlep but you‚Äôll want to grep more PEPs.‚Äù</p><p>A typical list will include e.g. president, head of state, national members of the legislature, cabinet officials, supreme judiciary body judges, head of the central bank, cabinet-equivalent ministers, etc etc.</p><p>You can <em>absolutely</em> bank PEPs, just like you <em>can</em> bank high-risk businesses. You need to EDD them. Certain banks, largely ginormous money center banks with worldwide operations, put in the specialized work to do this. This is because (with absolutely no insinuation of impropriety here!) private banking benefits from paying attentive service to rich and powerful people so that they talk you up to their rich and powerful friends.</p><p>Now, an individual private banker might be tempted to give <em>more than</em> attentive service. Regulators <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/goldman-sachs-charged-foreign-bribery-case-and-agrees-pay-over-29-billion">frown</a> on that, hence PEP status and PEP screening tools.</p><p>What is a PEP screening tool? I‚Äôm glad you asked. Many people will open accounts with you every day. You can, if your policies and regulator allow it, ask all of them ‚ÄúPardon me sir/madam: are you the president of a foreign nation? Answer quickly because I‚Äôve got about 15 more of these.‚Äù But the vast majority of new customers will think you are <em>very stupid</em>. You can‚Äôt <em>not know</em>, though. Very plausibly, you don‚Äôt trust a 22 year old drawn at random from your employee base to have comprehensive knowledge of the spouses of the current membership of the <em>SƒÖd Najwy≈ºszy.</em></p><p>Since software is eating the world, you can buy a product from any of a number of firms that will ask software these questions. You run an identity by it, and it says ‚ÄúElected to the upper house of the Japanese Diet in 2022; likely a PEP‚Äù or ‚ÄúUnlikely to be a PEP.‚Äù</p><p>This will allow you to decrease customer and employee friction in many of your product lines, while having a responsive answer to your bank examiner when they ask about your PEP program. The other parts of your PEP program will be dreadfully boring. You will write a procedure which says that e.g. that if news reporting or facts available the bank cause it to understand an existing customer to be newly a PEP (or uncover previously missed PEPness), this will trigger a review of their account relationship, which you would duly document. Then, you would add them to your EDD process for PEPs.</p><p>EDD for PEPs is (bottom line here) going to require someone to write a quarterly memo saying ‚ÄúUneventful quarter. The $1.2 million incoming wire was sale of private residence. We commissioned an appraisal (attached) and, based on comps, seems reasonable. Account holder‚Äôs title to property confirmed via title search (attached); it substantially predates most recent election. No other items of note.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>And that‚Äôs all you need to know about PEPs.</p><p>PEPs are extremely uncommon in the world relative to all people/firms. My one professional encounter with the concept when a particular bank claimed a European mayor of a small city was a PEP, on basis of being a politician, and would require EDD to onboard. I protested on behalf of the user. Compliance got annoyed at me for PEPsplaining them.</p><h3 id="politically-motivated-debanking-of-individuals-redux">Politically motivated debanking of individuals, redux</h3><p>Earlier we mentioned that the combination of a monoculture plus a plainly stated or implied policy directive can cause ambitious or ingratiating individuals to take action in the absence of any order to do so. <em>This is very much a risk</em>.</p><p>And if you care about debanking, you should care about this mechanism a lot more than you care about PEP minutiae.</p><p>Permit me a brief detour from banking to the Internet companies that run so much of our modern world.</p><p>It is fairly well understood by people that closely follow the tech industry that Trust and Safety teams were for years a locus of micropolitical action, some of it originating with uninvolved users on Twitter, and some of it originating within the house.</p><p>The prevailing political culture of Trust and Safety teams was, well‚Ä¶ look, let me level with you. Get a group of twentysomething San Franciscans with college degrees together. Now, filter out all the ones who can get a high-paying engineering job or would be reasonably fundable. Now, select of the remainder those who would want to stay, for several years, in a position where they are in charge of being a hall monitor on every human utterance which travels over electrons.</p><p>I think fairminded individuals of many political persuasions will understand that the population who gets through these filters uses the spelling ‚Äúfreeze peach‚Äù instead of ‚Äúfree speech‚Äù at a much higher base rate than the American population does.</p><p>Individuals in Trust and Safety, and sometimes Trust and Safety as a system, at various times in various places, may have engaged in <em>some</em> <em>shenanigans</em>. That isn‚Äôt a load-bearing claim to how this has relevance for debanking, but it happens to be true, and I‚Äôd be remiss if I didn‚Äôt say it.</p><p>If you didn‚Äôt keep a really close eye on them, and senior management at AppAmaGooFaceSoft doesn‚Äôt really keep a close eye on low-paid operational employees making decisions unless they cause substantial PR or government relations backlash, Trust and Safety would happily ‚Äúdeplatform‚Äù people whose politics they disliked for fairly benign reasons, while zealously defending people whose politics they liked.</p><p>This is an iterated game, and people realized you could just <em>ask</em> Trust and Safety to deplatform someone. Product teams built some flows to expedite this. You could ‚Äúbrigade‚Äù those automated tools (e.g. act in concert with friends to mass report a social media post), or make a fuss on Twitter (and wait for a company to perceive brand risk), or just ask an individual Trust and Safety person at a party.</p><p>And thus<em>, shenanigans</em>.</p><p>This was substantially exacerbated once government actors realized they could make Trust and Safety feel <em>really special</em> by having them have monthly meetings with Certifiably Important People. Eventually, at and around these meetings, those attendees began to ask Trust and Safety ‚Äú<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_no_one_rid_me_of_this_turbulent_priest">Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?</a>‚Äù And then after having done <em>that</em> for a while, we slouched into a situation where there was an official at the White House who understood his job to be the Illegal Orders Czar. He badgered Facebook, Twitter, and similar on a post-by-post basis and <em>also</em> zealously advocated at the platform-wide policy level. I‚Äôve never met him but I bet he thinks he is a good person and very good at his job.</p><p>We had a number of officials, in various government departments, who believed they could enact policy preferences more effectively by working through catspaws than by the ordinary operation of the government. But it is a singular fact that one of them was in the White House. He once invoked direct personal interest, from POTUS, explicitly, in writing, to jawbone Youtube to up its censorship game. <a href="https://ago.mo.gov/wp-content/uploads/missouri-v-biden-ruling.pdf">Citation</a> (pg 19).</p><p>Andreessen, who is on the board of Facebook, has discussed the perception and mechanisms of the shenanigan era and then the attempts-at-explicit compulsion era. I refer interested readers to his words in other places, because I <em>really do</em> want to get back to banking regulation.</p><p>I only know what I read in court documents, hear on the grapevine, and very occasionally see with my own two eyes. What I know is sufficient to agree with <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-411_3dq3.pdf">Justice Alito</a>: ‚ÄúIf the lower courts‚Äô assessment of the voluminous record is correct, this is one of the most important free speech cases to reach [the Supreme Court] in years.‚Äù</p><p>The weaponization of Trust and Safety by the ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù industrial/academic/NGO complex and partners in government is a scandal. Tech was‚Ä¶ complicit? I think that is a fair characterization. We were complicit for a few years. We have since found our spine, and expressed some amount of regret for decisions made contemporaneously with the demands.</p><p>One notable specific example of this change: Mark Zuckerberg, in a <a href="https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/PDFFiles/Mark-Zuckerberg-Letter-on-Govt-Censorship.pdf">letter to Congress</a>: ‚ÄúI believe that the government pressure was wrong, and I regret we weren‚Äôt more outspoken about it. I also think that we made some choices that, with the benefit of hindsight and new information, we wouldn‚Äôt make today.‚Äù</p><p>What do Trust and Safety decisions on e.g. misinformation or hate have to do with debanking? Regrettably, more than one would think.</p><p>Compliance is <em>also</em> a monoculture. Good news: Compliance across the banking industry and related companies is substantially more politically diverse than Trust and Safety was in San Francisco.&nbsp;Compliance decisions are also much more commercially meaningful, <em>directly</em>, than Trust and Safety decisions are. Compliance has to sacrifice a paying customer; Trust and Safety just needs to sacrifice <em>advertising inventory</em>. It's hard to recruit customers but ginning up more advertising inventory is fairly straightforward: you can do it simply by making different product decisions about ad load, for example. </p><p>Bad news: Compliance is <em>designed</em> to be a monoculture. First among all things, if you work in Compliance, you must be good at being an ingratiating rule-follower. I do not mean the word ‚Äúingratiating‚Äù as a criticism. I mean it as a description of <em>an affect</em>. You must <em>perform compliance</em> to work in Compliance. If you do not, if you have a rebellious streak, if you throw elbows in meetings with your regulator, you will be replaced by someone who is <em>not incompetent at the job they were hired to do</em>.</p><p>Compliance staff, particularly at senior levels (where they are deciding policy instead of merely clicking on alerts), are <em>central</em> members of the American professional-managerial class. And the culture that is the American PMC has some quirks.</p><h3 id="the-current-thing-is-dead-long-live-the-current-thing">The Current Thing is dead; long live the Current Thing</h3><p>The American PMC has is periodically seized by‚Ä¶ maniac moral fascination.

Scholarly literature has sometimes used the phrase ‚Äúmoral panics‚Äù but generally that is about the population generally. I prefer Andreessen‚Äôs formulation to capture the distinctive way the PMC‚Äîhis class, my class, and (very probably, since you voluntarily read several thousand words about banking regulation) your class‚Äîperforms itself.</p><p>If one is worried about extraordinary debanking, worry <em>less</em> about formal guidance, and worry <em>more</em> about the Current Thing. Because Compliance doesn‚Äôt need to get an email from a regulator or read a position paper to get the Current Thing. The Current Thing was in the New York Times this morning. The Current Thing is all over Twitter. The Current Thing is in the air we breathe. Who could <em>possibly</em> be so oblivious as to not understand the Current Thing? Certainly not a competent professional in a bank or fintech Compliance department.</p><p>Our model for conspiracies frequently supposes some central actor. The Current Thing has no central actor. When it is no longer the Current Thing, when sanity reasserts itself, we will look for evidence that it was the CIA or the Russians or the Soros network or the Kochs or misinformation or any of the thousand excuses we have used to protest our innocence.

Sometimes, after destructive political protests at which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/31/americans-killed-protests-political-unrest-acled">people</a> (including <a href="https://apnews.com/article/83b1ecab54f039bbd30346a218a4c994">cops</a>) died, tech companies <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2021/george-floyd-corporate-america-racial-justice/">donate money</a> to the organizers, because the political project seems to be of ongoing importance, and clearly nobody <em>intends</em> for there to be deaths at a political protest.</p><p>But sometimes, after destructive political protests at which people died, the Current Thing breaks the other way. Sometimes, this causes the great and the good, and also Compliance officers, to immediately throw all levers in their power.</p><p>The Current Thing requires no top-down direction. The White House doesn‚Äôt need to call. A senator‚Äôs letter will arrive days too late to matter.</p><p>Some people passionately believe the Current Thing from four years ago. But it seems like the consensus on it, and it was <em>an automatic consensus</em> in many places professionally relevant, is shifting under our feet.</p><p>What is the consensus in Washington right now? I‚Äôm pretty good at reading tea leaves in Japanese but have limited ability to decode Washingtonese. My present model for the new consensus: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a shame when people die, of course, and political protests should probably not be destructive, of course, but the political leadership of the U.S. is acceptable in polite society, of course, and it would be irresponsible to support a coup, of course, because all Presidents of the U.S. have been legitimately elected, of course, and because there has never been an attempted coup in the United States, of course, and if anyone ever said anything different well sometimes political speech gets feisty, of course.‚Äù</p><p>The Current Thing does not always favor the political left. ‚ÄúRussian sympathizers have taken over the highest levels of the U.S. government! We need to...!‚Äù seems to have sharply different political valence depending on <em>exactly</em> what tone of voice you say it in.</p><p>The Current Thing is not <em>always</em> even conveniently describable by the left/right axis, though sometimes it gets drafted. At no point prior to it <a href="https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/1514313645815066626">becoming a Current Thing</a> did anyone anywhere on the U.S. political spectrum care about drinking straws. I think ostentatiously using a plastic drinking straw might be a right-aligned signifer now in some circles. Ponder that statement. Ostentatiously. Using. A. Plastic. Drinking. Straw.</p><p>Sometimes, the alignment of the parties pivots <em>on a dime </em>while a new Current Thing is developing. Understanding <em>that that happens</em> is one of the most important contributions the Current Thing concept offers.</p><p>One of the few blessings of middle age is that one has lived through many Current Things. If one is reflective about it, even if one has fairly strong and fairly stable convictions, even if one remembers on occasion enthusiastically supporting the position that happens to be one that is one‚Äôs party‚Äôs line on an individual Current Thing, one has <em>distinct, vivid memories</em>. One remembers what everyone around you once believed about a thing, and they believed it with passionate intensity, and now they believe literally the opposite thing, with equally passionate intensity. And they <em>seem to not remember</em> and they <em>don‚Äôt seem</em> to be insane. You can easily have a concept about any work-relevant issue which isn‚Äôt the Current Thing. They demonstrate object permanence in those other conversations.</p><p>I will leave debating individual examples to people who write about politics for a living or follow it for the vicarious thrill some people get from team sports.</p><p>I don‚Äôt know what to do with the Current Thing observation, <em>generally</em>. I just want to get back to writing about wire transfer compliance. But if the next Current Thing happens to arrive, and it is‚Ä¶ squirrels, then there exists the risk that Compliance will develop an <em>intense interest</em> in squirrels. And fifteen years from that day, Compliance will still take the time, once a year or so, to review the necessity of updates to the squirrel interdiction policy.</p><h3 id="what-to-do-about-debanking">What to do about debanking</h3><p>Some people reading this are very, sincerely concerned with debanking.</p><p>Permit me to give you tactical advice to advance your values: put as many calories as possible into designing countermeasures to the Current Thing causing swift, arbitrary action against (primarily) existing accounts by Compliance. You probably won‚Äôt abolish Compliance departments as an institution. You probably won‚Äôt convince banks to bear the stupendous losses they‚Äôd get if they had to open accounts for substantially all comers. Bury Compliance in paperwork and delays for closing an account. You can tell your friends (or enemies) ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs as serious as evicting someone, so it should be as rigorously documented as evicting someone is in a reasonable city. Like, say, Chicago or New York.‚Äù</p><p>If you do this, there <em>will</em> be tradeoffs. You will see them most directly in unwillingness to bank marginal prospects for accounts, and indirectly in measurements of unbanked/underbanked in populations you care about. But this will, very effectively, cut down specifically on disruption caused to people and companies by the offboarding letter.</p><p>Now plausibly you might say there is a free lunch: just be morally righteous and have a backbone. And I agree, in a limited sense. Some virtues are free lunches. We want more of them.</p><p>But those virtues are empirically insufficient to guarantee behavior. Tomorrow‚Äôs Current Thing is very, very powerful, and it might even be aligned with your inclinations. And look back at history: the voluminous history of humanity, the recent history of one‚Äôs nation or industry, or even one‚Äôs personal Twitter archives. Look how many times righteous people with substantial backbone heard about the Current Thing and said ‚Äú... Nah, not the hill I want to die on.‚Äù</p><h3 id="the-policy-program-crypto-advocates-will-use-claims-of-debanking-to-advance">The policy program crypto advocates will use claims of debanking to advance</h3><p>Sometimes rich, powerful people just tweet things. (I can relate; I just tweet things all the time.) </p><p>But sometimes there is an agenda. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got an agenda!‚Äù is sometimes used as a cynical attack in politics. Democratic governance necessarily requires at least some people to have agendas.</p><p>Agendas are frequently published, much more frequently than they are secretly swapped in back rooms. Telling people what you want is a necessary step in getting what you want. Talking about the agenda is really useful for coordinating support for the agenda.</p><p>Crypto, like any industry, has people with a diversity of views in it. But one can‚Äôt losslessly describe the world without being the world, and some lossy models are still useful.&nbsp;</p><p>I have taken the liberty of writing a compressed version of <em>what crypto wants</em>, for the benefit of readers who might not geek out on this stuff. If you‚Äôd prefer hearing it from them directly, out of concern I‚Äôm being unfair, see <a href="https://twitter.com/propelforward/status/1864749506190843969">this thread</a>. Alternatively, you can read the writings of the advocates already namechecked, or spend a few days digesting the policy papers of their lobbyists.</p><p><strong>Crypto wants all banks to be directed to bank ‚Äúall legal businesses‚Äù, by which they mean crypto companies and crypto founders</strong>. They will want an end to banks having discretion in onboarding clients to ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù deposit products, first. They will claim they want this pretty much across the board; their exception will be e.g. Hamas. You get a corporate checking account, you get a corporate checking account, <em>everybody</em> gets a corporate checking account.</p><p>Having achieved this for low-risk vanilla products, they will want sharply less resistance for e.g. high velocity facilitation of funds flows by financial services firms, as long as those financial services firms say the usual things about playing ball, even if those financial services firms are crypto native. Their most immediate concern is exchanges, but they also want less resistance to novel products and use cases.</p><p><strong>Crypto wants their bank back. </strong>They don‚Äôt care what the name on the door is, but they want a bank which can do instantaneous book transfers and will accept basically all comers. Not Hamas, no, but if you would not onboard an entity controlled by CZ, Justin Sun, or someone understood to be Tether‚Äôs new best friend, <em>you do not understand the assignment</em>.</p><p>They want it to ask the minimum number of questions required to continue servicing high volumes compliantly in the United States, primarily. Their secondary priority will be serving as wide a footprint as can be reached without endangering the business within the United States. The U.S. is where the money is and they know this.</p><p>Crypto, nominally, would be happy with changes to U.S. financial plumbing that allowed you to stitch a SEN-equivalent product out of other banks. But they think they‚Äôll probably need a bank, and they think that bank will probably not be <em>their</em> bank if they are just a quickly growing startup business within a ginormous bank. No, they want a bank with 100%-or-as-close-as-makes-no-difference crypto deposit concentration, which will cater assiduously to their needs, and which will fight the good fight if they ever need it to.</p><p>Crypto will compromise on (read: sacrifice the chance of directly doing business with firms or individuals from) Russia, without notable complaint. When the conversation turns to China‚Ä¶ well, you know, a lot of financial innovation was forced to flee to‚Ä¶ <em>many countries in East Asia</em>, including some of our truest friends, under the previous regime. It would be a shame if you sacrificed American competitiveness and national security by not inviting those dollars back to where we can see them.</p><p>Crypto will be very in favor of U.S. national interests vis China, and some crypto investors have any number of proposals on how NatSecTech will help close the technical capabilities gap on e.g. manufacturing drone components. They have a number of portfolio companies to introduce you to, Washington, and plan to have more shortly.</p><p>If you are a regulator and don‚Äôt want crypto to have a bank, they want you to be promoted to private citizen as early as possible. And they want to make it very, very, very clear to junior staff that the same awaits them if they get out of line.</p><p>If you engage crypto in Washington and present as clueful, perhaps by saying ‚ÄúAren't most of the fruits of the innovation you just described as having departed the U.S. due to the previous administration actually custodied in New York right now? At Cantor Fitzgerald, right?‚Äù, crypto will say ‚ÄúYes, I am glad you brought that up. Stablecoins are one of the world‚Äôs largest users of U.S. Treasuries. We have a position paper about this. It is critically important to maintain the U.S.‚Äôs lead in stablecoins. You should prefer them be custodied within the United States. We think we have workable solutions for doing them within the regulated perimeter.‚Äù</p><p>And what about the elephant in the room? "Is that a Republican joke?!" </p><p><strong>Crypto wants full unreserved repudiation of all guidance that suggests cryptocurrencies are high-risk</strong>. Pause letters, position papers, informal guidance, supervisory questions, they want it all swept clean with a broom. They don‚Äôt care all that much about what banking regulators do <em>after</em> that, but if you want a suggestion, it should be asking banks about their crypto strategy, listening attentively, then exercising moral suasion if they <em>don‚Äôt </em>have one. If banks identify barriers to adoption of blockchain technology, advocates want regulators to react to that like the emergency it is.</p><p><strong>Crypto wants banks to be able to custody cryptoassets. </strong>There is a highly technical accounting standard that you probably don‚Äôt care about, which governs how much capital a bank needs to back assets it custodies. A bank needs $1 in equity capital to custody $1 in digital assets. This makes running a crypto custody business within the banking perimeter a non-starter.</p><p>Crypto already has crypto custody products available, but they are at places like e.g. Coinbase and not e.g. State Street. Crypto wants a custody business within the banking perimeter, because they perceive this as necessary to ease institutional adoption. They want parity with traditional risk assets (like equities), <em>minimally</em>. If they get that they‚Äôll pivot to asking for a thumb on the scale. Crypto is not wrong that capital requirements place a thumb on the scale for some politically preferred assets (e.g. MBS).</p><p><strong>Crypto wants to rewrite the formal history of the 2023 banking crisis</strong>. There are several supervisory reports which lay out a narrative, some linked above. You will replace and repudiate those reports. The new ones will claim that the failure of the banks was proximately caused by explicitly directed political action by the prior administration. You will aver that this and similar supervisory actions are against the policy of the United States. You will look the camera in the eye and, very sternly, say that banks acting contrary to this instruction will feel the full weight of the federal government arrayed against them.</p><p>Crypto doesn‚Äôt really care about what you say about SVB or First Republic.</p><p><strong>Crypto wants Fed master accounts for state-chartered crypto-native financial services companies</strong>. Simple enough. They want them with the automaticity that a community bank gets them. We show our charter and ask; you issue.</p><p><strong>Crypto wants the SEC to provide a repeatable, predictable path for selling tokens to ordinary Americans as early in the issuer‚Äôs lifecycle as reasonably feasible</strong>. The existing registration and exemption regime that non-crypto startups are under is, pointedly, one cross crypto/tech investors are <em>extremely</em> familiar with. They <em>do not want</em> <em>parity</em> with that regime.</p><p>They want to be able to sell tokens to retail, because retail is where the money is.</p><p>They are actually pretty sincere that as long as you give them carte blanche to sell to retail, they will follow the procedures you outline to unlock that. $1 million in compliance cost for an unrestricted offering is fine, and will cut down on headline risk by chasing away some of the 2017-era-ICO nonsense. Venture firms will be happy to underwrite the ante.</p><p>After you give them this, crypto will industrialize and blitzscale efforts to market crypto investment opportunities as investment opportunities to all Americans who currently invest in any capacity whatsoever and many who do not. They know (to a mortal certainty) they can sell tens of billions of dollars of these products if allowed to. <em>That would be a failure, </em>because crypto has required so much infra investment to get to the present day. Crypto's ambitions are much higher. They do not think trillions of dollars are out of reach. Trillions would be a success.</p><p>Crypto is starting to get just smidge impatient about when they get their trillions. <em>Some</em> crypto investors are on a shot clock, because they have made promises to capital partners. For many of them, Bitcoin at $100,000 is amazingly good news but not by itself a victory condition. They <em>need</em> that path to a trillion dollars of token sales.</p><p><strong>Crypto wants permissive guidance about novel crypto-adjacent banking products</strong>. Banks should be able to issue crypto-backed loans at parity to public equity-backed loans, for minimally the majors (BTC/ETH). Stablecoins should get treatment similar to a CD- or moneymarket-backed loan. (These are all very niche products, yes, but what is finance if not people who are very creative at imagining circumstances where you'd want very niche products.)</p><p>Everything else banks offer? We want it, too, on equal footing.</p><p><strong>Crypto wants some institutional examples made. </strong>They want at least one regulator canceled-without-replacement and they want the world to understand that crypto did it. They don‚Äôt expect it to be the Fed (not realistic) or the FDIC (indispensable infrastructure; keeps retail happy). The CFPB though? They‚Äôd take the CFPB.</p><p>And now you know why we‚Äôre having a sudden conversation about debanking.</p>

The robot used large language models in the cloud to answer questions, talk, and function. With Embodied out of business, the robot will soon no longer be able to make those calls. This outcome was always likely ‚Äì any cloud based device is subject to the health of the company and LLMs are not cheap to run. This has actually happened before <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8NShFU7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a company called Vector</a>. But the shocking part is that this was not an old device, it was fairly recent, expensive, and still being sold.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Affirmations with Moxie" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ju9yLXoR-3Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In a <a href="https://moxierobot.com/pages/closing-faqs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Closing FAQ</a> emailed to users and posted on their website, Embodied made it clear that Moxie was likely to stop working within days. No refunds will be given and if you bought the device on a payment plan it‚Äôs out of their hands. No repairs and service can be offered and the company has no clear plan for who, if anybody, will take it over. Short of a miracle, customers will be stuck holding the bag.</p><p>The response from Moxie owners seems fairly emotional. Parents have to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MoxieRobot/comments/1h621ag/how_i_told_my_kiddo_that_moxie_was_going_away/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explain to their kids that Moxie is functionally dying</a>, although the company has ‚Äúincluded a letter from the G.R.L. (Global Robotics Lab) to help guide this conversation in an age-appropriate way‚Äù. There are videos on TikTok of children and adults crying and asking Moxie what‚Äôs going to happen now. On some level I understand that reaction ‚Äì even outside of dropping 800 bucks on this thing, it‚Äôs like watching a friend die. I could see a future in which another owner takes over or even one where these devices are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MoxieRobot/comments/1ha2b7s/currently_working_on_a_replacement_ai_for_when/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hacked for local operation</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>But relying on large language models to socialize children, particularly neuroatypical ones, seems like a bad idea on every single level. I do not think any child should be learning language and social interactions from an LLM, let alone children with special needs. What‚Äôs more, this brings to bear a larger issue of the AI bubble: these devices are costly to run and Silicon&nbsp; alley has been attempting to outrun or rationalize that fact. And when this entire thing comes tumbling down, what happens to the people who decided to develop ill-advised relationships with AI?&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@veechip/video/7441801078485617962" data-video-id="7441801078485617962" data-embed-from="oembed"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@veechip" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@veechip?refer=embed">@veechip</a> <p>I asked Moxie about his creators going out of buisness.

            <guid>42370744</guid>
            <pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 21:33:12 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/tag/8.0.0">https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/tag/8.0.0</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42370744">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-pjax="true" data-test-selector="body-content" data-view-component="true"><p>Bazel 8.0 is a major LTS release. It contains new features and backwards incompatible changes.</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Many rules that were bundled with Bazel are now split into their own repositories, as part of the Starlarkification effort. This includes:
<ul>
<li>Android: All android_* build and repo rules have been moved to <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android">http://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android</a>. Android tools are no longer bundled with Bazel inside @bazel_tools//tools/android.</li>
<li>C++: All C++ toolchain-related symbols have been moved <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_cc">http://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_cc</a>; other symbols, including the rules themselves, will be moved in a future release.</li>
<li>Java: All java_* rules and providers (like JavaInfo)  have been moved to <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_java">http://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_java</a>.</li>
<li>Protobuf: All *_proto_library rules (for Java, C++, Python)  and providers (like ProtoInfo)  have been moved to <a href="https://github.com/google/protobuf">http://github.com/google/protobuf</a>.</li>
<li>Python: All py_* rules and providers (like PyInfo) have been moved to <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python">http://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python</a>.</li>
<li>Shell: All sh_* rules have been moved to <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_shell">http://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_shell</a>.</li>
<li>Use load statements for all  the rules and providers from the above repositories. The load statements work with Bazel 6, 7 and 8 (repositories are backwards compatible and support both bzlmod and WORKSPACE mode). Bazel 9 will make load statements mandatory.</li>
<li>To facilitate migration, Bazel 8 introduces the --incompatible_autoload_externally flag, which by default loads rules and symbols that were previously hard-coded inside Bazel from corresponding rule repositories.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The WORKSPACE mechanism is now disabled by default.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bazel.build/external/overview#bzlmod" rel="nofollow">Bzlmod</a>, the new way to manage external dependencies, is turned on by default since Bazel 7.0.</li>
<li>The WORKSPACE and WORKSPACE.bzlmod files are no longer read by Bazel, by default. To bring back this behavior, use --enable_workspace. Check the <a href="https://bazel.build/external/migration" rel="nofollow">migration guide</a> and try out the <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-central-registry/tree/main/tools#migrate_to_bzlmodpy">migration tool</a> for moving your external dependencies to Bzlmod.</li>
<li>We are aiming to remove WORKSPACE in Bazel 9 completely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Symbolic macros are introduced as a new way to write build macros, improving the experience for both macro authors and BUILD file owners.
<ul>
<li>Symbolic macro arguments are typed like rule attributes, with similar type conversions. They also are less prone to latent bugs because they automatically promote values of configurable attributes to select() expressions.</li>
<li>Symbolic macros avoid pitfalls that harm BUILD readability, such as mutating their arguments, and are compatible with lazy evaluation (not implemented yet).</li>
<li>Internal targets of symbolic macros are protected from clients by the visibility system.</li>
<li>Legacy macros that call native.existing_rules() can often be replaced by finalizer macros.</li>
<li>See <a href="https://bazel.build/extending/macros" rel="nofollow">https://bazel.build/extending/macros</a> for more detail on symbolic macros.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Migration-Ready Incompatible Flags</h2>
<p>The following flags are flipped in 8.0:</p>
<ul>
<li>--enable_workspace (<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23023" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23023/hovercard">#23023</a>; now defaults to false)</li>
<li>--incompatible_disallow_ctx_resolve_tools (<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22249" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22249/hovercard">#22249</a>; now defaults to true)</li>
<li>--incompatible_disallow_empty_glob (<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/8195" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8195/hovercard">#8195</a>; now defaults to true)</li>

</ul>
<h2>General</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>[Incompatible]</strong> All labels in Bazel error messages, log output, Build Event Protocol, etc. are now prefixed with double-at (@@) instead of single-at (@) where applicable, to properly denote that they contain canonical repo names.</li>
<li><strong>[Incompatible]</strong> The global applicable_licenses attribute has been renamed to package_metadata. The older name may be used for creating targets, but Starlark code must use the name package_metadata to retrieve it.</li>
<li><strong>[Incompatible]</strong> The package(distribs=[...]) attribute has been removed. It has been a no-op for several years now. distribs() at the package level is no longer legal syntax.</li>
<li><strong>[Incompatible]</strong> The --host_jvm_profile command line argument is not supported anymore.</li>
<li><strong>[Incompatible]</strong> The path attribute is removed from filegroup.</li>
<li><strong>[Incompatible]</strong> "bazel query" and "bazel print_action" can't run under the output base anymore.</li>
<li><strong>[Incompatible]</strong> --zip_undeclared_test_outputs now defaults to false, causing undeclared test outputs (i.e., files written to $TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR by a test) to be produced as a directory instead of a zip file.</li>
<li><strong>[Incompatible]</strong> On Windows, a change to the output base locking protocol might cause an older Bazel invoked immediately after a newer Bazel (on the same output base) to error out instead of blocking for the lock, even if --block_for_lock is enabled. (<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24210" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24210/hovercard">#24210</a>)</li>
<li>The result of canonicalize-flags now includes all Starlark flags by default. Use --noexperimental_include_default_values for the old behavior that only reports Starlark flags with non-default values.</li>
<li>Bazel now supports all characters in the rlocation and target paths of runfiles and can be run from workspaces with a space in their full path (<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23331" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23331/hovercard">#23331</a>).</li>
<li>genquery now supports (unconfigured) cycles, but may have higher peak memory usage.</li>
<li>The default value of --skyframe_high_water_mark_minor_gc_drops_per_invocation and --skyframe_high_water_mark_full_gc_drops_per_invocation has been decreased to 10, which can result in Bazel OOMing more eagerly as Skyframe state is no longer dropped an unlimited number of times in response to high memory pressure.</li>
<li>Improved progress message in case there are no actions in flight, and display explicitly "no actions running" in that case.</li>
<li>glob now has a more efficient implementation that uses less retained memory and CPU, while sometimes taking more wall time for recursive globs in very large directory trees.</li>
<li>REPO.bazel now allows another directive, ignore_directories(). It takes a list of directories to ignore just like .bazelignore does, but with glob semantics. (<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24203" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24203/hovercard">#24203</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Android</h2>
<ul>
<li>Native <code>mobile-install</code> is deleted. Please use the new Starlarkified version (‚Äúmobile-install v3‚Äù) instead. See <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android">https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Build Event Protocol</h2>
<ul>
<li>BEP will include correct TestResult and TargetSummary events when special test inputs like $test_runtime fail to build.</li>
<li>The default size limit for a named set of files in BEP is now 5000 (was unlimited before). In the event that the limit is reached, the message will be split.</li>
<li>BEP now contains data similar to dump command breakdowns for rules, aspects and skykeys.</li>
<li>WorkerMetrics of killed workers are logged (max 50 based on custom prioritization and then arranged in order of worker id). WorkerMetrics also includes the number of actions executed by each worker are now logged in the BEP. The semantics of WorkerPoolStats.evicted_count to refer to the workers that are killed (destroyed) as a result of memory pressure (evicted_count &lt;= destroyed_count).</li>
<li>BEP's execution_phase_time_in_ms no longer includes the analysis-only part at the beginning of the build. Artificial downtrend in execution_phase_time_in_ms expected.</li>
<li>A new experimental flag, --experimental_build_event_output_group_mode, allows users to change how a given output group's files are reported in BEP. The current behavior is NAMED_SET_OF_FILES_ONLY which populates OutputGroup.file_sets. Users may now specify INLINE_ONLY to instead report files directly in the TargetComplete/AspectComplete event under OutputGroup.inline_files. Users may also specify BOTH to populate OutputGroup.file_sets and OutputGroup.inline_files.</li>
<li>Undeclared test outputs are now reported individually in the BEP, unless zipping is enabled via --zip_undeclared_test_outputs.</li>
<li>Log all WorkerPoolStats for all worker pools (even though workers aren't created or destroyed). Also add unknown_destroyed_count and alive_count to the WorkerPoolStats proto.</li>
<li>By default, coverage artifacts will be reported inline in the TargetComplete event. To disable this behavior, pass --experimental_build_event_output_group_mode=baseline.lcov=named_set_of_files_only.</li>
</ul>
<h2>C++ / Objective-C</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>[Incompatible]</strong> apple_cc_toolchain rule was removed. Use regular cc_toolchain instead.</li>
<li><strong>[Incompatible]</strong> The Starlark methods copts, generate_linkmap, and should_strip_binary in the objc fragment have been deleted.  Please use the equivalent methods objccopts, objc_generate_linkmap, and objc_should_strip_binary in the cpp fragment instead.</li>
<li><strong>[Incompatible]</strong> Removed def_file from cc_common.create_link_variables.</li>
<li><strong>[Incompatible]</strong> With the default Unix toolchain on macOS, binaries now use <a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/rpath/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/rpath">@rpath</a> to find their .dylib dependencies. This is required to fix issues where tools run during the build couldn't find their dynamic dependencies. (<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23090" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23090/hovercard">#23090</a>)</li>
<li><strong>[Incompatible]</strong> The deprecated fragments["apple"].bitcode_mode and fragments["cpp"].apple_bitcode_mode APIs have been removed from Bazel. Apple deprecated Bitcode in Xcode 14.</li>
<li><strong>[Incompatible]</strong> CppLinkAction returns 2 args to aspects that have the correct quoting set (before it was always 1 args object defaulting to bash escaping).</li>
<li><strong>[Incompatible]</strong> The BAZEL_CURRENT_REPOSITORY preprocessor variable, which holds the canonical name of the Bazel repository containing a cc_* target, is now only set during compilation if the target depends on the C/C++ runfiles library @rules_cc/cc//runfiles via deps or implementation_deps.</li>
<li><strong>[Incompatible]</strong> C++ toolchains configuration files have moved to rules_cc, if you are depending on anything in @bazel_tools//tools/cpp, you should use the version from @rules_cc (&gt;=0.0.12) instead.</li>
<li>Added conlyopts and cxxopts attributes to C++ rules (<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23792" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23792/hovercard">#23792</a>)</li>
<li>cc_toolchain now passes runfiles for its *_files attrs (e.g. data files for a tool built for linking).</li>
<li>The new cc_static_library rule produces a static library that bundles given targets and all their transitive dependencies. It has to be enabled via --experimental_cc_static_library.</li>
<li>New $(DUMPBIN) make variable is now available for Visual Studio toolchains.</li>
<li>--incompatible_make_thinlto_command_lines_standalone is now a no-op.</li>
<li>--compile_one_dependency selects header-only cc_librarys in more cases.</li>
<li>Added windows_quoting_for_param_files feature for windows-style parameter file escaping.</li>
<li>The local_defines attribute of cc_library() and cc_binary() supports $(location ...) expansion for additional_compiler_inputs just like for deps.</li>
<li>The bazel --quiet command line option can now be used to make Bazel emit much less output. (<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24024" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24024/hovercard">#24024</a>)</li>
<li><strong>[Incompatible]</strong> cc_toolchain_suite is a <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7260" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7260/hovercard">no op</a>. All C++ rules use Bazel's <a href="https://bazel.build/extending/toolchains" rel="nofollow">toolchain API</a>.</li>
<li><strong>[Incompatible]</strong> --incompatible_enable_cc_toolchain_resolution is a <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7260" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7260/hovercard">no op</a>. All C++ rules use Bazel's <a href="https://bazel.build/extending/toolchains" rel="nofollow">toolchain API</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Configurability / cquery</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>[Incompatible]</strong> <a href="https://bazel.build/extending/config#incoming-edge-transitions" rel="nofollow">Incoming</a> rule() transitions  can't set cfg = "exec" or <a href="https://bazel.build/rules/lib/toplevel/config#exec" rel="nofollow">cfg = config.exec()</a>. This generally doesn't make sense. Prefer declaring dependencies as exec tools.</li>
<li>Starlark rules can annotate attr() with <a href="https://bazel.build/rules/lib/toplevel/config#none" rel="nofollow">cfg = config.none()</a>. This is useful for pure-data dependencies that should build the same no matter their parent's configuration.</li>
<li>Starlark rules can replace cfg = "target" on attribute definitions with <a href="https://bazel.build/rules/lib/toplevel/config#target" rel="nofollow">cfg = config.target()</a> for more consistent syntax.</li>
<li><a href="https://bazel.build/query/cquery" rel="nofollow">bazel cquery</a> <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16310#issuecomment-1876108171" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16310/hovercard">more accurately</a> lists dependencies from aspects. Requires --experimental_explicit_aspects. Try this if you see confusing results. As an experimental feature this doesn't work for all output formats. Available since 7.2.0.</li>
<li><a href="https://bazel.build/query/guide" rel="nofollow">bazel query</a> includes <a href="https://bazel.build/reference/be/platforms-and-toolchains#toolchain_type" rel="nofollow">toolchain type requirements</a> as implicit dependencies.. This includes the <a href="https://bazel.build/rules/lib/globals/bzl.html#rule.toolchains" rel="nofollow">toolchains</a> parameter in rule() definitions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Coverage</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>[Incompatible]</strong> Passing a FilesToRunProvider to coverage_support_files will now result in an error as opposed to being silently ignored.</li>
<li><strong>[Incompatible]</strong> Coverage report generators no longer receive the JAVA_RUNFILES and PYTHON_RUNFILES environment variables.</li>
</ul>
<h2>External Dependencies</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>[Incompatible]</strong> The format of canonical repo names has changed to use plus (+) instead of tilde (~). Effectively, this flips the flag --incompatible_use_plus_in_repo_names to true, and the flag is now a no-op (i.e. cannot be "unflipped"). ‚Äã‚ÄãSee <a href="https://bazel.build/external/module#repository_names_and_strict_deps" rel="nofollow">https://bazel.build/external/module#repository_names_and_strict_deps</a> for advice on how to avoid hardcoding canonical repository names.</li>
<li>--experimental_repository_downloader_retries now defaults to 5.</li>
<li>Overrides in the root MODULE.bazel file are now ignored with --ignore_dev_dependency. (Overrides in non-root modules are already ignored.)</li>
<li>The fetch and vendor commands now support --target_pattern_file for specifying target patterns.</li>
<li>Patches to the module file in single_version_override are now effective as long as the patch file lies in the root module.</li>
<li>Repository rules instantiated in the same module extensions can now refer to each other by their extension-specified names in label attributes.</li>
<li>override_repo and inject_repo can be used to override and inject repos in module extensions. (<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23534" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23534/hovercard">#23534</a>)</li>
<li>The new --inject_repository flag can be used to add new repositories via the CLI with --enable_bzlmod. Such repositories behave as if they were declared by local_repository via use_repo_rule in the root module. (<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24301" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24301/hovercard">#24301</a>)</li>
<li>External repositories that are managed by Bzlmod can now contain a top-level external directory or package. (<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24147" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24147/hovercard">#24147</a>)</li>
<li>repository_ctx.execute can now remove an environment variable when executing a process by associating it with the value None in the environment argument. (<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24245" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24245/hovercard">#24245</a>)</li>
<li>bazel mod now tries to evaluate all module extensions, even when some have failed to evaluate. (<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24259" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24259/hovercard">#24259</a>)</li>
<li>archive_override now accepts all attributes usable with http_archive; similar for git_override and git_repository. (<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24443" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24443/hovercard">#24443</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Java</h2>
<ul>
<li>The core Java rules (java_binary, java_library, java_test, java_import, java_plugin) and symbols (java_common, JavaInfo, JavaPluginInfo) are no longer available in Bazel and must be loaded from @rules_java.
<ul>
<li>WORKSPACE builds may need to update their setup, see the release notes at <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_java/releases">https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_java/releases</a> for what @rules_java now requires. Relatedly, projects enabling both --enable_bzlmod and --enable_workspace that fetch @rules_java via the MODULE.bazel file, may need to explicitly re-declare some dependencies in the WORKSPACE file, as Bzlmod dependencies are not automatically visible to other WORKSPACE repositories.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The default java language level (with rules_java 8.1.0) is now 11 (previously 8).</li>
<li>java_binary and java_test no longer generate an additional target - the deploy jars are once again outputs of the primary (only) target.</li>
<li>JavaInfo.compilation_info.javac_options now returns a depset. Use tokenize_javacopts from @rules_java to get the options as a correctly ordered list.</li>
<li>Java compilation actions now set LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 (previously: en_US.UTF-8).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Local Execution</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>[Incompatible]</strong> The mnemonic passed to --worker_extra_flag is now matched against the worker key mnemonic when one is available, instead of the action mnemonic. This makes it consistent with other worker flags taking a mnemonic. (<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24251" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24251/hovercard">#24251</a>)</li>
<li>Prevent linux-sandbox(ed) spawns from being able to write in the cgroups mount.</li>
<li>Symlink trees are now created through direct filesystem calls by default, instead of delegated to a helper process. On Windows, this entails respecting the --windows_enable_symlinks flag, falling back to a copy when the flag is unset (the helper process always attempts to create symlinks, irrespective of the flag). Set --noexperimental_inprocess_symlink_creation to temporarily revert to the previous behavior, which will be removed in a future release.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>[Incompatible]</strong> The aquery command now reports all potential inputs of actions that support input discovery, including the input headers of C++ compilation actions and those explicitly marked as unused through the unused_inputs_list argument to ctx.actions.run. Set --noinclude_pruned_inputs to omit pruned inputs from aquery output when running it after action execution.</li>
<li><strong>[Incompatible]</strong> The --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format and --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file command line options are not available anymore.</li>
<li>--experimental_collect_system_network_usage is flipped to true and will be removed soon.</li>
<li>Introduced Skyfocus, an experimental feature aimed to reduce Bazel's retained heap usage with working sets. Use --experimental_enable_skyfocus to enable it. See <a href="https://bazel.build/advanced/performance/memory#trade-flexibility" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> for more information.</li>
<li>bazel query now uses 3% less memory.</li>
<li>Introduce new flag --experimental_worker_use_cgroups_on_linux that uses cgroups to track memory usage for singleplex workers (on Linux).</li>
<li>Added --experimental_collect_skyframe_counts_in_profiler to collect Skyframe node counts in the JSON profile over time. Currently, the following SkyFunctions are measured: BZL_LOAD, GLOB, GLOBS, PACKAGE, CONFIGURED_TARGET, ASPECT, ACTION_EXECUTION.</li>
<li>Introduced a new format for the execution log, enabled by --execution_log_compact_file. This format is preferred over the preexisting --execution_log_{binary,json}_file, as it‚Äôs much cheaper to produce and smaller in size; however, it‚Äôs not human-readable. The tools in //src/tools/execlog may be used to analyze logs and convert between formats.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Remote Execution</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added the ability to garbage collect the disk cache by setting one or both of --experimental_disk_cache_gc_max_size and --experimental_disk_cache_gc_max_age. Garbage collection occurs in the background while the Bazel server is idle; the idle timer defaults to 5 minutes, but may be overridden by --experimental_disk_cache_gc_idle_delay.</li>
<li>The default value of --experimental_remote_cache_eviction_retries is changed to 5.</li>
<li>Uploading local action results to a disk or remote cache now occurs in the background whenever possible, potentially unblocking the execution of followup actions. Set --noremote_cache_async to revert to the previous behavior.</li>
<li>Added support for using a remote cache that evicts blobs and doesn't have AC integrity check (e.g. HTTP cache).</li>
<li>--incompatible_remote_symlinks, --incompatible_remote_dangling_symlinks, --incompatible_remote_downloader_send_all_headers and --incompatible_remote_output_paths_relative_to_input_rootare deleted.</li>
<li>--build_event_upload_max_threads is removed.</li>
<li>The default value of --experimental_remote_cache_compression_threshold is changed to 100.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Starlark / Build Language</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bazel can now parse .scl files, a dialect of Starlark without Bazel-specific symbols.</li>
<li>Dormant dependencies and materializer functions are now available with the --experimental_dormant_deps flag.</li>
<li>Aspects can now propagate to target‚Äôs toolchain dependencies by specifying the toolchain types to propagate to via toolchains_aspects.</li>
<li>Aspects can now return DefaultInfo, which will then be merged with that of the configured target they are applied to. Currently, only the files field is supported.</li>
<li>Output groups provided by a rule and/or multiple aspects are now merged instead of resulting in an error.</li>
<li>If --proto:rule_classes flag is enabled, query proto output will contain rule class definitions in Stardoc proto format.</li>
<li>Starlark min and max builtins now allow a key callback, similarly to sorted.</li>
<li><strong>[Incompatible]</strong> Non-singleton target visibility lists can now contain //visibility:public and //visibility:private elements; the result is appropriately simplified when assigned to an attribute. (<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19922" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19922/hovercard">#19922</a>)</li>
<li><strong>[Incompatible]</strong> --incompatible_simplify_unconditional_selects_in_rule_attrs simplifies configurable rule attributes which contain only unconditional selects. (<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19922" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19922/hovercard">#19922</a>)</li>
<li><strong>[Incompatible]</strong> The input_manifests argument of ctx.actions.{run,run_shell} is now a no-op. resolve_command and resolve_tools always return the empty list as the input manifest list.</li>
<li><strong>[Incompatible]</strong> ctx.resolve_tools is no longer available by default, in preparation for complete removal. Use --noincompatible_disallow_ctx_resolve_tools to temporarily make it available again. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="2280997341" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22249" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22249/hovercard" href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22249">#22249</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Windows</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>[Incompatible]</strong> On Windows, the default msys64 root is changed to C:/msys64 from C:/tools/msys64.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Appendix</h2>

<p>Across the sun-drenched landscapes of Southern Italy and other olive-growing regions in Europe, a deadly bacterium is wreaking havoc on olive trees, with devastating consequences for local economies and the global olive oil market. Xylella fastidiosa, a microscopic pathogen, has been silently causing the destruction of millions of olive trees since its discovery in Italy in 2013. This bacterial disease not only threatens the future of olive oil production but also raises questions about how agricultural sectors worldwide can better protect their crops from emerging diseases.</p>
<h3>The Silent Killer: What is Xylella fastidiosa?</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylella_fastidiosa">Xylella fastidiosa</a> is a Gram-negative bacterium that inhabits the xylem vessels of plants ‚Äî the water-conducting tissue. This pathogen is transmitted through the sap-feeding actions of certain insects, like <strong>sharpshooters</strong> and <strong>spittlebugs</strong>, which act as vectors. Although X. fastidiosa affects a wide range of plant species, its impact on olive trees has been particularly catastrophic. It causes a condition known as <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_quick_decline_syndrome">Olive Quick Decline Syndrome (OQDS)</a></strong>, which leaves once-vibrant trees withering and dying in a matter of months.</p>
<p>The bacterium was first detected in Europe in 2013, when it emerged in the olive orchards of Apulia, a region in southern Italy that historically produced nearly half of the country‚Äôs olive oil. By 2020, a staggering 595 plant species had been identified as potential hosts, including not just olive trees but also coffee plants, grapes, and citrus. This vast range of hosts makes Xylella fastidiosa a particularly difficult foe to contain.</p>
<h3>The Origin of the Outbreak: From Coffee to Olive Trees</h3>
<p>The origin of the Xylella outbreak in Italy can be traced back to a single coffee plant imported from Central America in 2008. Researchers found that the bacterium in the infected coffee plant adapted to thrive in olive trees, setting the stage for the crisis that would unfold over the next decade. By 2015, the disease had spread beyond Apulia, affecting regions across France, Spain, and Portugal. The rapid spread of this bacterium has left scientists and farmers alike scrambling for solutions.</p>
<h3>The Diseases Caused by Xylella fastidiosa</h3>
<p>Xylella fastidiosa is responsible for a range of plant diseases, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bacterial Leaf Scorch</strong>: Affects a variety of tree species, causing premature leaf drop and stunted growth.</li>
<li><strong>Oleander Leaf Scorch</strong>: Affects ornamental plants like oleanders, leading to the rapid decline of affected species.</li>
<li><strong>Coffee Leaf Scorch (CLS)</strong>: Affects coffee plants, causing the leaves to scorch and impacting the coffee supply.</li>
<li><strong>Pierce‚Äôs Disease of Grapes</strong>: A major concern for the wine industry, as it leads to wilting and fruit loss in grapevines.</li>
<li><strong>Olive Quick Decline Syndrome (OQDS)</strong>: Specifically harmful to olive trees, causing premature leaf drop, dieback of branches, and eventually, the death of the tree.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the focus has been on olives, the bacterium‚Äôs ability to infect such a broad spectrum of plants makes it an agricultural nightmare, particularly in regions where multiple crops are grown in close proximity.</p>
<h3>A Hidden Crisis: Olive Quick Decline Syndrome</h3>
<p>The disease known as Olive Quick Decline Syndrome (OQDS) has been the primary culprit in the destruction of olive trees across Italy and beyond. Infected trees exhibit sudden withering of leaves, branches, and twigs, with symptoms often spreading rapidly through the entire tree. For centuries-old olive trees, particularly the prized varieties <em>Cellina di Nard√≤</em> and <em>Ogliarola salentina</em>, the impact has been devastating. These trees, which once formed the backbone of Italy‚Äôs olive oil industry, have been lost to this relentless disease.</p>
<p>By 2015, the disease had already infected over a million olive trees in Apulia alone. The situation worsened as Xylella fastidiosa spread to other parts of Europe, including Corsica and mainland France, where it began affecting other plants like myrtle-leaf milkwort. In total, more than 20 million olive trees have been infected across Europe, putting the region‚Äôs olive oil production at risk.</p>
<h3>The Search for a Cure: Is There Hope?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, there are currently no known cures for Xylella fastidiosa. The most effective measures to control the disease involve preventing its spread. Infected trees must be destroyed, and measures must be taken to control the insect vectors that transmit the bacterium. European regulations mandate the removal of contaminated plants and increased surveillance to track the movement of the disease.</p>
<p>Moreover, scientists are exploring ways to identify and breed olive varieties resistant to Xylella fastidiosa. However, this process is time-consuming, and it may take years before a reliable solution is found. The most practical strategy, for now, is to plant olive varieties that are naturally resistant to Xylella fastidiosa to prevent future outbreaks and minimize potential losses.</p>
<figure></figure>
<h3>Symptoms of Xylella fastidiosa Infection</h3>
<p>The symptoms of Xylella fastidiosa infection are diverse and can be easily mistaken for other plant diseases. Common signs include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leaf Scorching</strong>: The edges of leaves turn brown and dry, eventually spreading across the entire leaf.</li>
<li><strong>Chlorosis</strong>: A yellowing of the leaves, often followed by necrosis (death of tissue).</li>
<li><strong>Dwarfing of Plants</strong>: Infected plants may experience stunted growth, with shorter branches and internodes.</li>
<li><strong>Premature Fruit Drop</strong>: Infected trees may drop their fruit before it fully ripens, leading to a loss of harvest.</li>
<li><strong>Overall Decline</strong>: As the disease progresses, the entire tree may collapse, leading to its death.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because these symptoms often appear gradually, the disease may go unnoticed until it has already caused significant damage.</p>
<h3>The Economic Fallout: A Looming Crisis</h3>
<p>The economic implications of Xylella fastidiosa‚Äôs spread are staggering. In Italy, the country‚Äôs olive orchards are estimated to suffer a ‚Ç¨5.2 billion loss over the next 50 years if the trees cannot be replaced. This would have a ripple effect on the olive oil industry, leading to higher prices and reduced availability for consumers worldwide. Experts predict that the economic decline could range from ‚Ç¨4.1 billion to ‚Ç¨10.3 billion over the next five decades, depending on the rate of the disease‚Äôs spread.</p>
<p>For olive growers, the lesson is clear: proactive measures, such as planting resistant olive varieties, could have saved millions of trees. The ongoing spread of Xylella fastidiosa serves as a reminder of the importance of vigilance and early intervention in agriculture.</p>
<figure></figure>
<h3>What‚Äôs Next? A Call to Action</h3>
<p>The future of olive oil production in Europe depends on quick, coordinated action. It is essential for the agricultural community to continue researching resistant olive varieties and better pest control methods. Meanwhile, European countries must strengthen regulations to prevent the introduction and spread of this deadly pathogen.</p>
<p>The Xylella crisis underscores the need for global cooperation in the fight against plant diseases. As the world‚Äôs agricultural systems face new and evolving threats, it is vital that we learn from this outbreak and take steps to protect our crops ‚Äî not just for today, but for generations to come.</p>
