A <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nmid.6474/gov.uscourts.nmid.6474.3.0_1.pdf" target="_blank">letter</a> from Justice Department official Matthew McKenzie to U.S. District Judge Ramona Manglona of the U.S. District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands said that Assange would appear in court at 9 a.m. local time on Wednesday (or, 7 p.m. ET on Tuesday) to plead guilty and said that DOJ expects Assange will return to Australia, his country of citizenship, after the proceedings.</p><p>U.S. charges against Assange stem from one of the largest publications of classified information in American history, which took place during the first term of Barack Obama's presidency. Starting in late 2009, according to the government, Assange conspired with <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/judge-orders-chelsea-manning-be-released-n1157381" target="_blank">Chelsea Manning</a>, a military intelligence analyst, to disclose tens of thousands of activity reports about the war in Afghanistan, hundreds of thousands of reports about the war in Iraq, hundreds of thousands of State Department cables and assessment briefs of Guantanamo Bay detainees using his WikiLeaks website.</p><p>Court documents revealing Assange's plea deal were filed Monday evening in the U.S. District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. territory in the Pacific Ocean. Assange was expected to make an appearance in that court and to be sentenced to 62 months, with credit for time served in British prison, meaning he would be free to return to Australia, where he was born.</p><p>Assange has been <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/wikileaks-julian-assange-extradition-appeal-espionage-london-court-rcna153007" target="_blank">held</a> in the high-security Belmarsh Prison on the outskirts of London for five years and previously spent seven years in self-exile at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London — <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-fathered-two-children-embassy-partner-says-n1182151" target="_blank">where he reportedly fathered two children</a> — until his asylum was withdrawn and he was forcibly <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-arrested-police-london-n991236" target="_blank">carried out of the embassy</a> and arrested in April 2019.

In March, the High Court in London <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/julian-assange-wikileaks-win-appeal-extradition-us-spy-charges-rcna139519" target="_blank">gave him permission</a> for a full hearing on his appeal as he sought assurances that he could rely upon the First Amendment at a trial in the United States.

A hearing on the issue of Assange's free speech rights had been <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/wikileaks-assange-extradition-appeal-heard-month-rcna156499" target="_blank">scheduled</a> for July 9-10.</p><p>Assange's WikiLeaks also <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/wikileaks-julian-assange-no-proof-hacked-dnc-emails-came-russia-n616541" target="_blank">published</a> hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee that upended the 2016 presidential race.

At a joint news conference with then-President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin days later, Trump contradicted the indictment and the intelligence community, saying that Putin was "<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-putin-questions-abound-ahead-helsinki-meeting-n891606" target="_blank">extremely strong and powerful in his denial</a>" that Russians interfered in the 2016 election to help him win.</p><p>Manning was sentenced to 35 years in a military prison, but <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/president-obama-commutes-chelsea-manning-s-sentence-n708046" target="_blank">her sentence was commuted by Obama</a> in the final days of his presidency in 2017.

<p>Bill Atkinson worked mostly at home, but whenever he made significant progress he rushed in to Apple to show it off to anyone who would appreciate it.   This time, he visited the Macintosh offices at Texaco Towers to show off his brand new oval routines, which were implemented using a really clever algorithm.</p><p>

	Bill had added new code to QuickDraw (which was still called LisaGraf at this point) to draw circles and ovals very quickly.  That was a bit hard to do on the Macintosh, since the math for circles usually involved taking square roots, and the 68000 processor in the Lisa and Macintosh didn't support floating point operations.  But Bill had come up with a clever way to do the circle calculation that only used addition and subtraction, not even multiplication or division, which the 68000 could do, but was kind of slow at.</p><p>

	Bill's technique used the fact the sum of a sequence of odd numbers is always the next perfect square (For example, 1 + 3 = 4, 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16, etc).  So he could figure out when to bump the dependent coordinate value by iterating in a loop until a threshold was exceeded.  This allowed QuickDraw to draw ovals very quickly.</p><p>

	Bill fired up his demo and it quickly filled the Lisa screen with randomly-sized ovals, faster than you thought was possible.  But something was bothering Steve Jobs.  "Well, circles and ovals are good, but how about drawing rectangles with rounded corners?  Can we do that now, too?"</p><p>

	"No, there's no way to do that.  In fact it would be really hard to do, and I don't think we really need it".  I think Bill was a little miffed that Steve wasn't raving over the fast ovals and still wanted more.</p><p>

	Steve suddenly got more intense.  "Rectangles with rounded corners are everywhere! Just look around this room!". And sure enough, there were lots of them, like the whiteboard and some of the desks and tables.  Then he pointed out the window.  "And look outside, there's even more, practically everywhere you look!".  He even persuaded Bill to take a quick walk around the block with him, pointing out every rectangle with rounded corners that he could find.</p><p>

        When Steve and Bill passed a no-parking sign with rounded corners, it did the trick.  "OK, I give up", Bill pleaded.  "I'll see if it's as hard as I thought."  He went back home to work on it.</p><p>

        Bill returned to Texaco Towers the following afternoon, with a big smile on his face.  His demo was now drawing rectangles with beautifully rounded corners blisteringly fast, almost at the speed of plain rectangles.  When he added the code to LisaGraf, he named the new primitive "RoundRects".   Over the next few months, roundrects worked their way into various parts of the user interface, and soon became indispensable.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
                                                                        <p><img alt="The Microsoft OneDrive Logo" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2022/03/1648728320_onedrive_logo_story.jpg"></p>

<p>Microsoft has made OneDrive slightly more annoying for Windows 11 users. Quietly and without any announcement, the company changed Windows 11's initial setup so that it could turn on the automatic folder backup without asking for it.</p>

<p>Now, those setting up a new Windows computer <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-apparently-hates-it-when-you-switch-from-microsoft-account-to-local-account/">the way Microsoft wants them to</a> (in other words, connected to the internet and signed into a Microsoft account) will get to their desktops with OneDrive already syncing stuff from folders like Desktop Pictures, Documents, Music, and Videos. Depending on how much is stored there, you might end up with a desktop and other folders filled to the brim with shortcuts to various stuff right after finishing a clean Windows installation.</p>

<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/back-up-your-folders-with-onedrive-d61a7930-a6fb-4b95-b28a-6552e77c3057">Automatic folder backup in OneDrive</a> is a very useful feature when used properly and when the user deliberately enables it. However, Microsoft decided that sending a few notification prompts to enable folder backup was not enough, so it just turned the feature on without asking anybody or even letting users know about it, resulting in a flood of Reddit posts about users complaining about what the hell are those green checkmarks next to files and shortcuts on their desktops.</p>

                            <!-- PLACE THIS SECTION INSIDE OF YOUR BODY WHERE YOU WANT THE VIDEO PLAYER TO RENDER -->
            <p>If you do not want your computer to back up everything on your desktop or other folders, here is how to turn the feature off (you can also set up Windows 11 in offline mode):</p>

<ol>
<li>Right-click the OneDrive icon in the tray area, click the settings icon and then press Settings.</li>
	<li>Go to the "Sync and Backup" tab and click "Manage backup."</li>
	<li>Turn off all the folders you do not want to back up in OneDrive and confirm the changes.</li>
	<li>If you have an older OneDrive version with the classic tabbed interface, go to the Backup tab and click Manage Backup &gt; Stop backup &gt; Stop backup.</li>
</ol>
<p>Microsoft is no stranger to shady tricks with its software and operating system. Several months ago, we noticed that <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-wont-let-you-close-onedrive-in-windows-without-you-explaining-it-first/">OneDrive would not let you close it</a> without you explaining the reason first (<a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-backtracks-no-longer-asks-to-explain-closing-onedrive-on-windows-10-and-11/">Microsoft later reverted that stupid change</a>). A similar thing <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-now-wants-you-to-take-a-poll-before-installing-google-chrome/">was also spotted in the Edge browser</a>, with Microsoft asking users why they downloaded Chrome.</p>

<p>As a reminder, you can always just uninstall OneDrive and call it a day.</p>
                        
                        
                                                                    </div></div>]]></description>

<p><span>During Flannery O’Connor’s</span> childhood, the future author had a creative way of weeding out any unsatisfactory playmates who had been chosen by her mother as respectable society. O’Connor would read <em>Grimms’ Fairy Tales</em> aloud to her guests. Some were too frightened by the stories to ever return to the O’Connor house in Savannah (which suited their hostess just fine). Any girl who loved the fairy tales passed young O’Connor’s&nbsp;test. A kindred spirit had been found.</p>
<p>Classic fairy tales aren’t for the faint of heart. It’s not hard to see their influence on O’Connor’s disturbing and shocking southern gothic fiction that includes such horrors as serial killers waiting by the side of rural roads, ready to murder selfish grandmothers. The stories compiled by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm include their fair share of violence and twisted crimes: men who chop young women up into pieces, a father who lusts after his own daughter, and many, many characters who make deals with the devil himself. Today children are often only familiar with sanitized versions of the Grimm Brothers’ stories.</p>

<p>Hans Christian Andersen’s classic fairy tales have also been adjusted over the years for a more sensitive audience. When I found his version of “The Little Mermaid”<em> </em>at the library as a young girl, I was surprised but fascinated by the stark differences from the Disney film. The prince in Andersen’s<em> </em>“The Little Mermaid” marries someone else. And the mermaid’s bargain with the sea-witch results in a desperate choice: die when the sun rises after his wedding night or murder her beloved in his bridal chamber. While there are moments of suspense and danger in Disney’s <em>The Little Mermaid</em>, it’s hard to imagine bubbly Ariel with her bouncing red bangs and a knife in hand, trying to decide whether to fatally stab lovable himbo Prince Eric. Such a dark scene, although not uncommon in the realm of classic fairy tales, would have been considered too distressing for young viewers. In an effort to make the story more palatable, Disney’s <em>Cinderella </em>does not include the details of Cinderella’s stepsisters chopping off their heels and toes to fit their bloody, mutilated feet into the glass slipper in greedy pursuit of the throne or getting their eyes pecked out by birds in a final stroke of justice, as the Grimms’ version describes. But is this Disneyfication of these tales a good or a bad thing?</p>
<p>Fairy tales are stories that are told to children and set in a world of magic. As twentieth-century educator <a href="https://www.plough.com/en/authors/a/annemarie-waechter-arnold">Annemarie Wächter</a>&nbsp;put it, “Children and fairy tales are inseparable – one cannot be imagined without the other.” Fairy tales are beloved by children partly because they are tales of <em>action</em>. Rather than revolving around the inner thoughts and motivations of nuanced characters, they are concerned with <em>what happens next</em>, what the characters (often archetypes) <em>do</em>. They are more than mere fables with a snappy moral (think Aesop) because their meaning transcends clearcut lessons. Instead, they are full of mystery. There is room inside these tales for the child to explore fairyland: a strange and dangerous world in which she can practice overcoming her fears by journeying alongside the hero. And at the end of the tale, everything is set right. As Wächter puts it, “Fairy tales can often be brutal and cruel – people and animals die – and yet, despite everything, the positive powers always win. There can be no other ending.”</p>
<p>Fairy tales take both evil and goodness quite seriously. In other words, they are truthful. As Madeleine L’Engle claimed, “The world of fairy tale, fantasy, myth, is inimical to the secular world, and in total opposition to it, for it is interested not in limited laboratory proofs, but in truth.” And in their embrace of truth, fairy tales wrestle with darkness and end in triumph. But are we willing to tell children the truth by reading them fairy tales, as Flannery O’Connor did to her playmates? It seems that these days we are more comfortable if we alter them either by&nbsp; softening the darkness in the story or, as we see in much young adult literature, rejecting the possibility of happily ever after.</p>
<p><span>Disney’s <em>Cinderella </em>does not include the details of Cinderella’s stepsisters chopping off their heels and toes to fit their bloody, mutilated feet into the glass slipper in greedy pursuit of the throne or getting their eyes pecked out by birds in a final stroke of justice, as the Grimms’ version describes. But is this Disneyfication of these tales a good or a bad thing?</span></p>
<p>While protecting the innocence of children by sheltering them from overly gruesome material is something all good parents seek to do, have we swung so far in our attempt to protect children that we don’t tell stories that help them process dark things? While we haven’t always been so leery of the violence in fairy tales, in this strange age we subject our children to drills at their schools to prepare them for active shooters in the classroom but consider them too fragile to be told stories that take evil and death seriously. Is this sheltering from the classic grit of fairy tales benefiting them, or are these just the sort of stories they need to be able to endure the violence that hangs like a shadow over our world?</p>
<p>The fairy tale acknowledges that parents do not always love and care for their children as they ought, that loved ones die and leave us alone and grieving, that evil is real and often powerful, and that violence and sin are present in our world. All these truths make grownups uncomfortable; we are eager to smooth over a child’s fears with comforting falsehoods. “Don’t worry, nothing is going to happen to me,” a mother might say when her child is distraught at the thought of her mortality. But the child knows that sometimes mothers die and his mother is no different. Children are wise enough to be afraid of death, loss, and danger – after all, these are frightening things. The question is whether we allow them to wrestle well with these fears or not. British writer G. K. Chesterton famously wrote, “The baby has known the dragon intimately ever since he had an imagination. What the fairy tale provides for him is a Saint George to kill the dragon.” If we spend our efforts trying to convince a child that the dragons of life can’t hurt him, we not only fail to tell the truth, we fail to show him that dragons do not have the last word. And the child longs to be equipped to face the monsters he fears, whether dragons or death.</p>
<p><span>While classic fairy tales</span> are maligned by some for being too realistic and unsettling in acknowledging the reality of evil, they are also criticized for being too<em> un</em>realistic for their final hopeful resolutions. “I won’t read my daughter fairy tales!” I’ve been told by concerned parents. “She might think Prince Charming is coming to save her and she’ll only be disappointed when she wakes up to the <em>real world</em>.” These critics are willing to leave the dragon in the story but want to remove Saint&nbsp;George. The endings of classic fairy tales are considered too rosy for a child’s consumption. Perhaps robbing young children of the world of fairyland where they can face the monsters they fear results in an inevitable overcorrection, as the explosion of dystopian YA fiction might suggest. Many such books see the world through a lens of despair, defeat, and mistrust, overrun with dragons with no Saint&nbsp;George in sight. A belief that despair is the only realistic response to the nature of the world leads to narratives like <em>Game of Thrones,</em> which presents a universe where there is neither good nor evil, just the unquenchable thirst for power that motivates every soul.</p>
<p>Even in stories for younger kids – A Series of Unfortunate Events, for example – we see the fairy tale turned on its head. In this series the orphaned Baudelaire children are never given the happily ever after they deserve. In <em>Grimms’ Fairy Tales</em> the heroes or heroines sometimes encounter helpers along the way, or they might meet manipulators or liars. In this they are realistic. And there is the understanding that the world is not merely dark; both good and evil people inhabit it, but there are some worth trusting. But the Baudelaires can trust no one. The adults they encounter are either too weak to help them or are secretly trying to harm them. Another trend of subverted fairy tale is the apologia for a villain, such as Disney’s <em>Maleficent, </em>in which the evil sorceress becomes the sympathetic victim. In these stories both evil <em>and</em> goodness are removed from the tale. The villain’s evil is explained away, the hero’s goodness revealed to be a farce. And yet, while these kinds of stories are undeniably popular, it is notable that the series that has recently captured the imagination of children (and even adults) most deeply is a modern fairy tale that includes both wrestling with evil and death and a happily ever after: J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter<em>, </em>a story, like <em>Grimms’ Fairy Tales</em>, with an indisputably Christian framework.</p>
<p><span>Every human being</span> understands the world and his place in it through narratives. God wires us to be formed by story; Jesus himself tells parables to teach his disciples. It is of the highest importance that we consider what stories we are telling our young people. What character do they think they are in the story of their lives? And what kind of world is their story set in? Is it a world in which greed and power will be ultimately triumphant? Is it a world in which love and goodness hold any sway? Could the dread that seems to plague our young people be not merely a reaction to the brokenness of our world but our failure to communicate that the universe will ultimately be set right as both fairy tales and the gospel promise? After all, as the theologian Vigen Guroian beautifully puts it in his fantastic book <em><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bookshop.org/a/78/9780195384314" target="_blank">Tending the Heart of Virtue</a></em>, “Fairy tales lead us toward a belief in something that, if it were not also so veiled in a mystery, common sense alone would affirm: if there is a story, there must surely be a storyteller.” And in this lies our deepest hope.</p>
<p><spa>The fairy tale acknowledges that parents do not always love and care for their children as they ought, that loved ones die and leave us alone and grieving, that evil is real and often powerful, and that violence and sin are present in our world. All these truths make grownups uncomfortable; we are eager to smooth over a child’s fears with comforting falsehoods.</spa></p>
<p>To combat both the anxiety that comes to children robbed of the space to confront evil and the despair that holds that the last chapter of humanity’s tale is final defeat, we have to offer truer stories. Early in life, children need to be steeped in fairy tales that don’t gloss over the dark and ugly parts of the world. Children are wise; they reject the false advertising of cheap positive thinking for the real prize of hard-won hope. For a message of hope to be received, it must be hope that shines in darkness, hope that breaks the witch’s spell. “It is the mark of a good fairy-story,” J. R. R. Tolkien writes in his essay “On Fairy-Stories,” “that however wild its events, however fantastic or terrible the adventures, it can give to child or man that hears it, when the ‘turn’ comes, a catch of the breath, a beat and lifting of the heart, near to (or indeed accompanied by) tears.” But to tell such stories, we have to believe they are true. If we grown-ups don’t believe there is, as Tolkien calls it, “joy beyond the walls of the world,” then our children will not believe us when we share fairy tales that end with hope. And if we offer narratives of a world without hope, our stories are no better than the sanitized tales that refuse to acknowledge mortality and evil. They are simply a different way of failing to tell the whole truth.</p>
<p>But happily ever afters may be difficult to envision without an eternal perspective. At the end of Andersen’s story, the little mermaid loses her life and her body disintegrates into sea foam on the surface of the waves. But her sacrifice for her beloved is rewarded by the chance to gain a human soul and therefore to experience eternal life. This ending is only hopeful accompanied by a belief in an afterlife, just as Flannery O’Connor’s “A Good Man Is Hard to Find” only ends “happily” with a salvific outpouring of grace if we see eternal hope for the murdered grandmother. Perhaps it’s the loss of this eternal perspective that prevents us from seeing beyond darkness to hope.</p>
<p>“Deprive children of stories,” warns philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre, “and you leave them unscripted, anxious stutterers in their actions as in their words.” Like Hansel and Gretel leaving their little white pebbles along their path into the dark forest, the next generation needs us to provide them with touchstones that can keep them from getting lost on their journey and help them find their way back home. These pathfinders are the stories they’re told, stories that light up the dark, that reveal the existence of dragons hiding in the caves of life, and remind us that Saint George will be ultimately triumphant, even when it seems all hope is lost.</p>

Not only would it seem that Bette Santini does not exist, but there is no possible way to purchase or even locate </span><em>A Girl’s Quest for Healthy Eating</em><span>, outside the Kindle app.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>And then things got spooky.

Like a spot-the-difference </span><em>Highlights</em><span> game, here was the same book with minor discrepancies. This cover featured several little girls, presumably all on healthy eating quests of their own. The page count was slightly different. And most distressing of all, the author's name: Bette Santini</span><em>r</em><span>. In other words, Santini plus R. Where had I seen this name before?

The real question is this: Where do these books come from? Is someone out there generating piles of content via A.I. and trying to turn micro-profits by gaming the Kindle marketplace and placing ads?

Such as helping Ethan, some random dumbass at school who is struggling with his grades. By having access to his thoughts, Olivia is able to identify what exactly he’s struggling with, which “made tutoring sessions more productive.” The next day, the robot Lynnell Gorshteyny has forgotten that the main character is named Olivia. “Next, they helped their classmate, Olivia, who was dealing with a fallout with her best friend. Olivia could perceive both sides of the argument.”&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever. You get the point. The book goes on and on, reminding us over and over of the power of empathy: that we must empathize with each other, that we must be empathetic towards each other, and how “most importantly, Olivia is an empath now.” In fact, the word empathy is mentioned 10 times in 35 pages. Every time I thought I had reached the book’s natural conclusion – “Her powers were gone, but she was also glad for the silence.” Big sigh. We’ve done it. – I would turn the page only to learn once again that “Olivia’s journey as a mind reader taught her valuable lessons.”&nbsp;</p><p>But what about the valuable lessons I’ve learned? Well, as of this morning, I’ve started receiving ads for a different genre of AI reads.

If only so that, in a couple of years from now, in a time that feels both immeasurably far but that I’m aware will arrive sooner than I can imagine, my son and I will snuggle up together in his bed, we will open up his personal tablet, and I will read him several Bedtime Story before he drifts sweetly off to sleep.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62f6b1c7-fc7e-4901-8e9c-57562d681cd3_920x1224.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62f6b1c7-fc7e-4901-8e9c-57562d681cd3_920x1224.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62f6b1c7-fc7e-4901-8e9c-57562d681cd3_920x1224.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62f6b1c7-fc7e-4901-8e9c-57562d681cd3_920x1224.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62f6b1c7-fc7e-4901-8e9c-57562d681cd3_920x1224.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62f6b1c7-fc7e-4901-8e9c-57562d681cd3_920x1224.png" width="534" height="710.4521739130435" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/62f6b1c7-fc7e-4901-8e9c-57562d681cd3_920x1224.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1224,&quot;width&quot;:920,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:534,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62f6b1c7-fc7e-4901-8e9c-57562d681cd3_920x1224.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62f6b1c7-fc7e-4901-8e9c-57562d681cd3_920x1224.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62f6b1c7-fc7e-4901-8e9c-57562d681cd3_920x1224.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62f6b1c7-fc7e-4901-8e9c-57562d681cd3_920x1224.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2024/06/24/ntpd-rs-deployment.html">https://letsencrypt.org/2024/06/24/ntpd-rs-deployment.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40778594">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	
	<article>
		<p>When we look at the general security posture of Let’s Encrypt, one of the things that worries us most is how much of the operating system and network infrastructure is written in unsafe languages like C and C++. The <a href="https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder">CA software</a> itself is written in memory safe Golang, but from our server operating systems to our network equipment, lack of memory safety routinely leads to vulnerabilities that need patching.</p>
<p>Partially for the sake of Let’s Encrypt, and partially for the sake of the wider Internet, we started a new project called <a href="https://www.memorysafety.org/">Prossimo</a> in 2020. Prossimo’s goal is to make some of the most critical software infrastructure for the Internet memory safe. Since then we’ve invested in a range of software components including the <a href="https://github.com/rustls/rustls/">Rustls TLS library</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns">Hickory DNS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/memorysafety/river">River reverse proxy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/memorysafety/sudo-rs">sudo-rs</a>, <a href="https://rust-for-linux.com/">Rust support for the Linux kernel</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/pendulum-project/ntpd-rs">ntpd-rs</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s Encrypt has now taken a step that was a long time in the making: we’ve deployed <a href="https://github.com/pendulum-project/ntpd-rs">ntpd-rs</a>, the first piece of memory safe software from Prossimo that has made it into the Let’s Encrypt infrastructure.</p>
<p>Most operating systems use the Network Time Protocol (NTP) to accurately determine what time it is. Keeping track of time is a critical task for an operating system, and since it involves interacting with the Internet it’s important to make sure NTP implementations are secure.</p>
<p>In April of 2022, Prossimo started work on a memory safe and generally more secure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol">NTP</a> implementation called <a href="https://github.com/pendulum-project/ntpd-rs">ntpd-rs</a>. Since then, the implementation has matured and is now maintained by <a href="https://github.com/pendulum-project">Project Pendulum</a>. In April of 2024 ntpd-rs was deployed to the Let’s Encrypt staging environment, and as of now it’s in production.</p>
<p>Over the next few years we plan to continue replacing C or C++ software with memory safe alternatives in the Let’s Encrypt infrastructure: OpenSSL and its derivatives with <a href="https://www.memorysafety.org/initiative/rustls/">Rustls</a>, our DNS software with <a href="https://www.memorysafety.org/initiative/dns/">Hickory</a>, Nginx with <a href="https://www.memorysafety.org/initiative/reverse-proxy/">River</a>, and sudo with <a href="https://www.memorysafety.org/initiative/sudo-su/">sudo-rs</a>. Memory safety is just part of the overall security equation, but <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/oncd/briefing-room/2024/02/26/press-release-technical-report/">it’s an important part</a> and we’re glad to be able to make these improvements.</p>
<p>We depend on contributions from our community of users and supporters in order to provide our services. If your company or organization would like to <a href="https://www.abetterinternet.org/sponsor/">sponsor</a> Let’s Encrypt please email us at <a href="mailto:sponsor@letsencrypt.org">sponsor@letsencrypt.org</a>. We ask that you make an <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/donate/">individual contribution</a> if it is within your means.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                        <p>NEW YORK (AP) — Car dealerships in North America continue to wrestle with major disruptions that started last week with cyberattacks on a software company used widely in the auto retail sales sector. </p><p>CDK Global, a company that provides software for thousands of auto dealers in the U.S. and Canada, was hit by back-to-back cyberattacks Wednesday. That led to an outage that has continued to impact operations.</p><p>For prospective car buyers, that’s meant delays at dealerships or vehicle orders written up by hand. There’s no immediate end in sight, with CDK saying it expects the restoration process to take “several days” to complete.</p><p>On Monday, Group 1 Automotive Inc., a $4 billion automotive retailer, said that it continued to use “alternative processes” to sell cars to its customers. </p><p>Here is what you need to know. </p><h2>What is CDK Global?</h2><p>CDK Global is a major player in the auto sales industry. The company, based just outside of Chicago in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, provides software technology to dealers that helps with day-to-day operations — like facilitating vehicle sales, financing, insurance and repairs.</p>
    

<p>CDK serves more than 15,000 retail locations across North America, according to the company.</p>



<h2>What happened last week?</h2><p>CDK experienced back-to-back cyberattacks on Wednesday. The company shut down all of its systems out of an abundance of caution, spokesperson Lisa Finney said last week.</p><p>“We have begun the restoration process,” Finney said in an update over the weekend — noting that the company had launched an investigation into the “cyber incident” with third-party experts and notified law enforcement.</p>
    
<p>“Based on the information we have at this time, we anticipate that the process will take several days to complete, and in the interim we are continuing to actively engage with our customers and provide them with alternate ways to conduct business,” she added.</p><p>In messages to its customers, the company has also warned of “bad actors” posing as members or affiliates of CDK to try to obtain system access by contacting customers. It urged them to be cautious of any attempted phishing.</p>
    

<p>The incident bore all the hallmarks of a ransomware attack, in which targets are asked to pay a ransom to access encrypted files. But CDK declined to comment directly — neither confirming or denying if it had received a ransom demand.</p><h2>Are impacted dealerships still selling cars?</h2><p>Several major auto companies — including Stellantis, Ford and BMW — confirmed to The Associated Press last week that the CDK outage had impacted some of their dealers, but that sales operations continue.</p><p>In light of the ongoing situation, a spokesperson for Stellantis said Friday that many dealerships had switched to manual processes to serve customers. That includes writing up orders by hand. </p><p>A Ford spokesperson added that the outage may cause “some delays and inconveniences at some dealers and for some customers.” However, many Ford and Lincoln customers are still getting sales and service support through alternative routes being used at dealerships. </p><p>Group 1 Automotive Inc., which owns 202 automotive dealerships, 264 franchises, and 42 collision centers in the U.S. and the United Kingdom, said Monday that the incident has disrupted its business applications and processes in its U.S. operations that rely on CDK’s dealers’ systems. The company said that it took measures to protect and isolate its systems from CDK’s platform.</p>
    

<p>All Group 1 U.S. dealerships will continue to conduct business using alternative processes until CDK’s dealers’ systems are available, the company said Monday. Group 1’s dealerships in the U.K. don’t use CDK’s dealers’ systems and are not impacted by the incident.</p><p>With many details of the cyberattacks still unclear, customer privacy is also at top of mind — especially with little known about what information may have been compromised this week.</p><p>Cybersecurity experts have stressed that consumers connected to CDK (or a CDK-affilated dealership) should assume that their data may have been breached. Those impacted should monitor their credit — or even consider <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/buyline-personal-finance/article/how-to-freeze-your-credit">freezing their credit</a></span> as an added layer of defense — and be wary of any suspicious phishing messages.</p>
    

<p>In a statement last week, Mike Stanton, president and CEO of the National Automobile Dealers Association, said “dealers are very committed to protecting their customer information” and were seeking updates from CDK to determine the scope of impact “so they can respond appropriately.”</p>

<p>Some time ago, Hillel Wayne published an article titled
<a href="https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/microfeatures-id-like-to-see-in-more-languages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Microfeatures I’d like to see in more languages</em><svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
In this article, he described three kinds of features in <em>programming languages</em>:
fundamental features, deeply engrained features, and nice-to-have convenience features.
Hillel’s premise was that language designers tend to focus on the first two;
however, because the convenience features are relatively low-overhead, it’s
easier for them to jump between projects, and they provide a quality-of-life
increase.</p>
<p>I’ve been running a blog for a while — some of the oldest posts I’ve found
(which are no longer reflected on this site due to their low quality) were from
2015. In this time, I’ve been on the lookout for ways to improve the site,
and I’ve seen quite a few little things that are nice to use, but relatively
easy to implement. They don’t really make or break a website; the absence of
such features might be noticed, but will not cause any disruption for the reader.
On the other hand, their presence serves as a QoL enhancement. I find these to be
analogous to Hillel’s notion of “microfeatures”. If you’re interested in adding
something to your site, consider browsing this menu to see if anything resonates!</p>
<p>One last thing is that this post is not necessarily about microfeatures
I’d like <em>every</em> blog or personal website to have. Some ideas I present
here are only well-suited to certain types of content and certain written
voices. They need not be applied indiscriminately.</p>
<p>With that, let’s get started!</p>
<h3 id="sidenotes">Sidenotes</h3>
<p><a href="https://gwern.net/me" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gwern<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a> is, in my view, the king of sidenotes.
Gwern’s writing makes very heavy use of them (at least based on the articles
that I’ve read). This is where I originally got inspiration for
<a href="https://danilafe.com/blog/sidenotes/">my own implementation in Hugo</a>. Check out the page
on <a href="https://gwern.net/hydrocephalus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hydrocephalus<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a> for an example; Here’s what
a piece of that page looks like on my end at the time of writing:</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/gwern-sidenotes.png" alt="A screenshot of Gwern's page on hydrocephalus. The main article text is accompanied by notes in both the left and right margin."><figcaption>
      <p>A screenshot of Gwern’s page on hydrocephalus</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Sidenotes are nice because they allow for diversions without interrupting
the main article’s flow. You can provide additional details for the curious
reader, or — <a href="https://gwern.net/hydrocephalus#sn4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as Gwern does<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a> —
use the sidenotes for citing studies or sources. In either case, the reading
experience is significantly more pleasant that footnotes, for which you typically
have to go to the bottom of the page, and then return to the top.</p>
<p>Another reason I called Gwern the “king of sidenotes” is
<a href="https://gwern.net/sidenote" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this page on sidenotes<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>. There, Gwern documents
numerous approaches to this feature, mostly inspired by <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tufte CSS<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
The page is very thorough — it even includes a link to my own work, as unknown
as it may be! I would recommend checking it out if you are interested in
enhancing your site with sidenotes.</p>
<h3 id="tables-of-contents">Tables of Contents</h3>
<p>Not all personal sites include tables of contents (TOCs), but they are nice.
They serve two purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Seeing at a glance what the post will be about, in the form of headings.</li>
<li>Being able to navigate to an interesting part of the page without
having to scroll.</li>
</ol>
<p>Static site generators (I myself use <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hugo<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>) are
typically able to generate TOCs automatically, since they are already generating
the HTML and know what headings they are inserting into the page. For instance,
Hugo has <a href="https://gohugo.io/methods/page/tableofcontents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>TableOfContents</code><svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
I suspect the same is true for other existing website technologies.</p>
<p>Despite this, I actually had to look relatively long to find sites I frequent that have
TOCs to show off as examples here. The first one I came across — after Gwern’s,
whose site will be mentioned plenty in this post anyway — is <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Faster than Lime<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
Take this post on <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles/understanding-rust-futures-by-going-way-too-deep" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rust’s Futures<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>;
this is what the top of it looks like at the time of writing:</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/fasterthanlime-toc.png" alt="A screenshot of the table of contents on Faster than Lime. A box with the word &quot;Contents&quot; contains links to several sections on the page bellow (off screen)"><figcaption>
      <p>A screenshot of the table of contents on Faster than Lime</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The quality and value of TOCs certainly depends on the
sections within the page itself — and whether or not the page has sections
at all! — but in my opinion, the benefits to navigation become apparent even
for relatively simple pages.</p>
<p>As an honorable mention, I’d like to show <a href="https://lars.hupel.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lars Hupel’s site<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
The pages on the site don’t — as far as I can tell — have <em>internal</em> tables
of contents. However, pages that are part of a series — such as
the <a href="https://lars.hupel.info/topics/crdt/01-intro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">introduction to CRDTs<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a> —
have tables of contents that span the entire series.</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/lars-toc.png" alt="A screenshot of the table of contents on Lars Hupel's site. A box with the words &quot;Series Navigation&quot; contains links to several other pages in the series."><figcaption>
      <p>A screenshot of the table of contents on Lars Hupel’s site</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I also find this very nice, though it does miss out on headings within a page.</p>
<h4 id="bonus-showing-page-progress">Bonus: Showing Page Progress</h4>
<p>I’ve mentioned that tables of contents can communicate the structure of the
page. However, they do so from the outset, before you’ve started reading.
In their “base form”, the reader stops benefiting from tables of contents
<span>
<label for="jump-top-note">once they've started reading.</label>
<span><span>[note:</span>
That is, of course, unless they jump back to the top of the post and
find the table of contents again.
<span>]</span>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>If you want to show progress while the reader is somewhere in the middle
of a page, you could use a page progress bar. I’ve noticed one while
reading <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quanta Magazine<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>; it looks like
this (recording my scrolling through
the <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-the-square-root-of-2-became-a-number-20240621/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most recent article at the time of writing<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>).</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/quanta-scroll.gif" alt="The progress bar on a Quanta Magazine article. As the page scrolls, an orange bar at the top gradually fills up from left to right."><figcaption>
      <p>The progress bar on a Quanta Magazine article</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>One immediate thought is that this is completely superseded by the regular
browser scroll bar that’s ever-present at the side of the page. However,
the scroll bar could be deceiving. If your page has a comments section,
the comments could make the page look dauntingly long. Similarly, references
to other pages and general “footer material” count towards the scroll bar,
but would not count towards the progress bar.</p>
<p>Combining the two, you could imagine an always-visible table of contents
that highlights the current section you’re in. With such a feature, you
can always see where you are (including a rough estimate of how far into
the page you’ve scrolled), and at the same time see how the current section
integrates into the broader structure. I’ve seen this done before, but could
not find a site off the top of my head that implements the feature; as a
fallback, here’s the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/sticky-table-of-contents-with-scrolling-active-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSS tricks tutorial<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>
that shows how to implement a dynamic table of contents, and a recording
of me scrolling through it:</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/csstricks-toc.gif" alt="The table of contents from a CSS Tricks demo. As the page scrolls, the current section in the table of contents becomes bold."><figcaption>

</figure>

<h3 id="easily-linkable-headings">Easily Linkable Headings</h3>
<p>How can you link a particular section of a page to your friend? There’s a
well-defined mechanism to do this in HTML: you can use the ID of a particular
HTML element, and add it as <code>#some-id</code> to the end of a link to the page. The
link then takes the user to that particular HTML element. I can do this,
for instance, to link to the <a href="#sidenotes">sidenotes section above<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#arrow-up"></use>
</svg></a>.</p>
<p>How does one discover the ID of the part of the page that they want to
link to? The ID is not a “visual” property; it’s not displayed to the user,
and is rather a detail of HTML itself. Thus, on any given page, even
if every element has a unique, linkable ID, I can’t make use of it without
going into <strong>Inspect Element</strong> and trying to find the ID in the HTML tree.</p>
<p id="linked-paragraph">The simple solution is to make the elements that you want to be easily “linkable”
into links to themselves! Then, the user can right-click
the element in question (probably the heading) and click <strong>Copy Link</strong>.
Much easier! To demonstrate a similar idea, <a href="#linked-paragraph">here is a link to this paragraph itself</a>.
You can now use the context menu to <strong>Copy Link</strong>, put it in your browser,
and voilà — you’re right back here!</p>
<p>As with <a href="#tables-of-contents">tables of contents<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#arrow-up"></use>
</svg></a>, many website technologies
provide most of the tooling to add support for this feature. Relatively
often I come across pages that have unique IDs for each header, but no clickable
links! I end up having to use inspect element to find the anchor points.</p>
<p>A variation on this idea — if you don’t want to make the entire heading or title
a link — is to include alongside it (before or after) a clickable element
that is a link to that title. You can click that element to retrieve link
information, instead (and the icon additionally tells you that this is possible).
Hugo’s documentation does this: here’s a screenshot of
<a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/markdown-attributes/#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an arbitrary page<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/hugo-titlelink.png" alt="A title and paragraph from the Hugo documentation. Next to the title there is a blue link symbol."><figcaption>

<h3 id="grouping-series-of-posts">Grouping Series of Posts</h3>
<p>Some authors like to write at length on a particular topic; to get the
content out to readers faster (and to make the resulting pages less daunting),
it makes sense to break a single topic up into a series. The easiest way
to do this is to just… publish several articles, possibly with related
names, and link them to each other. Done!</p>
<p>With a little more effort, though, the series-reading and series-writing
experience could be nicer. Instead of manually inserting links, you
could configure your website to automatically add a “next” and “previous”
button to pages in a given series. You could also give an overview of a particular
series and create a “navigation hub” for it.</p>
<p>As an example, the <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chapel language blog<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a> has navigation
buttons. Here’s a screenshot from <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/blog/posts/aoc2022-day09-elvish-string-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post in the Advent of Code series<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>:</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/chapel-seriesnav.png" alt="Series navigation buttons on a Chapel blog post. There are two buttons; one links to a previous page in the series, another links to the next."><figcaption>
      <p>Series navigation buttons on a Chapel blog post</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I’ve mentioned this in the section on <a href="#tables-of-contents">tables of contents<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#arrow-up"></use>
</svg></a>,
but <a href="https://lars.hupel.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lars Hupel’s site<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a> has tables of contents
that link between series. I’m not sure if it’s automatically generated
or hand-written, but it’s definitely nice.</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/lars-toc.png" alt="A screenshot of the table of contents on Lars Hupel's site. A box with the words &quot;Series Navigation&quot; contains links to several other pages in the series."><figcaption>
      <p>A screenshot of the table of contents on Lars Hupel’s site</p>

</figure>

<h3 id="dialogues">Dialogues</h3>
<p>I first came across dialogues on <a href="https://xeiaso.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xe Iaso’s site<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>,
but I think I see them used most often in posts on <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Faster than Lime<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
As an example, here’s a little dialogue on <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles/understanding-rust-futures-by-going-way-too-deep#it-s-waiting-for-the-first-one-to-finish" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post about Rust’s futures<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
At the time of writing, it looks like this:</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/fasterthanlime-dialogue.png" alt="A dialogue with &quot;cool bear&quot; on Faster than Lime. The page contains chat bubbles that alternate between a bear character and the author."><figcaption>
      <p>A dialogue with “cool bear” on Faster than Lime</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Using dialogues — even for technical writing — is not a particularly novel
idea. I know I’ve seen it in a textbook before; probably
this part of <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/dialogue-virtualization.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
It can help ask questions from a less-experienced point of view, and therefore
possibly voice concerns that a reader might themselves be having. And of course
— as with “cool bear” and Xe Iaso’s <a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many characters<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>
— it can change the tone and make the page a bit more fun.</p>
<h3 id="code-blocks-with-origin">Code Blocks with Origin</h3>
<p>This one was recommended to me by a reader, and so I’ll be talking about
my page specifically!</p>
<p>When I was <a href="https://danilafe.com/series/compiling-a-functional-language-using-c++/">writing about making a compiler</a>,
a reader emailed me and pointed out that they were getting lost in the various
code blocks. My page displayed the code that I was writing about, but the
project had grown beyond a single file. As a result, I’d be making changes
midway through one file at one moment, and another file the next. This
prompted me to add decorators to my code blocks that look
something like this:</p>





<div data-base-path="" data-file-path="patterns/patterns.rb" data-first-line="3" data-last-line="8">
<table><tbody><tr>
<td>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span>3
</span><span>4
</span><span>5
</span><span>6
</span><span>7
</span><span>8
</span></code></pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="Ruby"><span><span><span>def</span> <span>sum_digits</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>while</span> <span>n</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>9</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>n</span> <span>=</span> <span>n</span><span>.</span><span>to_s</span><span>.</span><span>chars</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>:to_i</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>sum</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>end</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>n</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>end</span></span></span></code></pre>
</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
</div>


<p>The decorator says what file the code is from, as well as what lines
are being presented. If you click the file name, the decorator links
to my Gitea instance, allowing you to read the code in context.</p>
<p>Though it’s not quite the same (in particular, it’s unfortunately missing
links), the Crafting Interpreters online book does something similar. It
describes changes to the code in words next to the changed code itself,
like “added after <code>MyStruct</code>”. Here’s a screenshot of the page on
<a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/local-variables.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">local variables<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>
at the time of writing.</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/craftinginterpreters-codenotes.png" alt="Location notes on code in Crafting Interpreters. On the right of code blocks, a margin note describes the file and nature of the change."><figcaption>
      <p>Location notes on code in Crafting Interpreters</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I think it looks quite elegant, and in some ways — specifically in
the verbal descriptions of what each change does — might be superior to my
approach.</p>
<p>It’s not quite the same thing, but <a href="https://gist.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Gists<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>
can help approximate this feature. A Gist could contain multiple files,
and each file can be individually embedded into your page. Hugo in particular has
<a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#gist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in support<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a> for
Gists (and I’ve snagged that link using the docs’ <a href="#easily-linkable-headings">easily linkable headings<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#arrow-up"></use>
</svg></a>);
I suspect that other website engines have some form of support
as well. At the time of writing, an embedded Gist looks something like this:</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/hugo-gist.png" alt="Code embedded in Hugo documentation using a GitHub Gist."><figcaption>
      <p>Code embedded in Hugo documentation using a GitHub Gist</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Clicking <code>list.html</code> takes you to the source code of the file.</p>
<h4 id="bonus-code-blocks-with-clickable-links">Bonus: Code Blocks with Clickable Links</h4>
<p>If we’re going for fancy code blocks, another fancy feature is provided
by the <a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/what-is-agda.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agda programming language<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
Agda can generate HTML code blocks in which every symbol (like a variable,
record name, function name) are linked to where they are defined. So if
you’re reading the code, and wonder “what the heck is <code>x</code>?”, you can just
click it to see how it’s defined.</p>
<p>It’s not simple to integrate Agda’s plain HTML output into an existing
webpage, but some projects do that. I took a stab at it in
my <a href="https://danilafe.com/blog/agda_hugo/">post about integrating it with Hugo</a>.
I wager this would be even harder for other languages. However, it leads
to nice results; my go-to is <a href="https://plfa.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Programming Languages Foundations in Agda<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
The online book introduces various concepts from Programming Language Theory,
and each code block that it shows is fully linked. This makes it possible
to jump around the page like so:</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/plfa-goto.gif" alt="Navigating code blocks on a page from PLFA. I hover over then click a plus sign to see how addition is defined. I then do the same to see how natural numbers are defined."><figcaption>
      <p>Navigating code blocks on a page from PLFA</p>

<h3 id="markers-for-external-links">Markers for External Links</h3>
<p>Some sites I’ve seen mark links that go to a different domain with
a little icon. If you’ve read this far, you’ve likely noticed that my
site does the same. Another good example of this — even though the CSS
is little rough at the time of writing — is <a href="https://jamesg.blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James’ Coffee Blog ☕<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
I’ve taken the (small) liberty to adjust the color of the icon, which
I suspect is buggy in my browser.</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/jamesg-external.png" alt="An external link on James' blog. The link is displayed as normal, and an additional diagonal arrow aiming up and to the right and surrounded by a square is displayed to the right of the link text."><figcaption>
      <p>An external link on James’ blog</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Some websites (this one included) also make such links open in a new tab
automatically. That way, you tend to not lose the original article by clicking
through one of its references.</p>
<h4 id="bonus-different-markers-for-different-destinations">Bonus: Different Markers for Different Destinations</h4>
<p><a href="https://gwern.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gwern’s website<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a> takes this idea further, by changing
the icon for external links depending on the destination. For instance,
links to Wikipedia articles are stylized with a little “W”, links to
Haskell.org are stylized using a lambda (<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>λ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>), and links to
<code>.zip</code> files have a little archive icon. There are more; I’ve found
the <a href="https://github.com/gwern/gwern.net/blob/959ba9c50d327a960e07241b2c7f13630bf8b80c/js/old/links.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link processing code on GitHub<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>

and even the <a href="https://github.com/gwern/gwern.net/blob/959ba9c50d327a960e07241b2c7f13630bf8b80c/js/old/links.js#L380-L387" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">list of websites that get their own icons<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
I could not find a verbal description, though.</p>
<p>Now for some pictures. Here are a ton of links from
the <a href="https://gwern.net/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“About”<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a> page!</p>

<h4 id="bonus-link-preview">Bonus: Link Preview</h4>
<p><a href="https://gwern.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gwern’s website<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a> has no shortage of cool ideas. Among
them showing link previews on hover. When hovering over a link, the site
displays a popup window that contains a view into that page. I suspect that
this view is also archived somehow, so that it retains a view into the
page that matches it at the time of writing.</p>
<p>To be perfectly honest, I found this feature a little jarring at first.
As I would try to click links, I would get surprised by an additional overlay.
However, as I spent more time browsing the site, I grew quite accustomed to
the previews. I would hover over a link to see the first paragraph and
thus get a short synopsis. This worked really well in tandem with
<a href="#bonus-different-markers-for-different-destinations">per-destination marker icons<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#arrow-up"></use>
</svg></a>;
I could tell at a glance whether a link was worth hovering over.</p>
<p>Here’s what it looks like:</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/gwern-hover.gif" alt="Hovering over a link on Gwern's site. After the link is hovered over, a rectangular popup displays a section of the Wikipedia page the link goes to. I scroll through the section to the table of contents."><figcaption>

<p>RSS is a feed standard that allows sites to publish updates. Blogs in
particular can make use of RSS to notify readers of updates.
RSS feeds are processed by a feed reader, which is a program that polls
a website’s <code>index.xml</code> file (or other similar files) and reads it to
detect new content. If you opt in to full-text RSS feeds, users can read
the entire post entirely from their reader.</p>
<p>RSS makes it easier to keep up with your site. Rather than having
to check in on every author whose content I enjoy on the internet, I can
add their feed URL to my list, and have my feed reader automatically aggregate
all updates for me to read. It’s kind of like a social media or news feed,
except that I control what’s shown to me, and authors of the blogs I follow
don’t need to create accounts and explicitly share their work on social media!</p>
<p>I don’t have any particular website to show off in this section; instead
I’ll show you a list of websites that I’m following in my feed reader of choice.
You might notice that a lot of these websites are listed here as inspiration
for other microfeatures.</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/feedbin.png" alt="A screenshot of my Feedbin list. Some sites include Hillel Wayne's, Faster than Lime, Drew DeVault, and the Chapel Language Blog"><figcaption>

<h3 id="links-to-other-sites">Links to Other Sites</h3>
<p>This feature I first noticed on Drew DeVault’s blog. Every page on Drew’s
blog, at the bottom, has a section titled “Articles from blogs I read”.
For instance, on <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2024/05/24/2024-05-24-Bunnix.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a sample post<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>,
at the time of writing, I’m seeing the following footer:</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/drew-openring.png" alt="Links to other blogs from Drew DeVault's blog. The links consist of three side-by-side boxes, each with a title and brief excerpt."><figcaption>
      <p>Links to other blogs from Drew DeVault’s blog</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As indicated in the image, Drew’s site in particular uses a program
called <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/openring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>openring</code><svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>, which is based on
RSS feeds (another <a href="#rss-feeds">microfeature I love<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#arrow-up"></use>
</svg></a>). However,
<em>how</em> the site finds such articles (statically like <code>openring</code>, or
on page load using some JavaScript) isn’t hugely important to me. What’s
important is that you’re promoting other content creators whose work
you enjoy, which is the ethos of my favorite slice of the internet.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion--anything-else">Conclusion + Anything Else?</h3>
<p>Those are all the microfeatures that I could think of in a single sitting.
I hope that you have been inspired to integrate features like these into
your own site, or at the very least that you think doing so would be a good idea.</p>
<p>This list isn’t exhaustive. I’ve probably missed some good microfeatures!
If you can think of such a feature, let me know; my email address is linked
in the footer of this article.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading, and cheers!</p>

Prevent the doorbell chime going continuously, the circuit is interrupted by the doorbell button, which acts as a switch. The circuit is only active/complete when the doorbell button is pushed. Hence, your chime turns on when someone pushes the doorbell button.</p><figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="512" src="https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/diy-doorbell-wiring-schema-1024x512.png" alt="Shows an circuit/wiring schema for the DIY Smart doorbell" srcset="https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/diy-doorbell-wiring-schema.png 1024w, https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/diy-doorbell-wiring-schema-300x150.png 300w, https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/diy-doorbell-wiring-schema-768x384.png 768w, https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/diy-doorbell-wiring-schema-720x360.png 720w, https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/diy-doorbell-wiring-schema-580x290.png 580w, https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/diy-doorbell-wiring-schema-320x160.png 320w, https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/diy-doorbell-wiring-schema-800x400.png 800w, https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/diy-doorbell-wiring-schema-600x300.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>DIY Smart doorbell circuit schema</figcaption></figure><p>The image above should give you an idea of the result of this article. Basically, you are going to split your doorbell circuit into two separate circuits. One circuit detects the doorbell button push; the other circuit controls the chime. This split allows for controlling those separately, e.g., detecting a doorbell push from Home Assistant, without activating the chime.</p><p>The device we are using is going to act as a sensor for the doorbell button push, and acts as a switch for the chime. Effectively, we are moving the activation of the chime from the doorbell button, to the new device. Our new device needs power, and since the one used consumes 5 volts. Any old USB phone charger you have, does the job just fine.</p><h2 id="1-smart-doorbell-stuff-youll-need">Smart doorbell stuff you’ll need</h2><p>To achieve this, you need some “stuff”. The $2 price tag is based on the actual device we are going to create, however, if you don’t have some of the needed tools, that would raise the total price. Nevertheless, the additional stuff is really cheap and are things that, in my humble opinion, every DIY home automator should have in their toolbox (for future projects).</p><p>Based on the country you are in, additional shipping costs may apply. I live in the Netherlands, and I’ve paid 1,80EUR in total, including shipping. Checking out the different sites for the right price helps. I’ve noticed the prices for these little boards vary, but getting it for around $2 is doable.</p><h3 id="2-the-main-components">The main components</h3><p>This project consists of just 2 parts. An ESP8266-based chip called the ESP-01S and a small board with a relay on it.</p><div id="ub_feature_box_0c870d0b-ced3-49fc-bf45-3ca5c48b54a4"><div> <p><img decoding="async" src="https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/esp-01s.png" alt="Product image of the ESP-01S chip"></p><p><a href="https://frenck.link/esp-01s-relay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="ESP-01S (opens in a new tab)">ESP-01S</a></p><p><em>The ESP-01S is one of the smallest WiFi boards available, that works ESPHome and Home Assistant.</em><br></p></div><div> <p><img decoding="async" src="https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/esp-01s-relay-module.png" alt="Product image of the ESP-01(s) relay module board"></p><p><a href="https://frenck.link/esp-01s-relay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Relay module (opens in a new tab)">Relay module</a></p><p><em>This relay module board for the ESP-01(S), It comes pre-soldered, and the ESP will just slide on top of it.</em></p></div></div><p>The nice thing about these two is that they fit together, are pre-soldered and often sold together. There is also another version of the ESP chip, without the <strong>S</strong>, the ESP-01. That chip is viable for use as well, however, the ESP-01S is an improved version and has double the amount of memory. Since the price difference is just a couple of cents, I would highly recommend getting the <strong>S</strong> version.</p><p>The board needs to be powered and requires 5 Volts. Lucky, most phone chargers provide those and I’m sure most of you have an old one around you could use.</p><p>That brings me to the shopping list of the main components needed:</p><ul><li><a href="https://frenck.link/esp-01s-relay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="An ESP-01S (opens in a new tab)">An ESP-01S</a></li><li><a href="https://frenck.link/esp-01s-relay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="The relay module board for the ESP-01(S) (opens in a new tab)">The relay module board for the ESP-01(S)</a></li><li>An old phone charger, delivering 5 Volts</li></ul><h3 id="3-other-tools-and-hardware">Other tools and hardware</h3><p>Besides the main components, you’ll need some other things for building it as well. Without a doubt, you need some screwdrivers and a wire stripper. A pair of tweezers can also help put wires to place, and for modifying to the board later on.</p><p>The ESP01-S chip needs to be programmed. To do that, you’ll need an FTDI adapter. If you have ever flashed ESP chips before (e.g., SonOff switches), you probably already have one. If not, you should get one! It is an essential tool to have when you are into home automation.</p><p>Additionally, some wire is needed. I always have a bunch of Dupont cables in stock. They are really helpful in many many projects I’ve done. It allows you to wire up prototypes really quickly as well.</p><div id="ub_feature_box_81af68ae-6eb7-4909-952a-e05f03dc75f8"><div> <p><img decoding="async" src="https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/dupont.png" alt="Product image showing a bunch of Dupont wires"></p><p><a href="https://frenck.link/dupont" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Dupont wires (opens in a new tab)">Dupont wires</a></p><p><em>Having a collection of Dupont wires with different male/female connector combinations, is useful to have around.

The resulting board is pretty small. Maybe it can already fit one of your electrical boxes. Another option is getting a small project box online, like this one:</p><div id="ub_feature_box_45fcedc7-f988-4090-b23c-581dc1fa06b7"> <p><img decoding="async" src="https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/doorbell-project-box.png" alt="Product image showing a small project box"></p><p><a href="https://frenck.link/projectbox-small" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Small project box</a></p><p><em>Small project boxes really finish a DIY project and make them look slick while protecting the electronics as well.

However, this project can be used on other hubs as well (like Domoticz or OpenHAB). I’ve added a section at the end of the article for more information about this.</p><h2 id="5-modifying-to-the-esp-01s-chip">Modifying to the ESP-01S chip</h2><p>To make this setup work, you would have to make a small modification to the ESP-01S chip. Reason for this modification is that you have to free up an additional pin for connecting your doorbell button. These input/output pins, are called GPIO pins.</p><p>The ESP-01S has two GPIO pins available. Using the relay board, one of the GPIO pins is wired to the relay, the other is wired to a reset mechanism. Without this modification, a doorbell button push would result in a reset/restart of the chip, which of course, isn’t what we want.</p><p>Don’t worry, this modification is easy. We need to bend the GPIO2 pin from the ESP-01S. This allows you to access the pin for connecting the doorbell button, while disconnecting it from the relay board.</p><figure><p> <iframe data-placeholder-image="https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/complianz/placeholders/youtubemS42qXhejKs-maxresdefault.webp" data-category="marketing" data-service="youtube" data-cmplz-target="src" data-src-cmplz="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mS42qXhejKs?feature=oembed" data-deferlazy="1" title="Freeing up GPIO-2 on a ESP-01S by bending the pin" width="720" height="405" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure><p>The lost reset functionality is later be restored via a software switch in ESPHome. Furthermore, the reset button on the side of the relay board isn’t affected by this and keeps working as a reset button as well.</p><h2 id="6-flashing-the-firmware-on-the-chip">Flashing the firmware on the chip</h2><p>This project uses ESPHome to create firmware for the ESP-01S chip. I’m not going to make a full tutorial on how to set up ESPHome since that is really well covered on their website. So, before continuing, make sure you’ve set up ESPHome.</p><ul><li><a href="https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_hassio.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Getting Started with ESPHome (opens in a new tab)">Getting Started with ESPHome</a> (for Hass.io users)</li><li><a href="https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_command_line.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Getting Started with ESPHome (opens in a new tab)">Getting Started with ESPHome</a> (when not on Hass.io)</li></ul><div id="ub-notification-box-block-b6b0f61f-1527-4b6c-b444-a1daec8f4796"><p>For the rest of this guide, I’m going to assume you are running Hass.io. However, the ESPHome getting started guide for non-Hass.io users is extremely detailed, and you should be able to adapt easily.</p></div><h3 id="7-creating-building-and-downloading-the-firmware">Creating, building and downloading the firmware</h3><p>Create a file called <code>doorbell.yaml</code>; for Hass.io users, create the file in the <code>/config/esphome</code> folder, so you end up with the file: <code>/config/esphome/doorbell.yaml</code>.</p><p>Next, add the following contents to the file:</p><p>The above file shows a ESPHome project definition; the ESPHome project code, or also referred to as ESPHome YAML.

Save the file and open up the ESPHome web interface; The doorbell project should appear!</p><p>Now, you should be able to validate, build and download the firmware from ESPHome. Let me show you a screen recording on how that works:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="967" height="513" src="https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ephome-doorbell-validate-compile-download.gif" alt="Animation on how to validate, compile and download ESPHome firmware"><figcaption>Doorbell ESPHome: Validate, compile and download</figcaption></figure><h3 id="8-uploading-the-firmware-to-the-esp-01s-chip">Uploading the firmware to the ESP-01S chip</h3><div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/flashing-esp-01s-1024x512.png" alt="Image shows my ESP-01S being flashes for the smart doorbell" width="334" height="169"><figcaption>Flashing my ESP-01S for the smart doorbell</figcaption></figure></div><p>Now you have the firmware (the downloaded <code>doorbell.bin</code>), you can start putting it onto the ESP-01S chip for use. This flashing procedure is the hardest part, and if you are new to this, please have some patience, it might need a couple of tries for you get it right.</p><p>Start with wiring up the ESP-01S chip to the FTDI adapter, using some Dupont wires. Don’t freak out now, we only need to do this once. Once you’ve flashed the chip, future flashing/upgrades can be done Over-the-Air (OTA) via WiFi. Wire the FTDI &amp; ESP-01S according to the following wire schematic:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="512" src="https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FTDI-ESP-01S-wiring-schema-1024x512.png" alt="Illustrates how to wire an FTDI adapter to an ESP-01S chip." srcset="https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FTDI-ESP-01S-wiring-schema.png 1024w, https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FTDI-ESP-01S-wiring-schema-300x150.png 300w, https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FTDI-ESP-01S-wiring-schema-768x384.png 768w, https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FTDI-ESP-01S-wiring-schema-720x360.png 720w, https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FTDI-ESP-01S-wiring-schema-580x290.png 580w, https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FTDI-ESP-01S-wiring-schema-320x160.png 320w, https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FTDI-ESP-01S-wiring-schema-800x400.png 800w, https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FTDI-ESP-01S-wiring-schema-600x300.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>FTDI to ESP-01S Wiring Schema</figcaption></figure><div id="ub-notification-box-block-589d6e90-355d-4fc4-840a-a09bdfb31475"><p>Make sure to double-check the wiring and set the FTDI to 3.3V.

Integrating your new, self-created, smart doorbell with Home Assistant. Home Assistant will discovery it automatically. The only thing you need to do is to activate it and unlock a bunch of new entities for you to play with.</p><p>This screen recording shows how that works:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="935" height="537" src="https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-08-03-15.42.55.gif" alt="Animation on how to integrate the DIY smart doorbell with Home Assistant"><figcaption>Integrating the ESPHome DIY smart doorbell with Home Assistant</figcaption></figure><h2 id="11-home-assistant-smart-doorbell-automations">Home Assistant smart doorbell automations</h2><p>At this point, you have a WiFi-enabled doorbell. Is it smart already? Not really…</p><p>Adding some automations to Home Assistant would make it really smart! There are many automations one could create with this. However, let me give you a couple of basic and useful examples.</p><h3 id="12-sending-notifications-to-your-phone">Sending notifications to your phone</h3><p>This little automation sends a notification to our phone when someone is at the door. We have Apple iPhones and watches, so those notifications would end up on our wrist as well, even if the chime is disabled!</p><h3 id="13-disable-the-chime-during-the-late-hours">Disable the chime during the late hours</h3><p>I have two kids. Nothing is more annoying than the sound of the doorbell chime about 15 minutes after you’ve put them into bed 😞. This little automation will disable the chime during the late hours and enable it again in the morning.</p><h3 id="14-streaming-the-front-door-camera-when-someone-is-at-the-door">Streaming the front door camera when someone is at the door</h3><p>This little automation is useful if you have a camera pointing at your front door. If you push the doorbell button, it will send out the camera stream of your front door camera to your living room TV 📺.</p><h3 id="15-more-smart-doorbell-automation-ideas">More smart doorbell automation ideas</h3><ul><li>Disable the chime when you arm the alarm when home, indicating you went to bed.</li><li>Use pressure sensors in your bed to turn off the chime when sleeping.</li><li>Create a camera snapshot when someone is at the door, and send it out to your phone.</li><li>Use the chime as an alarm bell as well, e.g., in case smoke or water leak is detected.</li><li>Use facial recognition on your front door camera, to disable the doorbell for the ones you don’t want to open the door for. E.g., an unknown person or your mother in law 😈</li><li>Prevent over abuse of doorbell pushes, by disabling it for a couple of minutes after it was pushed.</li><li>Hook the doorbell chime active switch into your voice assistant, allowing you to say “Hey Google, turn off the doorbell”</li></ul><h2 id="16-optional-changes-and-modifications">Optional changes and modifications</h2><p>There are probably a hundred variations on this approach I took, but that was not the point of this guide. However, some are worth mentioning.</p><h3 id="17-using-the-chimes-power-supply-using-a-step-down">Using the chimes’ power supply using a step-down</h3><p>In my case, my doorbell chime is powered by 8 Volts (DC) from the transformer. While to voltage is too high for the board, I could have used a little regulator to “step-down” from the 8 Volts to the 5 Volts required by the board.</p><p>These “step-down” are available for around a dollar on AliExpress. However, since I have enough older chargers I could use, and do have a power outlet available in my utility closet (where the doorbell wires are at); I saved myself the extra buck 😉.</p><h3 id="18-using-multiple-doorbell-buttons-eg-front--amp-backdoor">Using multiple doorbell buttons (e.g., front- &amp; backdoor)</h3><p>In some homes, there are multiple doorbells. E.g., one for the front door, the other for the back door. Mostly they are connected to the same chime. There are three ways to use this guide in those cases:</p><ol><li>Connect the doorbell push buttons in parallel to a single chip. This is fast and cheap, however, you cannot distinguish which button was pushed.</li><li>Connect two of those boards in parallel to the chime. You would need two boards and one chime, however, you can still distinguish the doorbell pushed.</li><li>Replace the ESP-01S and relay board with one of the bigger brothers. Those provide more GPIO pins. However, it would be more expensive compared to using just two of this project.</li></ol><h3 id="19-using-mqtt-eg-for-use-with-openhab">Using MQTT (e.g., for use with OpenHAB)</h3><p>Are you not using Home Assistant? Really? Or maybe you prefer to use MQTT with OpenHAB, Node-RED or Domoticz. Well, you can use this project as well! ESPHome provides an MQTT interface.</p><p>For more information about using MQTT with ESPHome, refer to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="ESPHome MQTT Client Component documentation.

ESPHome &amp; Home Assistant are just amazing tools to allow everyone to jump in and create amazing things.</p><p>The ESP-01S is an amazingly cheap and tiny ESP8266-based board, that is rarely considered or discussed nowadays. Mostly you’ll find articles and references to her big brothers; the ESP8266 and ESP32. However, if you need just one or two GPIO pins, it is a viable option.</p><p>Consider this: Replace “doorbell” with “bedside LED light” in this article… 🤯.

  The European Commission, which also acts as the EU antitrust and technology regulator, said it had sent its preliminary findings to Apple after an investigation launched in March.</p><p>
  “For too long Apple has been squeezing out innovative companies — denying consumers new opportunities and choices,” said Thierry Breton, the European commissioner responsible for digital markets, <a href="https://x.com/ThierryBreton/status/1805138863091859564" data-link-name="in body link">on X</a>.</p></div><figure id="64fc8fbb-3ed2-4789-ae8a-1ad8879ce267" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:1,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Brussels accuses Apple of breaking EU rules; UK facing rise in economic Misery Index – business live&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;64fc8fbb-3ed2-4789-ae8a-1ad8879ce267&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2024/jun/24/uk-economic-misery-index-election-advertised-salaries-fall-ftse-stock-markets-business-live&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0,&quot;design&quot;:0}}" config="{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;,&quot;darkModeAvailable&quot;:false,&quot;updateLogoAdPartnerSwitch&quot;:true,&quot;assetOrigin&quot;:&quot;https://assets.guim.co.uk/&quot;}"></gu-island></figure><p>In preliminary findings, against which Apple can appeal, the European Commission said it believed its rules of engagement did not comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) “as they prevent app developers from freely steering consumers to alternatives channels for offers and content”.</p><p>The company has 12 months to comply before it face fines of up to 10% of its global revenues but the EU hopes ongoing dialogue will lead to compliance rather than sanctions.</p><p>In addition, the commission has opened a new non-compliance procedure against <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Apple</a> over concerns its new contract terms for third-party app developers also fall short of the DMA’s requirements.</p><p>It is the third non-compliance investigation opened by the commission into Apple since the DMA came into force last year and the sixth launched in total, with two other inquiries outstanding into Google and one into Meta, the owner of Facebook.</p><p>At the heart of Monday’s findings are three elements of Apple’s practices, including fees charged to app developers for every purchase made within seven days of linking out to the commercial app.</p><p>The commission says a fee for such matchmaking is justifiable but what Apple charges goes “beyond what is strictly necessary”.</p><p>In its preliminary findings on its earlier investigation, the EU has reiterated that the new digital laws require Apple to ensure that developers should be able “free of charge to inform their customers of alternative cheaper purchasing possibilities, steer them to those offers and allow them to make purchases”.</p><div><p>As part of the new investigation, the commission is examining 0.50c charge, or “core technology fee”, Apple demands every time a developer’s app is installed on a phone.</p><p>
 The allegations that Apple is breaking EU law are the first against a tech company under the DMA, landmark legislation introduced last August to ensure six designated “very large online platforms” including Google, Amazon, Meta and ByteDance (TikTok) compete fairly.</p></div><p>The commission also found that Apple made it difficult for customers to find the pricing information, requiring them to “link out” to a webpage where a customer could then find the contract details.</p><p>“If the commission’s preliminary views were to be ultimately confirmed, none of Apple’s three sets of business terms would comply with article 5(4) of the DMA, which requires gatekeepers to allow app developers to steer consumers to offers outside the gatekeepers’ app stores, free of charge,” the Commission said.</p><p>The EU likened Monday’s preliminary findings to the halfway stage in a formal anti-trust investigation during which a company is shown a statement of objection and given time to rectify its anti-competitive practices.</p><p>Apple said it had made a number of changes to comply with the DMA in the past few months in response to feedback from developers and the European Commission investigators.</p><p>“We are confident our plan complies with the law, and estimate more than 99% of developers would pay the same or less in fees to Apple under the new business terms we created,” it said.</p><p>“All developers doing business in the EU on the App Store have the opportunity to utilise the capabilities that we have introduced, including the ability to direct app users to the web to complete purchases at a very competitive rate. As we have done routinely, we will continue to listen and engage with the European Commission.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>U.S. prosecutors are recommending to senior Justice Department officials that criminal charges be brought against Boeing after finding the planemaker violated a settlement related to two fatal crashes, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Justice Department (DOJ) must decide by July 7 whether to prosecute Boeing. The recommendation of prosecutors handling the case has not been previously reported.</p>
<p>In May, officials determined the company breached a 2021 agreement that had shielded Boeing from a criminal charge of conspiracy to commit fraud arising from two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving the 737 MAX jet.</p>
<p>Under the 2021 deal, the Justice Department agreed not to prosecute Boeing over allegations it defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration so long as the company overhauled its compliance practices and submitted regular reports. Boeing also agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle the investigation.</p>
<p>Boeing declined to comment. It has previously said it has "honored the terms" of the 2021 settlement, which had a three-year term and is known as a deferred prosecution agreement. Boeing has told the Justice Department it disagrees with its determination that the company violated the settlement, Reuters reported this month.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Justice Department declined to comment.</p>
<p>The two sides are in discussions over a potential resolution to the Justice Department's investigation and there is no guarantee officials will move forward with charges, the two sources said. The internal Justice Department deliberations remain ongoing, and no final decisions have been reached, they added.</p>
<p>Criminal charges would deepen an unfolding crisis at Boeing, which has faced intense scrutiny from U.S. prosecutors, regulators and lawmakers after a panel blew off one of its jets operated by Alaska Airlines mid-flight Jan. 5, just two days before the 2021 settlement expired.</p>
<p>The sources did not specify what criminal charges Justice Department officials are considering, but one of the people said they could extend beyond the original 2021 fraud conspiracy charge.</p>
<p>Alternatively, instead of prosecuting Boeing, the DOJ could extend the 2021 settlement by a year or propose new, stricter terms, the sources said.</p>
<p>In addition to financial penalties, the strictest settlements typically involve installing a third party to monitor a company's compliance. The DOJ can also require the company to admit its wrongdoing by pleading guilty.</p>
<p>Boeing may be willing to pay a penalty and agree to a monitor, but believes a guilty plea, which typically incurs additional business restrictions, could be too damaging, said one of the sources. Boeing derives significant revenue from contracts with the U.S. government, including the Defense Department, which could be jeopardized by a felony conviction, one of the sources said.</p>
<p>Relatives of the victims of the two fatal 737 MAX crashes have long criticized the 2021 agreement, arguing that Justice Department officials should have prosecuted the company and its executives.</p>
<p>At a Senate hearing in June, Chief Executive Dave Calhoun acknowledged the company's shortcomings on safety and apologized to the families who lost loved ones.</p>
<p>Last week, the families pressed prosecutors to seek a fine against the planemaker of nearly $25 billion and move forward with a criminal prosecution.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In early 2015, Apple started stealth semiconductor fabrication activities in a facility located at 3250 Scott Boulevard in Santa Clara, California.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> &nbsp;Like some sort of Skunkworks, Apple codenamed the facility “ARIA” and even tried to use the codename on regulatory paperwork.</p><p>The ARIA semiconductor fabrication facility operated less than three hundred feet from thousands of homes where Gjovik lived in 2020. Also within 300 from the building were two public parks (Creekside Park and Meadow Park), picnic tables, outdoor fitness stations, and a children’s playground. Within 1,000 feet of ARIA there was also a church, a school, an elder care facility,&nbsp; and the San Tomas Aquino Creek and public trail. (San Tomas Aquino Creek flows to the Bay and then into the Pacific Ocean).</p><p>Apple intentionally vented its fabrication exhaust – unabated – and consisting of toxic solvent vapors, gases, and fumes – into the ambient outdoor air. The factory was one story, while the apartments were four stories tall, creating a high likelihood that Apple’s factory exhaust entered the interior air of the apartments through open windows and the 'fresh air intake' vents.</p><p>Apple was fully aware of this facility and its operations, including the vast amount of hazardous materials and hazardous waste, as every year, Apple submitted a financial assurance document to the Santa Clara Fire Department and HazMat agency, which detailed hazardous waste treatment and disposal operations, and is personally signed by Apple’s Chief Financial Officer, Luca Maestri – including affixing a company seal. Each financial assurance filing also attached a detailed confirmation letter from Apple’s third-party auditor, E&amp;Y, on behalf of Apple. Maestri was also on the email distribution list for notification of hazardous waste violations at the facility.</p><p>Upon initiating operations at ARIA, Apple was quickly cited for building, environmental, health, safety, and fire code violations in at least 2015 (stop work order due to construction without permits), 2016 (spill of cooling water into storm drains, fire code and CalASPA violations, health and safety code violations, failure to properly monitor wastewater discharge), 2019 (wastewater testing violations), 2020 (fire code violations, using two EPA identification numbers, inaccurate hazmat inventory data, no spill plans or training, no business permit, no signature from supervisor on records, and failure to properly monitor wastewater discharge again).</p><p>In February 2020, Gjovik moved into a large, new apartment complex at 3255 Scott Blvd (adjacent to ARIA) and quickly became severely ill. Gjovik suffered severe fainting spells, dizziness, chest pain, palpitations, stomach aches, exhaustion, fatigue, and strange sensations in her muscles and skin. Gjovik also suffered bradycardia (slow heart rate), volatile blood pressure with both hypertension and hypotension and a high frequency of premature ventricular contractions (an arrhythmia). From February 2020 through September 2020, Gjovik was screened for multiple severe and fatal diseases and disorders, including Multiple Sclerosis, brain tumors, deadly arrhythmias, and Neuromyelitis Optica – instead, all of Gjovik’s symptoms were consistent with chemical exposure. Due to the solvent exposure, Gjovik also suffered skin rashes, burns, and hives, and her hair fell out and she had a shaved head for nearly a year as the bald patches slowly grew back.</p><p>Due to the sudden illness, Gjovik visited the Emergency Room on February 13 2020, and Urgent Care (at AC Wellness, Apple’s for-profit in-house clinic) on February 20 2020. Gjovik subsequently consulted with dozens of doctors, who screened her for all sorts of diseases, subjecting Gjovik to extensive blood draws, urine samples, injections, and scans – including potentially dangerous procedures like MRI and CT scans with contrast, of which Gjovik had multiple. Gjovik was too sick to work and went on disability.</p><p>Gjovik transitioned her medical care to a different clinic and provider after her Apple primary care provider at AC Wellness refused to help her triage her 2020 medical issues (due to exposure to Apple’s factory exhaust). Instead she suggested Gjovik could be suffering from anxiety, and enrolled Gjovik in an Apple internal user study related to blood pressure, requiring Gjovik share her iPhone medical and fitness data with Apple, and participate in weekly life coaching sessions (while being exposed to Apple’s solvent vapor and gas exhaust).</p><p>While sick in 2020, Gjovik would wake up occasionally at 3 AM feeling like she was dying and with symptoms of heart failure and asphyxia. Heart monitoring showed arrhythmias, bradycardia, and low blood pressure. On September 2 2020, Gjovik discovered elevated levels of volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) in her indoor air. What immediately captured Gjovik’s attention was the arge spike in VOCs had occurred the night prior, around 3 AM, while she had been suffering from one of these “dying” spells.</p><p>Gjovik sought out multiple occupational and environmental exposure doctors, who told Gjovik that all of her symptoms were consistent with solvent and other chemical exposures. After Gjovik discovered her medical issues at the apartment were due to a chemical emergency, Gjovik quickly filed complaints with Santa Clara City HazMat/Fire Department, California EPA DTSC and Air Resources Board, and US EPA. She also called Poison Control, who said what she described also sounded like Benzene exposure. (Apple reported it was exhausting Benzene into the air).</p><p>City Fire Department records for ARIA contain at least sixteen chemical spill/leak incident reports at ARIA within only three years. These incident reports included eight confirmed leaks/spills: leaks of phosphine and silane on June 1 2019 at 9:17 AM; a phosphine leak on October 21 2019 at 11:06 PM; a 17.5 PPM Tetraethyl Orthosilicate (“TEOS”) leak on July 17 2020 at 8:58 AM; a major phosphine leak on April 30 2021 at 8:29 AM (peaking at 32 PPB and 0.0001145 pounds of the gas vented into the exterior ambient air); a 5% fluorine gas leak on April 18 2022 at 10:42 AM, a Hexafluorobutadiene leak on May 29 2022 at 2:19 PM, and leaks of two unnamed toxic gases on September 20 2022 at 7:44 AM and December 21 2022 at 1:40 AM.</p><p>Notably, almost all of the reported toxic gas leaks during the time frames Gjovik had complained n 2020 that her symptoms seemed to always be the worst around 8-9 AM, 10-11 PM, and sometimes around 2-3 AM. One of the chemical spills that did not occur during those times of concern was root caused to an Apple engineer “accidently” turning on lethal fluorine gas. Similarly, another incident, the TEOS leak, was root caused to an Apple engineer accidently installing the gas for a tool “backwards.” Further, less than two weeks following the April 30 2021 phosphine leak, Apple’s manifests included sixty pounds of “v<em>acuum filters contaminated with glass dust</em>,” implying there may have also been a phosphine explosion.</p><p>Further, later in 2021-2022, Apple reported to the government. that in the year 2020, Apple released at least 7.8 tons (15,608 pounds) of VOCs and 260 pounds of the combustible solvent N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) into the exterior air around ARIA. Per a review of Apple’s manifests, Apple did not replace the carbon/charcoal in its exhaust system for over five years, with the first replacement occurring December 14, 2020 – only after Gjovik had notified Apple EH&amp;S and environmental legal about what occurred to her near ARIA.</p><p>In 2022, the US EPA severely restricted the legal use of NMP as <em>“it presents an unreasonable risk of injury to human health</em>” under TSCA. Apple also reported that in at least 2019-2021, that ARIA exhausted reportable amounts of mercury, arsenic, carbon monoxide, and formaldehyde into the ambient air around the factory. &nbsp;Further, Apple reported to the Bay Area Air Quality Management Board that ARIA exhausted an average of 16 pounds a day of isopropyl alcohol vapors.</p><p>In September 2020, Gjovik hired an industrial hygienist to test the indoor air at her apartment. She purchased an inspection, soil testing, and a two-hour sorbent tube-based TO-17 air panel. Only half the total contaminants were accounted for in the test and the California EPA informed her that testing with Summa canisters for 24 hours is superior and would have yielded better results. Still, Gjovik’s limited testing returned results showing a number of the chemicals in use by Apple at ARIA including Acetone, Acetonitrile, Acetaldehyde, Benzene, 1,2-Dichloroethane, Ethanol, Ethylbenzene, Hexane, Isopropanol, Isopropyl toluene, Methylene Chloride, Toluene, and Xylene.</p><p>In September 2020, Gjovik set up additional air monitors to observe the levels of VOCs in her apartment next to the ARIA factory (though she was not aware of the factory exhaust at that time). The results of the data validated what Gjovik had noticed with her symptoms and ad hoc testing – that the VOCs mostly spiked early in the morning and late at night as if they were being exhausted from an automated mechanical system (which it was). Gjovik notified several Apple executives of her findings and activities, including her managers Powers.</p><p>In September 2020, Gjovik’s blood and urine medical tests returned results with industrial chemicals, including arsenic, mercury, Toluene (Hippuric Acid), and Xylenes (2-3-4 Methyl hippuric Acid. Also noteworthy are the symptoms of Gjovik’s 3 AM attacks, (including both subjective reporting and physical real-time heart monitoring) match Phosphine and Arsine gas exposure. Both Phosphine and Arsine are very dangerous, exposure can be fatal, and there are no antidotes. Apple has a significant quantity of Arsine gas on site, and Gjovik’s medical tests from September 2020, on the morning after one of the 3 AM attacks, revealed significant arsenic in her blood with no other explanation than Arsine gas exposure within the prior eight hours.</p><p>Apple’s leaks, spills, and releases were not limited to the air. Apple’s wastewater discharge monitoring repeatedly showed the presence of heavy metals and organic solvents. In 2017, the government mandated testing revealed the presence of 29 μg/L of 1,1-Dichloropropane, 24 μg/L of &nbsp;Trichloroethylene (“TCE”), and 6.7 μg/L of Ethyl tertiary-butyl ether (ETBE). Among other issues, it’s unclear why Apple had TCE on site but not in any of its chemical inventories, and then, in addition, why exactly Apple was pouring that TCE down the drain.</p><p>&nbsp;ARIA reported an average daily water usage of around 44,000 gallons per day and the sewer pipes carrying ARIA’s discharges flowed downhill and directly around the apartment where Gjovik lived in 2020. In 2020, the government had already started investigating the plumbing at her apartment as a possible vector for some unknown solvent vapor pollution.</p><p>In September 2020, Gjovik noticed an Apple facility at 3250 Scott Boulevard across the street, which was also on the Superfund groundwater plume. Gjovik mentioned the facility to Apple on at least September 8, 9, 10, and 13, 2020 – inquiring if anyone was familiar with the area because Apple had an office there. Apple EH&amp;S and Gjovik had at least two phone calls. The woman who responded who was also actually in charge of Real Estate/EH&amp;S teams involved in Gjovik’s Superfund office at 825 Stewart Drive (“Stewart 1”) and the activities at ARIA.<br>​<br>In September 2021, the Apple EH&amp;S manager, Elizabeth, suggested that Gjovik use a special paid leave to move out of the apartment called ‘<em>extreme condition leave’</em> designated for disasters. Later, in September 2021, Apple Employee Relations conferred with Elizabeth about Gjovik’s environmental concerns only hours before Gjovik was abruptly terminated.</p></div><div><p>On February 21 2023, Gjovik discovered the semiconductor fabrication activities at ARIA. Gjovik posted on Twitter in real-time as she learned about it, expressing severe distress.[1] Until that day, Gjovik did not know it was Apple who was responsible for making her so ill in 2020. Further, until that day, Gjovik did not know the chemicals she was exposed to in 2020 were potentially lethal to human life.</p><p>Gjovik began researching the site and Apple's activities, with the findings making Gjovik feel compelled to file a formal complaint about Apple’s illegal conduct at ARIA. On June 23 2023, Gjovik filed complaints about ARIA to the US EPA, CalEPA, the city of Santa Clara, and Santa Clara County. Gjovik drafted a 28-page memo with dozens of exhibits. Gjovik also posted on Twitter that she did so and provided a public link.</p><p>The US EPA responded and took the lead on an investigation. Gjovik met with the US EPA’s RCRA Enforcement &amp; Compliance team several times before they then inspected Apple’s factory in August 2023 and January 2024. The August 17, 2023 inspection was coded as an RCRA “<em>Compliance Evaluation Inspection,</em>” defined as “<em>primarily an on-site evaluation of the compliance status of the site about all applicable RCRA Regulations and Permits</em>.”[2] The January 16, 2024 inspection was coded as a “<em>Focused Compliance Inspection</em>.”[3]&nbsp; Gjovik is still awaiting a report on the results. The US EPA notified her they finalized the report but are currently unable to share it with her as Apple apparently declared the report of their (assumed) numerous environmental violations is <em>Apple Confidential. </em>Gjovik has a pending FOIA request as well.</p></div><div><p><strong>Creation &amp; Maintenance of a Private Nuisance at 3250 Scott Blvd</strong></p><p>Apple created and maintained a condition in violation of Cal.Civ.C. § 3479. This nuisance was demonstrably injurious to health, which was indecent and offensive to the senses and obstructed the free use of property. By acting and failing to act, Apple created a condition or permitted a condition to exist that was harmful to health, offensive to the senses, an obstruction to the free use of property, and a fire, explosion, and poisoning hazard. Apple’s conduct in acting or failing to act was intentional, unreasonable, negligent, and reckless.</p><p>Apple is continuously casting pollution upon the property of the owner and tenants of adjacent properties, as it knew it would do when it constructed its exhaust and HVAC systems and hazardous waste handling systems. It knew then, as it knows now, that so long as it would continue its operation, the pollution would continue to fall, not by accident or mishap, but in conformity with the knowledge it had before the construction of the systems. Apple should be presumed to have intended its act's natural, known, and reasonable consequences.</p><p>Apple’s interference would and did substantially annoy or disturb persons of normal health and sensibilities in the same community. Apple’s operations at the factory and Superfund site are both continuing nuisances, and every continuation of the nuisance or trespass gives rise to separate damages claims. Apple has the agency and ability to stop the nuisance (it is not permanent), so until it does, the nuisance Apple created is continuous. &nbsp;Apple’s conduct was a substantial factor in causing Gjovik’s harm. Gjovik did not consent to a defendant’s conduct, and the seriousness of the harm outweighs the social utility of Apple’s conduct. Apple damaged Gjovik’s property and injured Gjovik’s person. Due to Apple’s actions, Gjovik’s property was destroyed, the leasehold degraded, she became very ill, and she suffered severe emotional distress.</p><p>In or about 2015, Apple constructed, or caused to be constructed, exhaust vents and open tanks at ARIA in Santa Clara, near the common border line of the defendant's and Gjovik’s property. The exhaust vents were installed and maintained negligently, recklessly, and unskillfully. Apple exhausted through the vents and emptied various materials or substances into the open tanks that caused a foul, obnoxious, and disagreeable odor and polluted the atmosphere / ambient air of Gjovik’s leasehold property.</p><p>Apple’s facility emits large quantities of vapors, dust, chemicals, and other contaminants into the air, which are carried by the natural winds and air currents onto Gjovik’s property and collect Gjovik’s chattel property and are generally injurious to Gjovik’s health, are offensive to the senses, and interfered with Gjovik’s comfortable enjoyment of life and property. Apple created the nuisance due to unnecessary, unreasonable, and injurious methods of operation of their business. The emissions were a business decision to be able to report reduced waste sent to landfills.</p><p><strong>Strict Liability for Ultrahazardous Activities at 3250 Scott Blvd</strong></p><p>Apple’s fabrication activities at ARIA provided a high degree of risk of significant harm to people and property, and the exercise of reasonable care could not eliminate the risk; the activity's benefits do not outweigh the risks, and these activities are inappropriate for the location, Apple’s activities at ARIA, directly adjacent to High-Density Residential and numerous sensitive receptors (including parks, schools, and playgrounds) is in violation of city and county zoning rules.</p><p>&nbsp;Apple’s facility was originally registered simply as an “R&amp;D Facility” (it appears Apple went to much effort to ensure no one knew they were doing semiconductor fabrication at the location). The ARIA building is located on “Light Industrial” zoned land (18.48), however semiconductor fabrication is expressly not allowed on any land other than “Heavy Industrial” zoned land (18.50). &nbsp;The state Fire Code also includes numerous other regulations targeted at the semiconductor fabrication processes (see, <em>e.g.</em>, Cal. Fire Code Ch. 17 – “Semiconductor Fabrication Faculties”).</p><p>Santa Clara City Code, Santa Clara County Code, and California Fire Code all explain that facilities which process raw materials (10.60.090) and require hazardous material and hazardous waste management, must be located in Heavy Industrial zoned land, must go through an application/review process, and may still be denied if their activities (and emissions) would create a nuisance for other industrial facilities in that area. Further, Santa Clara City Code requires that any industrial zoned properties be located at least 500 feet away from any Residential zoned properties.</p><p>Apple stored, used, treated, and released a large quantity of lethal gases at ARIA. Apple possessed and used substantial amounts of arsine, phosphine, silane, fluorine, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and phosphorus trichloride. In addition, many of Apple's chemicals at the plant were characterized as “<em>extremely hazardous substances</em>,”[1] “<em>highly toxic gases</em>,”[2] and/or “<em>acute and extremely hazardous wastes</em>.”[3] Regardless of other considerations, California Fire Code requires that any storage or processing of highly toxic gases occur no less than twenty feet away from the property lot line and public sidewalks.</p><p>Further, California Fire Code strictly prohibits the storage, use, or treatments of toxic gases within 75 feet of air intakes in adjacent buildings. This rule applies in Heavy Industrial zoning, where these activities should have been conducted. Apple intentionally venting unabated toxic gases and lethal chemicals into the ambient air only 250 feet from an open-air children’s playground – is exactly the policy justification for Ultrahazardous Activities tort enforcement as a common law zoning mechanism.<br>Apple conducted semiconductor fabrication activities, with extremely dangerous substances, openly dumping its unabated chemical exhaust into the ambient air, only 150 feet from High-Density Residential with thousands of apartments, and 250 feet away from two public parks and a children’s playground. The storage, use, treatment, and release of large quantities of highly toxic, extremely poisonous, acutely lethal gases – directly adjacent to an unsuspecting, High Density Residential area – and directly adjacent to public parks and children’s playgrounds –&nbsp; is an activity which, even when conducted with the greatest of care and prudence, can still cause severe injuries, fatalities, and mass human suffering (<em>e.g.</em> Bhopal). Thus, these activities – in this location, scenario, and context – are Ultrahazardous Activities.</p><p>Apple’s use, storage, and release (intentional and unintentional” of highly toxic gases can produce a dense cloud of lethal gas that would be large enough to engulf the apartments. Such an emissions could easily cause mass fatalities and severe suffering. The condition Apple created and permitted to exist resulted from Ultrahazardous Activities and for which strict liability should also exist.<br>Apple violated the spirit of the Clean Air Act, if not the law, which “<em>criminalizes knowing or negligent “releases into the ambient air [of] any hazardous air pollutant . . . or extremely hazardous substance” that give rise to imminent danger,</em>” [42 U.S.C. § 7413(c)(4)– (5)]. Similarly, Apple’s activities likely violated RCRA when Apple “<em>knowingly transports, treats, stores, disposes of, or exports any hazardous waste identified or listed under this subchapter . . . in violation of … of this section [and] knows at that time that he thereby places another person in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury</em>.” [42 U.S.C. § 6928(e)].</p><p>Apple also released chemicals categorized by Cal. Code Regs. Tit. 17, § 93000 as “<em>Substances Identified as Toxic Air Contaminants</em>,” of which there is no safe level of exposure without “<em>significant adverse health effects</em>. “Apple released into the air chemicals categorized under 42 U.S.C. Section 7412(b) as “<em>Hazardous Air Pollutants</em>” and Cal. Code Regs. Tit. 17, § 93001 as “<em>Hazardous Air Pollutants Identified as Toxic Air Contaminants</em>.”</p><p>Apple was engaged in Ultrahazardous Activities that caused Gjovik to be harmed. Apple’s activities were the proximate cause of that harm, and Apple is responsible for that harm. People who engage in ultrahazardous activities are responsible for the harm these activities cause others, regardless of how carefully they carry out these activities. Apple damaged Gjovik’s chattel property (discoloring, weakening, dissolving glues, causing reactions), degraded her extremely expensive leasehold conditions, and harmed Gjovik’s mind and body.</p></div></div>]]></description>
