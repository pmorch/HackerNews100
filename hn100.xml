            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2024/11/14/m4-macs-cant-virtualise-older-macos/">https://eclecticlight.co/2024/11/14/m4-macs-cant-virtualise-older-macos/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42157086">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-first_letter="I">
		<p>If you’ve already got a new M4 Mac and tried to run a macOS virtual machine on it, then you might have been disappointed. It seems that M4 chips can’t virtualise any version of macOS before 13.4 Ventura. So before you trade in or pass on your M1, M2 or M3 Mac, if you need access to older VMs, you might like to check whether this affects you.</p>
<p>I’m indebted to Csaba Fitzl for drawing my attention to this problem, and for reporting it to Apple in Feedback FB15774587. It has also been reported as <a href="https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues/6794" target="_blank" rel="noopener">affecting UTM</a>, and I believe affects all other macOS virtualisation software for Apple silicon.</p>
<h4>The bug</h4>
<p>Running a macOS VM for any version before 13.4 Ventura on an M4 Mac results in a black screen, and the VM fails to boot. This is true whatever settings are used in the virtualiser, even if it’s set to boot the VM in Recovery mode. It’s also true when that VM has been built on that Mac: although that appears to complete successfully, when first run that VM opens as a black screen and never proceeds with personalisation and setup.</p>
<p>Currently the only way to run a VM with macOS prior to 13.4 Ventura is to do so on a host with an M1, M2 or M3 chip.</p>
<h4>Can this be fixed?</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, as this bug prevents the VM from booting, there’s no reliable way to access its log to discover what’s going wrong there. There’s no sign of the failure in the host’s log either: the host appears to initialise its Virtio and other support normally, without errors or faults. After those, virtualisation processes on the host fall silent as they wait for the VM to start, which never happens.</p>
<p>There is a useful clue in Activity Monitor, though: in its CPU pane, despite being allocated multiple virtual cores, only one is seen to be active on the host. That implies the failure is occurring before the VM kernel boots the other cores, an event that occurs early during the kernel boot phase. Until that point, pre-boot phases and the kernel run on just a single CPU core.</p>
<p>macOS 13.4 updated iBoot to version 8422.121.1, so at first sight the VM could be failing when running older firmware. That doesn’t appear likely, as version 8422.121.1 was also installed in the 12.6.6 security update, so 12.7.x shouldn’t suffer this problem, but it does.</p>
<p>It thus appears most likely that this bug strikes in the early part of kernel boot, in which case the most feasible solution would be to fix the bug in macOS kernels prior to 13.4, and promulgate new IPSW image files for those. I suspect that’s very unlikely to happen, and as far as I’m aware it would be the first time that Apple has issued revised IPSWs.</p>
<h4>Which macOS can you virtualise?</h4>
<p>Support for lightweight virtualisation of macOS on Apple silicon Macs was still in progress in the first version of macOS to run on M1 chips, Big Sur. You therefore cannot create or run Big Sur VMs.</p>

<p>The first versions that can run in VMs are macOS 12 Monterey, although prior to 12.4 they can sometimes be a bit fractious. They also have major limitations, such as not supporting shared folders with the host.</p>

<p>This is 12.1 with its old System Preferences, running happily on an M3 Pro.</p>

<p>macOS Ventura should run well on M1, M2 and M3 hosts, and 13.4 and later on M4 hosts too.</p>

<p>macOS Sonoma should run even better on all current Apple silicon Macs, and delivers a much improved display with autoscaling. However, 14.2 and 14.2.1 don’t automatically support shared folders because of a bug that was fixed in 14.3.</p>

<p>macOS Sequoia is fully compatible, and adds support for iCloud Drive and some other Apple Account features, although still won’t run App Store apps. It may also fail to install the required extras to support Apple Intelligence.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<ul>
<li>Currently, M4 Macs can only run VMs of macOS Ventura 13.4 and later, 14 Sonoma, and 15 Sequoia.</li>
<li>M1, M2 and M3 Macs can run VMs of macOS Monterey 12.0.1 and later.</li>
<li>macOS Big Sur 11 can’t be virtualised on Apple silicon.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Postscript</h4>
<p>I’m grateful for the suggestion that it might be possible to work around this problem by running the older VM on a single core. Although I did manage to do that on an M3 (the first time I have seen recent macOS running on just <em>one</em> core!), that fails just the same on an M4, I’m afraid.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Not to be outdone by its longtime rival, Casio has announced its own digital ring watch that brings more functionality than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278580/timexs-new-digital-ring-watch-actually-tells-time">Timex’s wearable</a> that debuted last month.

As a result, unlike Timex’s watch ring that <a href="https://timex.com/products/timex-x-mm6-20mm-stainless-steel-ring-watch-m-l-tw2w81400">features a stretchable band</a> to accommodate different users, the CRW-001-1JR is permanently a US size 10.5. If your fingers are smaller than that, Casio includes a couple of spacers to improve the fit. If your fingers are larger than that, you’ll need to find some other way to check the time.</p><p>Last year, Casio <a href="https://www.g-central.com/casio-to-release-casio-watch-ring-collection-capsule-toys/#google_vignette">released a collection of ring watches</a> featuring designs inspired by some of the company’s most iconic digital timepieces from the past 50 years. Unfortunately, none of them were functional, so it’s nice to see Casio following up with a ring watch that actually works. For the 75th anniversary, maybe we’ll even get a tiny calculator ring watch.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>YC recently released their latest </span><a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs-build" rel="">Request for Startups</a><span>, and one specific item has already been getting some buzz in chip design communities. It’s exciting that an organization as high-profile as YC is taking chip design more seriously… or at least it’s exciting until you actually start reading what their proposal is. Unfortunately, YC seems to have fundamentally misunderstood the key challenges in the world of chip design, and where both LLMs and AI tools more broadly can help.</span></p><p>YC makes the following argument:</p><blockquote><p>Design of customized digital systems [...] has typically been costly because of the amount of custom design, development and testing necessary to bring such a system online. With the advent of large language models, these costs are coming down significantly, such that ever more specialized types of computation could be done.</p><p>We know there is a clear engineering trade-off: it is possible to optimize especially specialized algorithms or calculations such as cryptocurrency mining, data compression, or special-purpose encryption tasks such that the same computation would happen faster (5x to 100x), and using less energy (10x to 100x).</p></blockquote><p><span>If Gary Tan and YC believe that LLMs will be able to design chips 100x better than humans currently can, they’re significantly underestimating the difficulty of chip design, and the expertise of chip designers. While LLMs are </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10424v4" rel="">capable</a><span> of writing </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07544" rel="">functional Verilog</a><span> </span><em>sometimes</em><span>, their performance is still subhuman. More importantly, LLMs aren’t capable of designing novel chip architectures, which is the primary driver of performance improvements for modern accelerator chips. LLMs primarily pump out mediocre Verilog code.</span></p><p><span>The more charitable version of YC’s proposal is that LLM-based tools will significantly reduce the </span><em>cost</em><span> of chip design, which will make hardware acceleration more viable for applications where it’s currently cost-prohibitive. Unfortunately, the semiconductor industry already tried something similar. It was called high-level synthesis, and it resoundingly failed.</span></p><p><span>High-level synthesis, or HLS, was born in 1998, when </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forte_Design_Systems" rel="">Forte Design Systems</a><span> was founded. They developed a tool called Cynthesizer, which could automatically translate SystemC to Verilog given certain timing constraints. More generally, HLS tools let engineers write code in a higher-level language like C, C++, or Scala, and automatically convert that code to Verilog, which can in turn be synthesized into logic gates for ASICs and FPGAs. The idea is to make silicon development cheaper and more accessible, especially for teams that don’t have access to deep Verilog expertise.</span></p><p><span>Despite Cynthesizer’s cool name, it never really caught on. Forte was still </span><a href="https://www.eetimes.com/the-future-is-high-level-synthesis/?_ga" rel="">desperately trying to argue</a><span> that HLS was the future in 2011. In 2014, they were acquired by Cadence, and Cynthesizer was rolled into Cadence’s new HLS tool, Stratus.</span></p><p><span>Xilinx, now AMD, has been a major proponent of HLS, specifically targeting FPGA acceleration. This makes some sense, as FPGA development is usually done on smaller teams where the additional firepower HLS promises could be super useful. Their </span><a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/software/adaptive-socs-and-fpgas/vitis/vitis-hls.html" rel="">Vitis</a><span> tool is one of the best HLS tools in the industry -- unfortunately, that’s a bit of a low bar.</span></p><p><span>The current state of HLS is best summed up by Lan Huang in the </span><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11390-020-9414-8" rel="">introduction to his survey of the current state-of-the-art in HLS tools</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>The performance of HLS tools still has limitations. For example, designers remain exposed to various aspects of hardware design, development cycles are still time consuming, and the quality of results (QoR) of HLS tools is far behind that of RTL flows.</p></blockquote><p><span>Other researchers have reported </span><a href="https://trepo.tuni.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/126643/Are_We_There_Yet.pdf?sequence=1" rel="">similar disappointing results</a><span> in their own surveys. </span></p><p>Ultimately, while HLS makes designers more productive, it reduces the performance of the designs they make. And if you’re designing high-value chips in a crowded market, like AI accelerators, performance is one of the major metrics you’re expected to compete on. So it makes sense to spend the additional upfront cost to hire talented RTL designers, build chips with better performance, and deliver more successful products.</p><p>So HLS tools failed to gain any traction for high-value, high-volume chips, where performance and efficiency requirements necessitated human engineers writing high-quality Verilog. LLMs, which also produce poor-quality Verilog, will likely face the same challenges But what about other kinds of chips? Could LLMs help there?</p><p>The few successful applications of HLS enabled engineers without silicon expertise to leverage hardware acceleration. For example, HLS has seen success in FPGA acceleration of genomics workloads and CFD workloads.</p><p>In both cases, HLS is valuable because the engineers developing the hardware accelerators don’t have the RTL experience to build optimized RTL-level designs from scratch. But this is only the case because the markets for hardware-accelerated genomics and CFD are relatively small. GPUs already serve these use cases somewhat well, and neither use-case would drive even a fraction of the sales volume of AI chips or cryptographic accelerators. If these markets were bigger, it would make economic sense to dedicate talented hardware engineers to build optimized silicon.</p><p><span>The idea that YC is proposing falls into the same trap. LLMs can reduce the cost to develop silicon. This might make dedicated ASICs for applications like genomics economically viable, when they previously weren’t. But they weren’t viable for a reason: there isn’t a huge market there. Ultimately trying to leverage LLMs to build hardware accelerators for underserved applications is a loser’s bet.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-151675193" href="https://www.zach.be/p/yc-is-wrong-about-llms-for-chip-design#footnote-1-151675193" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> If an application doesn’t warrant hardware acceleration yet, it’s probably because it’s a small market, and that makes it a poor target for a startup.</span></p><p>If LLM-based chip design primarily unlocks low-value markets, why are so many startups and established EDA companies trying to leverage LLMs? Well, it turns out that LLMs are also pretty valuable when it comes to chips for lucrative markets -- but they won’t be doing most of the design work. LLM copilots for Verilog are, at best, mediocre. But leveraging an LLM to write small snippets of simple code can still save engineers time, and ultimately save their employers money.</p><p>More importantly, though, the chip design world is experiencing a massive talent shortage in verification. Normally, you want two verification engineers for every designer, because silicon bugs are incredibly costly. But in the modern era, good verification engineers are hard to come by.</p><p><span>If you could leverage LLMs to make verification faster, easier, or more effective, that could be massively valuable to established semiconductor companies and semiconductor startups alike. But actually ensuring that LLMs can actually understand and reason about chip designs specifications is no small task, which is why I’m skeptical of startups like </span><a href="https://www.bronco.ai/" rel="">Bronco</a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.getinstachip.com/" rel="">Instachip</a><span> who are naively throwing fine-tuned LLMs at chip verification.</span></p><p><span>First of all, chip specifications are often complex, incomplete, labyrinthine monstrosities -- they were written by people like me, after all. But more importantly, successful verification of a chip requires an LLM to understand the expected internal state of the chip. In essence, the language needs to have some formal model of the chip: think </span><a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/" rel="">AlphaProof</a><span>, but for semiconductor verification instead of math. This is one of the things we’re working on at </span><a href="https://www.normalcomputing.com/" rel="">Normal Computing</a><span>, alongside our novel thermodynamic chip architectures.</span></p><p>Ultimately, LLMs will make chip design cheaper. But this will primarily benefit three kinds of companies: large semiconductor companies who can reduce their verification workforce, conventional chip startups who can operate leaner teams, and then the EDA software startups selling LLM-based tools. LLMs won’t build 100x better chips, or enable hardware startups to tackle markets lacking hardware acceleration, because the economics just don’t make sense.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

        <p>Yggdrasil is a new experimental compact routing scheme. It is designed to be a future-proof and decentralised alternative to the structured routing protocols commonly used today on the Internet, as well as an enabling technology for future large-scale mesh networks. Yggdrasil is:</p>

</div>

<p>The <a href="https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/implementation.html">current implementation</a> of Yggdrasil is a lightweight userspace software router which is easy to configure and supported on a wide range of platforms. It provides end-to-end encrypted IPv6 routing between all network participants. Peerings between nodes can be configured using TCP/TLS connections over local area networks, point-to-point links or the Internet. Even though the Yggdrasil Network provides IPv6 routing between nodes, peering connections can be set up over either IPv4 or IPv6 networks.</p>

<p>This is still an alpha-stage project and there may be some breaking changes in the future. Despite that, Yggdrasil is generally stable enough for day-to-day use and a small number of users have been using and stress-testing Yggdrasil quite heavily for a variety of use cases. If you are interested in or would like to get involved in the Yggdrasil project, start below:</p>

<p dir="auto">Kyanos is an <strong>eBPF-based</strong> network issue analysis tool that enables you to capture network requests, such as HTTP, Redis, and MySQL requests.<br>
It also helps you analyze abnormal network issues and quickly troubleshooting without the complex steps of packet capturing, downloading, and analysis.</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Powerful Traffic Filtering</strong>: Not only can filter based on traditional IP/port information, can also filter by process/container, L7 protocol information, request/response byte size, latency, and more.</li>
</ol>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# Filter by pid
./kyanos watch --pids 1234
# Filter by container id
./kyanos watch --container-id abc
# Filter by Redis key
./kyanos watch redis --keys my-key1,my-key2
# Filter by response byte size
./kyanos watch --resp-size 10000"><pre><span><span>#</span> Filter by pid</span>

<ol start="2" dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Advanced Analysis Capabilities</strong> : Unlike tcpdump, which only provides fine-grained packet capture, Kyanos supports aggregating captured packet metrics across various dimensions, quickly providing the critical data most useful for troubleshooting.<br>
Imagine if the bandwidth of your HTTP service is suddenly maxed out—how would you quickly analyze <code>which IPs</code> and <code>which  requests</code> are causing it?<br>
With Kyanos, you just need one command: <code>kyanos stat http --bigresp</code> to find the largest response byte sizes sent to remote IPs and view specific data on request and response metrics.<br>

</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>In-Depth Kernel-Level Latency Details</strong>: In real-world, slow queries to remote services like Redis can be challenging to diagnose precisely. Kyanos provides kernel trace points from the arrival of requests/responses at the network card to the kernel socket buffer, displaying these details in a visual format. This allows you to identify exactly which stage is causing delays.</p>

<p dir="auto">The simplest usage captures all protocols currently supported by Kyanos:</p>

<p dir="auto">Each request-response record is stored as a row in a table, with each column capturing basic information about that request. You can use the arrow keys or <code>j/k</code> to move up and down through the records:
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/hengyoush/kyanos/blob/main/docs/public/watch-result.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/hengyoush/kyanos/raw/main/docs/public/watch-result.jpg" alt="kyanos watch result"></a></p>

<p dir="auto">In the details view, the first section shows <strong>Latency Details</strong>. Each block represents a "node" that the data packet passes through, such as the process, network card, and socket buffer.<br>
Each block includes a time value indicating the time elapsed from the previous node to this node, showing the process flow from the process sending the request to the network card, to the response being copied to the socket buffer, and finally read by the process, with each step’s duration displayed.</p>
<p dir="auto">The second section provides <strong>Detailed Request and Response Content</strong>, split into Request and Response parts, and truncates content over 1024 bytes.</p>
<p dir="auto">For targeted traffic capture, such as HTTP traffic:</p>

<p dir="auto">You can narrow it further to capture traffic for a specific HTTP path:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="./kyanos watch http --path /abc "><pre>./kyanos watch http --path /abc </pre></div>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">互換TOWNS OS (津軽OS)</h2><a id="user-content-互換towns-os-津軽os" aria-label="Permalink: 互換TOWNS OS (津軽OS)" href="#互換towns-os-津軽os"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Introduction</h2><a id="user-content-introduction" aria-label="Permalink: Introduction" href="#introduction"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The goal of this project is to write a copyright-free FM Towns OS to run free games and the re-released games, or why not a brand-new game for FM Towns. without concerns of violating copyrights of the files included in the original Towns OS.</p>
<p dir="auto">Let's see how far we can go!  But, so far so good.  Now Tsugaru OS is capable of running the three probably the most popular free games, Panic Ball 2, VSGP, and Sky Duel.  All playable without single file from the original Towns OS.</p>
<p dir="auto">このプロジェクトの目標は、著作権フリーなFM Towns OSを実装して、もとのTowns OSの著作権を気にすることなくフリーゲームや、復刻版、さらには新規のFM TOWNS用アプリ開発を可能にすることです。</p>
<p dir="auto">果たしてどこまでできるかはやってみないとわかりません。が、とりあえず、FM TOWNSのフリーソフトの中で、おそらく最も有名だったと思われる、Panic Ball 2, VSGP, Sky Duelの3本はやや音が違う箇所があるものの、プレイ可能になりました。</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">とりあえず、お試しに release/FDIMG.bin を津軽から起動できます。release/FDIMG_USEROM.bin を使うと、ディスク上のYSDOS.SYS, YAMAND.COMの代わりにROMドライブのMSDOS.SYS, COMMAND.COMを使います。いずれ実機での動作も想定しているので、その実験用です。</p>
<p dir="auto">あるいは、release/HDIMG.h0 をSCSI-ID 0にマウントして、他に何もメディアを入れずに津軽を起動しても津軽OSを起動することができます。なお、津軽OSはCMOSのドライブ設定に依存せず、SCSI ID 0のPartition 0から順にドライブレターを割り振っていくので、CMOS設定が無くてもハードディスクから起動できます。</p>
<p dir="auto">To try it, you can boot from release/FDIMG.bin from Tsugaru.  release/FDIMG_USEROM.bin uses MSDOS.SYS and COMMAND.COM in the ROM drive, instead of YSDOS.SYS and YAMAND.COM on the disk.  I'm going to make it work on the real hardware.  It's a preparation for it.</p>
<p dir="auto">Or, you can mount release/HDIMG.h0 on SCSI ID 0 and run it from Tsugaru.  Tsugaru OS does not rely on CMOS setting, so the first partition of SCSI ID 0 (or whatever found first) will be assigned to D drive.  It can start without CMOS setup.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">必要なもの</h2><a id="user-content-必要なもの" aria-label="Permalink: 必要なもの" href="#必要なもの"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Python: ビルドスクリプトを実行するために必要。あんまり好きな言語ではない。どっちかというと嫌い。</li>
<li>Netwide Assembler: Pathを通して、コマンドからNASMとタイプして実行できるように。</li>
<li>Visual C++: 2019でビルド確認。Developer Command PromptまたはDeveloper Power Shellから使う。</li>
<li>FM TOWNSエミュレータ「津軽」実行環境。Tsugaru_CUI.exeをビルドに使うので、パスを通してください。</li>
<li>High-C Multimedia Kit</li>
<li>FM TOWNS用386|Assembler Toolkit。なお、DOS用386ASMはFM TOWNSで実行できないらしい。</li>
<li>Make フリコレ9に収録のもの。</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">準備</h2><a id="user-content-準備" aria-label="Permalink: 準備" href="#準備"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">NASM, Visual C++のセットアップは多分探せばわかるでしょう。</p>
<p dir="auto">津軽の実行環境と、TGDRV.COMの使い方がわかってる必要があります。</p>
<p dir="auto">High-Cと386ASMのセットアップはやや大変かもしれませんが、津軽上のハードディスクイメージにHigh-Cと386ASMを以下のディレクトリにセットアップしてください。</p>

<p dir="auto">386ASMは386ASM.EXE, 386LINK.EXEなど実行ファイルを386ASMディレクトリにコピーしておけばOK。次に、フリコレ9のMAKE.EXEを、津軽上で</p>

<p dir="auto">にコピーしてください。</p>
<p dir="auto">次に、FreeTOWNSOSと同じレベルに、</p>

<p dir="auto">というディレクトリを作って、津軽からTGDRVを使って、津軽上でセットアップした上の3個のディレクトリをコピーしてください。</p>
<p dir="auto">これで、環境の準備は完了です。</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">ビルド</h2><a id="user-content-ビルド" aria-label="Permalink: ビルド" href="#ビルド"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">正しく環境がセットアップできていたならば、tgbiosサブディレクトリで makedisk.py を実行すると、全部ビルドして、HDIMG.h0, FDIMG.bin, FDIMG_USEROM.bin の3本のバイナリファイルができるはずです。</p>
<p dir="auto">だがしかし、上の説明が間違ってる可能性も結構あったりして。</p>
<p dir="auto">多分Windowsの実行ファイルで完結してる部分、NASM, Visual C++は問題ないと思うけど、津軽上でビルドするTGBIOSがちょっとひっかかるかも。津軽のVMは、make_build_envのAUTOEXEC.BATが想定するディレクトリにHigh-C, 386ASMがあると思ってtgbios下のTASK.BATを実行するので、そのようになってるか確認してください。</p>
<p dir="auto">Sorry, I'm going to write the English translation.</p>

      <p><em>work in progress</em></p>

      <p>It's fun to play with data<sup>[citation needed]</sup>. All data on Bluesky is extremely public, and with 15 million users (as of today and with mind-boggling growth), there's a lot of public data to play with.</p>

      <p>You can get the firehose as a websocket JSON feed with <a href="https://jazco.dev/2024/09/24/jetstream/">Jetstream</a>. This connects you to <em>everything</em> happening on the network in real time. It's extremely easy to get started and very fun.</p>

      <p>Here's a random word from every post being posted <em>right now</em>:</p>

      

      <p>There you go, you just consumed it for free from your browser.</p>

      <h2>little app</h2>

      <p>After noodling around a bit, i sketched out <a href="https://deletions.bsky.bad-example.com/" target="_blank">this questionable little app</a> which listens for all <code>delete</code> events from the firehose, and then shows the just-deleted text one last time in an anonymized disappearing feed. Kind of fascinating to see what people choose to delete. (also please note that I made this millions of users ago when the network was a fraction of the current chaotic speed). Maybe I'll write more about it later.</p>

      <p>Anyway it runs on fly:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Fly machine, shared-cpu-1x with 256MB RAM: $1.94/mo</li>
        <li>2GB Persistent volume: $0.30/mo</li>
      </ul>

      <p><img src="https://bsky.bad-example.com/consuming-the-firehose-cheaply/fly-dash.png" alt="screenshot of fly.io dashboard showing app metrics over 7 days. network io has a daily cycle (growing since bsky is growing), cpu memory and load average are all flat, volume usage grows (backfill), then levels (steady state), then grows again (bsky growing)."></p><p>Granted it's not doing <em>much</em>, but it's doing it happily on the smallest instance fly offers.</p>

      <p>What <em>is</em> it doing?</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Receive every new create-post event from the <code>app.bsky.feed.post</code> collection</li>
        <li>Filter out empty posts, apply redactions to mentions and links</li>
        <li>Cache the clean text content on the volume in pebbledb, keyed by <code>did+rkey</code></li>
        <li>Every few seconds, do a range-delete on saved texts older than 48hr</li>
        <li>For every delete-post event, try to fetch the text from the cache, and if found, broadcast it to all current observers</li>
      </ol>

      <p>More interesting apps might not scale down this far, but some will.</p>

<h2 id="the-polars-vs-pandas-difference-nobody-is-talking-about">The Polars vs pandas difference nobody is talking about</h2>
<p>I attended PyData Berlin 2024 in April, and it was a blast! I met so many colleagues, collaborators, and friends.
There was quite some talk of Polars - some people even gathered together for a Polars-themed dinner!
It's certainly nice to see people talking about it, and the focus tends to be on features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>lazy execution</li>
<li>Rust</li>
<li>consistent handling of null values</li>
<li>multithreading</li>
<li>query optimisation</li>
</ul>
<p>Yet there's one innovation which barely ever gets a mention: non-elementary group-by aggregations.</p>
<p>I'll start by introducing the group-by operation. We'll then take a look at elementary aggregations
with both the pandas and Polars APIs. Finally, we'll look at non-elementary aggregations, and see
how the Polars API enables so much more than the pandas one.</p>
<h2 id="whats-a-group-by">What's a group-by?</h2>
<p>Suppose we start with a (Polars) dataframe such as:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="solarized-dark"><p><code><br><div><p><span>shape: (6, 3)</span></p></div><div><p><span>┌─────┬───────┬───────┐</span></p></div><div><p><span>│ id  ┆ sales ┆ views │</span></p></div><div><p><span>│ --- ┆ ---   ┆ ---   │</span></p></div><div><p><span>│ i64 ┆ i64   ┆ i64   │</span></p></div><div><p><span>╞═════╪═══════╪═══════╡</span></p></div><div><p><span>│ 1   ┆ 4     ┆ 3     │</span></p></div><div><p><span>│ 1   ┆ 1     ┆ 1     │</span></p></div><div><p><span>│ 1   ┆ 2     ┆ 2     │</span></p></div><div><p><span>│ 2   ┆ 7     ┆ 8     │</span></p></div><div><p><span>│ 2   ┆ 6     ┆ 6     │</span></p></div><div><p><span>│ 2   ┆ 7     ┆ 7     │</span></p></div><div><p><span>└─────┴───────┴───────┘</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>A group-by operation produces a single row per group:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="solarized-dark"><p><code><br><div><p><span>df.group_by('id').agg('sales')</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<div data-ch-theme="solarized-dark"><p><code><br><div><p><span>shape: (2, 2)</span></p></div><div><p><span>┌─────┬───────────┐</span></p></div><div><p><span>│ id  ┆ sales     │</span></p></div><div><p><span>│ --- ┆ ---       │</span></p></div><div><p><span>│ i64 ┆ list[i64] │</span></p></div><div><p><span>╞═════╪═══════════╡</span></p></div><div><p><span>│ 1   ┆ [4, 1, 2] │</span></p></div><div><p><span>│ 2   ┆ [7, 6, 7] │</span></p></div><div><p><span>└─────┴───────────┘</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>If we want a single scalar value per group, we can use a reduction ('mean', 'sum', 'std', ...):</p>
<div data-ch-theme="solarized-dark"><p><code><br><div><p><span>df.group_by('id').agg(pl.sum('sales'))</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<div data-ch-theme="solarized-dark"><p><code><br><div><p><span>shape: (2, 2)</span></p></div><div><p><span>┌─────┬───────┐</span></p></div><div><p><span>│ id  ┆ sales │</span></p></div><div><p><span>│ --- ┆ ---   │</span></p></div><div><p><span>│ i64 ┆ i64   │</span></p></div><div><p><span>╞═════╪═══════╡</span></p></div><div><p><span>│ 1   ┆ 7     │</span></p></div><div><p><span>│ 2   ┆ 20    │</span></p></div><div><p><span>└─────┴───────┘</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>

<div data-ch-theme="solarized-dark"><p><code><br><div><p><span>df.groupby('id')['sales'].sum()</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>And indeed, for such a simple task as this one, the pandas API is quite nice. All we had to do was:</p>
<ol>
<li>select which columns we're grouping by</li>
<li>select the column(s) we want to aggregate</li>
<li>specify an elementary aggregation function</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's try something else: "find the maximum value of 'views', where 'sales' is greater than its mean, per
'id'".</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the pandas API has no way to express this, meaning
that no library which copies the pandas API can truly optimise such an
operation in the general case.</p>
<p>You might be wondering whether we can just do the following:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="solarized-dark"><p><code><br><div><p><span>df.groupby('id').apply(</span></p></div><div><p><span>    lambda df: df[df['sales'] &gt; df['sales'].mean()]['views'].max()</span></p></div><div><p><span>)</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>However, that uses a Python <code>lambda</code> function and so is generally going to be inefficient.</p>
<p>Another solution one might come up with is this one:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="solarized-dark"><p><code><br><div><p><span>df[df['sales'] &gt; df.groupby('id')['sales'].transform('mean')].groupby('id')['views'].max()</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>It's not as bad as the <code>apply</code> solution above, but it still looks overly complicated and requires
two group-bys.</p>
<p>There's actually a third solution, which:</p>
<ul>
<li>relies on <code>GroupBy</code> caching its groups</li>
<li>performs in-place mutation of the original dataframe</li>
<li>uses the fact that <code>'max'</code> skips over missing values</li>
</ul>
<p>Realistically, few users would come up with it (most would jump straight to <code>apply</code>), but for
completeness, we present it:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="solarized-dark"><p><code><br><div><p><span>gb = df.groupby("id")</span></p></div><div><p><span>mask = df["sales"] &gt; gb["sales"].transform("mean")</span></p></div><div><p><span>df["result"] = df["views"].where(mask)</span></p></div><div><p><span>gb["result"].max()</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>Surely it's possible to do better?</p>
<h2 id="non-elementary-group-bys-in-polars">Non-elementary group-bys in Polars</h2>
<p>The Polars API lets us pass <a href="https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/expressions/">expressions</a> to <code>GroupBy.agg</code>.
So long as you can express your aggregation as
an expression, you can use it in a group-by setting. In this case, we can express "the maximum value
of 'views' where 'sales' is greater than its mean" as</p>
<div data-ch-theme="solarized-dark"><p><code><br><div><p><span>pl.col('views').filter(pl.col('sales') &gt; pl.mean('sales')).max()</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>Then, all we need to do is pass this expression to <code>GroupBy.agg</code>:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="solarized-dark"><p><code><br><div><p><span>df.group_by('id').agg(</span></p></div><div><p><span>    pl.col('views').filter(pl.col('sales') &gt; pl.mean('sales')).max()</span></p></div><div><p><span>)</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>Wonderful! Like this, we can express the operation cleanly and without hacks, meaning that any dataframe
implementation which follows the Polars API has the possibility to evaluate this efficiently.</p>

<p>We've learned about the group-by operation, elementary aggregations in both pandas and Polars, and how
Polars' syntax enables users to cleanly express non-elementary aggregations.</p>
<p>pandas is a wonderful tool which solves a lot of real problems for a lot of real people.
However, when new dataframe libraries insist on copying its API, they are stunting their own potential.
If an API doesn't allow for an operation to be expressed and users end up using <code>apply</code> with custom
Python lambda functions, then no amount of acceleration is going to make up for that.</p>
<p>On the other hand, innovation on the API side can enable new possibilities. There's a reason
that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I came for the speed, but stayed for the syntax</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is a common refrain among Polars users.</p>

<p>The FTC also highlighted fees charged on users transferring data out of certain cloud systems and minimum spend contracts, which offer discounts to companies in return for a set level of spending.</p>
<p>Microsoft has also attracted scrutiny from international regulators over similar matters. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority is investigating Microsoft and Amazon after its fellow watchdog Ofcom found that customers complained about being “locked in” to a single provider, which offers discounts for exclusivity and charge high “egress fees” to leave.</p>
<p>In the EU, Microsoft has avoided a formal probe into its cloud business after agreeing to a multimillion-dollar deal with a group of rival cloud providers in July.</p>
<p>The FTC in 2022 sued to block Microsoft’s $75 billion acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard over concerns the deal would harm competitors to its Xbox consoles and cloud-gaming business. A federal court shot down an attempt by the FTC to block it, which is being appealed. A revised version of the deal in the meantime closed last year following its clearance by the UK’s CMA.</p>
<p>Since its inception 20 years ago, cloud infrastructure and services has grown to become one of the most lucrative business lines for Big Tech as companies outsource their data storage and computing online. More recently, this has been turbocharged by demand for processing power to train and run artificial intelligence models.</p>
<p>Spending on cloud services soared to $561 billion in 2023 with market researcher Gartner forecasting it will grow to $675 billion this year and $825 billion in 2025. Microsoft has about a 20 percent market share over the global cloud market, trailing leader Amazon Web Services that has 31 percent, but almost double the size of Google Cloud at 12 percent.</p>
<p>There is fierce rivalry between the trio and smaller providers. Last month, Microsoft accused Google of running “shadow campaigns” seeking to undermine its position with regulators by secretly bankrolling hostile lobbying groups.</p>
<p>Microsoft also alleged that Google tried to derail its settlement with EU cloud providers by offering them $500 million in cash and credit to reject its deal and continue pursuing litigation.</p>
<p>The FTC and Microsoft declined to comment.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Fixed pops, holes in the world, fading-out and disappearing objects across the game.</li>
						<li>Rebalanced the lighting across Half-Life 2 to account for playing with HDR on or off, using the original release as reference.</li>
						<li>Cleaner, smoother horizon lines thanks to new radial fog!</li>
						<li>Added higher-resolution lightmaps across the game!</li>
						<li>Removed green glow from the G-Man model’s eyes in the opening of the game, and restored the reflective glint as seen in the original release.</li>
						<li>Fixed missing grass sprites and blacked-out models throughout the game!</li>

						<li>Aim Assistance has gotten an overhaul making it feel better to use, and there are more configuration options available. Aim Assistance can be enabled separately for gamepad or mouse/keyboard input. The amount of assistance can be tuned up and down, and it’s no longer tied to a skill setting. Want to play on Hard with high aim assist, or Easy with it off? Knock yourself out.</li>
						<li>The Steam Deck main menu has been updated with all of today’s additions including the Episodes, Workshop, and new input configuration. The Steam Deck version of the main menu will also appear when you play Half-Life 2 on a PC running Big Picture Mode.</li>

    <pre>Those of you how know me, know that I am not a big fan of the X86
architecture, which I think is a bad mess, mangled by market power
considerations, rather than the CPU architecture this world actually
needs, in particular in terms of performance/energy ratio.

So when my regular HW-pusher had a T14s G6 with Qualcomm Snapdragon
ARM64 CPU, for only EUR1000 + VAT, and I couldn't resist.

Physical:
---------

Lenovo T-series as we know it.

FreeBSD-current status:
-----------------------

-CURRENT needed some patches to ARM64-specific interrupt stuff,
that too half a day or so, patches are in transit.

A lot of my time were spent trying to slow down the EFI console
enough to be able to capture the boot messages with my mobile phone's
camera.

One particular note here is that the VT console switches to a 25Hz timer
driven screen update once interupts are supposed to work, and if they dont,
you wont see why on the screen.

I think we ought to have a loader-tunable, settable to a number,
which slows down the console proportional to that number, and if
non-zero, the VT console should not rely on the timer.  That would
have saved me some trouble and confusion yesterday.

With those pending patches:

What works:  Screen, NVME, the two USB-A ports and that's probably about it.

What does not work: Keyboard, mouse, TB &amp; USB-C ports, thermal/freq mgt.

What is not tested: Everything else

Worldstone:
-----------

	&gt;&gt;&gt; World built in 3210 seconds, ncpu: 12, make -j12

... using 24 Wh of energy, measured with a proper power-meter.

Likely explanation: Twelve real CPUs and none of that HTT-crap ?

Conclusion:
-----------

Highly recommended.
