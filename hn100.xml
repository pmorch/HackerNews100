<h2>Introduction: when the trust model can’t be trusted</h2>



<p>Secrets vaults are the backbone of digital infrastructure. They store the credentials, tokens, and certificates that govern access to systems, services, APIs, and data. They’re not just a part of the trust model, they <em>are</em> the trust model. In other words, if your vault is compromised, your infrastructure is already lost.</p>



<p>Driven by the understanding that vaults are high-value targets for attackers, our research team at Cyata set out to conduct a comprehensive assessment of HashiCorp Vault (“Vault”), one of the most widely used tools in this space.</p>



<p>Over several weeks of deep investigation, we identified <strong>nine previously unknown zero-day vulnerabilities</strong>, <strong>each assigned a CVE</strong> through responsible disclosure. We worked closely with HashiCorp to ensure all issues were patched prior to public release.</p>



<p>The flaws we uncovered bypass lockouts, evade policy checks, and enable impersonation. One vulnerability even allows root-level privilege escalation, and another – perhaps most concerning – leads to the first public <strong>remote code execution (RCE)</strong> reported in Vault, enabling an attacker to execute a full-blown system takeover.</p>



<p>We found a pattern of logic failures that, individually and in combination, create dangerous attack paths – especially in real-world Vault deployments where misconfigurations or excessive permissions are common.</p>



<p>These vulnerabilities weren’t memory corruption or race condition issues, but subtle logic flaws buried in Vault’s authentication, identity, and policy enforcement layers. Some had existed for nearly a decade, quietly embedded and easy to miss, yet straightforward to exploit once understood.</p>



<p>Previous public research on Vault risks, most notably Google Project Zero’s <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/10/enter-the-vault-auth-issues-hashicorp-vault.html">Enter the Vault</a> (2020), focused on bypasses in cloud-provider-specific IAM backends like AWS and GCP. Our work targets Vault’s <strong>core authentication flows</strong>, surfacing issues that impact both Open Source and Enterprise versions, across multiple solution providers.</p>



<p>In this post, we share what we found, how we found it, and what it means for the infrastructure Vault is meant to protect.</p>



<p>In parallel, we conducted a similar assessment of <strong>CyberArk Conjur</strong>, uncovering several high-severity vulnerabilities – composing a pre-auth remote code authentication chain. Those findings are detailed <a href="https://cyata.ai/blog/exploiting-a-full-chain-of-trust-flaws-how-we-went-from-unauthenticated-to-arbitrary-remote-code-execution-rce-in-cyberark-conjur/">in a separate post on Conjur</a>.</p>



<h2>What is HashiCorp Vault?</h2>



<p>HashiCorp Vault is an open-source tool designed to secure, store, and control access to secrets, including API keys, database passwords, certificates, and encryption keys.</p>



<p>Used across organizations of all sizes, Vault centralizes secret management and enforces fine-grained access policies across distributed systems.</p>



<p>At its core, it acts as a security boundary: authenticating users and machines and brokering access to sensitive data.</p>



<p>Vault plays a critical role in modern DevSecOps pipelines, helping teams reduce the risks of hardcoded credentials, secret sprawl, and unauthorized access.</p>



<p>Users frequently highlight its integration flexibility, detailed policy enforcement, and suitability for complex, distributed environments.</p>



<p>In many environments, it’s trusted as the final gatekeeper of secrets and, depending on its configuration, a breach of Vault can mean a breach of <strong>everything</strong>.</p>

<h2>Methodology: how we found what others missed</h2>



<p>This research was the result of a deliberate, weeks-long effort by our research team to uncover logic-level vulnerabilities in Vault – the kind that don’t show up in memory scanners or crash logs, but that can quietly undermine a system’s trust model.</p>



<p>We didn’t stumble into these issues. We sought them out, starting with a clear hypothesis – if Vault plays the role of trust anchor for organizations, then even minor inconsistencies in how it enforces identity, authentication, or policy could have outsized consequences.</p>



<p>We focused on Vault’s core request flow, especially the <code>request_handling.go</code> file which functions as the “brain” of Vault. This is where requests are routed, identities resolved, and policy decisions made. We spent weeks reviewing the logic across functions and modules, looking for edge cases where trust boundaries might blur.</p>



<p>We didn’t rely on fuzzers or automated probes. Instead, we conducted a deep manual review of the source code – looking not just at what each function did, but how different components interpreted identity and input. Where we saw inconsistencies in casing, aliasing, or formatting, we dug deeper.</p>



<p>These weren’t random guesses, each test input was a precision-guided hypothesis shaped by the code itself. We also approached the system like an attacker: starting with minimal access and asking, <em>“How far can we push from here?”</em></p>



<p>We repeated that process again and again.</p>



<p>This recurring loop – spotting subtle inconsistencies, reasoning through their downstream impact, and validating them with controlled testing – led us to each of the nine vulnerabilities disclosed in this report.</p>



<p>Ultimately, we didn’t just look for vulnerabilities. We looked at how trust itself could break and followed the logic wherever it led.</p>



<h2>The path to compromise</h2>



<p><mark>Step 1 – Cracks in userpass authentication</mark></p>



<p>HashiCorp Vault supports a wide range of authentication methods, 14 by default. To kick off our research, we began with the simplest and most widely used – <code>userpass</code>, Vault’s native username-and-password login mechanism.</p>



<p>To enable <code>userpass</code>, users configure it through the Vault UI or API as one of the available authentication methods.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1294" height="844" src="https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hashicorp-1.webp" alt="" srcset="https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hashicorp-1.webp 1294w, https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hashicorp-1-300x196.webp 300w, https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hashicorp-1-1024x668.webp 1024w, https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hashicorp-1-768x501.webp 768w, https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hashicorp-1-372x243.webp 372w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1294px) 100vw, 1294px"></figure>



<p>In a typical <code>userpass</code> setup, each user is assigned a hashed password and one or more Vault policies. On login, Vault verifies the credentials and applies the appropriate policy upon success.</p>



<p>Given how foundational <code>userpass</code> is to Vault and how widely it’s deployed across production environments, we were surprised to discover logic flaws in this core component. Even here, at the default entry point to the system, the trust model could be broken.</p>



<p>The Full Login Flow</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1360" height="1360" src="https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/userpass-login.webp" alt="" srcset="https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/userpass-login.webp 1360w, https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/userpass-login-300x300.webp 300w, https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/userpass-login-1024x1024.webp 1024w, https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/userpass-login-150x150.webp 150w, https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/userpass-login-768x768.webp 768w, https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/userpass-login-372x372.webp 372w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px"></figure>



<p><strong>What we looked for</strong></p>



<p>We began by reviewing how Vault enforces lockout protections under <code>userpass</code> – specifically, how failed login attempts are tracked, throttled, and attributed to individual users.</p>



<p><strong>What we found</strong></p>



<p>Our first stop was Vault’s userpass backend. We wanted to understand not only how it works – but also how it could be manipulated into misbehaving.</p>



<p>Our investigation focused on Vault’s <strong>lockout protection</strong> logic, the mechanism that’s supposed to throttle brute-force attempts. We discovered three vulnerabilities, all related to how Vault tracks and handles failed login attempts:</p>



<ul>
<li id="CVE-2025-6010"><strong>CVE-2025-6010 – Redacted (Pending Fix)<br></strong>This CVE has been temporarily withheld from publication at the request of the vendor. No technical details will be shared at this time.</li>



<li id="CVE-2025-6004"><strong>CVE-2025-6004 – Lockout bypass via case permutation</strong><br>By changing the casing of a known username (e.g., <code>admin</code> vs <code>Admin</code>), an attacker can reset the lockout counter and continue brute-forcing.</li>



<li id="CVE-2025-6011"><strong>CVE-2025-6011 – Timing-based enumeration</strong><br>When Vault authenticates a real user, it performs a bcrypt hash comparison. For nonexistent users, that step is unintentionally skipped due to an early return. This leads to a detectable timing difference, allowing attackers to infer which usernames are valid.</li>
</ul>



<p>CVE-2025-6004 Lockout Bypass:</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CVE-2025-6004-userpass.mp4"></video></figure>



<p><strong>Why it matters</strong></p>



<p>These flaws allow an attacker to:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Enumerate </strong>valid users without alerting defenders</li>



<li><strong>Bypass </strong>Vault’s intended lockout protections</li>



<li><strong>Brute-force </strong>credentials at scale, even in hardened environments</li>
</ul>



<p>In short, Vault’s simplest authentication path – the first line of defense – contained logic bugs that could be exploited to undermine access controls before any policies were ever enforced.</p>



<p>Step 2 – LDAP logic flaws and MFA enforcement bypass</p>



<p>After uncovering multiple vulnerabilities in <code>userpass</code>, we turned our attention to another backend that shares the same lockout mechanism: <code>ldap</code>. It’s one of Vault’s most widely used authentication methods in production environments, often integrated with directory services like Active Directory or OpenLDAP. And like <code>userpass</code>, it enforces a lockout threshold by default, which made it a compelling next target for investigation.</p>



<p>To enable the <code>ldap</code> backend, it must be configured through the Vault UI or API:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1294" height="844" src="https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hashicorp-2.webp" alt="" srcset="https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hashicorp-2.webp 1294w, https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hashicorp-2-300x196.webp 300w, https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hashicorp-2-1024x668.webp 1024w, https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hashicorp-2-768x501.webp 768w, https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hashicorp-2-372x243.webp 372w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1294px) 100vw, 1294px"></figure>



<p>Unlike <code>userpass</code>, where Vault verifies credentials internally, the <code>ldap</code> method delegates authentication to an external server. Vault simply forwards the provided credentials, and the LDAP server performs the verification.</p>



<p>The full authentication flow looks like this:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1360" height="1562" src="https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ldap-login-flow.webp" alt="" srcset="https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ldap-login-flow.webp 1360w, https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ldap-login-flow-261x300.webp 261w, https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ldap-login-flow-892x1024.webp 892w, https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ldap-login-flow-768x882.webp 768w, https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ldap-login-flow-1337x1536.webp 1337w, https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ldap-login-flow-372x427.webp 372w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px"></figure>



<p><strong>What we looked for</strong></p>



<p>After discovering username enumeration issues in <code>userpass</code>, we turned our attention to the <code>ldap</code> backend – specifically, how it handles lockout behavior for unknown users.</p>



<p>Unlike <code>userpass</code>, <code>ldap </code>applies lockout uniformly to all failed login attempts, regardless of whether the username exists. This consistent treatment prevents the kind of enumeration attacks seen in <code>userpass</code>.</p>



<p>So:</p>



<ul>
<li>No lockout discrepancy → no username enumeration vector</li>



<li>A previous known issue (CVE-2023-3462) had already been patched</li>
</ul>



<p>But despite this uniformity, we uncovered <strong>two high-impact logic flaws</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>What we found</strong></p>



<p>We found two critical flaws that weakened lockout enforcement and bypassed MFA controls under specific configuration conditions.</p>



<p><strong>CVE-2025-6004 – Lockout bypass via input normalization mismatch</strong></p>



<p>This vulnerability stems from how Vault and the LDAP server handle input formatting differently. Vault tracks lockouts by the exact input string, but most LDAP servers normalize input, ignoring case and trimming spaces.</p>



<p>So, these inputs:</p>



<ul>
<li><code>"yardenporat"</code></li>



<li><code>"yardenporat "</code></li>



<li><code>" yardenporat"</code></li>



<li><code>"YARDENPORAT"</code></li>
</ul>



<p>These are all interpreted by LDAP as the same user, but treated by Vault as different aliases.</p>



<p>That discrepancy results in an astronomical number of login attempts that bypass the intended lockout limits. For example:</p>



<pre><code>≈ 1,000 (leading spaces) × 1,000 (trailing spaces) × 2¹¹ (case variants) × 5 (attempts) = ~10 billion guesses</code></pre>



<p><strong>Impact:</strong> </p>



<p>An attacker can make <strong>billions of password guesses</strong> against the same account in a single lockout window – completely defeating the brute-force protection mechanism</p>



<p><strong>CVE-2025-6003 – MFA enforcement bypass via</strong> <code>username_as_alias</code> <strong>and</strong> <code>EntityID</code><br>The second flaw was even more subtle and potentially more dangerous.</p>



<p>Vault allows admins to set <code>username_as_alias=true</code> in the <code>ldap </code>configuration. This means the username itself is used as the basis for identity resolution.</p>



<p>But when MFA enforcement is applied at the <code>EntityID</code> or <code>IdentityGroup</code> level, a mismatch occurs between how Vault resolves the user and how it enforces MFA.</p>



<p>Even though the user logs in successfully, Vault may fail to associate the correct <code>EntityID</code> and therefore, MFA never gets triggered.</p>



<p>For this bypass to occur, two conditions must be met:</p>



<ol>
<li><code>username_as_alias=true</code> in the LDAP auth configuration</li>



<li>MFA enforcement is applied at the <code>EntityID</code>or <code>IdentityGroup</code> level</li>



<li>This issue only became apparent after a deep analysis of how Vault handles <code>EntityID</code>resolution in tandem with authentication workflows, but the result is easily exploitable in practice, including via the UI.</li>
</ol>



<p><strong>Impact:</strong></p>



<p>When MFA is enforced at the <code>EntityID</code> level, Vault may fail to associate the correct <code>EntityID</code>, allowing the login to proceed without triggering MFA.</p>



<p>CVE-2025-6004 Lockout Bypass:</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CVE-2025-6004-ldap.mp4"></video></figure>



<p><br>CVE-2025-6003 MFA enforcement bypass:</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CVE-2025-6003-1.mp4"></video></figure>



<p><br><strong>Why it matters</strong></p>



<p>These two vulnerabilities allow an attacker to:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bypass Vault’s lockout mechanism</strong>, enabling a high volume of password guesses per account</li>



<li><strong>Silently bypass MFA enforcement</strong> in specific configurations where MFA is applied at the <code>EntityID</code> or <code>IdentityGroup</code> level and <code>username_as_alias=true</code> is set</li>
</ul>



<p>Both flaws directly undermine core security protections in enterprise Vault deployments and highlight how subtle logic mismatches can erode trust at the identity layer.</p>



<p>Step 3 – Bypassing TOTP MFA protections</p>



<p><code>userpass</code> and <code>ldap</code> are widely used authentication backends in Vault, but they’re rarely deployed on their own. In most real-world setups, multi-factor authentication (MFA) is also configured. That’s why it was clear to us that any analysis of the authentication surface would be incomplete without examining it.</p>



<p>The MFA method we investigated is TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password), the most common MFA method overall, and especially common alongside <code>userpass</code> and <code>ldap</code>.</p>



<p>This approach adds a rotating numeric code on top of static credentials, aiming to stop brute-force and replay attacks with minimal overhead.</p>



<p><strong>TOTP in Vault</strong></p>



<p>Vault’s built-in TOTP MFA relies on a per-entity shared secret. During authentication, it generates a 6-digit code (valid for a 30-second window by default) and compares it to the user’s input.</p>



<p>By taking a look under the hood, we saw that:</p>



<ul>
<li>Vault uses the Go package <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pquerna/otp/totp">github.com/pquerna/otp/totp</a></li>



<li>Rate-limiting and replay protection are implemented separately inside Vault</li>
</ul>



<p>For TOTP specification details, see <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6238">RFC 6238</a></p>



<p><strong>Vault’s TOTP flow</strong></p>



<p>Here’s how Vault handles TOTP MFA during login:</p>



<p>1. Login begins</p>



<p>2. Vault checks for TOTP MFA</p>



<p>3. A passcode is extracted:</p>

<p>4. Vault checks if the passcode was already used (replay detection):</p>



<pre><code>usedName := fmt.Sprintf("%s_%s", configID, passcode)

    err := usedCodes.Increment(rateLimitID, 1)
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("failed to increment the TOTP code counter")

<p>6. Code validation occurs using the <code>ValidateCustom()</code> function:</p>



<pre><code>key, err := c.fetchTOTPKey(ctx, configID, entityID)
if err != nil {

}

if key == "" {
    return fmt.Errorf("empty key for entity's TOTP secret")

<p>8. Authentication completes</p>

<p><strong>What we looked for</strong></p>



<p>We dug into Vault’s TOTP implementation, looking for logic flaws that could significantly weaken this layer of protection, whether individually or when combined.</p>



<p><strong>What we found</strong></p>



<p>We uncovered <strong>three major logic flaws</strong>, plus a CVE that captures their combined impact:</p>



<p><strong>Bug 1 – Used passcode enumeration</strong></p>



<p>Vault checks for code reuse before applying rate-limiting. This opens a subtle but powerful attack surface.</p>



<p>If an attacker submits a passcode that was recently used, Vault responds with a specific error:</p>



<pre><code>"code already used; new code is available in %v seconds"</code></pre>



<p>This behavior reveals information. Even if a code is expired, Vault confirms it was valid at some point, enabling enumeration of previously used passcodes.</p>



<p><br><strong>Bug 2 – One-time-use bypass via space padding</strong></p>



<p>This issue originates deep inside Vault’s TOTP validation stack. Specifically:</p>



<ol>
<li>Vault calls <code>totp.ValidateCustom()</code></li>



<li><code>totp</code> internally calls <code>hotp.ValidateCustom()</code></li>



<li>Inside <code>hotp</code>, input is normalized:</li>
</ol>



<pre><code>func ValidateCustom(passcode string, ...) {
    passcode = strings.TrimSpace(passcode)
    ...
}</code></pre>



<p>So <code>"123456"</code> and <code>" 123456"</code> are treated as equivalent by the validator.</p>



<p>But Vault’s internal <code>usedCodes</code> cache does not normalize the input. This means:</p>



<ul>
<li><code>"123456"</code> is marked as used</li>



<li><code>" 123456"</code> is accepted as new, even though it’s the same underlying code</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Impact:</strong> </p>



<p>An attacker can <strong>bypass the one-time-use restriction</strong> simply by adding spaces.</p>



<p><br><strong>Bug 3.1 – Rate-limiting evasion via time skew</strong></p>



<p>Even if an attacker has a valid TOTP code using Bug 1, Vault may still reject it because the enumeration attempts required to discover that code may have already triggered per-entity rate-limiting within the TOTP validity window. But this protection can be bypassed if the attacker understands how Vault sets its TTL threshold:</p>



<pre><code>passcodeTTL := time.Duration(int64(time.Second) * int64(totpSecret.Period))</code></pre>



<p>This default is <strong>30 seconds</strong>, matching the default TOTP period. But due to skew, passcodes may remain valid for <strong>up to 60 seconds</strong>, spanning two time windows.</p>



<p>This creates a strategy:</p>



<ul>
<li>Hit the rate limit</li>



<li>Wait out the 30-second TTL</li>



<li>Resubmit the same code (still within skew window)</li>



<li><strong>Authentication succeeds</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><br><strong>Bug 3.2 – Rate-limiting bypass via entity switching</strong></p>



<p>Vault enforces rate limits <strong>per </strong><code>EntityID</code>, but the <code>usedCodes</code> cache is <strong>global</strong>. This creates a loophole:</p>



<ol>
<li>One entity hits the rate limit while brute-forcing</li>



<li>A second entity submits the same (space-padded) passcode</li>



<li><strong>Rate-limit doesn’t apply</strong></li>
</ol>



<p id="CVE-2025-6013">Even worse, <strong>CVE-2025-6013</strong>, which we discovered and described above, allows LDAP users to generate multiple <code>EntityIDs</code> for the same identity. So even if Vault enforced rate limits per <code>EntityID</code> (which it doesn’t), attackers could still rotate <code>EntityIDs</code> to keep attacking.</p>



<p id="CVE-2025-6016"><br><strong>CVE-2025-6016 – Aggregated logic flaws weaken MFA</strong></p>



<p>All these flaws combine into a dangerous scenario.</p>



<p>An attacker can:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Enumerate </strong>used passcodes by probing for error messages</li>



<li><strong>Evade </strong>rate-limiting by either:
<ul>
<li>Switching entities</li>



<li>Waiting out the TTL window</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Bypass </strong>one-time-use protection via space manipulation</li>



<li><strong>Submit </strong>the correct passcode to authenticate without triggering defenses</li>
</ol>



<p>Despite TOTP being configured as a second factor, Vault’s logic flaws allowed attackers to <strong>brute-force MFA codes </strong>within a small time window.</p>



<p><strong>Why it matters</strong></p>



<p>These flaws significantly reduced the effectiveness of MFA in Vault, enabling attackers to bypass protections like rate-limiting and one-time-use enforcement, and in some configurations, guess valid TOTP codes without triggering MFA challenges as expected.</p>



<p>Step 4 – Certificate-based authentication and entity impersonation</p>



<p>In Vault, TLS certificate authentication is commonly used for machine-to-machine scenarios, allowing automated services, infrastructure components, or nodes to securely identify themselves.</p>



<p>To enable cert-based authentication, users configure it through the Vault UI or API:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1243" height="811" src="https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hashicorp-3.webp" alt="" srcset="https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hashicorp-3.webp 1243w, https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hashicorp-3-300x196.webp 300w, https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hashicorp-3-1024x668.webp 1024w, https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hashicorp-3-768x501.webp 768w, https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hashicorp-3-372x243.webp 372w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1243px) 100vw, 1243px"></figure>



<p>Once enabled, Vault’s <code>cert</code> method supports two modes:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>CA mode</strong> – Trust any certificate issued by a configured Certificate Authority (CA)</li>



<li><strong>Non-CA mode</strong> – Trust only a specific pinned certificate, verified by public key</li>
</ol>



<p>In both cases, Vault maps the TLS client certificate to an <code>EntityID</code> using the authentication mount path and the Common Name (CN) from the certificate.</p>



<p>(auth mount path, alias.Name)</p>



<p>The value of <code>alias.Name</code> is taken from the Common Name (CN) field of the client certificate presented during the TLS handshake, not from the certificate configured in Vault:</p>



<pre><code>Alias: &amp;logical.Alias{
    Name: clientCerts[0].Subject.CommonName,
}</code></pre>



<p>In CA mode, this behavior makes sense – CNs vary and can’t be predicted in advance. But in non-CA mode, this introduces a dangerous blind spot.</p>



<p><strong>What we looked for</strong></p>



<p>We examined how Vault maps identities in cert-based authentication, particularly in non-CA mode, to identify potential mismatches between trust and identity resolution.</p>



<p><strong>What we found</strong></p>



<p>We discovered a logic flaw in Vault’s non-CA certificate authentication: Vault verifies only that the TLS client certificate’s public key matches the pinned certificate, but does not verify that the CN matches as well.</p>



<p id="CVE-2025-6037"><strong>CVE-2025-6037 – Certificate entity impersonation</strong></p>



<p>In non-CA mode, an attacker who has access to the private key of a pinned certificate can:</p>



<ul>
<li>Present a certificate with the correct public key</li>



<li>Modify the CN in the client certificate to any arbitrary value</li>



<li>Cause Vault to assign the resulting <code>alias.Name</code> to that CN</li>
</ul>



<p>Because Vault maps this alias to an <code>EntityID</code>, the attacker is now authenticated as any identity whose alias matches the forged CN.</p>



<p>This allows impersonation of other machine identities, inheriting:</p>



<ul>
<li>Policies tied to the spoofed <code>EntityID</code></li>



<li>Policies from associated <code>Identity Groups</code></li>
</ul>



<p>Even though policies directly tied to a specific certificate remain inaccessible, in many deployments, <code>EntityID</code> – linked policies may be sufficient to escalate access or retrieve secrets.</p>



<p><strong>Why it matters</strong></p>



<p>Vault’s trust model depends on accurate identity mapping. This vulnerability breaks that assumption by allowing any private-key holder of a pinned cert to impersonate other machine identities, a severe breach of trust.</p>



<p>In environments where certificates govern automated secret retrieval, service orchestration, or backend access control, this opens the door to full lateral compromise.</p>



<p>Step 5 – Escalating from admin to root</p>



<p>So far, we’ve focused on breaking Vault’s authentication surface, through <code>userpass</code>, <code>LDAP</code>, <code>MFA</code>, and <code>cert</code>.</p>



<p>Now we turn to what happens after authentication: what can a legitimate user do? In this section, we show how an admin-level user can escalate privileges and obtain a root token, despite the boundaries the Vault trust model is designed to enforce.</p>



<p>The Vault trust model is one that relies on strict role separation. Even users with admin-level tokens are restricted from performing certain privileged actions. But that boundary can break.</p>



<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>



<p>Vault uses a policy-based authorization system. Each identity or token is granted permissions through attached policies.</p>



<p>Two built-in policies define access boundaries:</p>



<ul>
<li><code>default:</code> minimal access</li>



<li><code>root:</code> full administrative control, including audit logging, plugin registration, encryption key rotation, and system reconfiguration</li>
</ul>



<p>To prevent misuse, Vault includes a hardcoded restriction to block assignment of the <code>root</code> policy. This protection applies at all expected enforcement points, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>During user login</li>



<li>When modifying an identity (<code>EntityID</code>) via Vault’s identity API</li>
</ul>



<p>To assign policies to an identity, Vault provides the following endpoint:</p>



<p><code>POST /v1/identity/entity/id/{entity_id}</code></p>



<p>This endpoint allows modification of the attached policy set for a given <code>EntityID</code>. It’s powerful and typically reserved for high-privilege users.</p>



<p>Vault includes a safeguard to prevent abuse:</p>



<pre><code>if strutil.StrListContains(entity.Policies, "root") {
    return logical.ErrorResponse("policies cannot contain root"), nil
}</code></pre>



<p>This hardcoded check explicitly blocks requests that attempt to assign the <code>root</code> policy, or so it seems.</p>



<p><strong>What we looked for</strong></p>



<p>With initial access achieved, we turned our attention to potential escalation paths, particularly whether admin users could gain root.</p>



<p>We uncovered a <strong>logic flaw</strong> in how Vault normalizes policy names, one that lets an attacker escalate from <strong>admin to root</strong> by bypassing its most explicitly protected gate.</p>



<p><strong>What we found</strong></p>



<p id="CVE-2025-5999"><strong>CVE-2025-5999 – Root privilege escalation via policy normalization</strong></p>



<p>During request evaluation (e.g., when a token is used to access an endpoint), Vault performs policy merging and normalization. The relevant code:</p>



<pre><code>auth.Policies = policyutil.SanitizePolicies(append(te.Policies, identityPolicies[te.NamespaceID]...))</code></pre>



<p>Inside <code>SanitizePolicies</code>, this logic appears:</p>



<pre><code>p = strings.ToLower(strings.TrimSpace(p))</code></pre>



<p>This introduces a subtle but powerful mismatch:</p>



<ul>
<li>The <strong>validation</strong> layer checks for <code>"root"</code>  – exactly as written</li>



<li>The <strong>enforcement</strong> layer normalizes input by trimming and lowercasing</li>
</ul>



<p>That means the following inputs:</p>



<ul>
<li><code>" root"</code> (with a space)</li>



<li><code>"ROOT"</code> (uppercase)</li>
</ul>



<p>Because these variations aren’t blocked by the validation check, they pass through and are then normalized to ‘root’ during enforcement.</p>



<p>So, if an attacker submits a request assigning <code>" root"</code> as a policy, it silently passes the block and becomes <code>root</code> in practice.</p>



<p>Vault will now treat the token as having full administrative privileges.</p>



<p><strong>Why it matters</strong></p>



<p>This logic flaw allows an attacker with admin-level access to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Authenticate and obtain a valid token</li>



<li>Submit a request to <code>POST /v1/identity/entity/id/{entity_id}</code> with <code>" root"</code> in the policy list</li>



<li>Bypass the hardcoded <code>root</code> check</li>



<li>Gain <strong>root privileges</strong> after the policy is normalized at runtime</li>
</ul>



<p>This bypass targets one of the <strong>most tightly protected controls in Vault</strong> and succeeds without crashing the service, triggering alarms, or touching memory. It’s a clean, silent privilege escalation.</p>



<p>Step 6 – Remote code execution via plugin interface abuse</p>



<p>In the previous step, we demonstrated how an admin-level user can escalate to root token privileges.</p>



<p>From there, the next logical step was to investigate whether that level of access could be used to achieve code execution, specifically, to abuse Vault’s internal interfaces in order to run arbitrary commands on the server.</p>



<p><strong>What we looked for</strong></p>



<p>From root, we explored whether code execution was possible for an attacker with elevated access, specifically via Vault’s plugin system.</p>



<p><strong>What we found</strong></p>



<p>Vault supports loading custom plugins – binaries that provide secret engines, auth methods, or other extensible functionality.&nbsp;These plugins are stored in a predefined <code>plugin_directory</code>, which is configured during setup and cannot be modified at runtime.</p>



<p>During our testing, we discovered a method for creating and loading an attacker-controlled plugin.</p>



<p><strong>CVE-2025-6000 – RCE via plugin catalog abuse</strong></p>



<p>To create and load a new plugin, an attacker must achieve five goals:</p>



<ol>
<li>Create a controlled file on disk</li>



<li>Locate the configured <code>plugin_directory</code></li>



<li>Place the controlled file inside <code>plugin_directory</code></li>



<li>Assign execute permissions to the file</li>



<li>Know the SHA256 hash of the file contents in advance (required to load a plugin)</li>
</ol>



<p><strong>Step 1 – Writing a payload to disk</strong></p>



<p>Vault encrypts nearly all user-controlled content, including secrets and metadata.</p>



<p>Even when storing data through the API, the resulting file is encoded and wrapped in structured formats.</p>



<p>There’s no way to get raw bytes written directly to disk . . . except in one place:</p>



<p><strong>Audit logs.</strong></p>



<p>Audit logs are written in plaintext, not encrypted. And while each entry is a structured JSON object, we discovered something surprising:</p>



<p><strong>Vault’s audit log system supports a “prefix” – a string prepended to every log entry.</strong></p>



<p>We set the prefix to a payload like <code>#!/bin/bash\n...</code> and let Vault write the rest. The JSON body that follows is ignored by Bash. All that matters is that the script starts with a valid shebang and executable code.</p>



<p><strong>Step 2 – Locating the </strong><code>plugin_directory</code></p>



<p>The <code>plugin_directory </code>configuration is used only for loading plugins. So, to locate it, our best bet was to examine the plugin loading endpoint:</p>



<p><code>POST /v1/sys/plugins/catalog/:type/:name.</code></p>



<p>We experimented with it to understand how plugin loading works and what the code flow looks like. During testing, we found that when attempting to load a non-existent binary, the endpoint returns an error message, and that message includes the full path to the <code>plugin_directory</code>.</p>



<p>For example, when we tried to load the binary <code>invalid91cad96-b8e6-4f5b-9359-ad20fe5815c4</code>, we got:</p>



<pre><code>Loading plugin invalid91cad96-b8e6-4f5b-9359-ad20fe5815c4&nbsp;
Got error:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * error while validating the command path: lstat /Users/yarpo/Desktop/vaults/hashicorp/config/plugins/invalid91cad96-b8e6-4f5b-9359-ad20fe5815c4: no such file or directory&nbsp;</code></pre>



<p><strong>Step 3 – Writing to the plugin directory</strong></p>



<p>Now that we had the <code>plugin_directory</code> we wanted to write our audit file to there.</p>



<p>Fortunately, Vault allows configuring the audit backend to write logs to any absolute file path.</p>



<p>We set:</p>



<ul>
<li><code>file_path</code> = inside the plugin directory</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Step 4 – Getting execute permissions</strong></p>



<p>Vault doesn’t load just any file as a binary. The file must have execute permissions in order to be loaded as a plugin.</p>



<p>This turned out to be the most unexpected and critical part. When configuring the audit log file, there is an option to set the file’s mode. and this includes support for executable modes.</p>



<p>So we set:</p>



<ul>
<li><code>mode = 0755</code></li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> Using the audit logs, we can create a file with arbitrary contents matching a regex, write it to any absolute <code>file_path</code>, and assign it executable permissions.</p>



<p><strong>Step 5 – Capturing the hash</strong></p>



<p>In the registration phase, a SHA256 of the binary must be provided. This might sound simple, but for our audit log approach, it presents a challenge: audit logs include timestamps and other unpredictable values, making it impossible to precompute the hash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To solve this, we configured multiple audit backends simultaneously.</p>



<p>We added a second backend that streamed logs to a TCP socket we controlled. This gave us a real-time copy of the exact file content, allowing us to compute the correct SHA256 after the file was written.</p>



<p><strong>Full exploit flow</strong></p>



<ol>
<li>Attempt to load a non-existent plugin → Vault returns an error that reveals the full <code>plugin_directory</code> path.</li>



<li>Enable a file-based audit backend with:</li>
</ol>



<ul>
<li><code>file_path = inside plugin_directory</code></li>



<li>mode = 0755</li>
</ul>



<ol>
<li><code>prefix = Bash payload</code> <strong>Send request</strong> → Vault writes executable Bash file.</li>



<li>Capture file content from the socket → Compute SHA256.</li>



<li><strong>Register the plugin</strong> using the correct hash.</li>



<li>Vault executes it → <strong>RCE achieved</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<p>Default -&gt; RCE (CVE-2025-6037, CVE-2025-5999, CVE-2025-6000):</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/HashiCorpRCE-1.mp4"></video></figure>



<p><strong>Why it matters</strong></p>



<p>This vulnerability chains together multiple trusted Vault components – audit logging, file permissions, plugin registration, to break critical security boundaries.</p>



<p>The ability to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Write a file to disk</li>



<li>Control its contents via a hidden prefix feature</li>



<li>Set its mode to executable</li>



<li>Compute its hash</li>



<li>And execute it as a plugin</li>
</ul>



<p>translates into a full remote code execution with no memory corruption or native code injection.</p>



<p>CVE-2025-6000 is <strong>the first public RCE reported in Vault</strong>, even though the underlying risk had been present for nearly a decade.</p>



<p><strong>Post-exploitation scenarios</strong></p>



<p>With RCE in Vault, an attacker gains complete control, but what they do next depends on their intent. We highlight two realistic post-exploitation strategies observed during testing.</p>



<p><strong>Vault ransomware</strong></p>



<p>Vault stores all critical state – including secrets, tokens, and policies, encrypted on disk. One of the key components required for decryption is the file:</p>



<ul>
<li><code>core/hsm/_barrier-unseal-keys</code></li>
</ul>



<p>If this file is deleted, Vault permanently loses access to its encryption key, rendering the remaining data unreadable – even to administrators.</p>



<p>By removing a single file, an attacker can flip Vault’s encryption model on its head, turning it from a security mechanism into a ransomware vector.</p>



<p><strong>Stealthy path: audit-free persistence</strong></p>



<p>In Vault Enterprise, the <strong>Control Group</strong> feature is designed to enforce multi-approver workflows for sensitive operations. But with RCE, this mechanism can be subverted for stealth.</p>



<p>By writing custom control group files directly to disk, an attacker can abuse the system to send HTTP requests and receive responses without being audited. This results in persistent, low-visibility access that bypasses oversight.</p>



<p>This abuse was discovered through black-box testing, as Control Group is exclusive to Vault Enterprise and not openly documented.</p>



<h2>Putting it all together: impact and attack paths</h2>



<p>This research exposes critical weak points in Vault’s trust and identity model – flaws that, under real-world conditions, form exploitable attack paths and can drive devastating results.</p>



<p>Each issue stands on its own, but when combined, they open the door to high-impact compromise scenarios.</p>



<p>In practice, a determined attacker may be able to chain together multiple vulnerabilities, depending on configuration, permissions, and persistence level.</p>



<p>Below are three realistic attack paths, based on common authentication methods:</p>



<p>1. <code>userpass</code> attack path (high-effort, persistent attacker)</p>



<ul>
<li>Enumerate valid usernames via error message mismatch</li>



<li>Bypass lockout using case variation</li>



<li>Bypass TOTP MFA rate limits and one-time-use protection</li>



<li><em>(If the compromised user has admin privileges)</em> → escalate to <code>root</code> via policy normalization</li>



<li>Achieve RCE via audit log and plugin abuse</li>
</ul>



<p>This path is difficult and requires persistence, but it’s viable, especially if MFA policies are weak and admin tokens are in use.</p>



<p>2. <code>ldap</code> attack path (config-dependent)</p>



<ul>
<li>Bypass lockout using input normalization mismatch</li>



<li>Bypass MFA if <code>username_as_alias=true</code> and MFA is enforced at the <code>EntityID</code> level</li>



<li><em>(If the compromised user has admin privileges)</em> → escalate to <code>root</code></li>



<li>Achieve RCE via plugin interface abuse</li>
</ul>



<p>This scenario depends on specific but common configuration choices</p>



<p>3. <code>cert</code> attack path (targeted impersonation)</p>



<ul>
<li>Impersonate an admin-level user by modifying CN in a certificate with a trusted public key</li>



<li><em>(If the impersonated identity has entity-based policies)</em> → gain admin access</li>



<li>Escalate to <code>root</code></li>



<li>Trigger RCE through audit logging chain</li>
</ul>



<p>This path requires access to the private key of a pinned certificate and benefits from permissive policy binding.</p>



<p>Each of these paths leverages distinct logic flaws in Vault, but all converge at the same critical outcome: <strong>root access and full code execution inside the Vault server</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Why this matters</strong></p>



<p>This research shows how authentication, policy enforcement, and plugin execution can all be subverted through logic bugs, without touching memory, triggering crashes, or breaking cryptography.</p>



<p><strong>These logic vulnerabilities – one of which would qualify as CVSS ‘critical’ –  could be weaponized to exfiltrate secrets, disable access controls, or sabotage infrastructure from within.</strong></p>



<p><strong>It’s a reminder that even without memory safety bugs, logic flaws can open the door to complete compromise.</strong></p>



<h2>How long were these vulnerabilities in Vault?</h2>



<p>As part of our research, we analyzed the history of key vulnerabilities in Vault to understand how long they had existed before our discovery. Two cases stood out:</p>



<p><em>CVE-2025-6037 – Certificate impersonation</em></p>



<p>This vulnerability existed in Vault for over <strong>eight years</strong>. For the first seven years, it was effectively a <strong>full authentication bypass via certificate</strong>, not just impersonation, making it far more severe.</p>



<p>In the past year, the issue appears to have been partially addressed, “downgrading” the bug to impersonation.</p>



<p id="CVE-2025-6000"><em>CVE-2025-6000 – Remote Code Execution</em></p>



<p>This vulnerability has existed in Vault for <strong>nine years</strong>, dating back to the project’s early releases.</p>



<p>This is also the <strong>first public RCE ever reported in Vault</strong>. While there have been issues in adjacent areas before, none previously enabled full command execution on the Vault server.</p>



<h2>Disclosure and response</h2>



<p>At Cyata, we followed a strict responsible disclosure process throughout this research. Every vulnerability was privately reported to HashiCorp with clear documentation, technical detail, and proof-of-concept support.</p>



<p>We worked in close coordination with HashiCorp’s security team to ensure that all issues were understood, addressed, and resolved before any public disclosure – minimizing risk to users and ensuring timely protection.</p>



<p>HashiCorp responded professionally at every stage of the process, engaging constructively and collaborating with us until all findings were fully resolved.</p>



<p>This wasn’t just a technical milestone. It was a deliberate, professional collaboration aimed at protecting the global organizations that rely on Vault.</p>

<li><strong>May 18, 2025</strong> – Cyata submitted the initial disclosure to the HashiCorp security team, covering the majority of the findings. Some issues were still under active investigation.</li>



<li><strong>May 23, 2025</strong> – We followed up with the complete list of confirmed vulnerabilities.</li>



<li><strong>May 24, 2025</strong> – HashiCorp responded with additional questions, primarily focused on the certificate impersonation issue.</li>



<li><strong>May 24 (Evening)</strong> – Cyata sent a detailed technical explanation clarifying the impersonation path.</li>



<li><strong>May 25, 2025</strong> – We shared a full proof-of-concept video demonstrating the certificate impersonation attack in action.</li>



<li><strong>June 12, 2025</strong> – HashiCorp acknowledged and accepted all findings, assigning <strong>nine CVEs</strong> across the reported issues.</li>
</ul>



<p><em>Coordinated patching and resolution</em></p>



<p>HashiCorp moved quickly to develop and release patches for both the Open Source and Enterprise versions of Vault. These fixes were made available to users ahead of public disclosure, ensuring organizations could protect their environments immediately.</p>



<p>Further information from the vendor is available in&nbsp;<a href="https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/hcsec-2025-22-multiple-vulnerabilities-impacting-hashicorp-vault-and-vault-enterprise/76096" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this HashiCorp advisory</a>.</p>



<p>This coordinated response is a model for how security research and vendor collaboration should work – transparent, professional, and impact-driven.</p>



<p>At Cyata, we believe meaningful research doesn’t stop at discovery. It must include responsible coordination, resolution, and ultimately, protection for the infrastructure the world depends on.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>This research reinforces a critical truth – even memory-safe software can fail at the logic level – and when it does, the consequences can be just as severe.</p>



<p>Vault is designed to be the ultimate protector of secrets and infrastructure access. But this work shows how subtle logic bugs in authentication flows, identity resolution, and policy enforcement, can quietly break trust.</p>



<p>And when trust in the vault is broken, the impact is immediate and devastating: attackers can impersonate users, bypass MFA, extract credentials, seize root tokens, and even execute arbitrary commands. With control over Vault, they can hijack internal services, pivot across environments, and hold entire systems hostage, all without triggering conventional alarms.</p>



<p>One of our key takeaways is that vaults must be tested not only against brute-force and interface abuse, but against deep behavioral inconsistencies – edge cases that only emerge when you understand how the system is wired together internally.</p>



<p>Cyata’s research team uncovered these vulnerabilities through manual review, attacker-style reasoning, and persistence. This wasn’t automation. It was a methodical, step-by-step process, reasoning through Vault’s design and asking: where can things go wrong?</p>



<p>The issues uncovered in this research are exceptionally severe, capable of quietly compromising the core layer that organizations rely on to protect everything else.</p>



<p>We believe that research like this is essential – not only to harden individual products, but to help the security community stay one step ahead of attackers.</p>



<p>Because when trust itself is the surface, scrutiny is protection.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The first aceclidine-based eye drop to improve near vision in adults with presbyopia, which affects more than 100 million adults in the US alone, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and will be available within three months.</p><p>Known as VIZZ, from pharmaceutical company LENZ, the drops are an aceclidine ophthalmic solution that effectively treats <a href="https://newatlas.com/medical/vuity-presbyopia-eye-drops/" data-cms-ai="0">presbyopia</a> in adults. The once-daily drops offer relief from blurry near. vision for up to 10 hours.</p><p>"The FDA approval of VIZZ is a defining moment for LENZ and represents a transformative improvement in the available treatment options for the 128 million adults living with blurry near vision in the United States," said Eef Schimmelpennink, President and Chief Executive Officer of LENZ Therapeutics. "This significant milestone is the result of tremendous commitment and collaboration by the LENZ team and our partners, the dedication of our clinical investigators, and the contributions of hundreds of participants in our clinical trials."</p><p>VIZZ works by gently shrinking the pupil of the eye, using aceclidine. This creates a “pinhole effect” – like narrowing a camera lens — which helps bring nearby objects into sharper focus. Unlike older eye drops, this one does not significantly affect the eye’s focusing muscles, so it doesn’t blur your distance vision or cause that “zoomed-in” effect (aka a myopic shift).</p><p>Ultimately, the drops offer improved reading vision for up to 10 hours, without the need for glasses and, importantly, without the side effects of older treatments.</p><p><a href="https://newatlas.com/medical/vuity-presbyopia-eye-drops/" data-cms-ai="0">In 2021, the very first drops to treat this condition were launched</a> to much acclaim, but there's a reason VIZZ drops are considered first-in-class. Vuity (pilocarpine hydrochloride 1.25%) is a dual-action eye drop that can improve near vision but may cause side effects like brow heaviness or rare vitreoretinal issues due to the ciliary muscle activation. Aceclidine, a pupil-selective miotic, works without significantly stimulating the focusing (ciliary) muscle, creating a pinhole effect – which improves near vision without adverse outcomes seen in Vuity.</p><p>"This FDA approval represents a disruptive paradigm shift in treatment options for millions of people who are frustrated and struggling with the inevitable age-related loss of their near vision," said VIZZ clinical investigator Marc Bloomenstein, from Schwartz Laser Eye Care Center in Scottsdale, Arizona. "I believe this will be a welcome solution for both optometrists and ophthalmologists who will now be able to offer a highly effective and sought-after presbyopia treatment that could immediately become the standard of care, with a product profile that will meet our patients’ needs."</p><p>The FDA approval comes on the back of three randomized, double-masked, controlled Phase II studies featuring hundreds of participants. VIZZ was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events observed in the 30,000-plus treatment days across all three trials. </p><p>Presbyopia is, unfortunately, an inevitable condition associated with aging. Almost everyone over the age of 45 experiences this near-sight vision loss, which gradually gets worse and usually requires correction with glasses or contact lenses. While presbyopia is a gradual condition, it can progress quickly and unexpectedly, making formerly simple tasks of day-to-day tasks like reading instructions or food labels more difficult. </p><p>The therapeutics company said VIZZ is expected to be broadly available in the fourth quarter of 2025, making it the first and only FDA-approved aceclidine-based eye drop for presbyopia treatment. </p><p>"This is uniquely engineered, highly-differentiated and designed to deliver quick onset and lasting benefit for the vast majority of presbyopes," said Schimmelpennink. "As we have shown, this is not only best-in-class, but frankly, the only in a class of pupil selective ciliary-sparing myotics."</p><p>The FDA approval comes based on trial data submitted by the pharmaceutical company, so it's worth noting that published peer-reviewed reports are yet to be published. Peer-reviewed publications often follow regulatory approvals, not precede them, which is common in the field of ophthalmology and dermatology.</p><p>However, the FDA data and guidance can be found <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2025/218585s000lbl.pdf" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">published here</a>.</p><p>Source: <a href="https://ir.lenz-tx.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/39/lenz-therapeutics-announces-us-fda-approval-of-vizz-for-the-treatment-of-presbyopia" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">LENZ Therapeutics</a></p></div></div>]]></description>

This process also apparently happens with Apple CEOs from time to time. If you are on Sequoia and want to keep them for posterity, you can get them out of </p><tt>/System/Library/Extensions/IOStorageFamily.kext/Contents/Resources</tt><p>. I'm still impressed to this day that someone not only took the time to write actually plausible text copy for the label, but also gave it Torx screws. Get out your T8 MacCracker for this drive:

This isn't the only echo of Macs past in the operating system. <a href="https://www.spacebar.news/apple-history-hiding-in-mac-font/">The Spacebar</a> also noticed that Apple Symbols still has many old, nay, "obsolete" icons that are only of use to people who still use web browsers on Power Macs.

That's not the half of it, though. There's a bunch more in that file than the ones he spotted. Here's what I saw; perhaps you can find more.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEisfewYuIj0Id6WTojGA6X6qYfPwz4-aa99S91PZViF4FnVlAEkd1aeAgaTlW_JchYMPtnOa6Mi8R5HGQwlgk1nnqFxBBsLpt_5_ZFkTASDzKJW6LN0Rp-HcJ6fQyGQO_BL2_WBPfWnNL7eVcJyzzeZCUAi8l87ReZ8jeFI-nt6DRVYvM3cTqN9Lwv_8sLg/s2000/charsheet.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="801" data-original-width="2000" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEisfewYuIj0Id6WTojGA6X6qYfPwz4-aa99S91PZViF4FnVlAEkd1aeAgaTlW_JchYMPtnOa6Mi8R5HGQwlgk1nnqFxBBsLpt_5_ZFkTASDzKJW6LN0Rp-HcJ6fQyGQO_BL2_WBPfWnNL7eVcJyzzeZCUAi8l87ReZ8jeFI-nt6DRVYvM3cTqN9Lwv_8sLg/s320/charsheet.png" width="320"></a></p><p>

In order: PowerPC logo, composite video out and in, S-video out and in (such as seen on some later PowerBooks), modem port, combined modem/printer port (like on the Duo 2300), printer port, SCSI, Ethernet (also AAUI), three glyphs for Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) ports, a server, rainbow outline Apple, Balloon Help (from System 7), Apple Guide (7.5), 5.25" floppy (I guess mostly for the Apple II folks), two Newton lightbulbs, Newton undo, Newton extras, Newton dates, Newton names, high-density 3.5" disk icon, a confused Compact Mac (possibly to evoke the flashing question mark when it can't find a bootable volume), classic QuickTime logo, busy watch, Apple Pro Speakers port (such as on the iMac G4 or the MDD G4), FireWire, programmer's key icon, and two versions of the reset icon, though these three do have Unicode equivalents or you can also use regular geometric shapes, and sometimes those faced the other way.
</p><p>
(A note on most of these characters is that they don't actually map to any defined Unicode code point; they are unconnected glyphs. Font Book will show them but you can't really copy them anywhere. A tool like Ultra Character Map will let you at least grab a graphical representation and paste it somewhere, as I have done here.)
</p><p>
But that's not all! Feast your eyes on what's still in <tt>/System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources</tt>!

What's particularly impressive is the <em>multiple sizes</em> for systems with differently sized screens as options. These are taken from the 1024x1024 144dpi retina versions in Sequoia.

and who let this thing in?
</p><p>
Why are all these things still in the macOS? My guess, modulo the Blue Screen PC, is trademark purposes.<i>[A number of people have suggested for network serves; some servers will identify themselves as specific computers, which will pick up an icon in this group, and of course the Windows PC for this purpose is well-known. Fine, except that this archive isn't comprehensive for all the possible Mac models that could have participated as a network share point: no G3s, for example, and no Power Mac G5.]</i> These all were used as Apple-specific labeling and could be considered as part of their trade dress, and having these legacy items still in the macOS probably serves some legal purpose if someone were to try to rip off their old IP. It can't be for nostalgia purposes or we'd still be able to run Carbon PowerPC apps on Tahoe like you can still run most Win32 applications on Windows 11. And Apple just doesn't <em>do</em> nostalgia — except in their ads.

<h2>Rules by Which a Great Empire May Be Reduced to a Small One</h2>
<p>Printed in <span>The Public Advertiser</span>, September 11, 1773; incomplete draft and notes:<a id="BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0001-ptr" href="#BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0001" title="jump to note 6">6</a> American Philosophical Society</p>
<div>
<p>Franklin was pleased with this satire, which was a companion piece to “An Edict by the King of Prussia.”<a id="BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0002-ptr" href="#BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0002" title="jump to note 7">7</a> Both had the virtues, he believed, <a id="BNFN-01-20-02-pb-0390"></a>of brevity, comprehensiveness, and “out-of-the-way forms” that caught attention; but he preferred the “Rules” to the “Edict” for the breadth and variety of its contents and for “a kind of spirited ending of each paragraph.”<a id="BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0003-ptr" href="#BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0003" title="jump to note 8">8</a> His technique in the two was different: in this one he challenged his readers to see their government’s policy through colonial eyes; in the “Edict” he jolted them with the fiction that they were colonists themselves. The two essays had a single purpose, to induce the public to take a fresh look at the American problem. When Parliament reconvened in the autumn, that problem promised to be a major subject of discussion; and the sensational demand from Massachusetts for the removal of Hutchinson and Oliver was sure, when it came before the Privy Council, to provoke a storm. Moderate counsels could never prevail unless the folly of past measures was exposed, and Franklin devoted himself to exposing it. At the top of his satirical bent he could not be ignored, and the initial public reaction to his efforts was gratifying. The issue of the <span>Public Advertiser</span> containing the “Edict” sold out immediately, and both satires were widely reprinted in England and then in America.<a id="BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0004-ptr" href="#BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0004" title="jump to note 9">9</a></p>
<p>What Franklin achieved is another matter. Satire is a poor instrument of persuasion, for the open-minded are likely to be entertained—perhaps shocked—rather than convinced, and the close-minded to be angered. He was aware of the danger. Although he hoped to turn a spotlight on colonial grievances in order to gain redress, he realized that the effect might be to make matters worse.<a id="BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0005-ptr" href="#BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0005" title="jump to note 1">1</a> For him personally that seems to have been the effect. The government dared not mention these attacks for fear of giving them even greater publicity, he concluded later, but they accounted in great part for the official fury unleashed upon him early in 1774.<a id="BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0006-ptr" href="#BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0006" title="jump to note 2">2</a></p>
<p>The substance behind the “Rules” was scarcely new. Franklin had, in more sober fashion, made almost every point before. He touched hardly at all upon the constitutional issues that the Bostonians had set boiling, no doubt because they were difficult to treat satirically; but he marshaled most of the other themes that were his stock in trade as a controversialist. Some related to the colonies in general, some to Massachusetts in particular, and they ran the gamut from old trade restrictions and novel taxes to the oppression wrought by the army <a id="BNFN-01-20-02-pb-0391"></a>and navy; the result was, as he said, comprehensive. These themes were so familiar from long reiteration that in their usual form they might well have evoked no more than a shrug from the British public. By recasting them in the “out-of-the-way” form of satire he gave them a new bite. But the effect was short-lived. The government soon bit him in turn and then—the final irony—legislated many of his “Rules” in the Coercive Acts of 1774.</p>

<div>
<div><p><span>For the</span> Public Advertiser.</p></div>
<p><span>Rules</span> <span>by which a</span> <span>GREAT</span> <span>Empire</span> <span>may be reduced to a</span> <span>SMALL ONE</span>. [Presented privately to a <span>late Minister</span>, when he entered upon his Administration; and now first published.]<a id="BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0007-ptr" href="#BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0007" title="jump to note 3">3</a></p>
<p>An ancient Sage valued himself upon this, that tho’ he could not fiddle, he knew how to make a <span>great City</span> of a <span>little one</span>.<a id="BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0008-ptr" href="#BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0008" title="jump to note 4">4</a> The Science that I, a modern Simpleton, am about to communicate is the very reverse.</p>
<p>I address myself to all Ministers who have the Management of extensive Dominions, which from their very Greatness are become troublesome to govern, because the Multiplicity of their Affairs leaves no Time for <span>fiddling</span>.</p>
<p>I. In the first Place, Gentlemen, you are to consider, that a great Empire, like a great Cake, is most easily diminished at the Edges. Turn your Attention therefore first to your remotest Provinces; that as you get rid of them, the next may follow in Order.</p>
<p>II. That the Possibility of this Separation may always exist, take special Care the Provinces are never incorporated with the Mother Country, that they do not enjoy the same common Rights, the same Privileges in Commerce, and that they are governed by <span>severer</span> Laws, all of <span>your enacting</span>, without allowing them any Share in the Choice of the Legislators. By carefully making and preserving such Distinctions, you will (to keep to my Simile of the Cake) act like a wise Gingerbread Baker, who, to facilitate a Division, cuts his Dough half through in those Places, where, when bak’d, he would have it <span>broken to Pieces</span>.</p>
<p>III. These remote Provinces have perhaps been acquired, purchas’d, or conquer’d, at the <span>sole Expence</span> of the Settlers or their Ancestors, without the Aid of the Mother Country. If this should happen to increase her <span>Strength</span> by their growing Numbers ready to join in her Wars, her <span>Commerce</span> by their growing Demand for her Manufactures, or her <span>Naval Power</span> by greater Employment for her Ships and Seamen, they may probably suppose some Merit in this, and that it entitles them to some Favour; you are therefore to <span>forget it all</span>, or resent it as if they had done you Injury. If they happen to be zealous Whigs, Friends of Liberty, nurtur’d in Revolution Principles, <span>remember all that</span> to their Prejudice, and contrive to punish it: For such Principles, after a Revolution is thoroughly established, are of <span>no more Use</span>, they are even <span>odious</span> and <span>abominable</span>.<a id="BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0009-ptr" href="#BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0009" title="jump to note 5">5</a></p>
<p>IV. However peaceably your Colonies have submitted to your Government, shewn their Affection to your Interest, and patiently borne their Grievances, you are to <span>suppose</span> them always inclined to revolt, and treat them accordingly. Quarter Troops among them, who by their Insolence may <span>provoke</span> the rising of Mobs, and by their Bullets and Bayonets <span>suppress</span> them. By this Means, like the Husband who uses his Wife ill <span>from Suspicion</span>, you may in Time convert your <span>Suspicions</span> into <span>Realities</span>.</p>
<p>V. Remote Provinces must have <span>Governors</span>, and <span>Judges</span>, to represent the Royal Person, and execute every where the delegated Parts of his Office and Authority. You Ministers know, that much of the Strength of Government depends on the <span>Opinion</span> of the People; and much of that Opinion on the Choice of<a id="BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0010-ptr" href="#BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0010" title="jump to note 6">6</a> Rulers placed immediately over them. If you send them wise and good Men for Governors, who study the Interest of the Colonists, and <a id="BNFN-01-20-02-pb-0393"></a>advance their Prosperity, they will think their King wise and good, and that he wishes the Welfare of his Subjects. If you send them learned and upright Men for judges, they will think him a Lover of Justice. This may attach your Provinces more to his Government. You are therefore to be careful who you recommend for those Offices. If you can find Prodigals who have ruined their Fortunes, broken Gamesters or Stock-Jobbers, these may do well as <span>Governors;</span> for they will probably be rapacious, and provoke the People by their Extortions. Wrangling Proctors and petty-fogging Lawyers<a id="BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0011-ptr" href="#BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0011" title="jump to note 7">7</a> too are not amiss, for they will be for ever disputing and quarrelling with their little Parliaments, if withal they should be ignorant, wrong-headed and insolent, so much the better. Attorneys Clerks and Newgate Solicitors will do for <span>Chief-Justices</span>, especially if they hold their Places <span>during your Pleasure</span>: And all will contribute to impress those ideas of your Government that are proper for a People <span>you would wish to renounce it</span>.</p>
<p>VI. To confirm these Impressions, and strike them deeper, whenever the Injured come to the Capital with Complaints of Mal-administration, Oppression, or Injustice, punish such Suitors with long Delay, enormous Expence, and a final Judgment in Favour of the Oppressor. This will have an admirable Effect every Way. The Trouble of future Complaints will be prevented, and Governors and Judges will be encouraged to farther Acts of Oppression and Injustice; and thence the People may become more disaffected, <span>and at length desperate</span>.</p>
<p>VII. When such Governors have crammed their Coffers, and made themselves so odious to the People that they can no longer remain among them with Safety to their Persons, recall and <span>reward</span> them with Pensions. You may make them <span>Baronets</span> too,<a id="BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0012-ptr" href="#BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0012" title="jump to note 8">8</a> if that respectable Order should not think fit to resent it. All will contribute to encourage new Governors in the same Practices, and make the supreme Government <span>detestable</span>.</p>
<p>VIII. If when you are engaged in War, your Colonies should vie in liberal Aids of Men and Money against the common Enemy, upon your simple Requisition, and give far beyond their Abilities, <a id="BNFN-01-20-02-pb-0394"></a>reflect, that a Penny taken from them by your Power is more honourable to you than a Pound presented by their Benevolence. Despise therefore their voluntary Grants, and resolve to harrass them with novel Taxes. They will probably complain to your Parliaments that they are taxed by a Body in which they have no Representative, and that this is contrary to common Right. They will petition for Redress. Let the Parliaments flout their Claims, reject their Petitions, refuse even to suffer the reading of them, and treat the Petitioners with the utmost Contempt. Nothing can have a better Effect, in producing the Alienation proposed; for though many can forgive Injuries, <span>none ever forgave Contempt</span>.</p>
<p>IX. In laying these Taxes, never regard the heavy Burthens those remote People already undergo, in defending their own Frontiers, supporting their own provincial Governments, making new Roads, building Bridges, Churches and other public Edifices, which in old Countries have been done to your Hands by your Ancestors, but which occasion constant Calls and Demands on the Purses of a new People. Forget the <span>Restraints</span> you lay on their Trade for <span>your own</span> Benefit, and the Advantage a <span>Monopoly</span> of this Trade gives your exacting Merchants. Think nothing of the Wealth those Merchants and your Manufacturers acquire by the Colony Commerce; their encreased Ability thereby to pay Taxes at home; their accumulating, in the Price of their Commodities, most of those Taxes, and so levying them from their consuming Customers: All this, and the Employment and Support of thousands of your Poor by the Colonists, you are <span>intirely to forget</span>. But remember to make your arbitrary Tax more grievous to your Provinces, by public Declarations importing that your Power of taxing them has <span>no limits</span>, so that when you take from them without their Consent a Shilling in the Pound, you have a clear Right to the other nineteen. This will probably weaken every Idea of <span>Security in their Property</span>, and convince them that under such a Government <span>they have nothing they can call their own;</span> which can scarce fail of producing <span>the happiest Consequences</span>!<a id="BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0013-ptr" href="#BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0013" title="jump to note 9">9</a></p>
<p>X. Possibly indeed some of them might still comfort themselves, and say, “Though we have no Property, we have yet <span>something</span> left that is valuable; we have constitutional <span>Liberty</span> both <a id="BNFN-01-20-02-pb-0395"></a>of Person and of Conscience. This King, these Lords, and these Commons, who it seems are too remote from us to know us and feel for us, cannot take from us our <span>Habeas Corpus</span> Right, or our Right of Trial <span>by a Jury of our Neighbours:</span> They cannot deprive us of the Exercise of our Religion, alter our ecclesiastical Constitutions, and compel us to be Papists if they please, or Mahometans.” To annihilate this Comfort, begin by Laws to perplex their Commerce with infinite Regulations impossible to be remembered and observed; ordain Seizures of their Property for every Failure; take away the Trial of such Property by Jury, and give it to arbitrary Judges of your own appointing, and of the lowest Characters in the Country, whose Salaries and Emoluments are to arise out of the Duties or Condemnations, and whose Appointments are <span>during Pleasure</span>. Then let there be a formal Declaration of both Houses, that Opposition to your Edicts is <span>Treason</span>, and that Persons suspected of Treason in the Provinces may, according to some obsolete Law, be seized and sent to the Metropolis of the Empire for Trial; and pass an Act that those there charged with certain other Offences shall be sent away in Chains from their Friends and Country to be tried in the same Manner for Felony. Then erect a new Court of Inquisition among them, accompanied by an armed Force, with Instructions to transport all such suspected Persons, to be ruined by the Expence if they bring over Evidences to prove their Innocence, or be found guilty and hanged if they can’t afford it. And lest the People should think you cannot possibly go any farther, pass another solemn declaratory Act, that “King, Lords, and Commons had, hath, and of Right ought to have, full Power and Authority to make Statutes of sufficient Force and Validity to bind the unrepresented Provinces <span>IN ALL CASES WHATSOEVER</span>.” This will include <span>Spiritual</span> with temporal; and taken together, must operate wonderfully to your Purpose, by convincing them, that they are at present under a Power something like that spoken of in the Scriptures, which can not only <span>kill their Bodies</span>, but <span>damn their Souls</span> to all Eternity, by compelling them, if it pleases, <span>to worship the Devil</span>.<a id="BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0014-ptr" href="#BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0014" title="jump to note 1">1</a></p>
<p>XI. To make your Taxes more odious, and more likely to <a id="BNFN-01-20-02-pb-0396"></a>procure Resistance, send from the Capital a Board of Officers to superintend the Collection, composed of the most <span>indiscreet, ill-bred</span> and <span>insolent</span> you can find. Let these have large Salaries out of the extorted Revenue, and live in open grating Luxury upon the Sweat and Blood of the Industrious, whom they are to worry continually with groundless and expensive Prosecutions before the above-mentioned arbitrary Revenue-Judges, all <span>at the Cost of the Party prosecuted</span> tho’ acquitted, because <span>the King is to pay no Costs</span>. Let these Men <span>by your Order</span> be exempted from all the common Taxes and Burthens of the Province, though they and their Property are protected by its Laws. If any Revenue Officers are <span>suspected</span> of the least Tenderness for the People, discard them.<a id="BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0015-ptr" href="#BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0015" title="jump to note 2">2</a> If others are justly complained of, protect and reward them. If any of the Under-officers behave so as to provoke the People to drub them, promote those to better Offices: This will encourage others to procure for themselves such profitable Drubbings, by multiplying and enlarging such Provocations, and <span>all with work towards the End you aim at</span>.</p>
<p>XII. Another Way to make your Tax odious, is to misapply the Produce of it. If it was originally appropriated for the <span>Defence</span> of the Provinces and the better Support of Government, and the Administration of Justice where it may be <span>necessary</span>, then apply none of it to that <span>Defence</span>, but bestow it where it is <span>not necessary</span>, in augmented Salaries or Pensions to every Governor who has distinguished himself by his Enmity to the People, and by calumniating them to their Sovereign. This will make them pay it more unwillingly, and be more apt to quarrel with those that collect it, and those that imposed it, who will quarrel again with them, and all shall contribute to your <span>main Purpose</span> of making them <span>weary of your Government</span>.</p>
<p>XIII. If the People of any Province have been accustomed to support their own Governors and Judges to Satisfaction, you are to apprehend that such Governors and Judges may be thereby influenced to treat the People kindly, and to do them Justice. This is another Reason for applying Part of that Revenue in larger Salaries to such Governors and Judges, given, as their Commissions are, <span>during your Pleasure</span> only, forbidding them to take any <a id="BNFN-01-20-02-pb-0397"></a>Salaries from their Provinces; that thus the People may no longer hope any Kindness from their Governors, or (in Crown Cases) any Justice from their Judges. And as the Money thus mis-applied in one Province is extorted from all, probably <span>all will resent the Misapplication</span>.</p>
<p>XIV. If the Parliaments of your Provinces should dare to claim Rights or complain of your Administration, order them to be harass’d with repeated <span>Dissolutions</span>. If the same Men are continually return’d by new Elections, adjourn their Meetings to some Country Village where they cannot be accommodated, and there keep them <span>during Pleasure;</span> for this, you know, is your <span>Prerogative</span>; and an excellent one it is, as you may manage it, to promote Discontents among the People, diminish their Respect, and <span>increase their Disaffection</span>.</p>
<p>XV. Convert the brave honest Officers of your Navy into pimping Tide-waiters and Colony Officers of the Customs. Let those who in Time of War fought gallantly in Defence of the Commerce of their Countrymen, in Peace be taught to prey upon it. Let them learn to be corrupted by great and real Smugglers; but (to shew their Diligence) scour with armed Boats every Bay, Harbour, River, Creek, Cove or Nook throughout the Coast of your Colonies, stop and detain every Coaster, every Wood-boat, every Fisherman, tumble their Cargoes, and even their Ballast, inside out and upside down; and if a Penn’orth of Pins is found un-entered, let the Whole be seized and confiscated. Thus shall the Trade of your Colonists suffer more from their Friends in Time of Peace, than it did from their Enemies in War. Then let these Boats Crews land upon every Farm in their Way, rob the Orchards, steal the Pigs and Poultry, and insult the Inhabitants. If the injured and exasperated Farmers, unable to procure other Justice, should attack the Agressors, drub them and burn their Boats, you are to call this <span>High Treason</span> and <span>Rebellion</span>, order<a id="BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0016-ptr" href="#BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0016" title="jump to note 3">3</a> Fleets and Armies into their Country, and threaten to carry all the Offenders three thousand Miles to be hang’d, drawn and quartered. <span>O! this will work admirably!</span></p>
<p>XVI. If you are told of Discontents in your Colonies, never believe that they are general, or that you have given Occasion for <a id="BNFN-01-20-02-pb-0398"></a>them; therefore do not think of applying any Remedy, or of changing any offensive Measure. Redress no Grievance, lest they should be encouraged to demand the Redress of some other Grievance. Grant no Request that is just and reasonable, lest they should make another that is unreasonable. Take all your Informations of the State of the Colonies from your Governors and Officers in Enmity with them. Encourage and reward these <span>Leasing-makers;</span><a id="BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0017-ptr" href="#BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0017" title="jump to note 4">4</a> secrete their lying Accusations lest they should be confuted; but act upon them as the clearest Evidence, and believe nothing you hear from the Friends of the People. Suppose all <span>their</span> Complaints to be invented and promoted by a few factious Demagogues, whom if you could catch and hang, all would be quiet. Catch and hang a few of them accordingly; and the <span>Blood of the Martyrs</span> shall <span>work Miracles</span> in favour of your Purpose.</p>
<p>XVII. If you see <span>rival Nations</span> rejoicing at the Prospect of your Disunion with your Provinces, and endeavouring to promote it: If they translate, publish and applaud all the Complaints of your discontented Colonists,<a id="BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0018-ptr" href="#BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0018" title="jump to note 5">5</a> at the same Time privately stimulating you to severer Measures; let not that <span>alarm</span> or offend you. Why should it? since you all mean <span>the same Thing</span>.<a id="BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0019-ptr" href="#BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0019" title="jump to note 6">6</a></p>
<p>XVIII. If any Colony should at their own Charge erect a Fortress to secure their Port against the Fleets of a foreign Enemy, get your Governor to betray that Fortress into your Hands. Never think of paying what it cost the Country, for that would <span>look</span>, at least, like some Regard for Justice; but turn it into a Citadel to awe the Inhabitants and curb their Commerce. If they should have lodged in such Fortress the very Arms they bought <a id="BNFN-01-20-02-pb-0399"></a>and used to aid you in your Conquests, seize them all, ’twill provoke like <span>Ingratitude</span> added to <span>Robbery</span>.<a id="BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0020-ptr" href="#BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0020" title="jump to note 7">7</a> One admirable Effect of these Operations will be, to discourage every other Colony from erecting such Defences, and so their and your Enemies may more easily invade them, to the great Disgrace of your Government, and of course <span>the Furtherance of your Project</span>.<a id="BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0021-ptr" href="#BNFN-01-20-02-0213-fn-0021" title="jump to note 8">8</a></p>
<p>XIX. Send Armies into their Country under Pretence of protecting the Inhabitants; but instead of garrisoning the Forts on their Frontiers with those Troops, to prevent Incursions, demolish those Forts, and order the Troops into the Heart of the Country, that the Savages may be encouraged to attack the Frontiers, and that the Troops may be protected by the Inhabitants: This will seem to proceed from your Ill will or your Ignorance, and contribute farther to produce and strengthen an Opinion among them, <span>that you are no longer fit to govern them</span>.</p>
<p>XX. Lastly, Invest the General of your Army in the Provinces with great and unconstitutional Powers, and free him from the Controul of even your own Civil Governors. Let him have Troops enow under his Command, with all the Fortresses in his Possession; and who knows but (like some provincial Generals in the Roman Empire, and encouraged by the universal Discontent you have produced) he may take it into his Head to set up for himself. If he should, and you have carefully practised these few <span>excellent Rules</span> of mine, take my Word for it, all the Provinces will immediately join him, and you will that Day (if you have not done it sooner) get rid of the Trouble of governing them, and all the <span>Plagues</span> attending their <span>Commerce</span> and Connection from thenceforth and for ever.</p>

His comment must have shocked English readers as much as he intended, for the principles of the Glorious Revolution had developed differently on the two sides of the Atlantic. In England the principle of an omnicompetent crown in Parliament had largely submerged the contractual limitations on government inherent in the Bill of Rights. The colonies, where local autonomy was in tension with control from London, preserved in full force the principle that authority per se was dangerous.

A generation ship is a hypothetical spacecraft designed for long-duration interstellar travel, where the journey may take centuries to complete. The idea behind a generation ship is that the initial crew would live, reproduce, and die on the ship, with their descendants continuing the journey until reaching the destination. These ships are often envisioned as self-sustaining ecosystems, featuring agriculture, habitation, and other necessary life-support systems to ensure survival across multiple generations.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p>The Initiative for Interstellar Studies (i4is) is delighted to reveal the winners of the Project Hyperion Design Competition, a landmark global challenge that called upon interdisciplinary teams to envision a generation ship—a crewed interstellar spacecraft designed for a 250-year journey to a habitable planet. The teams designed habitats of such a spacecraft that would allow a society to sustain itself and flourish in a highly resource-constrained environment.</p>

<p><span><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The Project Hyperion Design Competition required architectural designers, engineers, and social scientists to collaborate and address critical mission aspects that enable a spacecraft to function as a closed society over centuries. The collaboration between different disciplines is key to finding holistic solutions that do justice to the complexity of the requirements, in order to provide:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><span><span><span>Habitability for 1,000 ± 500 people over centuries</span></span></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><span><span>Artificial gravity via rotation</span></span></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><span><span>A society that ensures good living conditions, including essential provisions such as shelter, clothing, and other basic needs.</span></span></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><span><span>Robust life support systems for food, water, waste, and the atmosphere</span></span></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><span><span>Knowledge transfer mechanisms to retain culture and technologies</span></span></span></p>

The use of decoupled artificial gravity through counter-rotating rings is an excellent starting point, showing strong awareness of rotational dynamics and occupant comfort. While the rings are not concentric, which could potentially introduce unwanted torque due to offset centers of gravity, the concept still reflects a solid grasp of key mechanical challenges. The inclusion of maglev-supported habitat wagons enhances system redundancy and safety through multiple pressure vessels. The recognition that curved cylindrical modules would impose structural mass penalties, and the corresponding pivot to straight "sausage"-shaped modules with domed ends, shows a pragmatic engineering approach grounded in realistic structural constraints. Finally, the Mass/Equipment List (MEL) budgets represent a commendable early step in translating the conceptual architecture into quantifiable system requirements.</p></div><div data-mesh-id="comp-mdmwc2hwinlineContent" data-testid="inline-content" id="comp-mdmwc2hw" tabindex="-1" data-block-level-container="ClassicSection"><p id="comp-mdmwi85p" data-testid="richTextElement"><h2><span><span>Team</span></span></h2></p><p>Kyeongjun Na, Haesung Hwang, Hyeonguk Jeon, Hyeonsu Jang, Taemin Eom</p></div><div data-mesh-id="comp-mdmwc4ybinlineContent" data-testid="inline-content" id="comp-mdmwc4yb" tabindex="-1" data-block-level-container="ClassicSection"><p id="comp-mdmwjjka" data-testid="richTextElement"><h2><span><span>Jury feedback</span></span></h2></p><p>Galaxy Express 999 by EBS presents a well-considered approach to social organization, with a practical vision for internal modularity and adaptable living arrangements. The "Negotiopolis" concept is particularly compelling, offering an imaginative civic architecture and a negotiation-based governance model that introduces fresh perspectives on societal structure in an interstellar context. While the design is lighter on technical implementation, it contributes meaningfully to the broader discourse by emphasizing the importance of civic and social aspects. The artificial gravity concept is fundamentally sound, and the linear arrangement of pancake modules along the axis shows clear intent toward modular scalability. Although the pressure vessel design has some limitations—flat-ended cylindrical modules would face significant stress under pressure, requiring heavier structural reinforcement—there is awareness of this issue, as evidenced by partial attempts at incorporating domed ends. A refinement of this aspect, especially for end modules and during descent phases, would strengthen the structural logic. The internal modular system is sensibly developed and shows promise for flexible habitation. Inclusion of a Mass/Equipment List (MEL) would further support the design's technical depth, but the overall concept stands out for its imaginative and socially rich framework.</p></div><div data-mesh-id="comp-mdlanzqyinlineContent" data-testid="inline-content" id="comp-mdlanzqy" tabindex="-1" data-block-level-container="ClassicSection"><p id="comp-mdlanzr46" data-testid="richTextElement"><h2><span><span>Team</span></span></h2></p><p>Antonio Azzolino, Alexandre Goulart, Bianca Montesanti, Juliana Matos, Luciano Ferraresi</p></div><div data-mesh-id="comp-mdlao7s0inlineContent" data-testid="inline-content" id="comp-mdlao7s0" tabindex="-1" data-block-level-container="ClassicSection"><p id="comp-mdlao7s76" data-testid="richTextElement"><h2><span><span>Jury feedback</span></span></h2></p><p>F.A.O.C. presents a strikingly original and compelling concept by embedding a rotating habitat within a mined asteroid shell—a bold architectural move that addresses key deep space challenges with elegance.

One of its most distinctive features is the inclusion of the Five-Point Knowledge Transmission System, which adds a meaningful cultural and educational dimension to the concept—ensuring continuity of knowledge and identity over generations. The design demonstrates good system-level coherence, with particular strengths in its approach to artificial gravity: a rotating toroidal volume paired with two counter-rotating flywheels, enabling efficient spin-up and spin-down using electrical energy rather than propellant. This is a technically sound and elegant solution that enhances long-term sustainability. While the elongated football-shaped geometry provides a striking visual identity. Radiation and impact protection strategies are addressed, including consideration of current TRLs, though the radiation shielding appears less robust compared to leading entries. The use of elliptical minor toroid cross-sections presents potential structural inefficiencies due to internal pressure forces that coulb e mitigated by the integration of residential spheres. Culturally, the concept leans into a somewhat mythical aesthetic. However, many of its themes—particularly those related to legacy and intergenerational knowledge—are highly relevant to interstellar missions. The interior designs contribute to an evocative and atmospheric presentation. The final layout is clean, visually engaging, and easy to navigate.

</p>
  
<p>A few years ago at work, I had a project which offered an opportunity to look at the new generation of async-first, type-hint-driven Python web frameworks. For reasons which aren’t particularly relevant today, on that project I ended up choosing <a href="https://litestar.dev/">Litestar</a>, which is the one that <em>doesn’t</em> have a ravenous all-consuming hype machine surrounding it. And I’m very glad I did, because today I’m more convinced than ever it was the right choice, and for the last 18 months or so every new project I’ve started at my day job has been built with&nbsp;Litestar.</p>
<p>But even if you’re someone who does Python web apps for a living, and even if you’re someone who builds asynchronous type-hint-driven web apps, you might not be familiar with this absolute gem of the Python web ecosystem, and today I want to remedy&nbsp;that.</p>
<h2>A&nbsp;taste</h2>
<p>Here’s the traditional single-file-app&nbsp;demo:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>from</span><span> </span><span>litestar</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>Litestar</span><span>,</span> <span>get</span>


<span>@get</span><span>(</span><span>"/greet"</span><span>)</span>
<span>async</span> <span>def</span><span> </span><span>greet</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>f</span><span>"Hi, </span><span>{</span><span>name</span><span>}</span><span>!"</span>


<span>app</span> <span>=</span> <span>Litestar</span><span>([</span><span>greet</span><span>])</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>You save this&nbsp;as <code>app.py</code>, run&nbsp;with <code>litestar run</code> or hand it directly to the <abbr title="Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface"><span>ASGI</span></abbr> server of your choice, and it launches a web application. You go&nbsp;to <code>/greet?name=Bob</code> and it replies “Hi, Bob!”. Leave out&nbsp;the <code>name</code> parameter and it responds with an <span>HTTP</span> 400 telling you&nbsp;the <code>name</code> parameter is&nbsp;required.</p>
<p>So what. Big deal. The FastAPI Evangelism Strike Force will be along soon to bury you under rocket-ship emoji while explaining that FastAPI does the same thing but a million times better. And if you’re a Java person used to Spring, or a .<span>NET</span>  person used to <span>ASP</span>.<span>NET</span> <span>MVC</span>, well, there’s nothing here that’s new to you; you’ve had this style of annotation/signature-driven framework for years (and in fact one thing I like about Litestar is how often it reminds me of the good parts of those frameworks). And did anyone tell you FastAPI does this, too!&nbsp;🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>
<p>But there are a lot of things that make Litestar stand out to me in the Python world. I’m going to pick out three to talk about today, and one of them is hiding in plain sight in that simple example&nbsp;application.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>What’s in a&nbsp;name?</strong></p>
<p>You might see older material referring to Litestar as “Starlite”, which was its original&nbsp;name.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.starlette.io/">Starlette</a> is a toolkit for doing async Python web development, which can be used standalone or as a component in a more complex library or framework. FastAPI still uses Starlette under the hood, for example. And Litestar originally was built on Starlette too, and was named “Starlite”, presumably in recognition of that. Over time, though, it dropped the Starlette dependency in favor of its own implementations for that functionality, and people on social media complained that the “Starlite” name was confusing, especially since Star<em>lette</em> was no longer being used. So the project which had been “Starlite” was renamed to Litestar for version 2.0, released in 2023, and has had that name ever&nbsp;since.</p>
</div>
<h3>Scaling (the other&nbsp;kind)</h3>
<p>It’s a bit unfortunate that the term “scaling” is almost always assumed to mean handling larger and larger quantities of traffic, because that’s only one axis on which any given piece of of technology can “scale” (and, I’d argue, possibly the least important one). The type of scaling I want to talk about here is scaling of a codebase: how does something (in this case, a web framework) help or hinder you as you deal with different amounts of&nbsp;code?</p>
<p>Django, for example, has a reputation for not scaling “down” all that well. You <em>can</em> do it if you really want to, and every so often someone will come up with a new demo of doing a Django project in a single Python file, but it’s just not something that comes naturally to Django. Quite the opposite: if you work through the official beginner Django tutorial and do things the “Django way”, you’ll have around a dozen files laid out in a specific structure of directories and subdirectories before you’ve written a single meaningful line of your own&nbsp;code. </p>
<p>But “micro” frameworks have often had the opposite problem: they’re great at starting out with a tiny single-file application, and then get painful as your codebase grows and needs to spread out (single-file Django approaches have the same problem: you have to do a lot of work to get a “micro-Django” working, and then you have to <em>undo</em> all that work as soon as the code grows large enough to be worth splitting across multiple&nbsp;files).</p>
<p>Let’s look at an example. Here’s a FastAPI equivalent of the basic Litestar application I showed&nbsp;above:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>from</span><span> </span><span>fastapi</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>FastAPI</span>


<span>app</span> <span>=</span> <span>FastAPI</span><span>()</span>

<span>@app</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"/greet"</span><span>)</span>
<span>async</span> <span>def</span><span> </span><span>greet</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>f</span><span>"Hello, </span><span>{</span><span>name</span><span>}</span><span>!"</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Notice that&nbsp;the <code>get()</code> decorator here is attached to the application object. This is a common pattern (Flask/Quart do the same thing, for example, and Starlette used to but has deprecated its entire decorator-based routing system), but it creates a problem once you have multiple files. You need to import the main application object into the other files in order to decorate the routes, but you need to import the other files into your “main” application file to make sure the route registrations are visible from there, and now you have a circular import, and that doesn’t&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>The general solution these frameworks offer is some sort of alternative sub-application object which can act as a per-file route registry that’s safe to import into the file where your application object is defined. FastAPI calls this object an “<span>API</span> router”; Flask/Quart call it a “blueprint”. Either way, it’s a necessary construct for those frameworks because their route decorators are always bound to some parent object, either the application object in a single-file app or an “<span>API</span> router”/“blueprint”/etc. object in a multi-file&nbsp;app.</p>
<p>That solves the circular-import problem, but creates a new issue: the whiz-bang quickstart demos of “micro” frameworks generally register all the example routes on the application object in a single file in order to keep everything as simple and flashy as possible, but now in order to build a real application (which will almost never stay in a single file) you’ll need to use a different mechanism, or start out following the demo and then switch later on. You also have to <em>know</em> about that different mechanism; in one framework’s documentation that I looked at, you can (at the time I’m writing this post) apparently get 40 pages into the user guide before encountering the section on how to register routes in a multi-file app&nbsp;😖😖😖.</p>
<p>Litestar avoids this entire mess by having the route decorators be standalone functions, not bound to a parent application or application-like object. This may seem like a small thing to focus on, but if you’ve spent time with popular Python microframeworks you’ve probably had to deal with the transition from single- to multi-file&nbsp;applications.</p>
<p>More importantly, this small change in approach frees up Litestar’s documentation to introduce route-grouping constructs early on and to present them as part of <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/applications.html#layered-architecture">a coherent layered architecture/configuration concept</a> rather than as an escape hatch for avoiding circular imports. Which is great, because Litestar’s layered architecture is one of its best features: its grouping constructs, and their ability to share configuration, offer an elegant way to compose functionality. For example, a common pattern I use when writing a set of <abbr title="Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete"><span>CRUD</span></abbr> endpoints looks like&nbsp;this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>from</span><span> </span><span>litestar</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>Router</span>
<span>from</span><span> </span><span>litestar.di</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>Provide</span>

<span># Imagine some CRUD routes for widgets defined here...</span>

<span>_write_widget_router</span> <span>=</span> <span>Router</span><span>(</span>
    <span>guards</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>some_auth_function</span><span>],</span>
    <span>route_handlers</span><span>=</span><span>[</span>
        <span>create_widget</span><span>,</span>
        <span>delete_widget</span><span>,</span>
        <span>update_widget</span><span>,</span>
    <span>]</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>widget_router</span> <span>=</span> <span>Router</span><span>(</span>
    <span>dependencies</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>"widget_dependency"</span><span>:</span> <span>Provide</span><span>(</span><span>some_widget_dependency</span><span>)},</span>
    <span>path</span><span>=</span><span>"/widgets"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>route_handlers</span><span>=</span><span>[</span>
        <span>get_widget</span><span>,</span>
        <span>get_widget_list</span><span>,</span>
        <span>_write_widget_router</span><span>,</span>
    <span>]</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This provides a single&nbsp;“public” <code>Router</code> instance with all the widget routes, all of which have access to the same core dependencies, but with the data-modifying routes also having auth applied. That composability is extremely powerful, and is less obvious if the “router” has to be introduced initially as a way to solve circular-import&nbsp;problems.</p>
<p>Litestar’s approach also means it’s easy to do things like register a single route multiple times, each with different configuration. Which enables use cases&nbsp;like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Different authentication/authorization schemes for each registration. For example, a data-editing route might be written once, and registered once under a router which applies <span>API</span> key auth for machine-to-machine requests, then registered again under a router which uses session auth for interaction by a human&nbsp;user.</li>
<li>Different sets of dependencies for each registration. For example, a route which queries and returns a list of widgets might just declare that it accepts an argument of&nbsp;type <code>WidgetRepository</code>, and leave it up to the router configuration to decide whether to dependency-inject one that sees all widgets, or perhaps only a subset, or only those which are active,&nbsp;etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you know what you’re doing, you can emulate some of this in the FastAPI/Flask style of bound route registration, but the techniques you’ll end up using for that feel to me like fighting against the framework, which is something I usually want to&nbsp;avoid.</p>
<h2>Not to be too&nbsp;Pydantic</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/">Pydantic</a> is a popular package for defining schema objects which perform validation and serialization/deserialization, driven by Python type annotations, and one major use case for this is the input/output schemas of web applications. FastAPI appears to use Pydantic exclusively, which comes with both upsides and downsides. Pydantic is very useful and very powerful, of course, but it also means FastAPI is somewhat limited by what Pydantic can support: mostly, this is Pydantic’s own classes, and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html">the Python standard&nbsp;library’s <code>dataclasses</code></a>.</p>
<p>One crucial limitation is an inability to derive validation/serialization behavior directly from <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span>ORM</span></abbr> classes, even though they both support a very similar type-annotation-based declaration format. Which means that to use SQLAlchemy with a Pydantic-only framework (and SQLAlchemy is basically <em>the</em> standard database toolkit and <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span>ORM</span></abbr> for Python), you either have to write out the shape of your data multiple times—once for SQLAlchemy, and then at least one more time (possibly more than one time) for Pydantic—or turn to a third-party package to help bridge the gap. FastAPI’s author worked around this by writing <a href="https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/">a new <span>DB</span> toolkit which combines SQLAlchemy and Pydantic</a>, and pushing it in FastAPI’s&nbsp;documentation.</p>
<p>Litestar, meanwhile, <em>supports</em> Pydantic, but is not <em>tightly coupled to</em> Pydantic, which gives a bit more flexibility. By default Litestar lets you define input/output schemas using Pydantic&nbsp;models, <code>dataclasses</code>, or <a href="https://jcristharif.com/msgspec/">msgspec</a>; ships with plugins to enable the use of <a href="https://www.attrs.org/">attrs</a> and of SQLAlchemy models; and <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/plugins/index.html#serializationpluginprotocol">provides a protocol for writing your own serialization plugins</a> to extend support to other kinds of&nbsp;objects.</p>
<p>That’s very convenient already, but the convenience is amplified by Litestar’s <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/dto/1-abstract-dto.html">system for automatically deriving data-transfer objects</a> from data-access or domain objects. Suppose, for example, that we have the following SQLAlchemy model&nbsp;class:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>from</span><span> </span><span>sqlalchemy.orm</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>DeclarativeBase</span><span>,</span> <span>Mapped</span><span>,</span> <span>mapped_column</span>

<span>Base</span> <span>=</span> <span>DeclarativeBase</span><span>()</span>

<span>class</span><span> </span><span>Widget</span><span>(</span><span>Base</span><span>):</span>
    <span>__tablename__</span> <span>=</span> <span>"widget"</span>

    <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>Mapped</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>mapped_column</span><span>(</span><span>primary_key</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
    <span>internal_notes</span><span>:</span> <span>Mapped</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]</span>
    <span>sku</span><span>:</span> <span>Mapped</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>mapped_column</span><span>(</span><span>unique</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>Mapped</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]</span>
    <span>price_cents</span><span>:</span> <span>Mapped</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In a Pydantic-only world, we’d need to write multiple Pydantic models representing different use&nbsp;cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>A “read” schema for use in <span>HTTP</span> responses, which would probably not include&nbsp;the <code>internal_notes</code> field and probably also&nbsp;not <code>id</code> (since <code>sku</code> is more likely to be the public&nbsp;identifier)</li>
<li>A “write” schema for creating widgets, which would&nbsp;exclude <code>id</code> since that likely is auto-generated on&nbsp;insert</li>
<li>Another “write” schema for updating widgets, setting all fields optional to allow partial&nbsp;update</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as possibly more schemas like an admin-view “read” schema that does include the internal fields, etc. Even if you get clever and use inheritance to share field definitions among all these Pydantic classes, you still will write out the full set of fields for widgets at least twice, and the second time it will be fragmented across multiple Pydantic classes, creating the risk of making a change to the <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span>ORM</span></abbr> model and forgetting to update all the corresponding field definitions in the Pydantic&nbsp;models.</p>
<p>Litestar’s approach is a significant improvement on this. For example, here’s how to use Litestar’s <abbr title="Data Transfer Object"><span>DTO</span></abbr> helpers to define the “read”&nbsp;schema:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>from</span><span> </span><span>litestar.dto</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>DTOConfig</span>
<span>from</span><span> </span><span>litestar.plugins.sqlalchemy</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>SQLAlchemyDTO</span>

<span>class</span><span> </span><span>ReadWidget</span><span>(</span><span>SQLAlchemyDTO</span><span>[</span><span>Widget</span><span>]):</span>
    <span>config</span> <span>=</span> <span>DTOConfig</span><span>(</span><span>exclude</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>"id"</span><span>,</span> <span>"internal_notes"</span><span>})</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This will give you a <abbr title="Data Transfer Object"><span>DTO</span></abbr> class containing all the fields of&nbsp;the <code>Widget</code> <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span>ORM</span></abbr> model <em>except</em> the two explicitly excluded, and will derive that set of fields, and the correct data types, from&nbsp;introspecting <code>Widget</code>. It will also automatically handle conversion to and from instances&nbsp;of <code>Widget</code> when you specify it as the input or return <abbr title="Data Transfer Object"><span>DTO</span></abbr> type of a route. Similarly, it’s possible to declare a list of fields to include, or to re-map field names for public consumption, or to declare a <abbr title="Data Transfer Object"><span>DTO</span></abbr> which makes fields optional for partial updates. This means there’s only one canonical definition of the fields—on the original class, which might be a SQLAlchemy <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span>ORM</span></abbr> model, might be&nbsp;a <code>dataclass</code>, etc.—and it doesn’t have to be repeated in the DTOs because the DTOs will always derive their field definitions directly from the source class you point them&nbsp;at.</p>
<p>Of course, there are going to be cases where your DTOs are sufficiently different from your DAOs and domain objects that this isn’t a big help, but my own experience is that “the <abbr title="Data Transfer Object"><span>DTO</span></abbr> is a subset of the <abbr title="Data Access Object"><span>DAO</span></abbr>’s fields” is extremely common in real-world applications, so Litestar’s approach really pays off in both reduced boilerplate and reduced errors from manual “transcription” of fields between different class&nbsp;definitions.</p>
<h2>Alchemical&nbsp;architecture</h2>
<p>I wasn’t exaggerating earlier when I said that SQLAlchemy is <em>the</em> database toolkit and <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span>ORM</span></abbr> for Python. While there are others out there, the only one I’m aware of that sees anything close to SQLAlchemy’s usage is the Django <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span>ORM</span></abbr>, and only because it’s built into and tightly integrated with Django. So if you’re going to be writing a database-backed web application in Python, and you’re not doing Django, you are almost certainly going to be using&nbsp;SQLAlchemy.</p>
<p>And Litestar makes that easy. While officially remaining agnostic as to whether you even have a persistence layer, it still includes good integrations for SQLAlchemy: the serialization plugin mentioned earlier allows the direct use of SQLAlchemy <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span>ORM</span></abbr> classes as input and output schemas; the <abbr title="Data Transfer Object"><span>DTO</span></abbr> helpers can derive subsets and remappings of fields from SQLAlchemy <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span>ORM</span></abbr> classes; and Litestar also ships with <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/databases/sqlalchemy/plugins/sqlalchemy_init_plugin.html">a plugin that manages a SQLAlchemy engine and per-request <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span>ORM</span></abbr> session for you</a>, as well as <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/databases/sqlalchemy/plugins/sqlalchemy_plugin.html">a single SQLAlchemy mega-plugin</a> combining all the SQLAlchemy plugins’&nbsp;functionality.</p>
<p>So it’s already pretty convenient to use SQLAlchemy in Litestar applications. But there’s more! The Litestar team also maintains <a href="https://docs.advanced-alchemy.litestar.dev/latest/">the excellent Advanced Alchemy library</a> which provides a bunch of useful features on top of SQLAlchemy. While Advanced Alchemy is framework-agnostic, Litestar’s SQLAlchemy plugin makes use of it and re-exports much of its functionality, giving you access to it automatically, and it does include Litestar-specific helpers for registering certain utility classes with Litestar’s dependency&nbsp;injection.</p>
<p>Advanced Alchemy provides a lot of quality-of-life improvements for SQLAlchemy, including a variety of base classes and mixins and data types doing useful things like database-agnostic big-integer primary keys, automatic create/update timestamps, <abbr title="Universally Unique IDentifier"><span>UUID</span></abbr>-keyed models, a proper <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time"><span>UTC</span></abbr> timestamp type, and a <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation"><span>JSON</span></abbr> type which chooses the best column type for your database. There are also command-line helpers for database management (including creating and working with <a href="https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/">Alembic migrations</a>), database dumping and seeding to/from <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation"><span>JSON</span></abbr>, and a lot&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>But the place where Advanced Alchemy really shines is in providing <a href="https://docs.advanced-alchemy.litestar.dev/latest/usage/repositories.html">a generic repository implementation</a> (both sync and async flavors) on top of SQLAlchemy models, along with <a href="https://docs.advanced-alchemy.litestar.dev/latest/usage/services.html">a service-layer abstraction</a> and helpers to integrate them into Litestar’s dependency injection&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>Here’s a basic example using&nbsp;the <code>Widget</code> class from&nbsp;above:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>from</span><span> </span><span>litestar.plugins.sqlalchemy</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>repository</span>

<span>class</span><span> </span><span>WidgetRepository</span><span>(</span><span>repository</span><span>.</span><span>SQLAlchemyAsyncRepository</span><span>[</span><span>Widget</span><span>]):</span>
    <span>model_type</span> <span>=</span> <span>Widget</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>WidgetRepository</code> will have all the methods you’d&nbsp;expect—<code>list()</code>, <code>get_one()</code>, <code>add()</code>, <code>delete()</code>, etc.—automatically derived from&nbsp;the <code>Widget</code> model. And let me just say that having repository implementations automatically derived from any SQLAlchemy model, with not just basic <abbr title="Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete"><span>CRUD</span></abbr> operations but also things like paginated fetches, is a <em>massive</em> productivity boost compared to just using vanilla SQLAlchemy. It’s maybe not quite on the level of Django’s generic views, but it’s a big step in that direction, and you probably could produce something like Django’s generic views with Litestar and Advanced Alchemy if you wanted to (perhaps one day, in my copious free time, I’ll even make an attempt at&nbsp;it).</p>
<p>I know it may seem strange to hear me saying this, since a few years ago I went on record as being strongly <em>against</em> these sorts of abstractions—specifically service layers—in Django. And I still think you absolutely should not try to retrofit repository or service-layer abstractions onto Django! They’re not the native patterns of Django’s architecture, and instead I think you should stick to <a href="https://www.b-list.org/weblog/2020/mar/16/no-service/">what I recommended back then</a>, which is to leverage Django’s own architecture, especially its “manager” abstraction, rather than trying to force abstractions onto it that don’t&nbsp;fit.</p>
<p>I also still think there are a lot of bad use cases for repositories and service layers that people should avoid, but that’s a digression which should probably become its own post, so I’ll just say for now that I think it’s fine to use repositories and service layers <em>as an organizing principle</em> when you’re using a less-structured framework which doesn’t express strong opinions about how you should lay out your code. And that’s exactly what I do when working with&nbsp;Litestar.</p>
<h2>A lightweight star of&nbsp;Python</h2>
<p>There are plenty of other features and conveniences in Litestar, many of which I use daily. Its auth system, supporting both <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/security/guards.html">simple guard functions</a> and <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/security/abstract-authentication-middleware.html">middlewares</a> for attaching identity and complex authn/authz logic to requests. Its <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/stores.html">“stores” framework</a>, which makes caching and similar tasks convenient. Its <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/logging.html">logging integrations</a> which support both the Python standard&nbsp;library’s <code>logging</code> module and popular third-party tools&nbsp;like <code>structlog</code>. Its built-in support for <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/plugins/problem_details.html">transforming errors to standard “problem details” structures</a>. Its built-in support for <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/metrics/index.html">recording and exporting metrics in standard Prometheus or OpenTelemetry formats</a>. Its <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/htmx.html">htmx support</a>.</p>
<p>You can do this stuff in other microframeworks, but it typically involves a lot of tracking down of third-party add-ons and/or writing your own glue code to integrate things. Litestar manages to keep the “microframework” feel when starting a new project while also having all these nice bits optionally available with the framework itself when and if you decide you want them, and that’s nothing to sneeze at. That’s what I was getting at earlier when I said it reminds me of the things I like in certain frameworks from other languages. Litestar doesn’t feel, to me, like it’s trying to be a replacement for any pre-existing Python web framework. It’s not trying to be the next Django or the next Flask or whatever; instead, it feels to me like a Pythonic take on the good parts of something like Spring Boot (and the way I like to set it up, doing things like using <a href="https://svcs.hynek.me/en/stable/">svcs</a> behind the scenes as a service locator to feed things to both Litestar’s and <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/">pytest’s</a> dependency injection, makes it feel even more that&nbsp;way).</p>
<p>I could go on for a lot longer listing things I like about Litestar, and probably wind up way too far into my own subjective preferences, but hopefully I’ve given you enough of a realistic taste of what it offers that, next time you’re about to build a Python web app, you might decide to reach for 💡⭐ to carry you to the moon&nbsp;🚀🚀🚀.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<p>
A number of 70s computing systems had nine-bit bytes, most prominently
the PDP-10, but today<sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup><span id="fn.1"><sup>1</sup> Apparently, it was the System/360 that
really set the standard here.</span> all systems use 8-bit bytes and that
now seems natural.<sup><a id="fnr.2" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup><span id="fn.2"><sup>2</sup> Though you still see RFCs use "octet", and the
C standard has a <code>CHAR_BITS</code> macro, to handle the possibility of a
different-sized byte.</span> As a power of two, eight is definitely nicer.
But I think a series of historical coincidences would actually go our
way with 9-bit bytes.<sup><a id="fnr.3" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup><span id="fn.3"><sup>3</sup> And, as I say below, I don't think
equivalently bad coincidences would break against us.</span>
</p>

<p>
<b>IPv4</b>: Everyone knows the story: IPv4 had 32-bit addresses, so about 4
billion total.<sup><a id="fnr.4" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup><span id="fn.4"><sup>4</sup> Less due to various reserved subnets.</span> That's not
enough in a world with 8 billion humans, and that's lead to NATs, more
active network middleware, and the impossibly glacial pace of IPv6
roll-out. It's 2025 and Github—Github!—doesn't support IPv6. But in a
world with 9-bit bytes IPv4 would have had 36-bit addresses, about 64
billion total. That would still be enough right now, and even with
continuing growth in India and Africa it would probably be enough for
about a decade more.<sup><a id="fnr.5" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup><span id="fn.5"><sup>5</sup> In our timeline, exhaustion hit in 2011, when
demand was doubling every five years. 16× more addresses gets us to
2031 projecting linearly, and probably a little later with growth
slowing.</span> When exhaustion does set in, it would plausibly at a time
where there's not a lot of growth left in penetration, population, or
devices, and mild market mechanisms instead of NATs would be the
solution.
</p>

<p>
<b>UNIX time</b>: In our timeline, 32-bit UNIX timestamps run out in 2038, so
again all software has to painfully transition to larger, 64-bit
structures. Equivalent 36-bit timestamps last until 3058, so no hurry.
Negative timestamps would represent any time since 882, so could cover
the founding of Kievan Rus', the death of Alfred the Great, the
collapse of the Classic Maya,<sup><a id="fnr.6" href="#fn.6" role="doc-backlink">6</a></sup><span id="fn.6"><sup>6</sup> The people stuck around, but they
stopped building cool cities.</span> and the movement of Magyar tribes into
the Carpathian basin.
</p>

<p>
<b>Unicode</b>: In our universe, there are 65 thousand 16-bit characters,
which looked like <i>maybe</i> enough for all the world's languages, assuming
you're really careful about which Chinese characters you let
in.<sup><a id="fnr.7" href="#fn.7" role="doc-backlink">7</a></sup><span id="fn.7"><sup>7</sup> Known as CJK unification, a real design flaw in Unicode that
we're stuck with.</span> With 9-bit bytes we'd have 262 thousand 18-bit
characters instead, which would totally be enough—there are only 155
thousand Unicode characters today, and that's with all the cat smileys
and emojis we can dream of. UTF-9 would be thought of more as a
compression format and largely sidelined by GZip.<sup><a id="fnr.8" href="#fn.8" role="doc-backlink">8</a></sup><span id="fn.8"><sup>8</sup> Alternatively,
we could lose a bit, be sparing with the cat smileys, and UTF-9 could
be one/two byte like Shift-JIS. That would be pretty attractive.</span>
</p>

<p>
<b>Pointers</b>: In 8-bit byte land, 32-bit operating systems impose a 2 GB
cap on processes,<sup><a id="fnr.9" href="#fn.9" role="doc-backlink">9</a></sup><span id="fn.9"><sup>9</sup> Because the kernel needs the top half of the
memory space.</span> which turns out to be pretty restrictive. 36-bit
operating systems would allow up to 32 GB per process, which even
today would be a big machine; I'm writing this on a four-year-old
Macbook Pro and it only has 16 GB of RAM. Server-class machines would
still need to address more memory than that, but they're usually
running specialized software or virtualizing; databases and
hypervisors are already tricky code and segmentation wouldn't be the
end of the world.<sup><a id="fnr.10" href="#fn.10" role="doc-backlink">10</a></sup><span id="fn.10"><sup>10</sup> Basically, it'd be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI">x32 as the standard</a>.</span> Memory
usage, even measured in bits, would be lower thanks to smaller
pointers<sup><a id="fnr.11" href="#fn.11" role="doc-backlink">11</a></sup><span id="fn.11"><sup>11</sup> So maybe 5% faster per x32 benchmarks?</span> though strings
would be bigger.<sup><a id="fnr.12" href="#fn.12" role="doc-backlink">12</a></sup><span id="fn.12"><sup>12</sup> So overall, maybe a wash?</span>
</p>

<p>
There are more obscure wins too. 16-bit AS numbers ran out years ago;
18-bit numbers would still be enough. 18-bit ports and process IDs and
user IDs would be a bit roomier. X86 and A64 instruction encodings
would be a bit saner.<sup><a id="fnr.13" href="#fn.13" role="doc-backlink">13</a></sup><span id="fn.13"><sup>13</sup> Thumb would work better?</span> Half-precision
(18-bit) floats might be prominent earlier.<sup><a id="fnr.14" href="#fn.14" role="doc-backlink">14</a></sup><span id="fn.14"><sup>14</sup> Today's manic 4- and
5-bit floats wouldn't work, and 3-bit floats seem impossible. Maybe
6-bit floats, 6-in-4, would be the consensus OCP float.</span> Extended
ASCII would have room for Greek and would become a kind of NATO code
page.<sup><a id="fnr.15" href="#fn.15" role="doc-backlink">15</a></sup><span id="fn.15"><sup>15</sup> And UTF-9 would privilege most of Western Europe, not just
the US.</span> Unix permissions would be one byte, so would lack sticky
bits. Octal, not hex, would be standard.<sup><a id="fnr.16" href="#fn.16" role="doc-backlink">16</a></sup><span id="fn.16"><sup>16</sup> It all comes from the
PDP-10!</span> Probably there are other benefits too.<sup><a id="fnr.17" href="#fn.17" role="doc-backlink">17</a></sup><span id="fn.17"><sup>17</sup> I measured ΔE for
18-bit color, which nicely splits 6/6/6. ChatGPT says the numbers I'm
getting are imperceptible, but I don't really know, and losing an

sequence numbers, where 18-bit sequence numbers might look appealing
but would cause real problems for high-bandwidth connections. You'd
need window scaling by the early 90s and a bump to 36-bit sequence
numbers by the mid 90s, culminating in an IPv6-like TCPv2 effort. Or
maybe instead of IPv6's "skinny upgrade" strategy TCPv2 would
incorporate networking concerns of the era; maybe ECN would be on by
default. But it's still not as bad as IPv6: ISPs would need to support
TCPv2 to offer higher speeds, which was the main way ISPs competed.
They'd make the investment. And since it all happens in the mid-90s,
HTTP might end up requiring TCPv2. We wouldn't dual-stack.

<p>Relatively speaking, California is not a hot spot for housing investors.</p>
<p>That’s a conclusion from my trusty spreadsheet’s review of data on investor activity across the nation from <a href="https://batchdata.io/">BatchData, a small data tracker</a> that digs deeper into property records than many traditional real estate analysts.</p>
<p>BatchData reviewed California ownership records to identify the state’s owner-occupied residences compared to houses controlled by investors. This study included properties for short-term or long-term rentals, second homes, and vacation retreats but did not follow condos or build-to-rent single-family-home projects.</p>
<p>By this math, 19% of California houses were owned by investors, ranking No. 36 among the states and just below the 20% national norm. <a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2025/07/16/where-in-california-do-investors-own-the-most-houses">By county, tiny Sierra has the most (83%) and Ventura the least (14%).</a></p>
<p>That 19% share is meek compared with where U.S. investors are most intensely busy – in states with small populations and tourism hooks. Those states include Hawaii at 40%, Alaska at 35%, Vermont at 31%, West Virginia at 30%, and Wyoming at 30%.</p>
<p>Conversely, investors were most shy in the Northeast: Connecticut at 10%, Rhode Island and&nbsp; Massachusetts at 12%, and Delaware at 13%.</p>
<p>And California’s economic rivals were not much more popular to investors than the Golden State. Texas was No. 24 at 22% and Florida, No. 27 at 21%.</p>
<p>Of course, due to its sheer size, California ranked No. 2 for the number of investment homes with 1.45 million, or 8% of all US investor-owned homes. Tops was Texas at 1.66 million. No. 3 was Florida at 1.21 million, then North Carolina at 787,055, and Michigan at 704,122.</p>				
<p>However, investors still grow their California portfolios. They added 143,747 houses since 2020, an 11% jump – by buying 358,092 houses while selling 214,345.</p>
<h4>Not so golden</h4>
<p>Why the low investor share for California?</p>
<p>Yes, it’s a big spot for renters. Census Bureau stats show 45% of households live in a place they don’t own, the third-highest share of tenants nationally.</p>
<p>However, there’s also the sky-high price tag for single-family homes, the third-highest nationally at $866,100, according to Redfin. That stretches the budget for investors, too.</p>
<p>Plus, typical returns have been skimpy. California’s six-year price appreciation ranked No. 41 at 50%, according to one federal index.</p>
<p>And underlying economics seem tepid.&nbsp;California’s flat population over five years ranked No. 47 and its five-year job growth at 3.8% was a middling No. 25.</p>

                                                <p>In 2020, 2022, and 2024, our nation held federal elections. Despite the pandemic, threats of violence, denial of results, and extraordinary pressure, these were secure and accurate. Election officials worked together across party lines.&nbsp;The system held.</p><p>This year, however, a new threat to free and fair elections has emerged: the federal government itself.</p><p>The Trump administration has launched a concerted drive to undermine American elections. These moves are unprecedented and in some cases illegal. They began with the pardon of the January 6 defendants who sought to overturn the 2020 results. They include affirmative attacks on democratic institutions, the repeal and withdrawal of voter protections, and symbolic or demonstrative moves. A clear pattern suggests a growing effort. As the 2026 midterms approach, that effort will likely gather momentum.</p><p>This resource offers the first chronicle of the Trump administration’s actions this year to undermine election integrity. They include:</p><ul><li>attempting to rewrite election rules to burden voters and usurp control of election systems;</li><li>targeting or threatening to target election officials and others who keep elections free and fair;</li><li>supporting people who undermine election administration; and</li><li>retreating from the federal government’s role of protecting voters and the election process.</li></ul><p>Why do we conclude this represents a concerted strategy? Among other things, President Trump tried to do this before. He was the first president to try to overturn the results of a presidential election and used federal power to do so. Institutions and key officials blocked him. These internal checks, however, are now gone, and many public officials will likely carry out the president’s will.</p><p>This campaign to undermine elections runs afoul of the U.S. Constitution. Only Congress and the states can set election rules. The executive branch, especially the Department of Justice (DOJ), is charged with&nbsp;enforcing&nbsp;federal laws. But neither the president nor the DOJ has the authority to set rules governing elections or to supervise the state and local officials who run them.</p><p>To be sure, previous elections were marred by rules and practices that hindered full participation.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-september-2024">Restrictive voting laws</a> (some of which had already been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/court-cases/lupe-v-state-texas">ruled unconstitutional</a>),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/how-gerrymandering-tilts-2024-race-house">skewed maps</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/preparation-kept-bomb-threats-disrupting-2024-elections">bomb threats</a> at polling places impeded the freedom to vote.

This federal protection for fair elections may no longer exist.</p><p>This unprecedented federal push will place new pressure on American elections and will require vigilance and actions from those determined to defend the integrity of the vote.</p>

          <h2>Attempting to Rewrite Election Rules and Interfere with Election Administration via Executive Order</h2>
        </header>
                                          <p>In March 2025, President Trump issued an&nbsp;<a href="https://perma.cc/A7K6-XV74">executive order&nbsp;</a>that aims to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/presidents-executive-order-elections-explained">overhaul and exert partial control</a> over significant parts of the nation’s election systems. The order includes several provisions; here we highlight three.</p><p>First, the order purports to direct the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) — an independent, bipartisan agency that assists states with election administration — to mandate that voters show a passport or other, similar document proving citizenship when they register to vote using the federal voter registration form.</p><p>Second, it attempts to force the EAC to&nbsp;amend its guidelines to rescind all previous certifications of voting equipment based on prior standards and, if appropriate, to re-certify voting systems under amended guidelines, which are to include provisions from the executive order.&nbsp;Eleven states and Washington, D.C.,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/2023-08/State%20Requirements%20for%20Certification%202023.pdf">require</a> their systems to be federally certified. And even&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/voting-system-standards-testing-and-certification">states that do not require federal certification</a> typically incorporate federal guidelines and testing and use voting systems that have been federally certified. Yet currently, just one voting system on the market complies with the standards issued prior to the executive order, and it was only&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/2025-07/Hart_Verity_Vanguard_1.0_EAC_Certificate_and_Scope_of_Conformance.pdf">certified on July 7, 2025</a>. Replacing machines could cost states billions of dollars.</p><p>The president’s attempt to interfere with voting systems is not novel. In his first term, he tried to direct the attorney general, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-directly-involved-plans-seize-voting-machines-reports-2022-02-01/">seize voting machines</a>. He was unsuccessful. Yet now there are signs that the federal government may already be attempting to interfere with voting systems, beyond anything expressed in the executive order. A DHS official&nbsp;and an individual claiming to work for the administration have asked election officials in Colorado for access to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/16/trump-voter-fraud-elections/">their voting equipment</a>.</p><p>Third, the order calls on the administration’s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and DHS to obtain state voter files and other records kept by election officials, including voter list maintenance records. The DOJ has already requested voter lists from at least&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/16/trump-voter-fraud-elections/">nine states</a>, and at least two have provided them. Unredacted voter files and voter list maintenance records can contain sensitive private information about U.S. citizens. Other records may contain information that is subject to access controls for security reasons. Relatedly, the order mandates that states have access to federal citizenship data for voter list maintenance purposes; DHS recently&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/04/22/dhs-uscis-doge-overhaul-systematic-alien-verification-entitlements-database" target="_blank" title="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/04/22/dhs-uscis-doge-overhaul-systematic-alien-verification-entitlements-database">overhauled</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/uscis-deploys-common-sense-tools-to-verify-voters" target="_blank" title="https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/uscis-deploys-common-sense-tools-to-verify-voters">expanded</a> the scope of its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/homeland-securitys-save-program-exacerbates-risks-voters">program for states&nbsp;</a>to identify supposed noncitizens on the voter rolls.</p><p>Each of these provisions is analyzed in turn.</p><h3>Attempting to Impose a “Show Your Papers” Requirement on Voters</h3><p><strong>Impact:</strong> If implemented, the requirement to show a citizenship document to register to vote when using the federal form would undermine voting and disrupt election administration in multiple respects. The “show your papers” provision, which&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/presidents-executive-order-elections-explained#:~:text=Is%20this%20executive,place%20by%20fiat.">overlaps significantly</a> with the policy laid out in the deeply unpopular&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/save-act-would-undermine-voter-registration-all-americans">SAVE Act</a> (which has stalled in the U.S. Senate), could block millions of American citizens from voting. According to research by the Brennan Center, more than 21 million citizens do not have a birth certificate, a passport, or naturalization papers readily available.</p><p><strong>Why It’s Wrong:</strong> A president has no right to rewrite the country’s election rules or regulate federal elections on his own.&nbsp;As a federal court&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/media/13927/download/2025-4-24-memo-op-and-order-granting-pi.pdf">recently</a> put it, “The Constitution vests none of these powers in the President.” In issuing the order, the president claimed extraordinary unilateral authority to regulate federal elections and usurp the powers of Congress, the states, and the EAC, an independent, bipartisan federal agency.</p><p><strong>Status:</strong> The order was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/107087/tracker-litigation-legal-challenges-trump-administration/">challenged</a> in five lawsuits across the country. Two courts have blocked some provisions while litigation proceeds, including those directing the EAC to add a requirement to show a passport or naturalization document to register to vote in federal elections. The same reasoning — that the president lacks authority to compel the EAC to act — would apply to other parts of the order that have not yet been carried out. Litigation is ongoing.&nbsp;</p><h3>Meddling with Election Equipment</h3><p><strong>Impact:</strong> The president’s directive in the executive order undermines faith in elections and voting machines and provides pretext for election deniers to discredit outcomes in the future. Any attempt to access voting machines by the administration makes this risk more pronounced. It may also encourage states to opt for hand-counting ballots, an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/hand-counting-votes-proven-bad-idea">error-prone process that can cause certification delays</a>.</p><p><strong>Why It’s Wrong:</strong> The president does not have the authority to regulate elections, including voting equipment guidelines. Nor does he have the power to direct the EAC, an independent agency, in any manner, as a federal court recently affirmed. And though certain federal agencies have authority to offer technical assistance or issue guidelines for voting equipment, none has authority to take exclusive custody of voting equipment for inspection. States also have rules on who can access equipment. In Colorado, for example, once someone other than an election official or other authorized person accesses a voting system, use of the equipment&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/rule_making/CurrentRules/8CCR1505-1/Rule20.pdf">can be prohibited</a>.</p><p><strong>Status:</strong> Washington and Oregon have&nbsp;<a href="https://agportal-s3bucket.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Elections%20Complaint.pdf?VersionId=NID68BFYNfX7zW0p.e9hZ.yFk7O_VgCE" target="_blank">challenged</a>&nbsp;the executive order’s provisions purporting to amend voting system guidelines. That litigation is ongoing. And though the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/2025-06/DRAFT_Voluntary_Voting_System%20Guidelines_Version_2.1_TGDC_Member_Review.pdf" target="_blank">EAC has drafted</a>&nbsp;voting system guidelines pursuant to the order, the agency still must follow several steps under federal law before the guidelines can be implemented, including consulting with advisory boards of nonpartisan experts and posting the guidelines for public comment.</p><h3>Accessing Sensitive Voter File Data</h3><p><strong>Impact:</strong> The administration could abuse voter file access to claim fraud and erode public trust in elections; it could also pressure state officials to target groups of voters and carry out unwarranted voter purges. Any disclosure of sensitive personal information puts individuals and groups at risk of being intimidated or doxed. And mishandling voter file data could expose U.S. elections to political and foreign interference.</p><p><strong>Why It’s Wrong:</strong> DOGE has a track record of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/15/nx-s1-5355896/doge-nlrb-elon-musk-spacex-security">mishandling sensitive data</a>. For example, within minutes after it gained access to the National Labor Relations Board’s systems in March 2025, someone with a Russian IP address made several attempts to access the database using one of the department’s newly created accounts. Those attempts were blocked, but the fact that foreign adversaries were able to immediately make such attempts indicates that election systems and the data they hold risk being compromised when left in the hands of DOGE. And for its part, DHS has previously&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/policy-solutions/holding-homeland-security-accountable">failed to fulfill its privacy obligations</a>.</p><p><strong>Status:</strong> Depending on how DOGE or DHS uses or discloses data, it may run afoul of federal law, including the Privacy Act and the Administrative Procedures Act. In some states, giving voter records to the federal government without written consent from voters would also be a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/analysis/Legal_Implications_of_Kobach_Request.pdf">violation of state law</a>; in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2024-02/public_interest_legal_foundation_v._bellows_no._23-1361_1st_cir._02.02.24.pdf">others</a>, redaction would be required.</p>

          <h2>Targeting Election Officials and Civil Society</h2>
        </header>
                                          <p>The Trump administration, falsely claiming that the 2020 presidential election was stolen, has already targeted organizations and individuals it sees as adverse with baseless or inappropriate retaliatory actions. It now threatens to do the same with certain election officials, civic groups that mobilize voters, and other individuals and entities that protect elections and the rule of law. These kinds of actions can be tools of retribution, intimidation, or coercion.&nbsp;</p><h3>Weaponizing Federal Agencies&nbsp;</h3><p>A set of new federal task forces — the DOJ’s Weaponization Working Group, the New Jersey U.S. Attorney’s Office&nbsp;<a href="https://perma.cc/CL39-4FSN">Election Integrity Task Force</a>, and the Washington, D.C., Attorney’s Office&nbsp;<a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/dc-prosecutor-ed-martin-launches-election-accountability-unit">Special Unit: Election Accountability</a> — establish a federal law enforcement approach to elections focused on targeting voters, election officials, perceived political adversaries, and journalists. The task forces devote resources to search for supposedly widespread voter fraud — a problem that doesn’t exist — and sanction political targeting.</p><blockquote><p>“They are poised to enable election interference by investigating perceived adversaries, targeting election officials, and casting doubt on election systems.”</p></blockquote><p>Political appointees who have spread falsehoods about the outcome of the 2020 election, including U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet&nbsp;Dhillon, and FBI Director Kash Patel, have empowered and enabled these task forces.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/pam-bondis-recent-history-troubling-doj">Bondi</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/12/10/trump-civil-rights-justice-department-dhillon/">Dhillon</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/meet-kash-patel-the-maga-diehard-donald-trump-tapped-to-lead-the-fbi?srsltid=AfmBOop0G47iKEIkeB_RGKpi9tVCTLxtKurOuVSorOk6pHcz9WElIEEN">Patel</a> have also made clear they are willing to use the federal government to investigate and prosecute people they claim are responsible for supposed election fraud. Patel has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/us/politics/kash-patel-fbi.html">stated</a>, “We’re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections — we’re going to come after you.”&nbsp;Bondi, in one of her first actions as attorney general, created the Weaponization Working Group, whose purpose is to “review the activities of all departments and agencies exercising civil or criminal enforcement authority of the United States over the last four years.” The administration has instructed the group to investigate some of the president’s perceived enemies, including former Special Counsel Jack Smith and his staff for investigating the January 6 riots, the Manhattan district attorney and the New York state attorney general for their involvement in the prosecution of Trump and his businesses, and anyone who investigated or prosecuted the January 6 rioters.</p><p><strong>Impact:</strong> During President Trump’s first term in office, federal agencies and departments occasionally served as a restraint on his unlawful actions. For example, when the president asked the attorney general to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-directly-involved-plans-seize-voting-machines-reports-2022-02-01/">seize voting machines</a> after his 2020 election loss, then Attorney General Bill Barr refused. But in his second term, the president’s picks may not hold the line in the same way. Rather, they are poised to enable election interference by investigating perceived adversaries, targeting election officials, and casting doubt on election systems.</p><p><strong>Why It’s Wrong:</strong> The DOJ can and should prosecute fraud in U.S. elections, but these task forces are premised on the false notions that U.S. elections are rigged and that there’s rampant voter fraud. Rather than ensuring election integrity, these task forces undermine it, part of the department’s serious shift away from protecting voting rights.</p><p><strong>Status:</strong> The Constitution and the law serve as a limit on what these political appointees can do. Indeed, courts have already struck down this administration’s attempts to subvert the law. For example, multiple courts have found that the president’s executive orders targeting law firms violate the First Amendment, and two courts have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/court-cases/league-women-voters-v-trump">preliminarily</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.282905/gov.uscourts.mad.282905.107.0.pdf">stopped</a> the president from unlawfully trying to direct an independent, bipartisan agency to add a citizenship document requirement to the federal voter registration form.&nbsp;</p><h3>Penalizing Law Firms</h3><p>The president issued executive&nbsp;<a href="https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/latest-law-firm-targeted-in-executive-order-says-there-is-no-question-that-we-will-fight">orders revoking the federal security clearances of six law firms</a> and prohibiting the federal government from contracting with them. These firms had been involved in litigation protecting voting rights and are associated with people who challenged the January 6 attack on the Capitol, attempts to overturn the 2020 election, and election interference in 2016. The president specifically cited these associations as justification for targeting the firms. For example, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/DCPD-202500359/pdf/DCPD-202500359.pdf">Paul Weiss</a> order was based in part on the firm employing a lawyer who brought a lawsuit against an individual who had participated in the January 6 insurrection. The&nbsp;<a href="https://perma.cc/6E42-6S6B">Perkins Coie</a> order provided that the firm had represented a political opponent of the president, brought challenges to restrictive voter ID laws that made it harder for eligible citizens to vote, and, as the court enjoining the order&nbsp;<a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69725919/185/perkins-coie-llp-v-us-department-of-justice/">stated</a>, brought “election-related lawsuits&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;challenging actions supported by the president or his campaign.”&nbsp;<a href="https://perma.cc/7KXU-QL5Z">Jenner &amp; Block</a> was targeted because it employed Andrew Weissman, who, as the court enjoining the order&nbsp;<a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69807126/138/jenner-block-llp-v-us-department-of-justice/">stated</a>, “drew presidential disdain” for criticizing the president and&nbsp;participating “in a legitimate investigation of election interference”&nbsp;— that is, the investigation and prosecution of the president’s campaign team for crimes related to foreign interference in the 2016 election. The association with Weissman “extended that disdain to the firm,” the court added. And&nbsp;<a href="https://perma.cc/J6XM-U224">Covington &amp; Burling</a>, according to the executive order, “assisted former Special Counsel Jack Smith.” The firm had provided Smith with free legal advice when he was investigating the January 6 riots.</p><p><strong>Impact:</strong> By targeting law firms for providing legal services — including free legal services — to causes the administration disapproves of, including protecting the freedom to vote, the orders have had a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/business/trump-law-firms-pro-bono-immigration.html">chilling effect</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-orders-target-law-firms-some-lawyers-say-that-threatens-rule-of-law-60-minutes-transcript/">firms</a>, including those that have not been directly targeted, diminishing the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/13/g-s1-59497/trump-law-firms-pro-bono">legal resources</a> available to Americans whose voting rights have been violated. To some extent, the nonprofit sector and state attorneys general have stepped up to provide needed legal support, but gaps remain. This chilling effect extends beyond law firms. For instance, it may compel prosecutors to avoid pursuing charges against election interference. And the administration’s attempt to punish some of the most powerful and well-resourced legal institutions in the country sends a potent message to anyone considering taking a position the administration may oppose.</p><p><strong>Why It’s Wrong:</strong> As multiple courts have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/27/g-s1-70443/trump-law-firm-susman-godfrey-ruling">found</a>, these actions are illegal. The First Amendment prohibits government officials from retaliating against protected speech or association, including retaliating against law firms that represent or offer legal services to those engaged in protected speech or association whom the president happens to disfavor.</p><p><strong>Status:</strong> Four of the targeted law firms challenged their respective executive orders, and judges have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/27/g-s1-70443/trump-law-firm-susman-godfrey-ruling">permanently blocked</a> the orders for violating the First Amendment. Despite the clear illegality of the orders,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/law-firms-deals-trump.html">nine firms</a> have entered into agreements with the administration. As part of those agreements, these firms said they would provide free legal services for causes that the president approves of.&nbsp;</p><h3>Threatening Election Officials and Nonprofits</h3><p>The president and his DOJ appointees have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/whats-next-elections-under-project-2025-agenda">repeatedly threatened</a> to prosecute the election officials who administered the 2020 election. In a March 14, 2025, speech, President Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-calls-jailing-perceived-opponents-justice-department-speech-rcna196515?utm_source=Democracy+Docket+Newsletters&amp;utm_campaign=e2a243ed96-20250319_EyeOnTheRight_LF&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-513211276f-607194689&amp;mc_cid=e2a243ed96&amp;mc_eid=3ede2f915b">stated</a>, “What a difference a rigged and crooked election had on our country. And the people who did this to us should go to jail. They should go to jail.”&nbsp;The president has also threatened to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/10/trump-administration-authoritarian">target nonprofit advocacy groups</a> that play an important role in voter engagement, election monitoring, and litigation to protect the freedom to vote.</p><p>These threats roughly track a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/project-2025s-anti-voter-agenda">proposal</a> in Project 2025, the controversial conservative policy agenda created by the Heritage Foundation, to prosecute people who protected the 2020 election with federal crimes. Project 2025 proposed charging election officials with criminal conspiracy to injure civil rights for their alleged misapplication of state law to <em>help</em> voters cast ballots during the 2020 election.</p><blockquote><p>“Federal and state law prohibits anyone, including federal officials, from intimidating voters and those, like election officials or civic engagement organizations, who assist or encourage them to vote.”</p></blockquote><p>The extent to which the administration will follow through on that plan is unclear, but it has already begun to target officials involved in protecting the 2020 election and build an infrastructure of task forces and working groups that heightens the threat of criminal prosecution. In one executive order, the president&nbsp;<a href="https://perma.cc/H39J-D2FW">directed</a>&nbsp;the DOJ to review the actions of Chris Krebs, whom the president appointed to lead the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) in 2018, because he “denied that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen.”</p><p>In addition to its Weaponization Working Group, the DOJ is reportedly&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/02/us/politics/justice-department-election-data.html">exploring ways</a> to criminally charge election officials for failing to maintain proper cybersecurity — based not on evidence but on assumptions driven by false claims of rampant voter fraud.</p><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Criminal investigations and prosecutions would impose a severe personal and financial toll on election officials or nonprofit employees for simply doing their jobs to help keep elections free and fair. But beyond that, the harms that stem from targeting the officials and civil society groups that make our elections work are manifold.</p><p>Even if the administration never charges any officials, the threat alone of criminal investigation or prosecution will likely exacerbate the exodus of election officials from their jobs. In 2024&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/local-election-officials-survey-may-2024">33 percent</a> of local election officials knew at least one colleague who resigned at least in part due to fear for their safety, of increased threats, or of intimidation; 21 percent stated that they were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/local-election-officials-survey-may-2024">unlikely</a> to continue serving in their role for the 2026 midterms.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/local-election-officials-survey-july-2025">In 2025</a> 59 percent of officials reported fear of political interference in their ability to do their jobs. And 46 percent were very or somewhat concerned about potential politically motivated investigations of themselves or their peers. Ultimately the drain of experienced officials from U.S. elections will hurt voters.</p><p>The threat of criminal investigation may also prompt civil society organizations to retreat from their work to engage voters. When Florida recently passed a law threatening organizations conducting voter registration drives with civil and criminal penalties for violating a slew of new restrictive regulations, some organizations curtailed their work or&nbsp;<a href="https://boltsmag.org/florida-law-sb-7050-restricts-outside-groups-trying-to-register-new-voters/">stopped</a> registering voters altogether.</p><p>The administration may also use the threat of criminal prosecution to pressure election officials to comply with unreasonable or unlawful requests. It may already be engaging in similar quid pro quo arrangements, as evidenced when the DOJ dropped corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams in the spring of 2025. Though the court ultimately ordered the case dismissed <em>with</em> prejudice (i.e., barring a future claim on the same facts), the DOJ had sought dismissal&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/02/g-s1-57386/judge-new-york-eric-adams"><em>without</em> prejudice</a>, which would have left open the opportunity for the case to be refiled at a later time, and thus would have allowed the DOJ to hold the threat of prosecution over Adams should he not acquiesce to any requests the administration may make. The U.S. attorney responsible for the prosecution, who had been appointed by the president, resigned in protest,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25527077-acting-us-attorney-danielle-sassoons-resignation-letter/?q=baffled&amp;mode=document">alleging&nbsp;</a>that the decision was motivated by a desire to procure political cooperation from Adams on unrelated matters.</p><p>An election official fearful of criminal charges might succumb to pressure to aggressively purge voters from the rolls or to engage in outright election subversion. When the president tried to overturn the 2020 presidential election, he and his associates put pressure on state and local election officials — including, famously, in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/fact-check-trumps-georgia-call-raffensperger">phone call</a> to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger — to assist his efforts. Raffensperger and other officials refused to subvert the results, but an election official facing the prospect of prosecution now might not take the same principled stand.</p><p><strong>Why It’s Wrong:</strong> Threats of criminal charges based on lies about the 2020 election have no legal or factual basis. There is no evidence that the 2020 election was tainted by any kind of fraud or impropriety in election administration. Project 2025 proposes to use a law designed to protect civil rights, including the right to vote, to prosecute state officials for aiding in the exercise of that right, a legal theory that will likely struggle in court.</p><p>The First Amendment protects election officials and pro-voter groups from retaliation based on their speech and association, just as it protects the speech and association of law firms. If the administration targets officials or groups for publicly declaring elections to be legitimate, safe, and secure or for registering and engaging voters, the targets may be able to block any investigation or prosecution in court before it proceeds, just as those law firms have succeeded in blocking the executive orders leveled at them.</p><p>Moreover, <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/guide-laws-against-intimidation-voters-and-election-workers">federal and state law prohibits anyone</a>, including federal officials, from intimidating voters and those, like election officials or civic engagement organizations, who assist or encourage them to vote. And though voters rarely do so, they&nbsp;<a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/821/1484/255574/">are able</a> to sue DOJ officials under anti-intimidation law in federal court.</p><p><strong>Status:</strong> Thus far these threats have remained just that. For example, DOJ lawyers tasked with finding ways to prosecute election officials for allegedly failing to maintain proper cybersecurity are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/02/us/politics/justice-department-election-data.html#:~:text=Inside%20the%20Justice%20Department%2C%20a%20number%20of%20lawyers%20have%20struggled%20to%20find%20a%20criminal%20statute%20to%20match%20the%20Trump%20administration%E2%80%99s%20demands%2C%20according%20to%20the%20people%20familiar%20with%20the%20matter.">reportedly</a> struggling to find any criminal statute that will allow them to do so.&nbsp;</p>

                                          <p>The federal government has rewarded people who peddle conspiracy theories about voter fraud and continue to deny the legitimacy of the 2020 election, including by resorting to violence. Many of this administration’s political appointees have continuously challenged the results of the 2020 election or otherwise undermined elections.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/election-deniers-head-america-first-policy-institutes-new-state-chapters/#:~:text=Rep.%20Doug%20Collins%2C%20a%20longtime%20Trump%20ally%20and%20one%20of%20the%20126%20GOP%20House%20members%20who%20signed%20an%20amicus%20brief%20in%20the%20dismissed%20Supreme%20Court%20lawsuit%20that%20contested%20the%202020%20presidential%20election%20results">At</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-york-governors-debate-hochul-zeldin/#:~:text=Zeldin%20was%20one%20of%20147%20House%20Republicans%20who%20objected%20to%20certifying%20President%20Biden%27s%20electoral%20victory%20on%20Jan.%206%2C%202021%2C%20shortly%20after%20the%20Capitol%20building%20was%20attacked%20by%20Trump%27s%20supporters.">least</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/trump-is-still-trying-to-undermine-elections#:~:text=Now%20that%20Trump%20has%20installed%20a%20surfeit%20of%20election%20deniers,guardrails%20protecting%20voting%20and%20voters.">four</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5112100-trump-budget-nominee-russell-vought-2020-election/">members</a> of the president’s cabinet are election deniers.</p><h3>Pardoning January 6 Rioters</h3><p>The January 6 rioters&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/trumps-plan-rewrite-history-jan-6">violently attacked</a> the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to keep President Trump in office after he lost the 2020 presidential election. On the first day of his second term, the president pardoned approximately&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/20/g-s1-36809/trump-pardons-january-6-riot">1,500 individuals</a> who had been on trial and commuted the sentences of 14 people who had been convicted for their participation in that attack.</p><p><strong>Impact:</strong> The move green-lights future vigilante efforts to overturn elections, including efforts by the January 6 rioters themselves, by indicating that those who engage in political violence and interfere with the peaceful transfer of power may not only avoid legal consequences but also be treated as heroes. The president and others have cast the rioters as “<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4713140-trump-calls-j6-defendants-warriors/">warriors</a>” and “<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y7l47xrpko#:~:text=Trump%20previously%20called%20those%20prosecuted%20for%20the%20riot%20%22political%20prisoners%22%2C%20who%20posed%20%22zero%20threat%22.">political prisoners</a>.”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/jan-6-rioters-are-the-new-hot-event-in-town-for-republicans-e3a02170">Republican Party events</a> around the country have honored the rioters.

While the events of January 6, 2021, took place in Washington, DC, under federal jurisdiction, similar acts anywhere else in the country would be governed by state laws, which prohibit violence, insurrection, and intimidation of voters and election officials.</p><p>Indeed, in part as a response to recent instances or threats of political violence, several states have strengthened such laws. For example, since 2020,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/chart-state-prohibitions-guns-election-locations">13 states&nbsp;</a>have passed laws banning guns or expanding prohibitions against them in and around polling places or ballot drop boxes. In addition, local election officials have partnered with law enforcement to form the&nbsp;<a href="https://safeelections.org/">Committee for Safe and Secure Elections</a> to protect voters and election workers from violence, threats, and intimidation. While the president is sending the message that his administration will reward those who undermine elections, states and local leaders are taking such threats seriously and have shored up the safety and security of elections.</p><h3>Undermining Prosecution of Election Subversion</h3><p>In 2021 Tina Peters, a Colorado election clerk, gave a man unauthorized access to voting equipment; that man was affiliated with My Pillow chief executive Mike Lindell, a leading proponent of false conspiracy theories that the 2020 election was rigged. She was convicted of four felonies under state law and sentenced to nine years in prison. The Trump administration is trying to get her out. In March 2025, the DOJ&nbsp;<a href="https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/03/gov.uscourts.cod_.241206.16.0.pdf">filed a statement of interest</a> in support of her habeas corpus petition, a federal suit seeking her release from prison while she pursues an appeal. The filing states that the DOJ is evaluating whether the state prosecution,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cpr.org/2024/09/11/interview-district-attorney-dan-rubinstein-tina-peters-case/#:~:text=Your%20office%20had%20to%20prosecute%20a%20fellow%20elected%20official%2C%20someone%20who%20is%20a%20Republican%20like%20yourself%20and%20on%20an%20issue%20%E2%80%94%20election%20conspiracies">led by an elected Republican prosecutor</a>, was politically motivated. On May 5, the federal court hearing Peters’s habeas petition&nbsp;<a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69629270/47/peters-v-feyen/">held</a> that a number of her claims were premature and suggested that it might dismiss her entire case. On the same day, the president&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cpr.org/2025/05/05/trump-directs-department-of-justice-to-try-to-free-tina-peters-from-prison-in-social-media-post/">took to social media</a> to describe Peters as an “innocent Political Prisoner” and to direct the Justice Department to “take all necessary action to help secure” her release.</p><p><strong>Impact:</strong> These actions could embolden rogue election officials to threaten elections from within. The president and the DOJ are sending a clear message that they will support such officials when they engage in subversive behavior. By announcing a review of a state prosecution, the DOJ is also indicating to state prosecutors that bringing charges against election officials who support Trump’s attempts at election subversion will subject them to scrutiny.</p><p><strong>Why It’s Wrong:</strong> Neither the president nor the DOJ has the power to overturn a state conviction. Peters broke multiple state laws in support of a conspiracy theory. A jury found her guilty. President Trump undermines that finding by publicly declaring that Peters is innocent.</p><p><strong>Status:</strong> Despite such threats, state officials continue to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cpr.org/2025/03/03/u-s-department-of-justice-to-review-state-conviction-of-former-mesa-county-clerk-tina-peters/">stand by</a> their prosecution of Peters in court and in the media, and Peters continues to serve her sentence.&nbsp;</p>

          <h2>Scaling Back from Protecting Elections</h2>
        </header>
                                          <p>The Trump administration is retreating from its responsibility to protect U.S. elections. State and local election officials no longer have a reliable partner in the federal government. And voters should not expect to have their voting rights vindicated by the DOJ.&nbsp;</p><h3>Dismantling CISA</h3><p>CISA is a component of the DHS responsible for helping to protect the cybersecurity and physical security of the nation’s critical infrastructure, including election systems. The agency provides voluntary, low-cost, and no-cost services, training, and assessments for state and local election officials across the country and helps these officials better understand the security threats their systems face.</p><p>The Trump administration&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/how-federal-government-undermining-election-security">severely undermined</a> the structure and purpose of CISA in the president’s first few months in office. In February 2025, CISA&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-security-cisa-kristi-noem-cybersecurity-5bac8ce416c46b4fbe44c94ae5874b39">put 17 of its election security staff on administrative leave</a>. Additionally, DOGE&nbsp;<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/careers/fired-cisa-probationary-employees-to-be-reinstated-after-us-judges-order/ar-AA1B6u2E?ocid=BingNewsSerp">fired 130 people</a> from CISA; a judge later reinstated those employees to their positions, but they were immediately placed on administrative leave.</p><p>That same month, CISA&nbsp;paused all election security activities pending an internal review. The review was completed in March, but the Trump administration has refused to release the findings. It is unclear which CISA services have been restored, if any, despite&nbsp;<a href="https://www.padilla.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/04.17.25-Padilla-Morelle-CISA-April-2025-Follow-Up-Letter-FINAL6.pdf">repeated</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.padilla.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025.07.07-CISA-Letter_Morelle-Padilla.pdf">requests</a> for information from members of Congress responsible for agency oversight.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/cisa-job-cuts/745483/">Reporting</a> from April suggests that CISA is planning massive additional cuts.</p><p>In March 2025, CISA&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-security-cisa-trump-kristi-noem-6c437543f5d26d890704e5f2a8400502">cut about $10 million</a> in funding to the Center for Internet Security, a nonprofit with programs that benefit state and local election officials. As a result, funding was eliminated for the&nbsp;<a href="https://statescoop.com/federal-cuts-election-security-secretaries-state-2025/">Election Infrastructure Information Analysis Center</a>, a network that facilitates information sharing about security risks and best practices between election vendors and state and local election officials, and was reduced for the&nbsp;<a href="https://statescoop.com/ms-isac-loses-federal-support/">Multi-State Information and Analysis Center</a>, a similar network that serves all state and local government entities.</p><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Scaling back the expertise at CISA and cutting the critical funding it delivers to state and local officials for election security expose U.S. election infrastructure to cyberattacks and physical attacks, leaving election officials with less support to anticipate or recover from these attacks and to run safe and secure elections.</p><p><strong>Why It’s Wrong:</strong> CISA’s dismantling occurs at a time when there are aggressive threats to our election system from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/policy-solutions/state-agenda-election-security-and-resiliency">foreign and domestic actors</a>. Cyberattacks may also become more effective with the evolution of artificial intelligence.</p><p>Additionally, a federal judge found that the firing of CISA employees was illegal under the Administrative Procedure Act for failure to follow federal law and regulations. The employees were reinstated. Despite the ruling, however, CISA managed to accomplish the same outcome, a diminished workforce, by immediately placing those reinstated employees on administrative leave.</p><p><strong>Status:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/policy-solutions/state-agenda-election-security-and-resiliency">In the absence of federal assistance</a>, state and local officials can set up new interagency working groups on election security — initiatives that states have taken in past election cycles — as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://statescoop.com/north-dakota-interstate-cyber-operations-center-expands-10-states/">expand interstate information-sharing networks</a>. States can also pass and enforce laws to protect election workers and infrastructure.</p><h3>Directing the DOJ to Endanger Voting Rights Rather Than Protect Them&nbsp;</h3><p>Shortly after being appointed to run the DOJ’s civil rights division, Assistant Attorney General Dhillon announced and implemented a “<a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/doj-leader-calls-for-civil-rights-paradigm-shift-after-exodus">paradigm shift</a>” that shirks the department’s responsibility to protect voting rights. While Dhillon describes the “usual approach” of previous Republican administrations as working to “slow the train down,” she envisions the division “turning the train around and driving in the opposite direction” under her leadership. Shortly after taking the helm, she also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/18/justice-department-civil-rights-division-trump">issued new mission statements</a> that signal the division’s move away from protecting the rights of marginalized groups and toward efforts such as rooting out voter fraud, which is actually extremely rare. Project 2025 had proposed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/project-2025s-anti-voter-agenda">such a shift</a>, also reflected in the president’s executive order on elections.</p><blockquote><p>“The Trump administration has signaled that it is unlikely to enforce laws to protect voting rights.”</p></blockquote><p>The DOJ has since&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/28/trump-doj-voting-rights">dropped every voting case</a> in which it had been a plaintiff at the start of this administration, and it has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/justice-department-shirking-its-responsibility-voters">withdrawn its involvement</a> in several other voting and redistricting suits. It also gutted the civil rights division of its career staff. By the end of May 2025, an estimated 250 attorneys making up approximately&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/19/g-s1-66906/trump-civil-rights-justice-exodus">70 percent of the division’s lawyers</a> had left the department. The staff of the division’s voting section&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/04/politics/inside-gutting-justice-department-voting-section">dwindled</a> from approximately 30 lawyers down to about 6. But the division has begun hiring new attorneys. The voting section is now led by Maureen Riordan, a longtime DOJ lawyer who rejoined the department after a stint at the Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF), a conservative organization that has for years sued election officials to try to force aggressive purges of the voter rolls.</p><p>Under Riordan, the DOJ sued election administrators in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/media/1401636/dl">North Carolina</a>&nbsp;in an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/court-cases/united-states-v-north-carolina-state-board-elections">apparent attempt</a> to prompt a purge of thousands of eligible voters from the rolls. The department also sued an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1404546/dl">Orange County, California</a>, election official for failing to provide the department unredacted private information concerning voters he had removed from the rolls; the official had previously provided redacted records to ensure voter privacy, but the department did not agree with the redaction. The DOJ also filed statements of interest in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1402891/dl?inline">Oregon</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/media/1407251/dl">Illinois</a>&nbsp;in support of another conservative activist organization’s lawsuits seeking more aggressive voter roll purges. And it issued letters to state election administrators in at least six other states —<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/16/trump-voter-fraud-elections/">Alaska</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25964785-hava-letter-redacted/">Arizona</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/11/nx-s1-5426097/trump-justice-department-voter-data-colorado">Colorado</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/State-of-Minnesota.pdf">Minnesota</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25994295-doj-62325-letter-to-commonwealth-of-pennsylvania/">Pennsylvania</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1402606/dl?inline">Wisconsin</a>&nbsp;— identifying purported failures to satisfy federal laws governing voter list maintenance.</p><p><strong>Impact:</strong> The Trump administration has signaled that it is unlikely to enforce laws to protect voting rights. That leaves voters particularly vulnerable in the seven states in the middle of the country that make up the Eighth Circuit, where the court of appeals&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/appeals-court-strips-voters-ability-file-voting-rights-act-lawsuits-7">recently ruled</a> that only the DOJ can bring suits to enforce the Voting Rights Act’s central prohibition against discrimination against racial and language minorities. The ruling bars private plaintiffs such as voters and advocacy groups, who have historically brought&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/importance-letting-voters-defend-their-rights-court">the vast majority</a> of these cases, from filing suit. Unless the Supreme Court overturns that ruling, voters in these seven states (Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota) will essentially be left without the primary protections of the landmark civil rights law.</p><p>At the same time, the department’s new focus on litigation to press for more aggressive purges poses a threat to election administration and voters alike. Aggressive purges risk disenfranchising eligible voters, as evidenced by the department’s suit in North Carolina. As many as 200,000 North Carolina voter registration records are missing a driver’s license number or the last four digits of a Social Security number, a result of the state voter registration form’s poor design and likely mistakes in data management. These are errors by the state, not the voters themselves; moreover, the omission of these numbers from voter records indicates nothing about the eligibility of these people to vote. But the DOJ’s suit against North Carolina purportedly aimed at fixing the state’s mistakes asks for relief that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/north-carolinians-go-court-protect-their-right-vote">would result</a> in the removal of many of these voters from the rolls.</p><p>PILF and other groups have tried to force voter roll purges through lawsuits, and they have been unsuccessful in court&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/league-women-voters-files-intervene-voter-purge-suit-against-state#:~:text=Over%20the%20last%20four%20years%2C%20Michigan%E2%80%99s%20voter%20rolls%20have%20been%20subject%20to%20similar%20lawsuits%2C%20such%20as%C2%A0Daunt%20v.%20Benson%2C%C2%A0PILF%20v.%20Winfrey%2C%20and%C2%A0PILF%20v.%20Benson%C2%A0%E2%80%93%20all%20of%20which%20failed.">time and again</a>. That is because while federal law requires election officials to conduct “<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/20507#:~:text=that%20makes%20a-,reasonable%20effort,-to%20remove%20the">reasonable</a>” voter list maintenance, it does not mandate a particular program for removing voters, nor does it require the removal of voters for mistakes in their records that are no fault of their own and indicate nothing about their eligibility.</p><p>Successful or not, these suits also feed a false narrative that U.S. elections are rife with fraud and provide fodder for attempts at overturning results. The DOJ’s suit in North Carolina follows a&nbsp;<a href="https://statecourtreport.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/griffin-concedes-riggs-ending-six-month-dispute-over-north-carolina?_gl=1*1cy8gzm*_gcl_au*ODg1ODIyNjQzLjE3NTE5OTc2MzU">months-long attempt</a> by a losing North Carolina Supreme Court candidate to reverse his defeat by using the same missing information in the state’s rolls to justify throwing out the validly cast votes of tens of thousands of eligible voters. The DOJ’s pursuit of cases like this one could lend legitimacy to similar election subversion efforts in the future.</p><p>Such suits also could provide cover for election officials to take bad-faith actions that would disenfranchise voters.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-swing-state-officials-election-deniers-1235069692/">Dozens of election officials</a> around the country are themselves election deniers. They could use a suit by the DOJ as justification for purging thousands of voters from the rolls or applying a fringe legal interpretation to a federal law.</p><p><strong>Why It’s Wrong:</strong> The DOJ has&nbsp;<a href="https://perma.cc/RXR2-GLK6">statutory duties</a> to enforce federal laws that ensure greater access to the ballot box for all eligible Americans, including duties set out in the Civil Rights Acts, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Voting Accessibility for Elderly and Handicapped Act of 1984, the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act of 1986, the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, and the Help America Vote Act of 2002.</p><p><strong>Status:</strong> The administration is still bound by the Constitution and the law. The abovementioned laws remain in full effect, and, despite the Eighth Circuit’s rogue ruling concerning the Voting Rights Act, many of them allow private enforcement through suits by voters and advocates. Private plaintiffs can and should bring legal challenges under federal law. Additionally, none of the new cases filed by the DOJ’s voting section have advanced to a decision in the courts, but organizations like the Brennan Center are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/north-carolinians-go-court-protect-their-right-vote">seeking to intervene</a> where appropriate to ensure that, when the courts do rule, voters’ interests are represented.</p>

        </header>
                                          <p>The Constitution establishes a system of checks and balances to ensure free and fair elections. The power to regulate elections lies in the hands of states and Congress. Courts and advocates complement this system to uphold the Constitution and federal law.</p><p>U.S. election infrastructure leaves no room for the president to insert himself. Yet that is exactly what he purports to do now: directing, dismantling, and weaponizing agencies so that the Trump administration can evade its responsibility to ensure the security of elections and the freedom to vote. Instead, the administration is setting the stage for election subversion. This power play poses a grave threat to the future of U.S. election infrastructure. It is also, in many respects, illegal. The various institutions and actors that operate the constitutional checks and balances safeguarding U.S. elections — including the courts, Congress, independent federal agencies, state legislatures, state and local election officials, and the people themselves — must prevent the Trump administration’s power grab from succeeding.&nbsp;</p>

		<h2>Overview </h2>
<p>Low-cost micro-units, often called single-room occupancies, or SROs, were once a reliable form of housing for the United States’ poorest residents of, and newcomers to, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and many other major U.S. cities. Well into the 20th century, SROs were the least expensive option on the housing market, providing a small room with a shared bathroom and sometimes a shared kitchen for a price that is unimaginable today—as little as $100 to $300 a month (in 2025 dollars). </p>
<p>In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, landlords converted thousands of houses, hotels, apartment buildings, and commercial buildings into SROs, and by 1950, SRO units made up about 10% of all rental units in some major cities. But beginning in the mid-1950s, as some politicians and vocal members of the public turned against SROs and the people who lived in them, major cities across the country revised zoning and building codes to force or encourage landlords to eliminate SRO units and to prohibit the development of new ones. Over the next several decades, governments and developers gradually demolished thousands of SROs or converted them to other uses, including boutique hotels for tourists. And as SROs disappeared, homelessness—which had been rare from at least the end of the Great Depression to the late 1970s—exploded nationwide.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Now, as a nationwide housing shortage has pushed rents and homelessness to historic highs, some states and localities are reconsidering the value of lower-cost, small units with shared kitchens, bathrooms, and amenities. Ironically, had SROs grown since 1960 at about the same rate as the rest of the U.S. housing stock, the nation would have roughly 2.5 million more such units— enough to house every American experiencing homelessness in a recent federal count more than three times over. </p>

<p>As governments throughout the United States seek to fill the gap in low-cost housing, one promising and inexpensive model is gaining traction: making shared housing legal, as it was for most of U.S. history. And one version of shared housing—converting some of the vast supply of office space left empty since the COVID-19 pandemic—looks especially promising: A single office building conversion could add hundreds of low-cost homes near jobs and transit, while a large high-rise could add more than 1,000 homes. Several states have passed laws in the last few years to remove local legal barriers to building SROs or converting certain existing buildings into SROs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This brief explores the history of SROs and their close relationship with homelessness. It also looks at strategies for adding large quantities of inexpensive housing units to meet the needs of the nation’s most vulnerable residents as well as others seeking low-cost housing. </p>
<h2>Housing costs drive homelessness&nbsp; </h2>
<p>A wealth of research has examined the causes of homelessness over the past two decades. These studies consistently find that the cost of housing is by far the primary driver. For example, several studies have concluded that an area’s median rent correlates far more closely with its homelessness rate than factors such as weather, poverty rate, and rates of mental illness or substance use.&nbsp; </p>
<p>One study found that a $100 increase in median rent was associated with a 9% increase in homelessness.<sup>1</sup> Another found that as rent-to-income ratios increase, homelessness increases in tandem.<sup>2</sup> A separate study found a strong relationship between home prices and homelessness.<sup>3</sup> Several studies have found low rental vacancy rates strongly predict high levels of homelessness.<sup>4</sup> And when rents are high, families squeeze more people into smaller spaces, with less room to help struggling friends and relatives.<sup>5</sup> Salim Furth, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, explains the link: “When housing is cheap, relatives and friends tend to have more space in their homes, enabling them to keep someone at risk of homelessness off the street. … When space is tight, the people forced out are those who are hardest to live with.”<sup>6</sup> Frequent explanations for homelessness focus on an individual’s characteristics. Certainly, people experiencing homelessness have disproportionate rates of disabilities, mental illness, and substance use compared with the general population. But cities with an abundance of low-cost homes have far less homelessness than high-cost cities, despite having similar rates of disability, mental illness, and substance abuse.<sup>7</sup> And, as noted earlier, even in New York, San Francisco, and other expensive places, homelessness was uncommon as recently as the 1970s, when those cities still had a large stock of SROs. </p>
<p>This relationship is apparent whether comparing cities or states.<sup>8</sup> High-rent states such as California, Hawaii, and New York have persistently high rates of homelessness; states with low rents, such as Alabama, Mississippi, and West Virginia, have low rates.<sup>9</sup> California’s rate of homelessness is more than 10 times Mississippi’s. The rate of homelessness in New York City and San Francisco is about 15 times that of Houston, which has the lowest rents among the largest U.S. cities. Memphis, Tennessee; Milwaukee; and Pittsburgh are three other cities that have rents lower than most U.S. cities; all have consistently maintained lower-than-average rates of homelessness.<sup>10</sup> Nationwide, as rents rose, 2023 marked an all-time high in homelessness. That mark was eclipsed in 2024. </p>
<p>We can be sure that high housing costs are causing high homelessness because as housing costs change in a city or state, homelessness tends to move in tandem. When rents rise quickly, homelessness does too; when rents rise slowly but incomes keep increasing, that improves affordability, so homelessness declines. Supply and demand are the primary drivers of rent: When jurisdictions have added more housing, rent growth has slowed and homelessness has fallen.<sup>11</sup> Where housing supply is limited, rent growth has been faster and homelessness more severe. </p>

<p>Another key indicator of the overwhelming relationship between housing costs and homelessness is the limited effectiveness of interventions targeted at other perceived causes of homelessness. An approach known as Housing First, for instance, showed great promise in the early 2000s. Previous attempts to address homelessness typically required individuals to participate in programs—drug treatment is a prominent example—before they received permanent housing. Housing First provided homeless individuals with a home along with access to social services such as counseling or treatment. The administrations of both George W. Bush and Barack Obama strongly supported Housing First, as did many states and cities. People receiving help via the Housing First strategy were far more likely to gain and keep a home than those that received conventional services.<sup>12</sup> But when the 2007-09 Great Recession hit, homebuilding across the United States collapsed. The rate of homebuilding stayed low for the next decade and has never fully recovered. The resulting housing shortage drove rents higher—and with them, homelessness—despite the continued use of Housing First.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The contrasting experience of two large Texas cities demonstrates this phenomenon clearly. Houston’s permissive homebuilding laws enabled it to increase its housing supply and hold rents low. By contrast, Dallas added much less new housing than Houston and saw much faster rent growth. Both cities used Housing First to help tackle homelessness, but while Houston’s homelessness rate fell—the city’s rate is just a fifth of the U.S. overall and by far the lowest among large cities—Dallas’ homelessness rate increased.<sup>13</sup> </p>

<p>Raleigh, North Carolina, provides another example of the link between high rents and homelessness. Median rents there jumped 34% from 2017 to 2022, and homelessness rose 62%.<sup>14</sup> But Raleigh enacted reforms that made it easier to build homes, including town houses, accessory dwelling units, and two- and three-unit buildings.<sup>15</sup> Rents didn’t rise at all in Raleigh from the start of 2022 to the start of 2024, and homelessness fell 35%.<sup>16</sup> Austin, Texas, had a similar experience, with rents and homelessness soaring from 2017 to 2022, but after land-use reforms made it easier to add housing, Austin saw both rents and homelessness decline.<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Extensive research has shown that adding housing supply, as Houston has done, slows rent growth, improving affordability. The main mechanism for this is that as new housing is added, there is less competition for older housing, which becomes more affordable. New housing helps improve affordability immediately, increasing supply and reducing demand pressure on the rest of the housing stock. In this way, more construction of new housing helps ensure a steady supply of lower-cost housing to accommodate lower-income residents. For example, when individual markets such as Austin and Phoenix saw a large number of new apartments delivered in 2023 (mainly projects that had started when interest rates were very low a couple of years earlier), rents declined across the board.<sup>18</sup> But they fell most in older apartments with few amenities.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>SROs and homelessness—an intertwined history </h2>
<h3>A new era gives rise to a new housing model </h3>
<p>Homelessness first became an issue on a national scale in the 1870s. Continued upheaval in the aftermath of the Civil War and industrialization pushed more people into “riding the rails” on the nation’s new railroad system in search of jobs.<sup>19</sup> The rise of these itinerant workers, in turn, drove the development of early rooming houses and residential hotels, particularly for Americans at the lower end of the income scale. Rooms could be rented by the night, week, or month. </p>

<p>Rooming and lodging houses were the first examples of SRO housing in the United States. Often, they were converted from single-family houses, tenement apartment buildings, or commercial office and warehouse properties. In other cases, single-family homes were not converted, but owners rented out individual rooms. American Enterprise Institute researchers have noted that before the 1920s, about one-third to one-half of urban residents were either boarders or rented part of their home to boarders.<sup>20</sup> However, hotels designed to serve medium- and long-term tenants also began appearing in U.S. cities: Residential hotels became the most common SRO model throughout the country. Some residential hotels offered meal service in luxurious dining rooms, as well as regular laundry and maid service; less expensive hotels featured dark rooms without windows or even just a dry space on an open floor in a flophouse for 5 cents to 10 cents a night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Residential hotel construction peaked in the early 20th century in most cities. By the 1920s, many cheap hotels in big cities such as New York, San Francisco, and Chicago offered a mix of private rooms; large rooms converted to tiny, cubicle-style bedrooms with partitions that did not reach the ceilings; and open-air wards with rows of cots.<sup>21</sup> At the time, a private room might rent for 25 cents to 40 cents a night and the semiprivate cubicles and open wards for 15 cents to 25 cents a night. That’s far less than anything available in modern U.S. cities: 40 cents in 1924 is the equivalent of about $7.40 in 2025, roughly $230 a month. That would be affordable even to a person living below the federal poverty line (defined as $15,650 in income for a one-person household in 2025).&nbsp; </p>

<p>Hotels nationwide were much different than they are today. They were much more likely to host long-term occupants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. One 1930 survey of hotels throughout the country found that long-term residents occupied an average of 20% of the rooms in the most expensive third of American hotels, and at least 75% of rooms in low- and mid-priced hotels.<sup>22</sup></p>
<p>In New York City, low-rent, single-room occupancy exploded during the Great Depression and World War II, when tens of thousands of people moved from the South and Puerto Rico to work in the city’s munitions factories and on major construction projects. By the 1950s, the city had more than 200,000 SRO units, accounting for more than 10% of the city’s rental housing stock.<sup>23</sup> In 1986, 87,000 New Yorkers still lived in hotels, according to what was then the largest study of inexpensive hotels undertaken by a city government in the U.S. Across the five boroughs, 43% of SRO residents were under 40 years old and 32% were 40 to 60 years old; a third were Black; and a quarter were Latino.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the same era in San Francisco, many long-term occupants of residential hotels were retired Filipino or Chinese laborers or newly arrived families from Southeast Asia.<sup>24</sup> In 1977, 330 sheriff’s deputies and policemen showed up to evict 40 elderly Filipino and Chinese residents from the International Hotel, triggering outcry and concern as well as a congressional report.<sup>25</sup> </p>
<h3>A backlash against SROs causes an explosion of homelessness </h3>
<p>Even as SRO hotels and rooming houses provided homes for many of the poorest U.S. residents, problems arose. The housing was often of low quality and poorly maintained, and some neighbors complained about SRO residents. </p>
<p>Some politicians scapegoated SRO residents, increasingly portraying them as poor, dependent on alcohol or drugs, reliant on public welfare, transient, and immoral.<sup>26</sup> This image was compounded by the condition of many SRO buildings, which even in the early 1900s were often run-down and neglected. Reformers blamed crowded apartments and unsanitary shared bathroom facilities for the spread of common diseases like pneumonia and tuberculosis.<sup>27</sup> Some policymakers and activists viewed residential hotels and SROs as a public nuisance and a decaying form of housing that should be eliminated. “The SRO should not be accepted as lawful housing for any segment of our population,” an aide to New York City Mayor Robert F. Wagner reportedly said in 1965.<sup>28</sup> “ No community should equate such housing with the acceptable living standards of the 1960s.” </p>
<p>Many city and state governments began crafting policies in the 1950s and 1960s that encouraged property owners to convert SRO buildings to tourist-oriented hotels or traditional apartments. Newly enacted zoning codes and building codes made creating SROs illegal or economically unviable. Researchers have noted that market forces alone would have been unlikely to decimate the stock of SROs because they were profitable to operate when allowed and declined only when new laws targeted them. </p>
<p>The scale of the loss of low-cost housing in the second half of the 20th century is staggering. There is no reliable count of the number of SRO units lost before 1970; “estimates usually refer to ‘millions’ of rooms closed, converted, or torn down in major U.S. cities,” the historian Paul Groth said.<sup>29</sup> He estimates that another million residential hotel rooms were destroyed or converted in the subsequent decade, from 1970 to 1980.<sup>30</sup> Almost all of that housing was destroyed or converted to other uses in response to zoning and building code reforms or tax incentives enacted for the specific purpose of eliminating SROs.</p>
<p>New York City, for example, banned construction of SRO buildings and the creation of new SRO units from existing buildings in 1955. Over the next two decades, the city enacted a series of other building code and zoning changes, which raised the costs of operating SRO buildings and had the effect of encouraging owners to convert them to other uses.<sup>31</sup> This meant that apartments in a building were required to have an average size much larger than SROs, in addition to the ban on new SROs. In the 1970s, New York City enacted tax abatements that gave SRO owners a financial incentive to convert SROs into rent-stabilized apartments with bathrooms and kitchens included (and higher rents). The tax break worked as intended, driving the conversion of 40 residential hotels a year.<sup>32</sup> In response to the city and state incentives and regulatory changes, owners destroyed two-thirds of New York City’s remaining SRO units from 1976 to 1981, a state Assembly study found at the time.<sup>33 </sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>New York City was not alone. Starting in the 1960s, for example, San Francisco decided to redevelop South of Market, making way for what became the Moscone Convention Center and Yerba Buena Gardens—an area where 41% of the 240 resident families lived in hotels. Justin Herman, who led the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency from 1959 to 1971 and accelerated its urban renewal efforts throughout the city, was quoted as saying, “This land is too valuable to permit poor people to park on it.”<sup>34</sup> Studies estimate that 40,000 residential hotel rooms were destroyed by urban renewal programs in San Francisco—including more than 6,000 in just five years from 1975 to 1980—though the city did not maintain public records on the total.<sup>35</sup>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Similarly, Seattle demolished half of its SROs downtown—16,200 units—between 1960 and 1973.<sup>36</sup> A catastrophic fire at the five-story Ozark Hotel in March 1970 led to a wave of demolition. After the fire, Seattle changed its building code to require either sprinklers or fire-resistant doors and stairways for buildings where residents lived on the fourth story or higher. These costly upgrades made it challenging to operate inexpensive units. The city demolished 5,000 SRO units during its enforcement of this one code change—the so-called Ozark fire code—in the 1970s.<sup>37</sup> Several other building code mandates followed, prompting many residential hotel owners to abandon their buildings rather than incur the higher costs to maintain them; by 1982, nearly 30% of the remaining units in downtown Seattle sat vacant.<sup>38</sup>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Other notable examples include Boston, which lost nearly 90% of its SROs from the 1950s to 1985;<sup> </sup>&nbsp;Chicago, which lost 80% of its SRO units—32,000 rooms—between 1973 and 1984; and San Diego, which lost about 1,247 units from 1976 to 1984.<sup>39</sup> Cincinnati is estimated to have lost more than 2,000 units during the 1970s, about 42% of its SRO stock.<sup>40</sup>&nbsp; </p>
<p>As the nation’s least expensive source of housing disappeared, homelessness soared in major cities across the United States. In New York City, for example,<em> </em>the number of homeless residents increased from a barely visible population to almost 30,000 by 1987.<sup>41</sup> About half of men entering homeless shelters in the city in 1980 reported they had previously lived in SROs. The sudden loss of SROs and commensurate rise in homelessness prompted an advocate in New York to remark: “The people you see sleeping under bridges used to be valued members of the housing market … they aren’t anymore.”&nbsp; </p>

<p>A series of social, political, and economic changes also battered large U.S. cities in the 1980s, contributing to the homelessness epidemic. State psychiatric hospitals released people suffering from mental illness without adequate provisions for outpatient care. Property owners abandoned inner cities, leaving empty buildings. AIDS arrived. The federal government reduced subsidies for public housing and rental assistance and made it more difficult for people with disabilities to qualify for Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Cuts to SSI—which largely benefits disabled people and those over 65—and a tightening of eligibility for disability payments in the early 1980s added to the financial instability of many struggling Americans.<sup>42</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some regions, especially the Northeast, homelessness became less visible after the initial surge in the early 1980s, as cities and towns increased shelter capacity. As a result, a larger share of people experience sheltered rather than unsheltered homelessness in cold-weather cities, especially in the Northeast. But the life outcomes of people without homes who live in shelters are little better than for those without homes who live on the street. Both groups lose decades of life expectancy.<sup>43</sup>&nbsp; </p>
<p>By the 1990s, only a tiny fraction of SRO hotels were left in the United States. Housing costs were lower in the 1990s than today (even in income-adjusted terms), but the lack of SROs meant that homelessness continued unabated. With the lowest rung on the housing ladder missing, many people could not afford rent for conventional apartments or houses, including shared ones.<sup>44</sup>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Nationwide, homelessness has been rising since 2017 as housing has become increasingly more expensive. Between 2022 and 2023 alone, the number of homeless people in the U.S. rose by 12%, to more than 653,000, according to the annual count compiled by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).<sup>45</sup> That meant 20 in 10,000 Americans were experiencing homelessness on a single night in January, the most since HUD began counting in 2007.<sup>46</sup> In 2024, the homelessness rate jumped to 23 in 10,000.<sup>47</sup> More than a third of all individuals identified in the HUD count were living on the street, in abandoned buildings, or beneath bridges—or, in the words of the HUD report, “in places not meant for human habitation.”<sup>48</sup> The 2023 record was broken in 2024, when HUD released data identifying 771,480 homeless Americans, an 18% increase from 2023. These numbers are widely considered an underestimate.&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h3>2.5 Million Missing Low-Cost Units </h3>
<p>In 1960, when the loss of SROs was just beginning, there were 6.9 million single-person households in the U.S. By 2023, that number had reached 38 million.<sup>49</sup> In that time, the nation’s housing stock grew by a factor of 2.5, from 58.3 million homes to 145.4 million. Meanwhile, more than 1 million SRO units were destroyed or converted to other uses from 1970 to 1980 alone. Had the SRO stock grown at a similar rate as the rest of the nation’s housing supply, the U.S. would have added 1.5 million units rather than losing 1 million, for a net change of 2.5 million more SRO units. That’s more than triple the number of people experiencing homelessness in HUD’s 2024 count.<sup>50</sup>  </p>

<p>New housing is usually expensive, and as homes get older, they get more affordable as high-income residents move into costly new housing. SROs, though, can be created at a much lower price point than other types of housing because the units are small and residents generally share bathrooms and kitchens. The same building using an SRO-style layout can simply fit more units that cost less than conventional apartments. Historically, SROs usually weren’t new construction; instead, they were created from other residential or commercial buildings whose original use no longer made sense. As the U.S. finds itself with more than a billion square feet of vacant office space in 2025, there is an opportunity to do what property owners did in the late 1800s and early 1900s: convert underused space into low-cost, well-located SRO-style housing units. It’s not possible to create all 2.5 million missing units this way, but SRO layouts are so efficient that a single high-rise building can hold more than 1,000 units.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<h3>Full circle: Surging homelessness drives renewed interest in SROs&nbsp; </h3>
<p>As early as the mid-1980s, the problem of homelessness in New York City had gotten so severe that legislators tried to reverse course on SROs.<sup>51</sup> The city government passed Local Law 19 in May 1983, adding protections for SRO tenants. The city ended tax benefits for converting SROs in 1983.<sup>52</sup> Eventually, the City Council banned the conversion, alteration, demolition, or warehousing (holding units vacant for years to make them eligible for conversion or demolition) of SRO units altogether. But the New York Court of Appeals ruled these bans unconstitutional because they prevented property owners from determining how their buildings could be used.<sup>53</sup> Similarly, Chicago officials passed an SRO preservation ordinance to discourage conversions or sales of SROs in 2014, but by that time, the large majority had already been lost.<sup>54</sup> The city’s zoning and building codes made it challenging to build new ones.</p>
<p>Although New York City’s policy to block owners of SRO buildings from converting them to new uses was overturned by courts, city officials took other steps to preserve SROs even as different city laws banned the creation of new ones. One of these statutes was an anti-harassment policy instituted decades ago, which required that landlords looking to convert SROs prove that they had not harassed tenants to move out, such as by making living conditions intolerable or failing to perform needed maintenance. But this policy, known as a Certification of Non-Harassment (CONH), added costs and administrative requirements for landlords, contributing to the difficulty of operating SROs. The program was changed and expanded in 2018 to require that landlords also get a CONH before renovating SRO buildings.<sup>55</sup> Ultimately, however, neither the city nor the state has taken effective steps to rehabilitate or meaningfully expand the city’s SRO stock.<sup>56</sup>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Despite all of this, New York City probably still has the largest remaining stock of SRO hotels and rooming houses in the country. A paper from the Furman Center at New York University estimated that there were as many as 30,000 SRO units remaining in the city in 2014.<sup>57</sup> The city regulates SROs as part of its rent stabilization program, meaning owners can raise rents by only a low amount each year and need to file documentation with the city on each unit’s rent. In 2022, the state housing agency reported 322 regulated SRO buildings with 11,051 units, of which nearly half—more than 5,300—were rent-stabilized.<sup>58</sup> The median monthly allowable rent for these units was $1,018 in 2022, compared with $1,641 for a regular rental apartment in the city in 2023 (including public housing, rent-controlled housing, subsidized housing, and conventional, market-rate housing).<sup>59</sup>&nbsp; </p>

<p>Although New York has the most existing SROs, several Western states have been the first to pass new laws to enable construction of single-occupancy units. State governments have increasingly stepped in to require that certain types of housing be allowed because localities have not taken adequate steps to address the housing shortage.<sup>60</sup> That was rare in the past: From 2011 to 2016, all states combined passed an average of one law per year to allow more homes; from 2023 to 2024, that number jumped to 48 for all states combined. In 2024, the Washington Legislature passed legislation requiring cities to allow SRO-type housing wherever multifamily housing of six or more units is permitted, beginning in late 2025.<sup>61</sup> This legislation authorizes small units with shared bathrooms and kitchens; limits off-street parking requirements to one spot for every four bedrooms; and prohibits all parking mandates for buildings within half a mile of a major transit stop.<sup>62</sup> The bill was one of several that Washington passed to ensure that some types of lower-cost housing are allowed even where local governments had blocked them before or residents fought development.<sup>63</sup> Seattle had previously allowed development of low-cost micro-units, for example, but city officials in 2013 enacted laws that effectively prohibited them. </p>
<p>The Oregon Legislature enacted similar legislation in 2023, allowing micro-units in all areas zoned for residential use in cities across the state, including an SRO with up to six units on a parcel zoned for single-family use.<sup>64</sup> As of Jan.1, 2025, Hawaii communities must allow the conversion of commercial properties into SRO housing.<sup>65</sup> Montana took a somewhat different approach, passing legislation in 2023 that created a housing “menu” for its cities and towns to choose from—a series of options from which cities must choose at least five to allow more housing.<sup>66</sup> One of these is to permit co-living micro-units.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Perhaps the simplest method of creating low-cost shared housing is to allow unrelated individuals to share a house in the same way that relatives are allowed to share a house.<sup>67</sup> But many communities limit the number of unrelated people who can live together—in some places, to as few as two. Such laws make sharing a house for a group of roommates—which usually enables rents lower than having an individual apartment—illegal. The U.S. has a record number of unused bedrooms, but many cannot be rented because of restrictions on house sharing by unrelated roommates, even if that would be the most profitable use for the landlord and the most affordable option for the tenants.<sup>68</sup> To enable this low-cost housing option, Iowa, Oregon, and Colorado all passed bipartisan legislation to strike down local codes that prohibit house-sharing (in 2017, 2021, and 2024, respectively).<sup>69</sup>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In all of those cases, states have stepped in when localities did not act, authorizing lower-cost housing and limiting the ability of local governments to ban inexpensive housing. The aim of those laws is to increase the rental market for low- and moderate-income residents and make more use of existing housing stock. If these bills succeed, and a large number of micro-units reach market, their rents will likely be low, since individual rooms, when available, usually rent for far less than houses or apartments.<sup>70</sup> And while these units are intended for individuals rather than larger households, Manhattan Institute researchers have noted that they could “help release three- and four-bedroom apartments currently occupied by unrelated millennials” for use by families.<sup>71</sup> </p>

<p>Individual rooms also cost less to build than apartments and houses. In October 2024, February 2025, and April 2025, The Pew Charitable Trusts and Gensler, a global architecture, design, and planning firm, released three reports that described how vacant office space in large cities could be converted into low-cost micro-units with shared bathrooms and kitchens—essentially a safe, clean, code-compliant, well-located version of SROs.<sup>72</sup> The projected rents for rooms in these converted buildings are about half of the median in the studied markets and therefore affordable to residents earning 30% to 50% of the area median income, with much lower public subsidies than are generally required to build low-cost apartments.<sup>73</sup> The small unit size (120-220 square feet), shared bathrooms, and shared kitchens would lead to development costs at least 50% lower than the cost of building new studio apartments. If these modern SRO rooms were priced right, a wide range of residents might elect to live in conveniently located downtown housing. But this option could make the biggest difference for low-income residents who are now struggling to afford any type of home.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Many Americans are struggling. Nationwide, about 11 million tenant households—one-fourth of all renters in the U.S.—are considered extremely low-income, earning at or below the federal poverty line of $15,650 for a single person or $32,150 for a family of four or if they earn less than 30% of their area’s median income. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, the United </p>
<p>States is short more than 7 million rental units that are affordable for those households.<sup>74</sup> California has the nation’s largest extremely low-income renter population, with nearly 1.3 million households.<sup>75</sup> And of those, more than three-quarters are severely “rent burdened,” meaning they spend more than 50% of their income on housing costs. New York has the second-highest number of extremely low-income renter households, at just under 1 million.<sup>76</sup>&nbsp; </p>
<p>New York State has taken fewer steps than some other states to house its poorest citizens. In 2023,Governor Kathy Hochul (D) announced $50 million in funding to help landlords repair 500 SROs across the state, a quiet reversal of long-standing anti-SRO policies.<sup>77</sup> And for the first time in decades, New York City has removed one of the barriers to new SRO units as part of a slate of zoning changes, called City of Yes for Housing Opportunity. City of Yes, which broadly aims to allow modestly more residential development throughout New York’s five boroughs, removed the minimum average unit-size requirements in Manhattan south of 96th Street and in downtown Brooklyn.<sup>78</sup> But New York City’s building code still has other obstacles to converting space into SRO-style housing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even with these efforts to add low-cost housing and reduce homelessness, from 2022 to 2023, the U.S. added fewer than 37,000 beds specifically to help individuals transitioning out of homelessness, an increase of just 7%. Providing safe, affordable homes for the hundreds of thousands of Americans experiencing homelessness will require far more ambitious policy initiatives informed by a recognition of the vital role SROs have played in U.S. housing for a century and a half.</p>
<h2>Conclusion </h2>
<p>Housing costs are by far the strongest determinant of homelessness. Areas with high costs have high homelessness rates, and areas with low housing costs have low homelessness rates. When rents rise quickly, homelessness does, too. When rent growth is contained, homelessness drops. Increasing the housing supply helps hold rent growth down, making housing more affordable. But adding low-cost housing is especially helpful in preventing homelessness.&nbsp; </p>

<p>When SROs were widespread in the United States, even the nation’s poorest residents could usually afford a home. But as targeted zoning, building codes, and tax incentives led to the demise of the SRO housing stock, homelessness became commonplace. Had the country’s stock of SRO housing merely grown in line with other types of housing, the U.S. would have about 2.5 million additional low-cost homes—more than triple the number of people counted as homeless in January 2024.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In an effort to bring back low-cost housing, some states that are struggling with high homelessness rates have begun to remove legal barriers to the development of co-living buildings that feature private micro-units with shared bathrooms and kitchens. If more states and cities reduce regulatory barriers to this type of housing—and ideally provide incentives to kick-start its development—the nation has a real opportunity to once again make homelessness rare and ensure that the most financially vulnerable Americans, such as those earning minimum wage or receiving Social Security benefits, can afford a place to live. </p>

    <li> This estimate is at the low end of what is likely necessary to meet Americans’ housing needs. In 1960, just 13% of U.S. households had one person. By 2020, that figure was 28%. Because single-person households have increased more than fivefold from 6.9 million in 1960 to 38.1 million in 2023, more single-room housing units are probably needed as an overall share of the housing stock.</li>

Zig calls it a “<a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/e17a050bc695f7d117b89adb1d258813593ca111/lib/std/segmented_list.zig" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Segmented List</a>”. Then theres C++ with <code>std::deque</code>, which is only somewhat similar. I like the name that <a href="https://mastodon.social/@pervognsen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Per Vognsen</a> uses: “<a href="https://gist.github.com/pervognsen/c9d18e8012ce497e7a92d3f86c112337" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Segment Array</a>”.</p><p>You can download my single-header C implementation here: <a href="https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/segment_array/segment_array.h">segment_array.h</a>.</p><p>The core concept is straight forward: items are stored in multiple contiguous segments, and each segment is double the length of its predecessor. New segments are allocated only when needed, and their pointers are kept in a fixed sized array.

The layout also allows us to access any index in constant time.</p><h2 id="the-implementation">The Implementation</h2><p>You could implement a Segment Array just from the description above, but there are a few details worth discussing further. Here’s the above diagram as a C struct:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>u32</span> <span>count</span><span>;</span>

</span></span><span><span><span>}</span> <span>SegmentArrayInternal</span><span>;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You might be surprised that the <code>segments</code> array has such a low fixed size. Most computers today use only 48 bits of the 64 bits in a pointer. That means 49 segments would hold more items than a pointer could even point to (aka more than 256 TiB of memory), so anything above 48 is out. I like to be able to use a <code>u32</code> to index the array<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> when I don’t need more than 4 billion items. That reduces the segments to 32. Finally, I shave off 6 more segments because the smallest segments sizes (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32) aren’t worth their overhead, so the 64 item segment becomes the first segment. 26 segments can hold 4,294,967,232 items (just under <code>UINT32_MAX</code>).</p><p>The <code>segments</code> array being a fixed size is actually important because it means it’s right next to the rest of the struct in memory and likely wont get a cache miss when we index into it.</p><p>You may have noticed I keep mentioning segment sizes that are a power of two. It’s not strictly necessary, but it makes the math nice and allows us to use fast bit shift operations for calculating indices:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span><span>#define SMALL_SEGMENTS_TO_SKIP 6

Once you have all items, you copy them into a fixed sized array and free the linked list.</li><li>Virtual Memory Array - Use mmap (macOS, Linux) or VirtualAlloc (Windows) to reserve a huge amount of virtual address space and commit to physical memory as the array grows. This can’t be used on platforms without virtual memory like webassembly and embedded systems.</li></ul><p>They each have different trade offs:</p><hr><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Growable</th><th>Arena Friendly</th><th>Random Access</th><th>Contiguous</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Fixed Size Array</td><td>❌</td><td>✅</td><td>✅</td><td>✅</td></tr><tr><td>Dynamic Array</td><td>✅</td><td>❌</td><td>✅</td><td>✅</td></tr><tr><td>Chunked Linked List</td><td>✅</td><td>✅</td><td>❌</td><td>❌</td></tr><tr><td>Hybrid Approach</td><td>✅ (at creation)</td><td>✅</td><td>✅ (after creation)</td><td>✅ (after creation)</td></tr><tr><td>Virtual Memory Array</td><td>✅ (up to reservation)</td><td>not really</td><td>✅</td><td>✅</td></tr><tr><td>Segment Array</td><td>✅</td><td>✅</td><td>✅</td><td>❌</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><p>Average memory efficiency:</p><ul><li>Fixed Size Array: 100%</li><li>Dynamic Array: 83% with a 1.5x growth factor, 75% with a 2x growth factor</li><li>Chunked Linked List: nearly 100%.

    </div><p>Dan Burton has trapped hundreds of wild pigs for clients of his wildlife control company in Salinas, but even he was startled when he cut one of them open and found blue meat inside.</p>


										      
																																	<p>"I'm not talking about a little blue," said Burton, owner of Urban Trapping Wildlife Control. "I'm talking about neon blue, blueberry blue."</p>
<p>Burton immediately knew what the problem was and relayed the disturbing discovery to Monterey County officials and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.</p>
<p>The agency is now warning trappers and hunters to keep an eye out for possibly contaminated <a href="https://phys.org/tags/wildlife/" rel="tag">wildlife</a> in the area, and not to consume the tainted meat, over concerns the blue meat is a sign that the animal may have consumed poison.</p>
<p>"It's just wild," Burton said.</p>
<p>The startling find of wild pigs with bright blue tissue in Monterey County suggests the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/wild+animals/" rel="tag">wild animals</a> have been exposed to the anticoagulant rodenticide diphacinone, a popular poison used by farmers and agriculture companies to control the population of rats, mice, squirrels and other <a href="https://phys.org/tags/small+animals/" rel="tag">small animals</a>, according to a statement from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.</p>
<p>"Hunters should be aware that the meat of game animals, such as wild pig, deer, bear and geese, might be contaminated if that game animal has been exposed to rodenticides," said Ryan Bourbor, pesticide investigations coordinator with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.</p>
<p>Officials are urging hunters not to consume any meat from an animal with signs of the blue pigmentation in their meat or fat, and to report the find to officials.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>Predators and people who eat animals that were poisoned by diphacinone can suffer "secondary exposure" to the poison because the substance can remain for a time in the organs and tissue of the poisoned animal.</p>
<p>"Generally, more than one feeding is needed to receive a toxic dose," according to a 2023 study, but people and animals that consume the substance can start feeling the effects of the poison, including signs of lethargy.</p>
<p>Another study published in 2011 found that cooking meat tainted with diphacinone had little effect on the concentration of the poison, and recommended that "consumption of pig meat obtained from areas with active rodent control programs should be avoided."</p>
<p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife said it became aware of the wild pigs' exposure to rat poison in March, when a trapper in Monterey County reported finding several wild pigs with blue muscle and fat.</p>
<p>The animals were tested by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife's Wildlife Health Lab and found the animals had anticoagulant rodenticide diphacinone in the stomach and liver, according to a statement from the agency.</p>
<p>Rodenticide baits are often dyed so they can be identified as poison, and the unusual blue-colored muscle is a sign that the animal may have eaten the poison, or eaten an animal that had been exposed to the poison.</p>
<p>Officials also warn that the blue coloring may not always be present in animals that have been exposed.</p>
<p>The rodenticide can pose a problem for farmers and agriculture companies that use it to control animals that can destroy or damage crops, but they end up poisoning other wild animals as well, Bourbor said.</p>

																									
																																			<p>Burton said his company discovered the affected animals when it was hired by an agriculture firm in late February and March to trap wild pigs that were going into the firm's fields.</p>
<p>His company traps the pigs and then euthanizes them according to state law, he said. He usually donates the carcass and meat of the pigs to low-income families. But in this case, the pigs were found with bright blue meat and fat when they were opened up.</p>
<p>"I thought, OK, that's weird," Burton said.</p>
<p>Burton said he investigated to try to figure out how the pigs' meat had become tainted and found that the animals appeared to be targeting squirrel bait stations in the field, which were being used to control the squirrel population.</p>
<p>"These pigs were seeking (the bait traps) out," Burton said. "I saw them trying to flip it over, breaking them, trying to get access to the poison."</p>
<p>The pigs that were consuming the poisoned bait were not immediately dying because they were consuming bait meant to kill much smaller animals, Burton said. The pigs, which Burton said weighed between 100 and 200 pounds, appeared to be acting normally even though their tissue was visibly affected by the poison.</p>
<p>The poison is also not fast-acting even for small animals, which can stay alive for several days before the poison takes effect, he said.</p>
<p>The pigs were submitted for testing and found to have been exposed to the poison over an extended period of time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the firm that hired Burton's company pulled the squirrel traps off the field, Burton said, out of concern that it was drawing in groups of the pigs.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>"Our concern is we're seeing multiple animals doing it," Burton said.</p>
<p>Diphacinone, the substance found in the pigs, is mostly prohibited across California, unless it is used by a certified vector control technician, government agency, or at agricultural sites, according to the California Department of Pesticide Regulation.</p>
<p>The prohibition became effective in 2024 as part of a law aimed at protecting wildlife from exposure to the poison.</p>
<p>According to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, a 2018 study found that about 8.3% of wild pigs tested had traces of anticoagulant rodenticide residue.</p>
<p>Burton said his main concern was that young hunters might not be aware of the signs to look for when hunting the pigs.</p>
<p>The CDFW asks that anyone who comes across an animal with the blue fat or tissue to contact the agency at whlab@wildlife.ca.gov or (916) 358-2790.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><p>The app Tea is a kind of digital whisper network for women. No men are allowed to join. Those who wish to be members must submit evidence, including selfies, in order to prove that they are women. Once they’ve been admitted, users have access to profiles of men annotated with information such as background checks and dating reviews; men with shady dating histories are rated with red flags. After launching in 2023, the Tea app got little attention for two years. Then, in July, thanks to TikTok and Instagram videos testifying to the app’s effectiveness at sussing out creeps, it reportedly gained more than two million new user requests. This might have been just another triumphant startup story, except that, on July 25th, the app suffered a data breach, and users’ selfies, I.D. photos, posts, and direct messages began appearing on the anonymous message board 4chan. Tea is meant to delete users’ documents after it verifies them, but it clearly had failed to do so. (The company has said that all of the leaked material was years old, which for victims of the breach must be cold comfort.) A Gen Z online-privacy activist named May, who asked that I leave out her last name, watched the leak happen and feared what it meant for the women who’d assumed that they were communicating within a protected space. “People can go and see that you’ve posted something about a guy,” May said. “He can now go after you.” (Tea did not respond to requests for comment.)</p><p>The Tea spillage is emblematic of what’s at risk when we attach our real-life identities to our online activities. Yet the tethering of identity to digital access is precisely what is prescribed by a new wave of laws going into effect around the world and in bills under consideration in the U.S. On the same day that the Tea leak was discovered, the Online Safety Act (<em>OSA</em>) rolled out in the United Kingdom. The act mandates that online platforms implement age verification in order to block underage users from “harmful and age-inappropriate content,” such as pornography and material that might encourage eating disorders, bullying, hate, or substance abuse. In theory, such laws protect minors, but in practice they affect all users’ experience of the internet. In order to verify who is a child online, after all, sites must also determine who is <em>not</em>. Adults in the U.K. now have to upload photos of their I.D.s showing their dates of birth or submit to <a data-offer-url="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/protecting-children/age-checks-for-online-safety--what-you-need-to-know-as-a-user" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/protecting-children/age-checks-for-online-safety--what-you-need-to-know-as-a-user&quot;}" href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/protecting-children/age-checks-for-online-safety--what-you-need-to-know-as-a-user" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">other tests</a>—facial-age estimation (from a selfie, say), a bank-account evaluation, a credit-card check—in order to watch certain music videos on Spotify or create unrestricted new social-media accounts. Eric Goldman, an associate dean at Santa Clara University School of Law, who has been studying online age verification, told me that these changes are about to dismantle what remains of the open web, which was predicated on anyone being able to access almost anything. “We’re witnessing the real-time destruction of the internet as we know it,” he said.</p><p>It is up to publishers to enforce these rules and determine what counts as “harmful.” Reddit has been particularly aggressive in complying with <em>OSA</em> in the U.K., requiring age verification for access to subforums on subjects including Alcoholics Anonymous, medical cannabis, and menstruation. The chat app Discord requires U.K. users to verify their age if they want to make certain changes to their moderation settings such as turning off message requests. X, Grindr, and Bluesky are rolling out forms of verification, too. Users, meanwhile, are devising ways to get around the barriers without giving up their identities. Virtual private networks, or V.P.N.s, can make it appear as though someone is browsing from another country; one V.P.N. provider reported an <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn72ydj70g5o">eighteen-hundred-per-cent increase</a> in daily sign-ups from the U.K. after <em>OSA</em> age-verification rules went into effect. Other people are using A.I.-generated images or video-game screenshots to falsify their identities.</p><p>Shoshana Weissmann, the director of digital media at the R Street Institute, a libertarian-leaning think tank, told me that these regulations might superficially seem similar to a liquor store or a night club requiring patrons to show I.D.—just another minor annoyance that we accept as routine. A store clerk glancing at an I.D., however, is very different from a website storing personal data or tracking users’ activities. As the Tea leak demonstrated, any age-verification system that stores user data comes with vulnerabilities and risks compromising users’ privacy. In short, the new safety laws eliminate the relative anonymity that we have continued to expect online even as social media has collapsed the boundaries between our physical and digital lives. Some users will surely decide that it’s not worth sacrificing privacy for access to online material, which means that fewer people who may benefit from a putatively sensitive space, such as an online A.A. community, will ultimately access it. As Goldman put it, “Age-authentication mandates shrink the internet for adults.” The chilling effect will be felt especially among those who lack proper identification credentials and among publishers who can’t easily afford verification software, without which they risk incurring steep fines.</p><p>More such laws are coming. Australia is attempting to ban those under sixteen from social media, including from YouTube, and is set to roll out age-verification mandates even for search engines. France began mandating age verification for adult content in April, and, in June, President Emmanuel Macron proposed banning children under the age of fifteen from social media. In the U.S., the Kids Online Safety Act was reintroduced with bipartisan support this year. The bill originated in 2022, inspired, in part, by the leaking of internal Facebook documents showing that the company was aware of its products’ negative impacts on minors. If passed into law, it would in some ways give young users more agency over their internet experience, including the right to delete their data and to opt out of algorithmic recommendations. But, like <em>OSA</em>, it also includes age-verification measures that will be impossible to implement without compromising all users’ access to the internet. Many tech companies, including Apple, have come out in support of <em>KOSA</em>, hinting at the way increased surveillance might hurt individuals more than businesses, which never shy from collecting user data. YouTube is already rolling out automated, A.I.-driven age-verification tools to restrict certain content from American minors.</p><p>May, the Michigan activist, has been following developments in online regulation since the passage of the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/after-the-closure-of-backpage-increasingly-vulnerable-sex-workers-are-demanding-their-rights"><em>FOSTA-SESTA</em> laws</a>, in 2018, under Donald Trump, which pushed sex workers offline by holding digital platforms such as Backpage liable for hosting their content. In 2022, May started a Discord chat for people seeking to fight back against <em>KOSA</em>’s proposed policies; it now has more than three thousand members working on campaigns and petitions. The vengeful and draconian tactics of the second Trump Administration have caused many people from marginalized groups to be more fearful of making their personal identities public. As May put it, “You have queer people fleeing from Texas and Florida, and now you want my government I.D. attached to what I look up as an adult?” Put another way, if protecting underage users from harmful content means implementing blanket surveillance, have you made the internet safer or less so? May has noticed that younger members of her Discord seem particularly worried that they won’t be able to access digital spaces as safely as they did before: “The prospect of them losing their online communities—for a lot of these young people, that’s all they have.” Then again, those of us who are most reliant on the internet have tended to undervalue our anonymity, giving it up easily to the likes of Google and Meta in exchange for smoothly customized communication. Even now, prospective new Tea users are clamoring in the app’s Instagram comments to have their identities verified.&nbsp;♦</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>This post is the second iteration of a series of posts that provide an in-depth look at the development of Tyr, a state-of-the-art Rust GPU driver for the Linux Kernel, supporting Arm Mali CSF-based GPUs.</p>
<p>As promised in the first iteration, we will now explore how GPU drivers work in more detail by exploring an application known as <code>VkCube</code>. As the program name implies, this application uses the Vulkan API to render a rotating cube on the screen. Its simplicity makes it a prime candidate to be used as a learning aid in our journey through GPU drivers.</p>
<p>This article will first introduce the concept of User Mode Drivers (<code>UMD</code>s) and Kernel Mode Drivers (<code>KMD</code>s), breaking down the steps needed to actually describe <code>VkCube</code>'s workload to the GPU. This will be done in a more compact way for brevity as it's a rather extensive topic that has been detailed in several books.</p>
<p>We will wrap up with an overview of the actual API offered by Tyr. As previously stated, this is the same API offered by Panthor, which is the C driver for the same hardware.</p>
<h3>A quick introduction to GPU drivers</h3>
<p>It is easier to introduce this topic by considering a simple 3D application like drawing a single triangle, or VkCube, a program that will render a rotating cube on the screen. Throughout this brief introduction, I will be using the terms UMD (usermode driver) to refer to the non-privileged part of the driver. For us this is <code>panvk</code>, a Vulkan driver that is part of Mesa. The term KMD, on the other hand, refers to the privileged part of the driver. That is represented by Tyr, a kernel driver that aims to be part of the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>The starting point is to understand that a kernel-mode GPU driver connects a much larger UMD (user-mode driver) to the actual GPU. The UMD will actually implement APIs like Vulkan, OpenGL, OpenCL, and others. These APIs, in turn, will be used by actual programs to describe their workload to the GPU. This includes allocating and using not only the geometry and textures, but also the shaders being used to process said data into the final result. This means that a key aspect of GPU drivers is actually allocating GPU memory to house data related to the current scene being drawn so that it can actually be operated on by the hardware.</p>
<p>Shaders are full-blown programs running on the GPU. They are extremely powerful and can be used in a lot of ways, but for VkCube their main purpose is to place the cube in the scene, color its sides, and continuously rotate it. Notice that even a very trivial shader needs to have access to some external data to actually work. The shaders for VkCube need, at least, the geometry and color data, as well as the matrix data describing the rotation about an axis in 3D space.</p>
<p>With the data describing the model and the machine code describing the shaders, the UMD must ask the KMD to place this in GPU memory prior to execution. It must also tell the GPU that it wants to carry out a draw call and set any state needed to make this happen, which it does by means of building VkCommandBuffers, which are structures containing instructions to be carried out by the GPU in order to make the workload happen. It also needs to set up a way to be notified when the workload is done and then allocate the memory to place the results in.</p>
<p>This is quite intense at first, but neatly summarizes the interface that our GPU driver must offer. One of the main jobs of the kernel driver is allocating and mapping memory, preferably in a way that promotes isolation through some sort of context that is private to the application. Other key responsibilities include submitting work to a hardware queue where it can be considered for execution, as well as notifying the user when said work has been carried out.</p>
<p>The last part is key as we are dealing with massively parallel hardware where things may (and will) complete asynchronously and out of order. There must be a way to encode a job's dependencies and it is up to the kernel driver to make sure that these dependencies are actually followed if we are to extract anything meaningful from the result.</p>
<p>Therefore, deciding what to execute when (also known as scheduling) is a major part of a kernel mode driver.</p>
<p>Finally, it is up to the KMD to actually initialize the device and make sure that it is operational for all clients. This means powering on any clocks and voltage regulators and running any startup code to bring the device to life, at which point the KMD must make sure that the device is fairly shared among all clients by rotating the access to the hardware among the different applications using it.</p>
<h3>A key takeaway</h3>
<p>One thing to be understood from the previous section is that the majority of the complexity tends to reside at the <code>UMD</code> level. This component is in charge of translating the higher-level API commands into lower-level commands that the GPU can understand. Nevertheless the <code>KMD</code> is responsible for providing key operations such that its user-mode driver is actually implementable, and it must do so in a way that fairly shares the underlying GPU hardware among multiple tasks in the system.</p>
<h3>Our driver interface</h3>
<p>Given the previous introduction on how a modern GPU driver works, we are now in a position to formally define the interface that will be exposed by our <code>KMD</code>:</p>

<p>Note this is a rather compact API, and very far removed from our initial task of drawing a rotating cube. This fits nicely into our model where the <code>UMD</code> is in charge of handling all the drawing commands, and uses the <code>KMD</code> as a means to access the underlying GPU hardware.</p>
<p>We can break the API above into a few distinct groups:</p>
<p>1. Device information: This is represented here by the <code>DEV_QUERY</code> ioctl. Needless to say, the <code>UMD</code> needs to know some information from the underlying GPU hardware in order to work. This is usually implemented by simply reading some <code>ROM</code> (read-only memory) area in the GPU.</p>
<p>2. Memory allocation and isolation: This is represented by <code>VM_CREATE</code>, <code>VM_BIND</code>, <code>VM_DESTROY</code>, <code>VM_GET_STATE</code>, <code>BO_CREATE</code>, and <code>BO_MMAP_OFFSET</code>. We will see how this is implemented at the kernel level later.</p>
<p>3. Group creation and management:<code>GROUP_CREATE</code>, <code>GROUP_DESTROY</code>, and <code>GROUP_GET_STATE</code>. We will go into great detail on what groups are in a later installment in this series.</p>
<p>4. Job submission: This is implemented solely by <code>GROUP_SUBMIT</code>. Note that this call is extremely important, as it's how we submit our device-specific command buffers that describe what operations are to be carried out by the GPU hardware.</p>
<p>5. Tiler heap management: This is represented by <code>TILER_HEAP_CREATE</code> and <code>TILER_HEAP_DESTROY</code>. Explaining how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiled_rendering" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tiling GPUs</a> work is so far beyond the scope of this series, but for the time being, it is enough to assume that they need a variable amount of internal memory in order to draw the geometry. This pool of memory is managed by the <code>UMD</code> through the interface presented here.</p>
<h3>What's next</h3>
<p>This article introduced some key concepts about how GPU drivers work. We will use these concepts in subsequent parts of this series as we delve further into Arm's CSF hardware.</p>
<p>The next section will explore the CSF architecture, introducing components like the Micro Controller Unit (i.e.: <code>MCU</code>) that underpins the design, as well as the steps needed to get it to boot.</p>

		Model Overview
	</span>
</h2>
<p><strong>Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507</strong> has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type: Causal Language Models</li>
<li>Training Stage: Pretraining &amp; Post-training</li>
<li>Number of Parameters: 4.0B</li>
<li>Number of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 3.6B</li>
<li>Number of Layers: 36</li>
<li>Number of Attention Heads (GQA): 32 for Q and 8 for KV</li>
<li>Context Length: <strong>262,144 natively</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE: This model supports only thinking mode. Meanwhile, specifying <code>enable_thinking=True</code> is no longer required.</strong></p>
<p>Additionally, to enforce model thinking, the default chat template automatically includes <code>&lt;think&gt;</code>. Therefore, it is normal for the model's output to contain only <code>&lt;/think&gt;</code> without an explicit opening <code>&lt;think&gt;</code> tag.</p>

<p>The code of Qwen3 has been in the latest Hugging Face <code>transformers</code> and we advise you to use the latest version of <code>transformers</code>.</p>
<p>With <code>transformers&lt;4.51.0</code>, you will encounter the following error:</p>

<p>For deployment, you can use <code>sglang&gt;=0.4.6.post1</code> or <code>vllm&gt;=0.8.5</code> or to create an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint:</p>
<ul>
<li>SGLang:<pre><code>python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 --context-length 262144  --reasoning-parser deepseek-r1

<li>vLLM:<pre><code>vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 --max-model-len 262144 --enable-reasoning --reasoning-parser deepseek_r1
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note: If you encounter out-of-memory (OOM) issues, you may consider reducing the context length to a smaller value. However, since the model may require longer token sequences for reasoning, we strongly recommend using a context length greater than 131,072 when possible.</strong></p>
<p>For local use, applications such as Ollama, LMStudio, MLX-LM, llama.cpp, and KTransformers have also supported Qwen3.</p>

		Agentic Use

</h2>
<p>Qwen3 excels in tool calling capabilities. We recommend using <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent">Qwen-Agent</a> to make the best use of agentic ability of Qwen3. Qwen-Agent encapsulates tool-calling templates and tool-calling parsers internally, greatly reducing coding complexity.</p>
<p>To define the available tools, you can use the MCP configuration file, use the integrated tool of Qwen-Agent, or integrate other tools by yourself.</p>

		Best Practices
	</span>
</h2>
<p>To achieve optimal performance, we recommend the following settings:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Sampling Parameters</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>We suggest using <code>Temperature=0.6</code>, <code>TopP=0.95</code>, <code>TopK=20</code>, and <code>MinP=0</code>.</li>
<li>For supported frameworks, you can adjust the <code>presence_penalty</code> parameter between 0 and 2 to reduce endless repetitions. However, using a higher value may occasionally result in language mixing and a slight decrease in model performance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Adequate Output Length</strong>: We recommend using an output length of 32,768 tokens for most queries. For benchmarking on highly complex problems, such as those found in math and programming competitions, we suggest setting the max output length to 81,920 tokens. This provides the model with sufficient space to generate detailed and comprehensive responses, thereby enhancing its overall performance.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Standardize Output Format</strong>: We recommend using prompts to standardize model outputs when benchmarking.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Math Problems</strong>: Include "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}." in the prompt.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple-Choice Questions</strong>: Add the following JSON structure to the prompt to standardize responses: "Please show your choice in the <code>answer</code> field with only the choice letter, e.g., <code>"answer": "C"</code>."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>No Thinking Content in History</strong>: In multi-turn conversations, the historical model output should only include the final output part and does not need to include the thinking content. It is implemented in the provided chat template in Jinja2. However, for frameworks that do not directly use the Jinja2 chat template, it is up to the developers to ensure that the best practice is followed.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        
        <p>Imagine you’re writing a project and need a library. Let’s call it <code>libpupa</code>.</p>
        <p>You look up its current version, which is <code>1.2.3</code>, and add it to your dependencies:</p>
        <pre><code>"libpupa": "1.2.3"</code></pre>
        <p>In turn, the developer of <code>libpupa</code>, when writing its version <code>1.2.3</code>, needed another library: <code>liblupa</code>.</p>
        <p>So they did the same thing: they looked up the version, which was <code>0.7.8</code> at the time, and added it to the dependencies of <code>libpupa 1.2.3</code>:</p>
        <pre><code>"liblupa": "0.7.8"</code></pre>
        <p>The version <code>0.7.8</code> of <code>liblupa</code> is immortalized forever in the dependencies of <code>libpupa 1.2.3</code>. No matter how many other versions of either <code>liblupa</code> or <code>libpupa</code> are released, <code>libpupa 1.2.3</code> will always depend on <code>liblupa 0.7.8</code>.</p>
        <p>Our dependency resolution algorithm thus is like this:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Get the top-level dependency versions</li>
          <li>Look up versions of libraries they depend on</li>
          <li>Look up versions of libraries they depend on</li>
          <li>...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The important point of this algorithm is that it’s fully deterministic. Given just the top-level dependencies, it will produce the entire dependency tree, identical every time.</p>
        <p>It’s also space-efficient: you don’t need to specify all the versions, just the top-level ones. Given <code>libpupa 1.2.3</code>, we will always arrive at <code>liblupa 0.7.8</code>. So why write it down in a separate file?</p>
        <p>And that’s it. End of story. Write down your top-level dependencies. The computer will figure out transitive ones. They are guaranteed to be the same, since everything is immutable. The sun is shining, the grass is green, and builds are fully reproducible.</p>
        <p>But people had to invent lockfiles.</p>
        <p>Imagine you voluntarily made your build non-reproducible by making them depend on time. If I build my app now, I get <code>libpupa 1.2.3</code> and <code>liblupa 0.7.8</code>. If I repeat the same build in 10 minutes, I’ll get <code>liblupa 0.7.9</code>. Crazy, right? That would be chaos.</p>
        <p>But this is what version ranges essentially are. Instead of saying “<code>libpupa 1.2.3</code> depends on <code>liblupa 0.7.8</code>”, they are saying “<code>libpupa 1.2.3</code> depends on whatever the latest <code>liblupa</code> version is at the time of the build.”</p>
        <p>Notice that this is determined not at the time of publishing, but at the time of the build! If the author of <code>libpupa</code> has published <code>1.2.3</code> a year ago and I’m pulling it now, I might be using a <code>liblupa</code> version that didn’t even exist at the time of publishing!</p>
        <p>But... why would <code>libpupa</code>’s author write a version range that includes versions that don’t exist yet? How could they know that <code>liblupa 0.7.9</code>, whenever it will be released, will continue to work with <code>libpupa</code>? Surely they can’t see the future? Semantic versioning is a hint, but it has never been a guarantee.</p>
        <p>For that, kids, I have no good answer.</p>
        <p>The funny thing is, these version ranges end up not being used anyway. You lock your dependencies once in a lockfile and they stay there, unchanged. <em>You don’t even get the good part!</em></p>
        <p>I guess, builds that depend on the calendar date are too crazy even for people who believe that referencing non-existing versions is fine.</p>
        <p>“But Niki, you can regenerate the lockfile and pull in all the new dependencies!”</p>
        <p>Sure. In exactly the same way you can update your top-level dependencies.</p>
        <p>“But Niki, lockfiles help resolve version conflicts!”</p>
        <p>In what way? Version conflicts don’t happen because of what’s written in dependency files. Your library might work with the newer dependency, or it might not. It doesn’t really depend on what the library’s author has guessed.</p>
        <p>Your library might have a version range of <code>0.7.*</code>, work with <code>0.7.8</code>, <code>0.7.9</code> but not with <code>0.7.10</code>. Either way, the solution is the same: you have to pick the version that works. And the fact that someone somewhere long time ago wrote <code>0.7.*</code> doesn’t really help you.</p>
        <p>“But Niki, if lockfiles exist, there must be a reason! People can’t be doing it for nothing!”</p>
        <p>You are new in IT, I see. People absolutely can and do things here for no good reason all the time.</p>
        <p>But if you want an existence proof: Maven. The Java library ecosystem has been going strong for 20 years, and during that time not once have we needed a lockfile. And we are pulling hundreds of libraries just to log two lines of text, so it is actively used at scale.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, lockfiles are an absolutely unnecessary concept that complicates things without a good reason. Dependency managers can and are working without it just the same.</p>
        <p>UPD: Reading comments, I see that I missed a part of version resolution that is important. In Maven, if you have conflicting transitive dependencies, the version that will picked is the version closest to the root. E.g.:</p>
        <pre><code>My app
├╴a 1.0
│ └╴ d 1.0
└╴b 1.0
  └╴c 2.0
    └╴ d 2.0</code></pre>
        <p>In this case, <code>d 1.0</code> will be picked. This is still deterministic, but it lets you override versions when needed. For example, if <code>d 2.1</code> is released with security patches, you can always add it to the root and that’s the version that will be picked:</p>
        <pre><code>My app
├╴a 1.0
│ └╴d 1.0   x-- ignored
├╴b 1.0
│ └╴c 2.0
│   └╴d 2.0 x-- ignored
└╴d 2.1     &lt;-- picked</code></pre>
        <p>No need to wait for the whole world to update. Still deterministic. Still no lockfiles.</p>
        <p>Why not pick the biggest version? Then you’ll lose the ability to override.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Although I try to make good use of the debugger, I am quite used to print-based
debugging, especially for unit tests. I wanted to explore some tricks to improve
print-based debugging, and also incorporate the debugger more.</p>
<h2 id="print-based-debugging-improved">print-based debugging improved</h2>
<p>One big problem with using print debugging is spammy output. If I am
running something in a loop, and only one iteration of the loop has anything
interesting, I still need to filter and sort through every iteration's output.</p>
<p>Or perhaps I am working with some data structure that has a printable
representation that is easier to parse than the raw data; if I don't know where
the error comes from I would have to litter print functions everywhere hoping to
catch the necessary context.</p>
<p>However, I realized that since zig tests use <code>error</code>s, instead of panics, it is
possible to use <code>errdefer</code> to print something only when a test actually fails.</p>
<pre data-lang="zig"><code data-lang="zig"><span><span>test</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>errdefer</span> std.debug.<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"{f}"</span><span>,</span> .<span>{</span>ast<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>    <span>// ...
</span></span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Does a fantastic job of avoiding cluttering the code, and providing the precise
context necessary when an error actually occurs.</p>
<h2 id="running-tests-in-the-debugger">Running tests in the debugger</h2>
<p>If anything more complex is necessary, using the debugger is the way to go.
However, naively trying to run <code>seergdb</code> or <code>gdb -tui</code> directly from the
terminal gets difficult, as the test binaries are not in <code>zig-out</code> directory
(understandably) but in the <code>zig-cache</code> directory.</p>
<p>I learned a trick from <a href="https://ziggit.dev/t/zig-debugging-with-lldb/3931/7?u=glfmn">ziggit</a> that the <code>build.zig</code> can run
commands, and you can feed the artifact path of a build step as an argument into
the command:</p>
<figure>
  <figcaption><cite>build.zig</cite></figcaption>
  <pre data-lang="zig"><code data-lang="zig"><span><span>// seergdb is a gdb gui frontend
</span></span><span><span>const</span> debugger <span>=</span> b.<span>addSystemCommand</span><span>(</span>&amp;.<span>{</span> <span>"seergdb"</span><span>,</span> <span>"--run"</span><span>,</span> <span>"--"</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>debugger.<span>addArtifactArg</span><span>(</span>exe_unit_tests<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>const</span> debug_step <span>=</span> b.<span>step</span><span>(</span><span>"debug"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Run unit tests under debugger"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>debug_step.<span>dependOn</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span>debugger.step<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span></code></pre>
</figure>
<p>This makes it really easy to run the proper binary; however, this isn't enough
on its own: the debugger only kicks into action for a breakpoint or panic, but
the test runner gracefully handles errors.</p>
<p>We can get around this by adding <code>@breakpoint</code> calls, but then we are
potentially back to square one, where we have to speculatively add breakpoints
and catch the precise moment where things fail, or have to manually step through
until failure.</p>
<h2 id="combining-tricks">Combining tricks</h2>
<p>Of course, a good solution is to use:</p>
<pre data-lang="zig"><code data-lang="zig"><span><span>test</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>errdefer</span> <span>@breakpoint</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>This will break the program at the precise moment we hit an error. There's a
chance enough context is still around to snoop at with the debugger, and we
would also have the debug printing that the <code>std.testing.expect{.*}</code> functions
provide.</p>
<p>However, this does have downsides. Consider the program:</p>
<pre data-lang="zig"><code data-lang="zig"><span><span>test</span> <span>"errdefer @breakpoint()"</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>errdefer</span> <span>@breakpoint</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>    <span>return</span> <span>error</span><span>.</span><span>FixMe</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>test</span> <span>"normal test"</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>return</span> <span>error</span><span>.</span><span>FixMe</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>If we run <code>zig build test</code>, instead of reporting individual test errors, the
summary will just report that the entire test <em>step</em> failed:</p>
<pre><code><span>error: while executing test 'main.test.@"errdefer @breakpoint()"',
</span><span>the following command terminated with signal 5 (expected exited with code 0):
</span><span>
</span><span>  ./.zig-cache/o/348ca1907303b41ca8e0fceafd43ad63/test \
</span><span>    --cache-dir=./.zig-cache \
</span><span>    --seed=0xe3f1cf05 --listen=-
</span></code></pre>
<p>If we still want to preserve the normal behavior except when we actually <em>want</em>
to break for a debugger, then we need one more trick.</p>
<h2 id="conditional-compilation">Conditional compilation</h2>
<p>The Zig build system allows us use
<a href="https://ziglang.org/learn/build-system/#conditional-compilation">build options to pass compile time values</a> to our program. We
can leverage these to pass a <code>bool</code> to decide when to call <code>@breakpoint</code> in
our tests.</p>
<p>Starting from a simple build script that only runs tests:</p>

</span></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</figure>
<p>We can add the compile time option like so:</p>
<figure>
  <figcaption><cite>build.zig</cite></figcaption>
  <pre data-linenos="" data-lang="zig"><code data-lang="zig"><table><tbody><tr><td>4</td><td><span><span>const</span> options <span>=</span> b.<span>addOptions</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

</span></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</figure>
<p>We need to add the generated options module to our lib:</p>
<figure>
  <figcaption><cite>build.zig</cite></figcaption>
  <pre data-linenos="" data-lang="zig"><code data-lang="zig"><table><tbody><tr><td>16</td><td><span>lib.<span>addImport</span><span>(</span><span>"config"</span><span>,</span> options.<span>createModule</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Then, in our <code>root.zig</code> file we can reference the options like so:</p>
<figure>
  <figcaption><cite>root.zig</cite></figcaption>
  <pre data-linenos="" data-lang="zig"><code data-lang="zig"><table><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td><span><span>const</span> std <span>=</span> <span>@import</span><span>(</span><span>"std"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

</span></td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td><span><span>}</span>
</span></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Now, we can run the test and get no breakpoint:</p>
<pre><code><span>zig build test
</span></code></pre>
<p>However, we run into a snag: this value is observable to our program, but
we have to recompile the <code>build.zig</code> in order to change the value. We need
to add the option to the build system itself:</p>
<figure>
  <figcaption><cite>build.zig</cite></figcaption>
  <pre data-linenos="" data-lang="zig"><code data-lang="zig"><table><tbody><tr><td>4</td><td><span><span>var</span> options <span>=</span> b.<span>addOptions</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

</span></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Now we can run:</p>
<pre><code><span>zig build -Ddebugger test
</span></code></pre>
<p>And observe the change in behavior.</p>
<p>As a final step, we can hook up the command to run our debugger when
the <code>use_debugger</code> flag is set like so:</p>
<figure>
  <figcaption><cite>build.zig</cite></figcaption>
  <pre data-linenos="" data-lang="zig"><code data-lang="zig"><table><tbody><tr><td>29</td><td><span><span>const</span> test_step <span>=</span> b.<span>step</span><span>(</span><span>"test"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Run tests"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

</span></td></tr><tr><td>37</td><td><span><span>}</span>
</span></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Now, if we run with the <code>-Ddebugger</code> flag, the test runner will automatically
run in the debugger, and will break on error! See a screenshot <a href="https://glfmn.io/posts/zig-error-patterns/seergdb.png">here</a>.</p>
<p>It might be nice to encapsulate the config option checking in a function:</p>
<pre data-lang="zig"><code data-lang="zig"><span><span>fn</span> <span>breakForDebugger</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>void</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>config.debugger<span>)</span> <span>@breakpoint</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>But I leave that up to your judgement.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>If you want to solve a tricky problem, it often helps to get organized. You might, for example, break the problem into pieces and tackle the easiest pieces first. But this kind of sorting has a cost. You may end up spending too much time putting the pieces in order.</p>
<p>This dilemma is especially relevant to one of the most iconic problems in computer science: finding the shortest path from a specific starting point in a network to every other point. It’s like a souped-up version of a problem you need to solve each time you move: learning the best route from your new home to work, the gym and the supermarket.</p>
<p>“Shortest-paths is a beautiful problem that anyone in the world can relate to,” said <a href="https://hjemmesider.diku.dk/~mthorup/">Mikkel Thorup</a>, a computer scientist at the University of Copenhagen.</p>
<p>Intuitively, it should be easiest to find the shortest path to nearby destinations. So if you want to design the fastest possible algorithm for the shortest-paths problem, it seems reasonable to start by finding the closest point, then the next-closest, and so on. But to do that, you need to repeatedly figure out which point is closest. You’ll sort the points by distance as you go. There’s a fundamental speed limit for any algorithm that follows this approach: You can’t go any faster than the time it takes to sort.</p>
<p>Forty years ago, researchers designing shortest-paths algorithms ran up against this “sorting barrier.” Now, a team of researchers has devised <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17033">a new algorithm that breaks it</a>. It doesn’t sort, and it runs faster than any algorithm that does.</p>
<p>“The authors were audacious in thinking they could break this barrier,” said <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/people/profile/ret">Robert Tarjan</a>, a computer scientist at Princeton University. “It’s an amazing result.”</p>
<h2><strong>The Frontier of Knowledge</strong></h2>
<p>To analyze the shortest-paths problem mathematically, researchers use the language of graphs — networks of points, or nodes, connected by lines. Each link between nodes is labeled with a number called its weight, which can represent the length of that segment or the time needed to traverse it. There are usually many routes between any two nodes, and the shortest is the one whose weights add up to the smallest number. Given a graph and a specific “source” node, an algorithm’s goal is to find the shortest path to every other node.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientists-establish-the-best-way-to-traverse-a-graph-20241025/">most famous shortest-paths algorithm</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01386390">devised</a> by the pioneering computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra in 1956, starts at the source and works outward step by step. It’s an effective approach because knowing the shortest path to nearby nodes can help you find the shortest paths to more distant ones. But because the end result is a sorted list of shortest paths, the sorting barrier sets a fundamental limit on how fast the algorithm can run.</p>

<p>In 1984, Tarjan and another researcher <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/28869.28874">improved Dijkstra’s original algorithm</a> so that it hit this speed limit. Any further improvement would have to come from an algorithm that avoids sorting.</p>
<p>In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Thorup and other researchers devised algorithms that broke the sorting barrier, but they needed to make <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/316542.316548">certain</a> <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/S0097539702419650">assumptions</a> about weights. Nobody knew how to extend their techniques to arbitrary weights. It seemed they’d hit the end of the road.</p>
<p>“The research stopped for a very long time,” said <a href="https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/People/Faculty/DuanRan.htm">Ran Duan</a>, a computer scientist at Tsinghua University in Beijing. “Many people believed that there’s no better way.”</p>
<p>Duan wasn’t one of them. He’d long dreamed of building a shortest-paths algorithm that could break through the sorting barrier on all graphs. Last fall, he finally succeeded.</p>
<h2><strong>Out of Sorts</strong></h2>

<p>Duan’s interest in the sorting barrier dates back nearly 20 years to his time in graduate school at the University of Michigan, where his adviser was one of the researchers who worked out how to break the barrier in specific cases. But it wasn’t until 2021 that Duan devised a more promising approach.</p>
<p>The key was to focus on where the algorithm goes next at each step. Dijkstra’s algorithm takes the region that it has already explored in previous steps. It decides where to go next by scanning this region’s “frontier” — that is, all the nodes connected to its boundary. This doesn’t take much time at first, but it gets slower as the algorithm progresses.</p>
<p>Duan instead envisioned grouping neighboring nodes on the frontier into clusters. He would then only consider one node from each cluster. With fewer nodes to sift through, the search could be faster at each step. The algorithm also might end up going somewhere other than the closest node, so the sorting barrier wouldn’t apply. But ensuring that this clustering-based approach actually made the algorithm faster rather than slower would be a challenge.</p>
<p>Duan fleshed out this basic idea over the following year, and by fall 2022, he was optimistic that he could surmount the technical hurdles. He roped in three graduate students to help work out the details, and a few months later they arrived at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04139">a partial solution</a> — an algorithm that broke the sorting barrier for any weights, but only on so-called undirected graphs.</p>
<p>In undirected graphs, every link can be traversed in both directions. Computer scientists are usually more interested in the broader class of graphs that feature one-way paths, but these “directed” graphs are often trickier to navigate.</p>
<p>“There could be a case that A can reach B very easily, but B cannot reach A very easily,” said <a href="https://matthew99a.github.io/">Xiao Mao</a>, a computer science graduate student at Stanford University. “That’s going to give you a lot of trouble.”</p>
<h2><strong>Promising Paths</strong></h2>
<p>In the summer of 2023, Mao heard Duan give a talk about the undirected-graph algorithm at a conference in California. He struck up a conversation with Duan, whose work he’d long admired.</p>
<p>“I met him for the first time in real life,” Mao recalled. “It was very exciting.”</p>

<p>After the conference, Mao began thinking about the problem in his spare time. Meanwhile, Duan and his colleagues were exploring new approaches that could work on directed graphs. They took inspiration from another venerable algorithm for the shortest-paths problem, called the Bellman-Ford algorithm, that doesn’t produce a sorted list. At first glance, it seemed like an unwise strategy, since the Bellman-Ford algorithm is much slower than Dijkstra’s.</p>
<p>“Whenever you do research, you try to take a promising path,” Thorup said. “I would almost call it anti-promising to take Bellman-Ford, because it looks completely like the stupidest thing you could possibly do.”</p>
<p>Duan’s team avoided the slowness of the Bellman-Ford algorithm by running it for just a few steps at a time. This selective use of Bellman-Ford enabled their algorithm to scout ahead for the most valuable nodes to explore in later steps. These nodes are like intersections of major thoroughfares in a road network.</p>
<p>“You have to pass through [them] to get the shortest path to a lot of other stuff,” Thorup said.</p>
<p>In March 2024, Mao thought of another promising approach. Some key steps in the team’s original approach had used randomness. <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-randomness-improves-algorithms-20230403/">Randomized algorithms</a> can efficiently solve many problems, but researchers still prefer nonrandom approaches. Mao devised a new way to solve the shortest-paths problem without randomness. He joined the team, and they worked together over the following months via group chats and video calls to merge their ideas. Finally, in the fall, Duan realized they could adapt a technique from <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10658">an algorithm</a> he’d devised in 2018 that broke the sorting barrier for a different graph problem. That technique was the last piece they needed for an algorithm that ran faster than Dijkstra’s on both directed and undirected graphs.</p>
        
        
<p>The finished algorithm slices the graph into layers, moving outward from the source like Dijkstra’s. But rather than deal with the whole frontier at each step, it uses the Bellman-Ford algorithm to pinpoint influential nodes, moves forward from these nodes to find the shortest paths to others, and later comes back to other frontier nodes. It doesn’t always find the nodes within each layer in order of increasing distance, so the sorting barrier doesn’t apply. And if you chop up the graph in the right way, it runs slightly faster than the best version of Dijkstra’s algorithm. It’s considerably more intricate, relying on many pieces that need to fit together just right. But curiously, none of the pieces use fancy mathematics.</p>
<p>“This thing might as well have been discovered 50 years ago, but it wasn’t,” Thorup said. “That makes it that much more impressive.”</p>
<p>Duan and his team plan to explore whether the algorithm can be streamlined to make it even faster. With the sorting barrier vanquished, the new algorithm’s runtime isn’t close to any fundamental limit that computer scientists know of.</p>
<p>“Being an optimist, I would not be surprised if you could take it down even further,” Tarjan said. “I certainly don’t think this is the last step in the process.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://hamatti.org/posts/dotfiles-feel-too-intimate-and-personal-to-share/">https://hamatti.org/posts/dotfiles-feel-too-intimate-and-personal-to-share/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44812611">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>I <b>love</b> dotfiles.</p>

<p>
  “Dotfiles” is a term that refers to configuration files used to configure
  software and operating systems. They are called such because often these files
  start with a dot. You may have seen
  <code>.bashrc</code>,
  <code>.tmux.conf</code> or
  <code>.zshrc</code> in the wild.
</p>

<p>
  Whenever a software doesn’t offer direct file-based configuration, I feel sad
  because it means I need to take extra steps to keep my configuration across
  different devices in sync or when setting up a new machine.
</p>

<p>I <b>love</b> sharing.</p>

<p>
  I regularly publish ideas and experiences in
  <a href="https://hamatti.org/blog">my blog</a>, I share my notes in
  <a href="https://notes.hamatti.org/">my digital garden</a>
  and I publish almost all the code I write (outside work) as open source
  <a href="https://github.com/hamatti">in GitHub</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I <b>love</b> to read
  <a href="https://github.com/search?q=dotfiles&amp;type=repositories">other people’s dotfiles</a>
  and learn from them.
</p>

<p>
  Yet, somehow I feel like sharing my own dotfiles to the world is beyond my
  comfort zone. I feel my customisations and aliases and other decisions are too
  intimate and personal to share.
</p>

<p>I don’t quite know why though.</p>

<p>
  I have a really cool repository where I keep my dotfiles and there’s quite a
  lot there. There’s the usual suspects like my
  <code>zsh</code> config and aliases, my
  <code>tmux</code> configuration and my
  <code>neovim</code> and
  <code>vscode</code> stuff too. And my
  <a href="https://hamatti.org/posts/bring-your-custom-toolkit-to-repl-sessions/">Python startup script</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I also keep my
  <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> core list
  there: that’s all the packages I want to always have at hand. Having them all
  in one place to be installed with a single command on a new computer is
  lovely.
</p>

<p>
  I also keep my
  <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/styl-us/">Stylus</a>
  CSS rules there so I can easily bring the experience I want on any browser I
  use.
</p>

<p>
  I use
  <a href="https://notes.hamatti.org/technology/recipes/manage-dotfiles-with-gnu-stow">GNU Stow to manage most of these</a>. For anything that’s directly applicable by copying the files into a given
  folder, I’ve set up the folder structure so that running
  <code>stow [folder]</code> will create symlinks to
  right places: any change made into the repository from any machine will apply
  to all machines. It’s so cool.
</p>

<p>
  All in all, my dotfiles repository is home to 19 configuration files +
  everything my neovim installation has, plugins and all.
</p>

<p>
  For now however, I
  <i>keep them secret, keep them safe </i>until I
  feel better about sharing my dotfiles with the world.
</p>

          <p>If something above resonated with you, let's start a discussion about it! <strong>Email me at juhamattisantala at gmail dot com and share your thoughts</strong>. In 2025, I want to have more deeper discussions with people from around the world and I'd love if you'd be part of that.</p>

<p>Google is the latest company to suffer a data breach in an ongoing wave of Salesforce CRM data theft attacks conducted by the ShinyHunters extortion group.</p>

<p>In June, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-hackers-target-salesforce-accounts-in-data-extortion-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Google warned</a> that a threat actor they classify as 'UNC6040' is targeting companies' employees in voice phishing (vishing) social engineering attacks to breach Salesforce instances and download customer data. This data is then used to extort companies into paying a ransom to prevent the data from being leaked.</p>

<p>In a brief update to the article last night, Google said that it too fell victim to the same attack in June after one of its Salesforce CRM instances was breached and customer data was stolen.</p>

<p>"In June, one of Google's corporate Salesforce instances was impacted by similar UNC6040 activity described in this post. Google responded to the activity, performed an impact analysis and began mitigations," <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/voice-phishing-data-extortion" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reads Google's update</a>.</p>

<p>"The instance was used to store contact information and related notes for small and medium businesses. Analysis revealed that data was retrieved by the threat actor during a small window of time before the access was cut off."</p>

<p>"The data retrieved by the threat actor was confined to basic and largely publicly available business information, such as business names and contact details."</p>

<p>Google is classifying the threat actors behind these attacks as 'UNC6040' or 'UNC6240.' However, BleepingComputer, which has been tracking these attacks, has learned that a notorious threat actor known as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/shinyhunters-behind-salesforce-data-theft-attacks-at-qantas-allianz-life-and-lvmh/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">ShinyHunters is behind the attacks</a>.</p>

<p>ShinyHunters has been around for years, responsible for a wide range of breaches, including those at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/powerschool-hacker-now-extorting-individual-school-districts/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">PowerSchool</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/oracle-customers-confirm-data-stolen-in-alleged-cloud-breach-is-valid/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Oracle Cloud</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/snowflake/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Snowflake data-theft attacks</a>, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/old-atandt-data-leak-repackaged-to-link-ssns-dobs-to-49m-phone-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">AT&amp;T</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-leaks-full-database-of-77-million-nitro-pdf-user-records/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">NitroPDF</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/wattpad-data-breach-exposes-account-info-for-millions-of-users/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Wattpad</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mathway-investigates-data-breach-after-25m-records-sold-on-dark-web/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">MathWay</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-leaks-386-million-user-records-from-18-companies-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">many more</a>.</p>

<p>In a conversation with BleepingComputer yesterday, ShinyHunters claimed to have breached many Salesforce instances, with attacks still ongoing.</p>

<p>The threat actor claimed yesterday to BleepingComputer that they breached a trillion-dollar company, and were considering just leaking the data rather than attempting to extort them. It is unclear if this company is Google.</p>

<p>As for the other companies impacted in these attacks, the threat actor is extorting&nbsp;them through email, demanding they pay a ransom to prevent the data from being publicly leaked.</p>

<p>Once the threat actor has finished privately extorting companies, they plan to publicly leak or sell data on a hacking forum.</p>

<p>BleepingComputer has learned of one company that has already paid 4 Bitcoins, or approximately $400,000, to prevent the leak of their data.</p>

<p>Other companies impacted in these attacks include&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/adidas-warns-of-data-breach-after-customer-service-provider-hack/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Adidas</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qantas-confirms-data-breach-impacts-57-million-customers/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Qantas</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/allianz-life-confirms-data-breach-impacts-majority-of-14-million-customers/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Allianz Life</a>, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisco-discloses-data-breach-impacting-ciscocom-user-accounts/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Cisco</a>, and the&nbsp;LVMH subsidiaries&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/louis-vuitton-says-regional-data-breaches-tied-to-same-cyberattack/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Louis Vuitton</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fashion-giant-dior-discloses-cyberattack-warns-of-data-breach/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Dior</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.chosun.com/english/industry-en/2025/05/26/ORM5MULB7NEM7EBUFVXHVLSB4A/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Tiffany &amp; Co.</a></p>

<p>The only time a conservative can be a good thing, is when people push to be superior off of merit and good character, and typically showing humility is still required. &nbsp;Unfortunately for everyone else, its so much easier to be superior using bad behaviors than good ones. &nbsp;Hence dictatorships, war and conflict exist in spades. Forcing others to be lower is a conservative cornerstone. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Confederacy, Nazis, Most Monarchies, Oligarchies, Zionists, Religious fanatics… conservatism without morals, superiority attained without humility and empathy.</p>

<p>To be honest I do not have enough faith in MAGA for them to be told this never existed and not believe it. They believe almost anything they are told to believe.</p>

<p>EDIT: now that I think about it more, would you really put it past this regime to pull up some archaic law from 1790 that interprets something as not being legal because it isn’t in on public display and then say that being “online“ is what public display is now? I mean, that’s really what their M.O. has been; carry out what you want to do through EO instead of legal channels,  slow down the judiciary trying to stop you from breaking the law, tell your cult this is judicial overreach when they inevitably rule against you and then just do what you want anyway until you create a crisis. Then if you do get forced back in line do it quietly  and tell your propaganda machine not to mention it so the cult still believes you are the God King they want you to be.</p>
