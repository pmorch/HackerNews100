<p><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/t/T5SjvgLdchGm5DEKzIfFVPQgFIQ=/400x0/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-Desaturated.jpg?lossy" srcset="https://images.macrumors.com/t/T5SjvgLdchGm5DEKzIfFVPQgFIQ=/400x0/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-Desaturated.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/I5bNngcUCU5yI3dtNQSAA25c9cc=/800x0/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-Desaturated.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/ZzAm2e6i99b7DKjxBK1W_GKqlHk=/1600x0/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-Desaturated.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/DRrqn78jMuNaPRaARegn6ILe_N4=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale()/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-Desaturated.jpg 2500w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 697px" alt="iOS App Store General Feature Desaturated" width="2250" height="1266"><br>The Texas ‌App Store‌ Accountability Act (SB2420) requires Apple and other app marketplaces to confirm user age when a person creates an Apple Account. Apple Accounts for users under 18 would need to join a Family Sharing group, with new controls available for parents and restrictions for minors.</p>
<p>In a preliminary injunction that delays the implementation of the act, Judge Robert Pitman said that it violates the First Amendment and is "more likely than not unconstitutional."<br>
</p>
<blockquote><p>The Act is akin to a law that would require every bookstore to verify the age of every customer at the door and, for minors, require parental consent before the child or teen could enter and again when they try to purchase a book. As set out below, the Court finds a likelihood that, when considered on the merits, SB 2420 violates the First Amendment.</p></blockquote>
<p>The injunction was in response to a motion filed by the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA), a group that includes Apple and Google. Today's decision is a win for Apple, as Apple has been fighting against age assurance requirements in Texas and other states. Apple says that the Texas law impacts user privacy.<br>
</p>
<blockquote><p>While we share the goal of strengthening kids' online safety, we are concerned that SB2420 impacts the privacy of users by requiring the collection of sensitive, personally identifiable information to download any app, even if a user simply wants to check the weather or sports scores.</p></blockquote>
<p>The court will move on to determining whether the law is facially invalid, which would mean that it is unconstitutional and will be entirely thrown out.</p>

            <link>https://github.com/freelawproject/x-ray</link>
            <guid>46369923</guid>
            <pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 21:54:30 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/freelawproject/x-ray">https://github.com/freelawproject/x-ray</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46369923">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freelawproject/x-ray/main/redacted.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freelawproject/x-ray/main/redacted.png" alt="Image of REDACTED STAMP"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">x-ray is a Python library for finding bad redactions in PDF documents.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why?</h2><a id="user-content-why" aria-label="Permalink: Why?" href="#why"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">At Free Law Project, we collect millions of PDFs. An ongoing problem
is that people fail to properly redact things. Instead of doing it the right
way, they just draw a black rectangle or a black highlight on top of black
text and call it a day. Well, when that happens you just select the text under
the rectangle, and you can read it again. Not great.</p>
<p dir="auto">After witnessing this problem for years, we decided it would be good to figure
out how common it is, so, with some help, we built this simple tool. You give
the tool the path to a PDF. It tells you if it has worthless redactions in it.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What next?</h2><a id="user-content-what-next" aria-label="Permalink: What next?" href="#what-next"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Right now, <code>x-ray</code> works pretty well and we are using it to analyze documents
in our collections. It could be better though. Bad redactions take many forms.
See the issues tab for other examples we don't yet support. We'd love your
help solving some of tougher cases.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2><a id="user-content-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">With uv, do:</p>

<p dir="auto">With pip, that'd be:</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><code>uvx</code> lets you run this without even installing it. For example, here's an amicus brief we filed that doesn't have any bad redactions:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="uvx --from x-ray xray https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca3.125346/gov.uscourts.ca3.125346.45.0.pdf
{}"><pre><code>uvx --from x-ray xray https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca3.125346/gov.uscourts.ca3.125346.45.0.pdf
{}
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Once you <em>do</em> install x-ray, you can easily use it on the command line. Once installed, just:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="% xray path/to/your/file.pdf
{
  &quot;1&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;bbox&quot;: [
        58.550079345703125,
        72.19873046875,
        75.65007781982422,
        739.3987426757812
      ],
      &quot;text&quot;: &quot;The Ring travels by way of Cirith Ungol&quot;
    }
  ]
}"><pre>% xray path/to/your/file.pdf
{
  <span><span>"</span>1<span>"</span></span>: [
    {
      <span><span>"</span>bbox<span>"</span></span>: [
        58.550079345703125,
        72.19873046875,
        75.65007781982422,
        739.3987426757812
      ],
      <span><span>"</span>text<span>"</span></span>: <span><span>"</span>The Ring travels by way of Cirith Ungol<span>"</span></span>
    }
  ]
}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Or if you have the file on a server somewhere, give it a URL. If it starts with <code>https://</code>, it will be interpreted as a PDF to download. Here's congressional testimony our directory made (it doesn't have any bad redactions):</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="% xray https://free.law/pdf/congressional-testimony-michael-lissner-free-law-project-hearing-on-ethics-and-transparency-2021-10-26.pdf
{}"><pre>% xray https://free.law/pdf/congressional-testimony-michael-lissner-free-law-project-hearing-on-ethics-and-transparency-2021-10-26.pdf
{}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">A fun trick you can do is to make a file with one URL per line, call it <code>urls.txt</code>. Then you can run this to check each URL:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="xargs -n 1 xray  < urls.txt"><pre>xargs -n 1 xray  <span>&lt;</span> urls.txt</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">However you run <code>xray</code> on the command line, you'll get JSON as output. When you have that, you can use it with tools like <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/" rel="nofollow"><code>jq</code></a>. The format is as follows:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>It's a dict.</li>
<li>The keys are page numbers.</li>
<li>Each page number maps to a list of dicts.</li>
<li>Each of those dicts maps to two keys.</li>
<li>The first key is <code>bbox</code>. This is a four-tuple that indicates the x,y positions of the upper left corner and then lower right corners of the bad redaction.</li>
<li>The second key is <code>text</code>. This is the text under the bad rectangle.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Simple enough.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can also use it as a Python module, if you prefer the long-form:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="% python -m xray some-file.pdf"><pre><code>% python -m xray some-file.pdf
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">But that's not as easy to remember.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want a bit more, you can, of course, use <code>xray</code> in Python:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="from pprint import pprint
import xray
bad_redactions = xray.inspect(&quot;some/path/to/your/file.pdf&quot;)  # Pathlib works too
pprint(bad_redactions)
{1: [{'bbox': (58.550079345703125,
               72.19873046875,
               75.65007781982422,
               739.3987426757812),
      'text': 'Aragorn is the one true king.'}]}"><pre><span>from</span> <span>pprint</span> <span>import</span> <span>pprint</span>
<span>import</span> <span>xray</span>
<span>bad_redactions</span> <span>=</span> <span>xray</span>.<span>inspect</span>(<span>"some/path/to/your/file.pdf"</span>)  <span># Pathlib works too</span>
<span>pprint</span>(<span>bad_redactions</span>)
{<span>1</span>: [{<span>'bbox'</span>: (<span>58.550079345703125</span>,
               <span>72.19873046875</span>,
               <span>75.65007781982422</span>,
               <span>739.3987426757812</span>),
      <span>'text'</span>: <span>'Aragorn is the one true king.'</span>}]}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The output is the same as above, except it's a Python object, not a JSON object.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you already have the file contents as a <code>bytes</code> object, that'll work too:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="some_bytes = requests.get(&quot;https://lotr-secrets.com/some-doc.pdf&quot;).content
bad_redactions = xray.inspect(some_bytes)"><pre><span>some_bytes</span> <span>=</span> <span>requests</span>.<span>get</span>(<span>"https://lotr-secrets.com/some-doc.pdf"</span>).<span>content</span>
<span>bad_redactions</span> <span>=</span> <span>xray</span>.<span>inspect</span>(<span>some_bytes</span>)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Note that because the <code>inspect</code> method uses the same signature no matter what,
the type of the object you give it is essential:</p>
<markdown-accessiblity-table><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Input</th>
<th><code>xray</code>'s Assumption</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>str</code> or Pathlib <code>Path</code></td>
<td>local file</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>str</code> that starts with <code>https://</code></td>
<td>URL to download</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>bytes</code></td>
<td>PDF in memory</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></markdown-accessiblity-table>
<p dir="auto">This means that if you provide the filename on disk as a bytes object instead
of a <code>str</code>, it's not going to work. This will fail:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="xray.inspect(b&quot;some-file-path.pdf&quot;)"><pre><span>xray</span>.<span>inspect</span>(<span>b"some-file-path.pdf"</span>)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">That's pretty much it. There are no configuration files or other variables to
learn. You give it a file name. If there is a bad redaction in it, you'll soon
find out.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How it works</h2><a id="user-content-how-it-works" aria-label="Permalink: How it works" href="#how-it-works"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Under the covers, <code>xray</code> uses the high-performant <a href="https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/" rel="nofollow">PyMuPDF project</a> to parse PDFs. It has been a wonderful project to work with.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can read the source to see how it works, but the general idea is to:</p>
<ol dir="auto">

<p dir="auto">Find rectangles in a PDF.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Find letters in the same location</p>

To LG's credit, the TV automatically detected all of my devices -- my PC, PS5, Switch 2, and Fire TV Stick 4K Max -- and applied the best settings for each.

I wasn't thrilled to discover a setting enabled by default that essentially spies on my screen just for ads, but at the same time, I felt a wave of relief when I realized how easy it is to turn off.

<p>Thankfully, LG doesn't make disabling Live Plus too hard, though you do have to click through a few menus. If you want to turn it off, here's how:</p>    <p>1.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>People examining documents released by the Department of Justice in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Jeffrey Epstein</a> case discovered that some of the file redaction can be undone with Photoshop techniques, or by simply highlighting text to paste into a word processing file.</p><p>Un-redacted text from these documents began circulating through social media on Monday evening. An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251219222621/https://www.justice.gov/multimedia/Court%20Records/Matter%20of%20the%20Estate%20of%20Jeffrey%20E.%20Epstein,%20Deceased,%20No.%20ST-21-RV-00005%20(V.I.%20Super.%20Ct.%202021)/2022.03.17-1%20Exhibit%201.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">exhibit </a>in a civil case in the Virgin Islands against Darren K Indyke and Richard D Kahn, two executors of Epstein’s estate, contains redacted allegations explaining how Epstein and his associates had facilitated the sexual abuse of children. The exhibit was the second amended complaint in the state case against Indyke and Kahn.</p><p>In section 85, the redacted portion states: “Between September 2015 and June 2019, Indyke signed (FAC) for over $400,000 made payable to young female models and actresses, including a former Russian model who received over $380,000 through monthly payments of $8,333 made over a period of more than three and a half years until the middle of 2019.”</p><p>Prosecutors in the Virgin Islands settled its civil sex-trafficking case against Epstein’s estate, Indyke and Kahn in 2022 for $105m, plus one half of the proceeds from the sale of Little St James, the island on which Epstein resided and on which many of his crimes occurred. The justice department <a href="https://usvidoj.com/u-s-virgin-islands-attorney-general-settles-sex-trafficking-case-against-estate-of-jeffrey-epstein-and-co-defendants-for-over-105-million/" data-link-name="in body link">press release</a> announcing the settlement did not include an admission of liability.</p><p>Indyke, an attorney who represented Epstein for decades, has not been criminally indicted by federal authorities. He was hired by the Parlatore Law Group in 2022, before the justice department settled the Epstein case. That firm represents the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, and previously represented Donald Trump in his defense against charges stemming from the discovery of classified government documents stored at Trump’s Florida estate. Calls and email seeking comment from Indyke and the Parlatore Law Group have not yet been returned.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly denied any knowledge of or involvement in Epstein’s criminal activities and any wrongdoing.</p><p>Other sections further allege how Epstein’s enterprise concealed crimes.</p><p>“Defendants also attempted to conceal their criminal sex trafficking and abuse, conduct by paying large sums of money to participant-witnesses, including by paying for their attorneys’ fees and case costs in litigation related to this conduct,” reads one redacted passage.</p><p>“Epstein also threatened harm to victims and helped release damaging stories about them to damage their credibility when they tried to go public with their stories of being trafficked and sexually abused. Epstein also instructed one or more Epstein Enterprise participant-witnesses to destroy evidence relevant to ongoing court proceedings involving Defendants’ criminal sex trafficking and abuse conduct.”</p><p>Redactions of sections 184 through 192 of the document describe property taxes paid by companies incorporated by Epstein on properties that were not on the balance sheet for those firms.</p><p>“For instance, Cypress’s Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2018 did not reflect any assets other than cash of $18,824. Further, Cypress reported only $301 in expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018, despite it paying $106,394.60 in Santa Fe property taxes on November 6, 2018,” reads one redacted passage.</p><p>“Similarly, in 2017, Cypress reported as its only asset cash in the amount of $29,736 and expenses of $150, despite it paying $55,770.41 and $113,679.56 in Santa Fe property taxes during 2017.”</p><p>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4405" data-link-name="in body link">Epstein Files Transparency Act</a> signed into law last month permits the Department of Justice “to withhold certain information such as the personal information of victims and materials that would jeopardize an active federal investigation”.</p><p>It was unclear how property material complies with the redaction standard under the law. An inquiry to the Department of Justice has not yet been answered.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main">
			
<article data-pagefind-body="">
	
	
	
	<p>This is a reading of <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111"><abbr>RFC 9111</abbr></a> (2022), the latest iteration of the <abbr>HTTP</abbr> Caching standard.</p>
<p>It defines the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Cache-Control"><code>Cache-Control</code></a> <abbr>HTTP</abbr> header as a way to prescribe how caches should store and reuse <abbr>HTTP</abbr> responses, with regards to not just the browser cache, but to any other intermediary caches, such as proxies and content delivery networks, that may exist between the client and the origin server.</p>
<img src="https://danburzo.ro/img/http-caching-refresher/cache-chain.png" alt="A crude illustration depicting a browser with its private cache, two intermediary services with their shared caches, and the origin server" width="1000" height="310">
<p>The <code>Cache-Control</code> header accepts a set of comma-separated directives, some of which are meant to be added to <abbr>HTTP</abbr> requests, and others to <abbr>HTTP</abbr> responses. A typical response header:</p>
<pre><code>HTTP/2 200
Cache-Control: max-age=0, must-revalidate
</code></pre>
<p>Some of these directives specifically target <em>shared caches</em>, that is intermediary caches that serve the same cached responses to many users, while others also apply to <em>private caches</em> such as the browser cache.</p>
<h2>What’s fresh?</h2>
<p>Whenever the cache receives a request, it must figure out if the cached response is still <strong>fresh</strong> and can therefore be reused without incurring the performance tax of an <abbr>HTTP</abbr> request, or whether it has gone <strong>stale</strong> and should be validated with the server.</p>
<p>To decide on freshness, the cache compares the age of the response to the response’s so-called freshness timeline.</p>
<p>The age of a cached response is the time elapsed since it was last generated or revalidated by the origin server. To the time spent in its own cache, the browser will add any <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Age"><code>Age: &lt;seconds&gt;</code></a> header received from intermediary caches.</p>
<p>The freshness timeline is a duration beyond which the cached response is to be considered stale. It’s usually signaled by the server via the appropriate response headers, but may also be guesstimated by the cache in the absence of explicit, valid cues. In order of precedence:</p>
<ul>
<li>the server establishes a freshness timeline, in seconds, with the <a href="#max-age-response"><code>Cache-Control: max-age=&lt;number&gt;</code></a> directive on the response; otherwise,</li>
<li>the cache falls back to computing the interval between the <code>Expires: &lt;date&gt;</code> and <code>Date: &lt;date&gt;</code> response headers, if available; otherwise,</li>
<li>if there’s no <code>Expires</code> header, the response lacks an explicit expiration, and a heuristic freshness based on the <code>Last-Modified</code> response header might be applicable.</li>
</ul>
<p>For shared caches, the special <a href="#s-maxage-response"><code>s-maxage=&lt;number&gt;</code></a> directive takes precedence over all others.</p>
<h2>Going past expiration</h2>
<p>Just because a response has gone stale, it doesn’t mean it needs to be thrown out.</p>
<p>When it receives a request for a stale cached response, the cache should validate it with its upstream server. Although validation always generates an <abbr>HTTP</abbr> request, it avoids a data transfer when there’s no newer version of the cached response on the server, so it can still be faster than a regular request.</p>
<p>Validation uses a mechanism known as a conditional <abbr>HTTP</abbr> request, which includes one or more special headers called preconditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>if the precondition with the highest precedence is met, the server responds with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/200"><abbr>HTTP 200 OK</abbr></a> and an updated response body; otherwise,</li>
<li>it responds with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/304"><abbr>HTTP 304</abbr> Not Modified</a> and an empty body, confirming the existing response can be reused.</li>
</ul>
<p>To generate the preconditions needed for these conditional requests, which the server uses to compare the cached response to the freshest version available, responses must be tagged in a way that’s unique to each version:</p>
<ul>
<li>historically, this was done with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Last-Modified"><code>Last-Modified: &lt;date&gt;</code></a> header, corresponding to the latest update to the content;</li>
<li>a more flexible and robust alternative is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/ETag"><code>ETag: "&lt;value&gt;"</code></a> header, which stores an arbitrary <abbr>ASCII</abbr> string that uniquely identifies the response. This string is usually a hash incorporating one or more aspects: the modification time, the file size, and the file content.</li>
</ul>
<p>When performing the validation, the cached response headers are mirrored as preconditions for the conditional request:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Last-Modified: &lt;date&gt;</code> becomes <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/If-Modified-Since"><code>If-Modified-Since: &lt;date&gt;</code></a>;</li>
<li><code>ETag: "&lt;value&gt;"</code> becomes <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/If-None-Match"><code>If-None-Match: "&lt;value&gt;"</code></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When both preconditions are present, only <code>If-None-Match</code> is evaluated.</p>
<p>Regardless of the result of the validation request, the cached response headers are updated with the new values received from the server, and the fresh-o-meter on the cached response is reset.</p>
<p>Certain caches may be set up to serve stale responses in some circumstances, such as when losing the connection to the server or in the event of an <abbr>HTTP 5xx</abbr> server error. There are also <code>Cache-Control</code> directives that influence how stale responses are handled, covered in the next section.</p>
<h2>Cache-Control response directives</h2>
<h3 id="max-age-response">
<p><code>max-age=&lt;number&gt;</code></p>
</h3>
<p>The <code>max-age</code> response directive defines the response’s freshness timeline in seconds, after which the response should be considered stale. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-max-age-2">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.2.1</abbr></a></p>
<h3 id="must-revalidate-response">

<p>The <code>must-revalidate</code> response directive indicates that the cache must not reuse a stale response until it’s been successfully validated by the origin server. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-must-revalidate">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.2.2</abbr></a></p>
<p>If the server throws an error, the cache must surface that instead of reusing a stale response. If the cache is disconnected, it must produce an error with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/504"><abbr>HTTP 504</abbr> Gateway Timeout</a> status code, or another more applicable error code.</p>
<p><strong>Side effects:</strong> <code>must-revalidate</code> is one of the directives, along with <code>s-maxage</code> and <code>public</code>, that allow shared caches to <a href="#caching-authenticated-responses">store and reuse a response to a request containing an <code>Authorization</code> header</a>, which they are generally prohibited from doing.</p>
<h3 id="no-cache-response">
<p><code>no-cache</code></p>
</h3>
<p>The <code>no-cache</code> response directive indicates that the cache must not reuse <em>any</em> response until it’s successfully validated by the origin server. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-no-cache-2">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.2.4</abbr></a></p>
<p>This is similar to <code>must-revalidate</code> but refers to all cached responses, not just stale ones. In effect, <code>no-cache</code> is a sort of <code>max-age=0, must-revalidate</code>.</p>
<h3 id="no-store-reponse">
<p><code>no-store</code></p>
</h3>
<p>The <code>no-store</code> response directive indicates that private and shared caches must not store any part of the request or the response, and to never reuse the response. The standard is quick to warn that the effect is not guaranteed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<span>MUST NOT</span> store” in this context means that the cache <span>MUST NOT</span> intentionally store the information in non-volatile storage and <span>MUST</span> make a best-effort attempt to remove the information from volatile storage as promptly as possible after forwarding it. This directive is not a reliable or sufficient mechanism for ensuring privacy. In particular, malicious or compromised caches might not recognize or obey this directive, and communications networks might be vulnerable to eavesdropping. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-no-store-2">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.2.4</abbr></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Side effects:</strong> The directive can also influence non-<abbr>HTTP</abbr> caches. Most browsers will <a href="https://web.dev/articles/bfcache#minimize-no-store">exclude from the back/forward cache</a> pages having the <code>no-store</code> response directive. Chrome, however, has recently started to make <em>some</em> of these pages <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/bfcache-ccns">eligible for bfcache</a> when the browser deems it safe.</p>
<h3 id="must-understand-response">
<p><code>must-understand</code></p>
</h3>
<p>The <code>must-understand</code> response directive indicates that the cache shouldn’t store or reuse responses with <abbr>HTTP</abbr> status codes whose semantics the cache doesn’t understand and conform to. The directive is meant to future-proof existing implementations from status codes that might have special requirements in regards to caching. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-must-understand">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.2.3</abbr></a></p>
<p>It’s recommended to use <code>must-understand, no-store</code> together as a fallback, and caches are encouraged to ignore the <code>no-store</code> directive if they do understand the semantics of the <abbr>HTTP</abbr> status code. This ensures older caches that don’t recognize the <code>must-understand</code> directive don’t cache the response at all, although by 2025 this should be an exceedingly rare sight.</p>
<h3 id="private-response">
<p><code>private</code></p>
</h3>
<p>The <code>private</code> response directive indicates that the response is meant for a single user. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-private">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.2.7</abbr></a>.</p>
<p>Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>a shared cache must not store the response; and</li>
<li>a private cache may store the response even if the response wouldn’t otherwise be heuristically cacheable.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>private</code> directive can be used to guard against other directives that might inadvertently make <a href="#caching-authenticated-responses">authenticated responses available to shared caches</a>.</p>
<h3 id="public-response">
<p><code>public</code></p>
</h3>
<p>The <code>public</code> response directive indicates two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>a shared cache may <a href="#caching-authenticated-responses">store and reuse a response to a request containing an <code>Authorization</code> header</a>, which it’s generally prohibited from doing; and</li>
<li>a private cache may store the response even if the response wouldn’t otherwise be heuristically cacheable.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-public">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.2.9</abbr></a></p>
<h3 id="s-maxage-response">
<p><code>s-maxage=&lt;number&gt;</code></p>
</h3>
<p>The <code>s-maxage=&lt;number&gt;</code> response directive is analogous to <code>max-age</code>, but only affects shared caches. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-s-maxage">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.2.10</abbr></a>.</p>
<p>The directive also incorporates the semantics of the <code>proxy‑revalidate</code> response directive, in that a shared cache must not use a stale response until it has been successfully validated with the origin server.</p>
<p><strong>Side effects:</strong> <code>s-maxage</code> is one of the directives, along with <code>must-revalidate</code> and <code>public</code>, that allow shared caches to <a href="#caching-authenticated-responses">store and reuse a response to a request containing an <code>Authorization</code> header</a>, which they are generally prohibited from doing.</p>
<h3 id="proxy-revalidate-response">
<p><code>proxy-revalidate</code></p>
</h3>
<p>The <code>proxy-revalidate</code> response directive is analogous to <code>must-revalidate</code>, but only affects shared caches. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-proxy-revalidate">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.2.8</abbr></a>.</p>
<h3 id="no-transform-response">
<p><code>no-transform</code></p>
</h3>
<p>The <code>no-transform</code> response directive indicates that intermediaries, regardless of whether they implement a cache or not, must not transform the response content, such as optimizing images or compressing stylesheets and scripts. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-no-transform-2">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.2.6</abbr></a>.</p>
<h3 id="stale-while-revalidate-response">
<p><code>stale-while-revalidate=&lt;number&gt;</code></p>
</h3>
<p>The <code>stale-while-revalidate</code> response directive was defined in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5861"><abbr>RFC 5861</abbr>: <abbr>HTTP</abbr> Cache-Control Extensions for Stale Content</a> (2010). It indicates that the cache may use a cached response if it hasn’t exceeded its freshness lifetime by more than the specified number of seconds.</p>
<p>Whenever the presence of this directive causes a stale response to be served, the cache should trigger a background revalidation of the response.</p>
<p>The author of the <abbr>RFC</abbr>, Mark Nottingham, <a href="https://www.mnot.net/blog/2014/06/01/chrome_and_stale-while-revalidate">has written a rationale</a> for this directive.</p>
<h3 id="stale-if-error-response">
<p><code>stale-if-error=&lt;number&gt;</code></p>
</h3>
<p>Also defined in the <abbr>RFC 5861</abbr> extension, the <code>stale-if-error</code> response directive indicates that the cache may use a cached response if it hasn’t exceeded its freshness lifetime by more than the specified number of seconds, if the attempt to validate the stale response results in an error.</p>
<p><a href="https://cache-tests.fyi/"><abbr>HTTP</abbr> Caching Tests</a> suggests this directive is not well supported.</p>
<h2>Cache-Control request directives</h2>
<p>As web developers, we most often deal with <code>Cache-Control</code> in <abbr>HTTP</abbr> responses, but this header can also be included on <abbr>HTTP</abbr> requests. Browsers, for example, use them when the user refreshes the page.</p>
<p>When used in <abbr>HTTP</abbr> requests, <code>Cache-Control</code> directives express the client’s preference in regards to the freshness or age of the response. Caches reconcile these requests with the <code>Cache-Control</code> response directives of its cached responses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RequestInit#cache"><code>cache</code> option</a> for <code>fetch()</code> has a separate set of values that map to <code>Cache-Control</code> request directives, but the mappings are not always intuitive. For example, <code>cache: 'no-cache'</code> maps to <code>Cache-Control: max-age=0</code>. For the curious, the mappings are <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-network-or-cache-fetch">defined here</a>. You can always set your <code>Cache-Control</code> headers directly with the <code>headers</code> option.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><code>max-age=&lt;number&gt;</code></h3>
<p>The <code>max-age</code> request directive indicates that the client wants a fresh response whose age is less than or equal to the specified number of seconds. When combined with <code>max-stale</code>, the client will accept some stale responses. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-max-age">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.1.1</abbr></a>.</p>
<h3><code>max-stale=&lt;number&gt;</code></h3>
<p>The <code>max-stale</code> request directive indicates that the client will accept a stale response that has exceeded its freshness lifetime by no more than the specified number of seconds. When used without an argument, <code>max-stale</code> indicates that the client will accept any stale response, no matter how old. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#section-5.2.1.2">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.1.2</abbr></a></p>
<h3><code>min-fresh=&lt;number&gt;</code></h3>
<p>The <code>min-fresh</code> request directive indicates that the client prefers a response that still has at least the specified number of seconds of freshness left. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-min-fresh">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.1.3</abbr></a></p>
<h3><code>no-cache</code></h3>
<p>The <code>no-cache</code> request directive indicates that the client prefers caches not to use a stored response without successfully validating it with the origin server. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-no-cache">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.1.4</abbr></a></p>
<h3><code>no-store</code></h3>
<p>The <code>no-store</code> request directive indicates that a cache must not store any part of either this request or any response to it. The same caveats as to <a href="#no-store-response">its response counterpart</a> apply. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-no-store">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.1.5</abbr></a></p>
<p>If a cache serves this request with a response that was previously stored, the <code>no-store</code> request directive doesn’t cause the cache to remove the response after serving it.</p>
<h3><code>no-transform</code></h3>
<p>The <code>no-transform</code> request directive indicates that the client is asking for intermediaries to avoid transforming the content. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-no-transform">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.1.6</abbr></a></p>
<h3><code>only-if-cached</code></h3>
<p>The <code>only-if-cached</code> request directive indicates that the client only wants a stored response. Caches should respond with either a stored response that satisfies all the other constraints, or an <abbr>HTTP 504</abbr> Gateway Timeout status code. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-only-if-cached">☞ <abbr>RFC 9111 § 5.2.1.7</abbr></a></p>
<h3><code>stale-if-error=&lt;number&gt;</code></h3>
<p>Similarly to <a href="#stale-if-error-response">its response counterpart</a>, the <code>stale-if-error</code> request directive indicates that the client will accept a stale response that has exceeded its freshness lifetime by no more than the specified number of seconds, if an attempt to validate it resulted in a server error.</p>
<h2>Browser refresh mechanisms</h2>
<p>Browsers typically offer two refresh mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>soft reloads</em>, triggered by the reload button, a corresponding menu item and keyboard shortcut, and the pull-to-refresh gesture in mobile browsers, are meant to get an updated representation of the page, for example getting the latest posts on a social media timeline.</li>
<li><em>hard reloads</em>, enabled with a modifier key, skip the cache altogether and are meant to fix interrupted loads, outdated cached responses, and other broken states.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s how some browsers on macOS implement these behaviors.</p>
<h3>Soft reloads</h3>
<p>Triggered by <kbd>Ctrl + R</kbd> on Windows/Linux and <kbd>Command + R</kbd> on macOS.</p>
<p>Firefox triggers a conditional request to revalidate the cached response for the main resource (the <abbr>HTML</abbr> file). Sub-resources such as stylesheets, scripts, and images are reloaded as usual, according to their cache directives.</p>
<p>Chrome behaves similarly, with the difference that the validation request for the main resource also includes a <code>Cache-Control: max-age=0</code> directive (which can’t hurt).</p>
<p>Instead of revalidating its cached response, Safari performs a non-conditional request for the main resource, then loads sub-resources as usual.</p>
<h3>Hard reloads</h3>
<p>Triggered by <kbd>Ctrl + Shift + R</kbd> on Windows/Linux and <kbd>Command + Shift + R</kbd> on macOS except Safari, which uses <kbd>Command + Option + R</kbd>. (If you’ve applied your muscle memory to Safari before, you know all too well that the common shortcut opens Reader Mode instead…)</p>
<p>On a hard reload, all three browsers trigger non-conditional requests with the <code>Cache-Control: no-cache</code> directive on the <abbr>HTML</abbr> page and its sub-resources.</p>
<p>Curiously, once you perform a hard reload in Safari, subsequent soft reloads will still use the <code>Cache-Control: no-cache</code> request directive to fetch the main resource, which is probably an unintended, but otherwise benign behavior.</p>
<h3>The <code>immutable</code> response directive</h3>
<p>Reloading a web page didn’t always work like this. Historically, when performing a soft reload, all the sub-resources would be revalidated along with the main resource, in effect freshening up the cache for the current page.</p>
<p>Circa 2015, Facebook was seeing several <abbr>HTTP 304</abbr> Not Modified responses on long-lived resources like scripts and stylesheets whenever a user would refresh their feed page with the browser’s reload button.</p>
<p>To address this issue, Patrick McManus from Mozilla <a href="https://bitsup.blogspot.com/2016/05/cache-control-immutable.html">proposed</a> the <code>immutable</code> response directive, which later became <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8246"><abbr>RFC 8246</abbr>: <abbr>HTTP</abbr> Immutable Responses</a>.</p>
<p>The directive indicates that the origin server won’t update a resource during the freshness lifetime of the cached response, so a cache shouldn’t issue conditional requests for responses that are still fresh when the user reloads the page, unless the user really, really wants an updated response (e.g. a hard reload).</p>
<p>Around the time that <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/01/using-immutable-caching-to-speed-up-the-web/">support for <code>immutable</code></a> landed in Firefox 49 and Facebook began to use it to great effect, Chrome introduced a <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2017/01/reload-reloaded-faster-and-leaner-page_26.html">new way to perform reloads</a> that solved the problem without introducing additional directives: instead of revalidating everything on a soft reload, just revalidate the main resource and load sub-resources as usual. Safari switched over to the new reload policy soon after [<a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=169756">Webkit#169756</a>], and Firefox eventually did with <a href="https://www.firefox.com/en-US/firefox/100.0/releasenotes/">Firefox 100</a>.</p>
<p>That leaves the <code>immutable</code> directive in an awkward place. Safari added support [<a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167497">Webkit#167497</a>] but Chrome representatives remain unconvinced that it offers a significant benefit on top of the current reload behavior [<a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/41253661">Chromium#41253661</a>].</p>
<h2 id="caching-authenticated-responses">
Caching responses to authenticated requests
</h2>
<p>One of the more confusing aspects of <abbr>HTTP</abbr> caching is how various <code>Cache-Control</code> response directives affect the way shared caches treat responses to requests that contain an <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#name-authorization"><code>Authorization</code> header</a>, which are understood as specific to a single user.</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#name-storing-responses-to-authen"><abbr>RFC 9111 § 3.5</abbr></a>, shared caches are not allowed to store these responses <q>unless the response contains a Cache-Control field with a response directive that allows it to be stored by a shared cache, and the cache conforms to the requirements of that directive for that response.</q></p>
<p>The three directives that enable shared caches to store authenticated responses, and which must therefore be carefully evaluated before deploying, are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#public-response"><code>public</code></a></li>
<li><a href="#s-maxage-response"><code>s-maxage=&lt;number&gt;</code></a></li>
<li><a href="#must-revalidate-response"><code>must-revalidate</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Conversely, a <a href="#private-response"><code>private</code></a> directive prevents any other directive from making authenticated responses eligible to shared caches.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I wrote this article to clarify for myself what the various cache directives stand for and how they overlap and interact. It only covers the main ideas, without delving into the more obscure corners of <abbr>HTTP</abbr> semantics. I approached the subject with a “clear cache”, and mainly used the normative references (<abbr>RFC 9111</abbr> and its extensions), aided by various guides from different eras:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mnot.net/cache_docs/">Caching Tutorial for Web Authors and Webmasters</a> (1998—) by Mark Nottingham;</li>
<li><a href="https://jakearchibald.com/2016/caching-best-practices/">Caching best practices &amp; max-age gotchas</a> (2016) by Jake Archibald;</li>
<li><a href="https://web.dev/articles/http-cache">Prevent unnecessary network requests with the <abbr>HTTP</abbr> Cache</a> (2018) by Ilya Grigorik and Jeff Posnik;</li>
<li><a href="https://csswizardry.com/2019/03/cache-control-for-civilians/">Cache control for civilians</a> (2019–2025) and <a href="https://csswizardry.com/2025/03/why-do-we-have-a-cache-control-request-header/">Why Do We Have a Cache-Control Request Header?</a> (2025) by Harry Roberts;</li>
<li><a href="https://grayduck.mn/2021/09/13/cache-control-recommendations/">Cache-Control Recommendations</a> (2021) by April King;</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Caching">Web Caching</a> on <abbr>MDN</abbr>.</li>
</ul>
<p>What’s interesting about these guides is that the recommendations don’t just encode an interpretation of the specs, but also incorporate safeguards against non-conformant or outdated browser caches and intermediares.</p>
<p>In light of developments as recent as 2022, it would be cool to figure out to what extent things have improved, and which of these safeguards can be discarded. <a href="https://cache-tests.fyi/"><abbr>HTTP</abbr> Caching Tests</a> seems to be a good resource for assessing the situation.</p>

<!-- BEGIN txt2web generated body --><p>
I flew back to Italy for the Christmas holidays, as I usually do. Here I have my childhood c64, on which I learend how to program, and which in the last few years I took to refurbishing.<br>
In general, everytime I'm back to my parent's place I spend some time fixing and sorting out things, and this is one of them.</p><p>

Now it works like a charm, and of course I also added some <a href="https://c64os.com/buyersguide/">bells and whistles</a>, mostly stuff that allows me to easily tranfer programs from a PC (a kung-fu cart and a pi1541) - so this year I thought it was time to actually do something with it! </p><p>

I decided to turn it into a cozy fireplace:</p><center><a href="https://c0de517e.com/026_c64fire/cozy.jpg" aria-label="link to large image"><img src="https://c0de517e.com/026_c64fire/THUMBS/cozy.png" width="350" max-height="292" alt="(click on the image for the full-color version)"></a><br><small>(click on the image for the full-color version)</small></center><p>
I was quite surprised that it worked, that I managed to complete this project in a few hours over two days, and that it was, most of all, fun! </p><p>

I expected... more friction, having to work with arcane cross-platform toolchains and the like, but instead I completed almost of all it in a web-based IDE/emulator combo!</p><p>

Moreover, I am far from being an expert when it comes to c64 coding. Yes, I used to program with one... when I was six or seven! And yes, I do follow its demoscene, and over the years I've read quite a bit about its chips and inner workings, but I've never written any demo effect for it. </p><p>

In other words... if I managed, you can too! That's what made me want to write this post...</p><p>

<b>All you need for Christmas...</b><br>
...is a 6502.</p><p>

Here, I'll give you a crash course on the c64 - the key points of what I knew before starting this.</p><p>

If you know how modern CPUs work, and how to optimize for them - try to forget all of that. The 64 comes from an era where RAM was faster than compute. Lookup tables are your friend, as it is fully unrolling loops / code generation. We have no caches!</p><p>

Don't be surprised then to learn that the famous 6502 CPU has only one arithmetic register, the "accumulator". There are also two "index" registers used to offset memory locations, a status register, and a program counter - but you can't do math on any of these, at best, test or increment/decrement.<br>
Moreover, the program counter is the only 16-bit register, all the others are 8-bit.</p><p>

But who needs registers when you have fast RAM? Memory is your register file: pretty much all 6502 instructions operate between the accumulator and memory locations (or numeric constants, that are still memory, just part of the instruction itself).</p><p>

To further facilitate this, the 6502 comes with a rich set of addressing modes, most instructions can fetch memory in few different ways: at absolute addresses, at addresses offset with one of the two index registers or even at indirect addresses (addresses contained in memory locations).<br>
There is also a special memory area, called the "zero page", the first 256 bytes of memory (a page is, unsurprisingly, 256 bytes), which has an extra optimization: addressing there takes one cycle less, because the address can be encoded in the instruction in a single byte instead of two.</p><p>

Have a look at the <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/6502/6502_instruction_set.html">6502 instruction set</a>, it's very simple! Won't take more than 15 minutes to skim over them all.</p><p>

<b>The plan.</b></p><p>

Where things get less simple is to deal with all the c64 custom chips, the SID (sound) and the VIC-II (graphics). That's how demo-scene effects are done! Manipulating these chips in very precise ways to cause them to generate crazy stuff, most of which was never considered possible by the c64 designers back then!</p><p>

The average c64 demo effect is all about this - generating lookup tables and unrolled assembly to then be able to exactly time internal chip status changes as the video signal is being generated line by line ("racing the beam"). Usually, what is shown on screen is not at all what it seems - i.e. it's not how you would create a similar effect on a PC.</p><center><a href="https://c0de517e.com/026_c64fire/demo.jpg" aria-label="link to large image"><img src="https://c0de517e.com/026_c64fire/THUMBS/demo.png" width="350" max-height="197" alt="We won't be porting Second Reality..."></a><br><small>We won't be porting Second Reality...</small></center><p>
I know almost nothing of any of this - so my plan was to avoid it all! I wanted to set the VIC-II in some graphic mode that gave me a decently simple, linear framebuffer, and from there on write the code like I would have done on any other computer, hoping that a fire effect is simple enough to compute that the 64 would just be able to cope with it.</p><p>

Luckily, there is one such mode. The default, vanilla, character mode! Here, we have 40x25 characters on screen, chosen from a set of 256. So, one byte per "pixel", and 1000 pixels in total - great!</p><center><a href="https://c0de517e.com/026_c64fire/petscii.png" aria-label="link to large image"><img src="https://c0de517e.com/026_c64fire/THUMBS/petscii.png" width="350" max-height="180" alt="The default &quot;petscii&quot; character set."></a><br><small>The default "petscii" character set.</small></center><p>
Now, the default character set does not really lean itself to creating a demo effect, but I knew I could create a custom one. My idea was to simply making a dither pattern, and as much as possible work like I had a 8-bit "grayscale" screen. </p><p>

C64 characters are 8x8, so I could create a dither pattern that has a number of "on" pixels in the character corresponding to its position in the charset: 0 being fully off (background color), 64 being fully on (foreground color), and everything in between being a mix.<br>
Of course though this would give us only 64 values, ideally, I wanted to utilize the whole 8-bit space... On obvious idea is that we could add colors to the mix. For example, having the first 64 values go from black (background) to brown (foreground), then the next 64 have brown as background and red as foreground, then red and yellow, and finally yellow and white.</p><center><a href="https://c0de517e.com/026_c64fire/chars.png" aria-label="link to large image"><img src="https://c0de517e.com/026_c64fire/THUMBS/chars.png" width="350" max-height="249" alt="My custom charset. Made by hand in C64Studio."></a><br><small>My custom charset. Made by hand in C64Studio.</small></center><p>
This can't be achieved in the default character mode, unfortunately, as only the foreground color is controllable per-character (via another memory location, still using one byte per character - easy), while the background is shared. Luckily though, there is an <a href="https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Extended_color_mode">"extended color mode"</a> that fits the bill exactly. In this mode the character set is limited to 64, but the two high bits of each character can be used to control the background color, while the foreground remains in the separate memory location as usual.</p><p>

<b>Implementation.</b></p><p>

All development was done in the <a href="https://ide.retrogamecoders.com/">retrogamecoders c64 IDE</a>, which handly couples the <a href="https://cc65.github.io/">cc65 compiler</a> with an emulator.</p><p>

Writing c64 code in C is generally a terrible idea, and cc65 is not even the "best" compiler out there (is quite old and barely does optimize the generated code - <a href="https://llvm-mos.org/wiki/Welcome">llvm-mos</a> might be better), but being able to test in C and then gradually "port" to assembly was crucial for a noob like me. If I were to keep working on this, I'd probably move to <a href="https://theweb.dk/KickAssembler/Main.html#frontpage">Kick Assembler</a>, which is particularly suited for the kind of code-generation that you want to do in demo-coding.</p><p>

Anyhow, here are the .c files, step by step, in chronological order. You can just copy and paste them in the retrogamecoders IDE and see how things work, start tinkering if you like!

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><em><span>Part 2 of our video streaming saga. </span><a href="https://blog.helix.ml/p/we-killed-webrtc-and-nobody-noticed" rel="">Read Part 1: How we replaced WebRTC with WebSockets →</a></em></p><p>Let me tell you about the time we spent three months building a gorgeous, hardware-accelerated, WebCodecs-powered, 60fps H.264 streaming pipeline over WebSockets...</p><p><span>...and then replaced it with </span><code>grim | curl</code><span> when the WiFi got a bit sketchy.</span></p><p>I wish I was joking.</p><p><span>We’re building </span><a href="https://github.com/helixml/helix" rel="">Helix</a><span>, an AI platform where autonomous coding agents work in cloud sandboxes. Users need to watch their AI assistants work. Think “screen share, but the thing being shared is a robot writing code.”</span></p><p>Last week, we explained how we replaced WebRTC with a custom WebSocket streaming pipeline. This week: why that wasn’t enough.</p><p><strong>The constraint that ruined everything:</strong><span> It has to work on enterprise networks.</span></p><p>You know what enterprise networks love? HTTP. HTTPS. Port 443. That’s it. That’s the list.</p><p>You know what enterprise networks hate?</p><ul><li><p><strong>UDP</strong><span> — Blocked. Deprioritized. Dropped. “Security risk.”</span></p></li><li><p><strong>WebRTC</strong><span> — Requires TURN servers, which requires UDP, which is blocked</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Custom ports</strong><span> — Firewall says no</span></p></li><li><p><strong>STUN/ICE</strong><span> — NAT traversal? In </span><em>my</em><span> corporate network? Absolutely not</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Literally anything fun</strong><span> — Denied by policy</span></p></li></ul><p>We tried WebRTC first. Worked great in dev. Worked great in our cloud. Deployed to an enterprise customer.</p><p>“The video doesn’t connect.”</p><p><em>checks network</em><span> — Outbound UDP blocked. TURN server unreachable. ICE negotiation failing.</span></p><p>We could fight this. Set up TURN servers. Configure enterprise proxies. Work with IT departments.</p><p><span>Or we could accept reality: </span><strong>Everything must go through HTTPS on port 443.</strong></p><p><span>So we built a </span><strong>pure WebSocket video pipeline</strong><span>:</span></p><ul><li><p>H.264 encoding via GStreamer + VA-API (hardware acceleration, baby)</p></li><li><p>Binary frames over WebSocket (L7 only, works through any proxy)</p></li><li><p>WebCodecs API for hardware decoding in the browser</p></li><li><p>60fps at 40Mbps with sub-100ms latency</p></li></ul><p>We were so proud. We wrote Rust. We wrote TypeScript. We implemented our own binary protocol. We measured things in microseconds.</p><p><strong>Then someone tried to use it from a coffee shop.</strong></p><p>“The video is frozen.”</p><p>“Your WiFi is bad.”</p><p>“No, the video is definitely frozen. And now my keyboard isn’t working.”</p><p><em>checks the video</em></p><p>It’s showing what the AI was doing 30 seconds ago. And the delay is growing.</p><p>Turns out, 40Mbps video streams don’t appreciate 200ms+ network latency. Who knew.</p><p>When the network gets congested:</p><ol><li><p>Frames buffer up in the TCP/WebSocket layer</p></li><li><p>They arrive in-order (thanks TCP!) but increasingly delayed</p></li><li><p>Video falls further and further behind real-time</p></li><li><p>You’re watching the AI type code from 45 seconds ago</p></li><li><p>By the time you see a bug, the AI has already committed it to main</p></li><li><p>Everything is terrible forever</p></li></ol><p><span>“Just lower the bitrate,” you say. Great idea. Now it’s 10Mbps of blocky garbage that’s </span><em>still</em><span> 30 seconds behind.</span></p><p>We tried everything:</p><p><strong>“What if we only send keyframes?”</strong></p><p>This was our big brain moment. H.264 keyframes (IDR frames) are self-contained. No dependencies on previous frames. Just drop all the P-frames on the server side, send only keyframes, get ~1fps of corruption-free video. Perfect for low-bandwidth fallback!</p><p><span>We added a </span><code>keyframes_only</code><span> flag. We modified the video decoder to check </span><code>FrameType::Idr</code><span>. We set GOP to 60 (one keyframe per second at 60fps). We tested.</span></p><p>We got exactly ONE frame.</p><p>One single, beautiful, 1080p IDR frame. Then silence. Forever.</p><pre><code><code>[WebSocket] Keyframe received (frame 121), sending
[WebSocket] ...
[WebSocket] ...
[WebSocket] It's been 14 seconds why is nothing else coming
[WebSocket] Failed to send audio frame: Closed</code></code></pre><p><em>checks Wolf logs</em><span> — encoder still running</span></p><p><em>checks GStreamer pipeline</em><span> — frames being produced</span></p><p><em>checks Moonlight protocol layer</em><span> — </span><strong>nothing coming through</strong></p><p><span>We’re using </span><a href="https://games-on-whales.github.io/wolf/stable/" rel="">Wolf</a><span>, an excellent open-source game streaming server (seriously, the documentation is great). But our WebSocket streaming layer sits on top of the Moonlight protocol, which is reverse-engineered from NVIDIA GameStream. Somewhere in that protocol stack, </span><em>something</em><span> decides that if you’re not consuming P-frames, you’re not ready for more frames. Period.</span></p><p>We poked around for an hour or two, but without diving deep into the Moonlight protocol internals, we weren’t going to fix this. The protocol wanted all its frames, or no frames at all.</p><p><strong>“What if we implement proper congestion control?”</strong></p><p><em>looks at TCP congestion control literature</em></p><p><em>closes tab</em></p><p><strong>“What if we just... don’t have bad WiFi?”</strong></p><p><em>stares at enterprise firewall that’s throttling everything</em></p><p>One late night, while debugging why the stream was frozen again, I opened our screenshot debugging endpoint in a browser tab:</p><pre><code><code>GET /api/v1/external-agents/abc123/screenshot?format=jpeg&amp;quality=70</code></code></pre><p>The image loaded instantly.</p><p>A pristine, 150KB JPEG of the remote desktop. Crystal clear. No artifacts. No waiting for keyframes. No decoder state. Just... pixels.</p><p>I refreshed. Another instant image.</p><p>I mashed F5 like a degenerate. 5 FPS of perfect screenshots.</p><p>I looked at my beautiful WebCodecs pipeline. I looked at the JPEGs. I looked at the WebCodecs pipeline again.</p><p>No.</p><p>No, we are not doing this.</p><p>We are professionals. We implement proper video codecs. We don’t spam HTTP requests for individual frames like it’s 2009.</p><p>typescript</p><pre><code><code>// Poll screenshots as fast as possible (capped at 10 FPS max)
const fetchScreenshot = async () =&gt; {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/v1/external-agents/${sessionId}/screenshot`)
  const blob = await response.blob()
  screenshotImg.src = URL.createObjectURL(blob)
  setTimeout(fetchScreenshot, 100) // yolo
}</code></code></pre><p>We did it. We’re sending JPEGs.</p><p><span>And you know what? </span><strong>It works perfectly.</strong></p><p>Here’s the thing about our fancy H.264 pipeline:</p><p><span>PropertyH.264 StreamJPEG SpamBandwidth40 Mbps (constant)100-500 Kbps (varies with complexity)StateStateful (corrupt = dead)Stateless (each frame independent)Latency sensitivityVery highDoesn’t careRecovery from packet lossWait for keyframe (seconds)Next frame (100ms)Implementation complexity3 months of Rust</span><code>fetch()</code><span> in a loop</span></p><p><span>A JPEG screenshot is </span><strong>self-contained</strong><span>. It either arrives complete, or it doesn’t. There’s no “partial decode.” There’s no “waiting for the next keyframe.” There’s no “decoder state corruption.”</span></p><p>When the network is bad, you get... fewer JPEGs. That’s it. The ones that arrive are perfect.</p><p><span>And the size! A 70% quality JPEG of a 1080p desktop is like </span><strong>100-150KB</strong><span>. A single H.264 keyframe is 200-500KB. We’re sending LESS data per frame AND getting better reliability.</span></p><p><span>We didn’t throw away the H.264 pipeline. We’re not </span><em>complete</em><span> animals.</span></p><p>Instead, we built adaptive switching:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Good connection</strong><span> (RTT &lt; 150ms): Full 60fps H.264, hardware decoded, buttery smooth</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Bad connection detected</strong><span>: Pause video, switch to screenshot polling</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Connection recovers</strong><span>: User clicks to retry video</span></p></li></ol><p><span>The key insight: </span><strong>we still need the WebSocket for input</strong><span>.</span></p><p>Keyboard and mouse events are tiny. Like, 10 bytes each. The WebSocket handles those perfectly even on a garbage connection. We just needed to stop sending the massive video frames.</p><p>So we added one control message:</p><p>json</p><pre><code><code>{"set_video_enabled": false}</code></code></pre><p>Server receives this, stops sending video frames. Client polls screenshots instead. Input keeps flowing. Everyone’s happy.</p><p>15 lines of Rust. I am not joking.</p><p>rust</p><pre><code><code>if !video_enabled.load(Ordering::Relaxed) {
    continue; // skip frame, it's screenshot time baby
}</code></code></pre><p>We almost shipped a hilarious bug.</p><p>When you stop sending video frames, the WebSocket becomes basically empty. Just tiny input events and occasional pings.</p><p><strong>The latency drops dramatically.</strong></p><p>Our adaptive mode sees low latency and thinks: “Oh nice! Connection recovered! Let’s switch back to video!”</p><p>Video resumes. 40Mbps floods the connection. Latency spikes. Mode switches to screenshots.</p><p>Latency drops. Mode switches to video.</p><p>Latency spikes. Mode switches to screenshots.</p><p><strong>Forever. Every 2 seconds.</strong></p><p><span>The fix was embarrassingly simple: once you fall back to screenshots, </span><strong>stay there until the user explicitly clicks to retry</strong><span>.</span></p><p>typescript</p><pre><code><code>setAdaptiveLockedToScreenshots(true) // no oscillation for you
```

We show an amber icon and a message: "Video paused to save bandwidth. Click to retry."

Problem solved. User is in control. No infinite loops.

## Ubuntu Doesn't Ship JPEG Support in grim Because Of Course It Doesn't

Oh, you thought we were done? Cute.

`grim` is a Wayland screenshot tool. Perfect for our needs. Supports JPEG output for smaller files.

Except Ubuntu compiles it without libjpeg.
```
$ grim -t jpeg screenshot.jpg
error: jpeg support disabled</code></code></pre><p><em>incredible</em></p><p>So now our Dockerfile has a build stage that compiles grim from source:</p><p>dockerfile</p><pre><code><code>FROM ubuntu:25.04 AS grim-build
RUN apt-get install -y meson ninja-build libjpeg-turbo8-dev ...
RUN git clone https://git.sr.ht/~emersion/grim &amp;&amp; \
    meson setup build -Djpeg=enabled &amp;&amp; \
    ninja -C build
```

We're building a screenshot tool from source so we can send JPEGs in 2025. This is fine.

<p><img alt="LINUX KERNEL" src="https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/linuxkernel.webp" width="100" height="100"></p><p>
An interesting anecdote from this month's Linux Plumbers Conference in Tokyo is that Meta (Facebook) is using the Linux scheduler originally designed for the needs of Valve's Steam Deck... On Meta Servers. Meta has found that the scheduler can actually adapt and work very well on the hyperscaler's large servers.
</p><p>
SCX-LAVD as the Latency-criticality Aware Virtual Deadline scheduler has <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/LAVD-Scheduler-Linux-Gaming">worked out very well for the needs of Valve's Steam Deck</a> with similar or better performance than <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/search/EEVDF">EEVDF</a>. SCX-LAVD has been worked on by Linux consulting firm Igalia under contract for Valve. SCX-LAVD has also seen varying use by the CachyOS Handheld Edition, Bazzite, and other Linux gaming software initiatives.
</p><p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=2025&amp;image=meta_lavd_1_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2025&amp;image=meta_lavd_1_med" alt="Steam Deck and Server"></a></p>
<p>It turns out that besides working well on handhelds, SCX-LAVD can also end up working well on large servers too. The presentation at LPC 2025 by Meta engineers was in fact titled "<em>How do we make a Steam Deck scheduler work on large servers</em>." At Meta they have explored SCX_LAVD as a "default" fleet scheduler for their servers that works for a range of hardware and use-cases for where they don't need any specialized scheduler.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2025&amp;image=meta_lavd_2_med" alt="Meta SCX LAVD"></p>
<p>They call this scheduler built atop sched_ext as "Meta's New Default Scheduler". LAVD they found to work well across the growing CPU and memory configurations of their servers, nice load balancing between CCX/LLC boundaries, and more. Those wishing to learn more about Meta's use and research into SCX-LAVD can find the Linux Plumbers Conference presentation embedded below along with the <a href="https://lpc.events/event/19/contributions/2099/attachments/1875/4020/lpc-2025-lavd-meta.pdf">slide deck</a>.

            <p>AI <em>is</em> making formal verification go mainstream.</p>
<p>AI-assisted mechnical proving companies are raising funds on billion dollar <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/robinhood-ceos-math-focused-ai-startup-harmonic-valued-145-billion-latest-2025-11-25/">valuations</a>, new people are trying proof assistants,
overwhelmingly Lean, at unprecedented rates. Models achieve fascinating results in competitions previously considered to contain
some of the hardest problems in the world, such as IMO, ICPC, Putnam; as well as open problems in mathematics such as Erdös Problems.
It's not just the hobbyists that are excited about AI-assisted proofs, from <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/machine-jan-3.pdf">Terry Tao</a>, to <a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2025/12/08/ai-formal-verification.html">Martin Kleppman</a>, to <a href="https://x.com/ilyasergey/status/1989053674552004749">Ilya Sergey</a>, prominent researchers around the world are excited and hopeful about the effects.</p>
<h2 id="formal-verification-the-goods"><a href="#formal-verification-the-goods" aria-label="Anchor link for: formal-verification-the-goods">Formal Verification: The Goods</a></h2>
<p>Let me quickly give you a run down of the argument:</p>
<p>There are multiple complex challenges in formal verification. The first one, and the one that is very hard to solve technically,
is that most software in the world does not have a formal specification. A formal specification is a simpler mathematical description
of the system we build. Algorithms have formal specifications. Data structures, protocols, data formats, safety-critical systems typically
have formal specifications. The majority of the programs in the world doesn't have a formal specification, hell, most of them don't even have
informal specifications. At the limit, which is where we actually are, the specification of a program is itself, the implementation is the
specification. The lack of a formal specification makes it very hard to formally verify some piece of software, because what would you even
verify?</p>
<p>The second issue is, proof engineering, the practice of writing proofs for theorems about your systems, is very hard. The proofs have many domain
specific elements to them, a proof of a mathematical theorem will be very different from a proof about a programming language, and a proof about the programming
language will highly depend on the underlying constructs of its theoretical framework. The widest taught proof engineering book
is <a href="https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/">Software Foundations</a>, and every chapter has a different style of proofs. Someone that went through
Volume 2: Programming Language Foundations will not find the problems in Volume 6: Separation Logic Foundations intuitive or obvious. There are other problems
such as the tooling for proof automation, brittleness of proofs, reusability of proofs etc. but I don't find them particularly fundamental to proof engineering
itself but rather problems of the current generation, so we can leave those aside for now.</p>
<p>The rise of LLMs in programming vastly affects both of these points. It affects point number 1 because AI-assisted programming is a very natural fit
fot specification-driven development. AI-assisted programming pushes the limits of programming from what you can implement to what you can specify and
what you can <a href="https://alperenkeles.com/posts/verifiability-is-the-limit/">verify</a>. This is a great incentive for writing executable specifications,
because then you can put the LLM inside a loop until it achieves the said objective, irrespective of the means of the achievement.
<a href="https://alperenkeles.com/posts/verifiable-abstractions/">I predict that</a> this will give rise to program optimizers and translators that will
be transformative of our work in those domains. However, tests are, as infamously they are, incomplete. Tests are great at finding bugs (actually
they are not so great most of the time, but that's another discussion), but they <strong>cannot</strong> prove the absence of bugs. SQLite famously has
millions of tests, but researchers still find bugs in SQLite, similar situations arise in almost all software.</p>
<p>The only way to prove the absence of bugs is formal verification, and industry has seen great examples of this. Highly cited formal verification
projects include CompCert C Compiler, <a href="https://users.cs.utah.edu/~regehr/papers/pldi11-preprint.pdf">the random testing of which against GCC and Clang</a>
has led to finding 79 bugs in GCC and 202 bugs in Clang, and only 2 bugs in CompCert in its <em>unverified</em> parser, finding no bugs in its verified compilation
pass, a striking win for formal verification. (Thanks to <a href="https://emptysqua.re/blog/">A. Jesse Jiryu Davis</a> informing me, I learned that researchers have
<a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/pfonseca/papers/eurosys2017-dsbugs.pdf">studied</a> the source of failures in formally verified distributed systems, and
found that wrong assumptions about the unverified parts of the system are the likely culprit.)</p>
<p>This makes formal verification a prime target for AI-assisted programming. Given that we have a formal specification, we can just let the machine wander around
for hours, days, even weeks. If it comes back with a solution, we shall trust not to the probabilistic predictions of the so-called artificial intelligence,
but the symbolic proof checker that verifies the solution. This idea has always been at the core of formal verification, the ability to have unsound proof
generation coupled with sound proof checking has given rise to complex tactics, algorithms that produce proofs by searching them, to enable proof engineers
in great capacity.</p>
<p>This is not the end of the good news. AI is also very good at writing proofs, at least much better than the average software engineer. Given that we have
a perfect oracle, we can also turn the problem into an RLVR (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards), which means we should expect the models to get
even better at it as time goes on as they did in chess, go, and many other similar problems. This is the promise behind the billion dollar valuations,
the companies started with impressive autoformalization techniques and automated provers for tackling competition problems and open conjectures, but
the real industrial value is at the core of automating software engineering by letting the engineer write a verbal description, autoformalized into a Lean
theorem, proven by the automated prover, and voila, we have our program that we can fully trust.</p>
<p><em>or do we?</em></p>
<h2 id="formal-verification-the-bads"><a href="#formal-verification-the-bads" aria-label="Anchor link for: formal-verification-the-bads">Formal Verification: The Bads</a></h2>
<p>I see the appeal, I like the idea, I trust the researchers building these systems, but I don't love the overarching promises. This blog post
is my attempt at building a reasonable middle ground by laying out the goods (as I already did), and the bads (as I now will), and make my closing
remarks by reiterating the position of testing in this space, and in the future.</p>
<h3 id="autoformalization-is-a-shaky-ground"><a href="#autoformalization-is-a-shaky-ground" aria-label="Anchor link for: autoformalization-is-a-shaky-ground">Autoformalization is a shaky ground</a></h3>
<p>I started this post by stating most programs in the world do not have formal specifications, followed by how AI is incentivizing us to write specifications,
and autoformalization takes the specifications, and makes them <strong>formal</strong>. In formal verification, there's this concept of a <em>trusted computing base (TCB)</em>. TCB
is your Achilles' Heel, it's the bottom of the ladder, where layers over layers of verification is built on, trusting a small core without verifying it, because
there must be a bottom of the ladder, we cannot build a circular verification argument, and the system cannot verify itself. (please fact check me on this
if I'm wrong, which is possible)</p>
<p>Autoformalization is part of the TCB in this AI-assisted verified programming paradigm, because one cannot mechanically verify that the verbally stated
specification indeed corresponds to the formalized one. There are several modes of usage, one issue is soundness, there might be mechanically verified scenarios
that would be rejected by the verbal specification. Another issue is completeness, the formalized model might reject valid scenarios in our descriptions.
Autoformalization part of the process requires and deserves our special attention as it's one of the crucial points of failure in this verification process.</p>
<h3 id="proof-assistants-are-slow"><a href="#proof-assistants-are-slow" aria-label="Anchor link for: proof-assistants-are-slow">Proof assistants are slow</a></h3>
<p>In a proof assistant, the primary goal is reasoning about programs and ease of verification. For instance, proof assistants, traditionally, don't use our classic
two's complement integers packed into words in our memory, they use Peano numbers, an encoding of natural numbers as inductive data structures:</p>
<pre data-lang="lean"><code data-lang="lean"><span>Inductive Nat : Type :=
</span><span>| zero : Nat
</span><span>| succ : Nat -&gt; Nat.
</span></code></pre>
<p>This encoding doesn't possess the concept of an integer overflow. Its inductive structure allows us to build theorems that hold for all natural numbers, not
just the ones that can fit in a word. It is also painfully slow, the computational complexity of <code>a + b</code>, an operation so fast in CPU that it's literally
an instant, is <code>O(a + b)</code>, addition is linear in time to the added values instead of a constant operation. However, we would like to run verified code on
real life workloads, so we cannot wait for a million cycles to add 1M + 1M = 2M. There are 2 solutions to this problem, the first one is that you build a
more efficient encoding in the proof assistant, prove equivalence of the efficient but hard to reason encoding to the inefficient but simpler to reason one,
and use the efficient one in your computations. The other is once again, axiomatization, or broadening the TCB. Proof assistants offer a mechanism called
<strong>extraction</strong> that allows for extracting a piece of code in the language of the proof assistant (e.g Rocq) to a language with a larger ecosystem optimized
for running production workloads (e.g OCaml). Much of the extraction is a one-to-one correspondence between the languages via syntactic transformations,
but we can hijack the extraction to axiomatize our own types. We can turn Nat into unsigned integers, where <code>Nat.add</code> becomes <code>u64 + u64</code>. For instance,
in Rocq, Nats are extracted to BigInts, which should have the same semantics, but the "should" in this sentence carries the heavyweight. Without an accompanying
proof of correctness, we just put BigInt into the TCB.</p>
<p>Without broadening the TCB, the speed of a proof assistant will be limited by the large amount of pointer chasing that arises naturally with the use of
inductive types and their tree-inducing characteristics. There are many domains in which speed isn't that big of a deal, but I think there's also a
concern between speed and the requirement for correctness, as faster code tends to involve more complex language constructs such as concurrency,
bit manipulation, layout awareness, which leads to more bugs than their simpler counterparts. If we cannot reason about programs that are more likely
to have bugs, how much of the overarching problem are we tackling?</p>
<h3 id="verification-requires-models-and-models-are-very-hard-to-come-by"><a href="#verification-requires-models-and-models-are-very-hard-to-come-by" aria-label="Anchor link for: verification-requires-models-and-models-are-very-hard-to-come-by">Verification requires models, and models are very hard to come by</a></h3>
<p>In order to verify some property of a system, one needs a model of the system. These models don't grow on trees, they are crafted by domain
experts over a number of years. People have been building models for programs with pointers (separation logic), as well as programs with
concurrency, programs with randomness, programs with algebraic effects, and perhaps many more that I haven't even heard of. In proving a property
of the system, we need a foundation for our reasoning process, which these theories give us for their respective domains. However, there are many
domains we don't have good models for, one example is runtime performance. This has been a contentious issue in the computer science curriculum, the
asymptotic complexity does not translate to program behavior in real hardware. Modern CPUs have cache lines, speculative execution, branch prediction
that makes the plain old abstract machine used in asymptotical analysis obsolete for many scenarios. We do not even have a single hardware to conform
our model to, we have tens of different configurations of hardware, each of which will give different results in our measurements. If we tried to prove
that some piece of code has a better result for a specific memory/processor pair than another one, we would have a massive job on our hands, I personally
don't even know where I would start with.</p>
<p>Contrast this to testing, where you can just spin up the same algorithm on both machines, run our benchmarks, which will be our final ground truth. Testing
is almost universally considered inferior to formal verification, it is what you do when you don't have the resources to justify verification, because if you
had the opportunity to spend the time, proving absence of bugs, or universal facts about your system, would be much more valuable than codifiying the results
of singular measurements. I am here to tell you that there are tests we can write that could not be formally verified, because while building the underlying
models for verification might be hard, just using the real hardware for our measurements can be much easier.</p>
<h3 id="verification-doesn-t-tell-you-that-you-are-going-down-the-wrong-path"><a href="#verification-doesn-t-tell-you-that-you-are-going-down-the-wrong-path" aria-label="Anchor link for: verification-doesn-t-tell-you-that-you-are-going-down-the-wrong-path">Verification doesn't tell you that you are going down the wrong path</a></h3>
<p>In games, there are clear winners and losers. In verification, you can prove that your theorem is correct, you can prove that your theorem is incorrect, but
absence of a proof for a theorem does not imply that the theorem is incorrect, it is possible that you just haven't found the proof. This means the feedback
you get when writing a proof is limited as you cannot rely on your inability to progress as a signal about your theorem, it is plausible that you are the problem.
This is why QuickChick, a testing tool descending from the famous QuickCheck of Haskell that introduced Property-Based Testing to the world, exists in Rocq
ecosystem as one of the three most popular packages. If verification was strictly superior to testing, QuickChick would have no reason to exist, but it serves
a very crucial role that the verification process needs, <strong>falsification</strong>. I had said that the absence of a proof does not imply that a theorem is wrong, but the witness of a violation of the theorem definitely does. Random testing is the prime suspect for finding such counterexamples, pulling the verifier out of the
rabbit hole of going through many useless paths in the proof search before giving up, because the theorem is ultimately wrong, there is no proof to be found.</p>
<h2 id="random-testing-and-formal-verification"><a href="#random-testing-and-formal-verification" aria-label="Anchor link for: random-testing-and-formal-verification">Random Testing and Formal Verification</a></h2>
<p>I have given examples of tests that formal verification is incapable of modeling, and examples of tests that complement formal verification process by creating
a short that falsifies false theorems instead of trying to prove them in vain. The synergy between testing and formal verification doesn't end here, I am a firm
supporter of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/lean-into-verified-software-development/">Verification-Guided Development (VGD)</a>, which in addition to leveraging this synergy, solves the problem of proof
assistants being too slow. In verification
guided development, we implement two versions of the same system, one is the simpler to reason, verified version, the other is the complex, production one. We then
test the property that the production system conforms to the reference implementation that is verified by running them with the same inputs and asserting that
the result is the same every single time. VGD <em>lifts</em> the proof to the production implementation from the slower one implemented in the proof assistant by leveraging
differential random testing, which allows for building a best-of-both-worlds system that is both correct and fast. Below is an image taken from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01688">the paper</a>
that (as far as I know) introduced the notion of VGD, explaining their workflow.</p>
<p><img src="https://alperenkeles.com/posts/test-dont-verify/image.png" alt="cedar vgd"></p>
<p>VGD doesn't solve all the issues I mention in the rest of the post, but it removes the slowness out of the mix. As we have a production implementation ready to be tested thoroughly,
we can make all kinds of measurements that fall out of the purview of verification, but into the realm of testing. It levels the playing field between the verified realm of computing
and the unverified one, reducing the downsides of the verification leveraging testing.</p>

<p>I would like to state it once more for everyone:</p>
<p><strong>I see the appeal, I like the idea, I trust the researchers building these systems, but I don't love the overarching promises. This blog post
is my attempt at building a reasonable middle ground by laying out the goods, and the bads, and make my closing
remarks by reiterating the position of testing in this space, and in the future.</strong></p>
<p>I believe random testing plays as important of a role as formal verification in the future of software engineering. We will not have magically formally verified systems
in many domains, but as autoformalization tools get better, we will have many, many more formal specifications. Random testing benefits from these formal specifications
in different ways than formal verification, but both have their places. Proof systems will be incomplete without the accompanying testing tools, and the testing tools
will be incomplete without proofs of correctness, it is only possible via some combination of verification and testing that we can achieve our ideals of the future of
software engineering, live in a world where bugs are considered anomalies instead of the norm, where correctness is a virtue, and the bugs in our systems are as old and
as forgotten as the diseases we learned to cure and put away.</p>

In a note to colleagues seen by NBC News, she accused the network of pulling the segment for “political” reasons.</p><p id="anchor-bf7ea9">In the note, she said it was pulled because the Trump administration refused requests for comment — a standard that she said, if adopted, would amount a government “kill switch” to stop publication of a story.</p><p id="anchor-2b490d">“Our story was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices,” Alfonsi wrote in the note.</p><p id="anchor-9bcb9f">“It is factually correct.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Ryanair has been fined €256m (£223m) by Italy’s competition authority for abusing its dominant market position to limit sales of tickets by online travel agents.</p><p>The authority said Europe’s largest airline had “implemented an abusive strategy to hinder travel agencies” via an “elaborate strategy” of technical obstacles for agents and passengers to make it difficult for online travel agents to sell Ryanair tickets and instead force sales through its own website.</p><p>The fine related to Ryanair’s conduct between April 2023 and at least until April 2025, the authority said on Tuesday. It said Ryanair had prevented online travel agents from selling tickets on its flights in combination with other airlines and services, weakening competition.</p><p>Ryanair said it would immediately appeal against the “legally flawed” ruling.</p><p>The Ryanair chief executive, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/michael-oleary" data-link-name="in body link">Michael O’Leary</a>, had decided to wage war on what he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/29/ryanair-cuts-profits-forecast-flights-lastminute-opodo" data-link-name="in body link">described as “pirate” travel agents</a>, such as Booking.com, Kiwi and Kayak. O’Leary accused the travel agent industry of scamming and ripping off unsuspecting consumers by charging extra fees and markups on ticket prices.</p><p>O’Leary was prepared to accept lower ticket sales as he tried to prevent travel agents from selling tickets, forcing their passengers to fill out extra forms supposedly as a security measure. The abrupt removal of Ryanair flights from agents’ websites in late 2023 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/03/ryanair-ticket-sales-hit-after-travel-agent-websites-delist-airline" data-link-name="in body link">caused a drop in sales for the airline</a>.</p><p>The lower sales <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/29/ryanair-cuts-profits-forecast-flights-lastminute-opodo" data-link-name="in body link">dented Ryanair’s profits</a>, although they have not prevented the Irish airline from rising to a record valuation of €31bn (£27bn). That has made it the world’s second most valuable airline, behind only the US’s Delta Air Lines.</p><p>O’Leary – who is known for his combative and often sweary criticisms of airports, rivals and regulators – is planning to hand over control of the business to a successor within the next five to 10 years. He will be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/18/ryanair-boss-michael-oleary-heads-for-100m-bonus" data-link-name="in body link">given shares worth €111m</a> (£97m) if he stays at the airline until the end of July 2028. He was already a billionaire on paper because of his shareholding.</p><p>Responding to the ruling, O’Leary said it was “an affront to consumer protection and competition law”.</p><p>He added: “The internet and the ryanair.com website have enabled Ryanair to distribute directly to consumers, and Ryanair has passed on these 20% cost savings in the form of the lowest air fares in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Italy</a> and Europe.</p><p>“Ryanair looks forward to successfully overturning this legally flawed ruling and its absurd €256m fine in the courts.”</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&quot;index&quot;:11,&quot;listId&quot;:4139,&quot;identityName&quot;:&quot;business-today&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Business Today&quot;,&quot;frequency&quot;:&quot;Every weekday&quot;,&quot;successDescription&quot;:&quot;We'll send you Business Today every weekday&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;news&quot;,&quot;idApiUrl&quot;:&quot;https://idapi.theguardian.com&quot;}"></gu-island></figure><p>The vast majority of Ryanair’s sales took place through its website even before the battle against online travel agents. However, the Italian authority said Ryanair had been guilty of “abuse of a dominant position” and using its “significant market power” in trying to stamp out the business.</p><p>Ryanair’s tactics included rolling out facial recognition procedures for people who bought tickets via a third party, claiming that was necessary for security. It then “totally or intermittently blocked booking attempts by travel agencies”, including by blocking payment methods and mass-deleting accounts.</p><p>The airline then “imposed partnership agreements” on agencies that banned sales of Ryanair flights in combinations with other carriers, and blocked bookings to force them to sign up. Only in April this year did it allow agencies’ websites to link up with its own services, allowing effective competition.</p><p>The competition authority said Ryanair’s actions had “blocked, hindered or made such purchases more difficult and/or economically or technically burdensome when combined with flights operated by other carriers and/or other tourism and insurance services”.</p></div></div>]]></description>
