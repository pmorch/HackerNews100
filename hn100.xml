										<p>The recent introduction of spot bitcoin ETFs has been generating headlines and buzz in pockets of the industry. However, Vanguard does not have plans to create a Vanguard bitcoin ETF or other crypto-related products. Additionally, such products from other issuers will not be offered on our brokerage platform. In this Q&amp;A, two Vanguard leaders—Janel Jackson, global head of ETF Capital Markets and Broker &amp; Index Relations, and Andrew Kadjeski, head of Brokerage &amp; Investments—discuss why.</p>

When deciding what investment products to offer, we consider a range of factors, including whether we believe they have <i>enduring</i> investment merit and meet our clients’ needs. While the discussion about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, in general, has increased recently, we do not currently believe that there is an appropriate role for them to play in long-term portfolios. <sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>

                    <p>We do have a lot of interest in blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrencies. We believe its application to a number of other uses besides crypto will make capital markets more efficient, and we’ve been actively involved in research to use blockchain technology.&nbsp;<br>

                <h5><p>Why is Vanguard not offering crypto-related products on its brokerage platform?<sup>1</sup></p>
</h5>
            </div>
        

        <div>
                    	<p><a name="OLE_LINK10" id="OLE_LINK10"></a><b>Kadjeski:</b> Investors have a lot of choices these days when it comes to where to save for their retirement, invest for their kids’ education, and hold their emergency savings. Investors who come directly to Vanguard do so because they know we put their interests first<a name="OLE_LINK6" id="OLE_LINK6"></a>—and that is reflected in what products and services we <i>do</i> and <i>don’t</i> have on the shelf.</p>
<p>The easy step for us would have been just to allow full access to crypto-related products. But as a firm and a brokerage platform, we’re purposely structured to meet the needs of our investor-owners, most of whom are long-term, buy-and-hold investors.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p><b>Jackson:</b> In Vanguard’s view, crypto is more of a speculation than an investment. This is at the root of our decision to not offer crypto products, whether our own or others. With equities, you own a share of a company that produces goods or services, and many also pay dividends. With bonds, you get a stream of interest payments. Commodities are real assets that meet consumption needs, have inflation-hedging properties, and can play a <a href="https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/articles/inflation-fighting-power-of-commodities.html" target="_self">role in certain portfolios</a>. While crypto has been classified as a commodity, it’s an immature asset class that has little history, no inherent economic value, no cash flow, and can create havoc within a portfolio.</p>
<p>Morningstar recently published a perceptive article pointing out that even a modest 5% allocation to bitcoin in an otherwise traditional balanced portfolio can drastically raise its risk profile.<sup>3</sup> This is driven, in large part, by bitcoin’s extreme volatility.</p>
<p><b>Kadjeski:</b> Over just the past three years, the price of bitcoin has increased by as much as 150% and declined by as much as 77%. Double-digit percent price drops are routine among cryptocurrencies. Remember that you need a 100% return just to make up for a 50% decline. And the more volatile an asset, the more tempting it is to trade. At Vanguard, our products and services are designed with the goal to help investors save more, trade less, and take a long-term approach—not chase trends and churn their portfolios.</p>

                <h5><p>Has Vanguard made similar decisions in the past?</p>
</h5>
            </div>
        

        <div>
                    	<p><b>Jackson:</b> There have been several investment trends in the past—the internet funds in the late 1990s for example—that Vanguard could have capitalized on. But we always ask ourselves, “Does this meet our investors’ long-term needs?” In hindsight, in nearly all cases, I believe we made the right call, ultimately benefiting our clients.<b></b></p>
<p><b>Kadjeski:</b> The same line of thinking applies to our brokerage platform. In 2019, we decided to remove access to leveraged and inverse funds and ETFs. These products are often misunderstood and misused by investors and can magnify losses. Similarly, in 2022, we stopped offering most over-the-counter stocks, which are prone to high risk, low liquidity, and potential fraud.</p>
<p><b>Jackson:</b> We understand that our decision on crypto is not popular among some investors, but many know that we’re being consistent with our philosophy and past practice.<sup>4 </sup>Our mission statement to give investors the best chance for investment success isn’t just a saying for us. It’s built into our DNA and we’re staying true to our mission by making this decision.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Date: 2025-01-26 <br>
Git: <a href="https://gitlab.com/mort96/blog/blob/published/content/00000-home/00016-wayland-input-latency.md">https://gitlab.com/mort96/blog/blob/published/content/00000-home/00016-wayland-input-latency.md</a></p>
<p>Yesterday, I read this blog post:
<a href="https://gist.github.com/generic-internet-user/e8eec46ce159571032115f6fb064523c">Wayland Cursor Lag: Just give me a break already...</a>,
where a Linux user discusses their frustration with input latency under Wayland.
They detailed their own subjective experience of the problem,
but failed to produce hard evidence.</p>
<p>Even though I'm a very happy user of wayland overall,
I share the blog post's author's subjective impression that there's more
cursor lag under Wayland than under X11.
In my opinion, their experiment was limited by their phone camera's 90 FPS,
which really doesn't feel like it's enough to get conclusive numbers
when we're talking about differences which are probably on the order of
single screen refresh cycles.</p>
<p>So I thought: hey, I have a phone with a 240 FPS camera mode,
I bet that's enough to get some conclusive results!</p>
<p>Spoilers: I was right.</p>
<h2>Experimental design</h2>
<p>I simply pointed my phone's camera at the screen and desk using my left hand,
made sure to get the mouse cursor, the mouse and my right hand in frame,
and recorded myself repeatedly flicking the mouse with my finger.
I recorded myself flicking it 16 times under Wayland,
logged out of the GNOME Wayland session and into a GNOME X11 session,
then did the same there.</p>
<p>I then converted the two resulting video files into a series of JPEGs
using ffmpeg (<code>ffmpeg -i &lt;input file&gt; %04d.jpg</code>),
and counted from the first frame where I could see the mouse move
until the first frame where I could clearly see that the cursor had moved.</p>
<p>I elected to include the start and end frame;
so if I saw the mouse move in frame 1045,
then I saw the cursor move in frame 1047,
I would count that as 3 frames.</p>
<p>Here's an example which depicts a latency of 3 frames (requires JavaScript):</p>
<div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://mort.coffee/_/imgs/wayland-latency-before-1.jpg" alt="before 1"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's a frame from before the mouse has begun moving.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://mort.coffee/_/imgs/wayland-latency-before-2.jpg" alt="before 2"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mouse still hasn't moved.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://mort.coffee/_/imgs/wayland-latency-moved-1.jpg" alt="mouse moving"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here, the mouse has just about started moving,
so I consider this "frame 1".
The cursor hasn't moved yet.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://mort.coffee/_/imgs/wayland-latency-moved-2.jpg" alt="still moving"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mouse moves a bit further, but the cursor still hasn't moved.
This is "frame 2".</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://mort.coffee/_/imgs/wayland-latency-cursor.jpg" alt="cursor moved"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the frame where the cursor starts moving.
This is "frame 3", so I would note down this sequence
as taking 3 frames.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p>Hardware details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distro: Fedora Workstation 41</li>
<li>GNOME version: 47</li>
<li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 5950X</li>
<li>GPU: AMD Radeon RX 7900XT</li>
<li>Monitor: Gigabyte M32U (4k IPS @ 144.99, no DPI scaling)</li>
<li>Mouse: Logitech G502 Lightspeed</li>
<li>Camera: iPhone 15 Pro, slo-mo 240 FPS</li>
</ul>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>The main limitations of this experiment are:</p>
<ul>
<li>240 FPS still isn't <em>that</em> much. With my 144Hz screen, I have less than
two camera frames per screen refresh. This introduces some random variance.</li>
<li>Pixels don't switch instantly, so there are ambiguous frames where the cursor
is <em>barely</em> starting to become visible in its new location.
I decided to count the cursor as "having moved" when there is a clearly visible
cursor in a new location on the screen, even if the pixels haven't fully lit up.</li>
<li>For some reason, the video recording from my phone contains some duplicate frames.
I don't know why this happens. I decided to interpret these duplicate frames
as a representation of a frame's worth of time passing, so I counted them as normal.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these factors introduce some uncertainty in the results.
However, they <em>should</em> affect Wayland and X11 equally, so with enough data,
it should all even out.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Another caveat I should clearly point out is that there are
many other Wayland compositors out there than GNOME's, and I have not tested them.
For that matter, there are other GPU drivers out there than AMD's.
Other compositors and other GPU drivers may show different results.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Here's the data I captured:</p>

<p>Wayland, on average, has roughly 6.5ms more cursor latency than X11 on my system.
I don't have the statistics expertise necessary to properly analyze
whether this difference is statistically significant or not,
but to my untrained eye, it looks like there's a clear and consistent difference.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the difference is very close to 1 full screen refresh.
I don't know whether or not that's a coincidence.</p>
<p>Here are the numbers in chart form:</p>
<p><img src="https://mort.coffee/_/imgs/wayland-latency-chart.svg" alt="Latency chart"></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In my mind, these results are conclusive proof that there <em>is</em> a difference
in input latency between X11 and Wayland, at least with my hardware,
and that the difference is large enough that it's plausible for some people to notice.</p>
<p>Further testing on more varied hardware and refresh rates is necessary
to get a clear picture of how wide-spread the problem is and how large it is.
It's likely that the magnitude of the difference varies based on factors
such as which compositor is used and what the refresh rate of the screen is.</p>
<p>I probably won't undertake that further testing,
because this is all very time intensive work.
My goal was only to see if I could conclusively measure <em>some</em> difference.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I want to add a note here about what this testing does <em>not</em> show.
It does not show that there's higher input latency <em>in general</em>
in Wayland compared to X11 in a way which affects, for example, games.
It is possible that this added latency is entirely cursor-specific
and that Wayland and X11 exhibit the exact same input latency
in graphical applications and games.
It is my understanding that the cursor is handled very differently from
normal graphical applications.
Further testing would be necessary to show whether Wayland has more input latency
<em>in games</em> than X11.</p>

Seriously, the reaction to this rollout was an Excel #DIV/0 error.</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-home/microsoft-is-changing-the-way-you-sign-in-and-it-could-be-a-security-nightmare/">Microsoft is changing the way you sign in - and it could be a security nightmare</a></strong></p><p>What went wrong? Where do I begin?</p><h2>They botched the price increase</h2><p>Let me bend over backward to Microsoft here. They launched Office 365 (which later became Microsoft 365) more than a dozen years ago, and in that time they have not raised the price once. In case you haven't noticed, we are living through some inflationary times right now.</p><p>So, there was plenty of room for Microsoft to roll out a gentle price increase. "Hey y'all, we know this isn't welcome news but we need to bump up the Microsoft 365 subscription price by two bucks a month. It's still a great deal!"</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11-in-2025/">How to upgrade your 'incompatible' Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 in 2025</a></strong></p><p>Netflix does that every year or two and no one shows up at Netflix HQ with pitchforks and torches.</p><p>But no. Instead, they made it a 30% price increase and <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/its-official-all-your-office-apps-are-getting-ai-and-a-price-increase/">blamed it all on artificial intelligence</a>. Bad idea. Why? Because...</p><!----><h2>No one wants to pay for AI</h2><p>There's a ton of potential in AI, and it has some solid use cases today, for tasks like <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-chatgpt-to-write-code-what-it-does-well-and-what-it-doesnt/">writing code</a> and finding patterns in large databases.</p><p>But in the places where Microsoft 365 Family and Personal subscribers are likely to see AI, the edges are still very, very rough. If you ask Copilot in Word to write something for you, the results will be about what you'd expect from an enthusiastic summer intern. You might fare better if you ask Copilot to turn a folder full of photos into a PowerPoint presentation. But is that task really such a challenge?</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-best-ai-for-coding-in-2025-and-what-not-to-use/">The best AI for coding in 2025 (and what not to use)</a></strong></p><p>To top that off, there are similarly rough edges in the way the Copilot features are implemented. For example, I have both work and family subscriptions to Microsoft 365. This combination normally works very well; I can sign in with one account, attach resources like OneDrive from both accounts, and work with almost no friction.</p><p>But good luck doing the same with Copilot features. In that configuration, I consistently get error messages telling me, "As a Microsoft 365 Personal or Family subscriber, you'll be able to use Copilot when you're signed with your Microsoft work or school account (<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-launches-entra-a-new-identity-and-access-family-of-products/">Entra ID</a>) and Microsoft personal account. However, that ability is not yet available."</p><figure><div><picture><!----> <img src="" alt="m365-copilot-error" width="740" height="994.2798353909466" fetchpriority="low"></picture></div> <figcaption><div><p>If you pay for a personal and work subscription to Microsoft 365, you'll pay the higher price but won't get the new features.</p></div> <span>Screenshot by Ed Bott/ZDNET</span></figcaption></figure><p>Let me see if I understand this: I'm paying Microsoft for not one but two subscriptions, and they raised the price of one of those subscriptions while not allowing me to use its signature feature. That seems like a lousy way to reward your best customers.</p><h2>The announcement was bungled, too</h2><p>I pay annually for my Microsoft 365 Family subscription. The price went up more than a week ago, but I haven't received an email telling me about it. As the account manager, I should see that notice before I see the new price in my dashboard.</p><p>Instead, I learned about the new price thanks to a pop-up message on my Android phone.</p><figure><div><picture><!----> <img src="" alt="price-change-for-microsoft-365" width="740" height="1178.5185185185185" fetchpriority="low"></picture></div> <figcaption><div><p>This po-up on my phone is the only notice I've received about a price change.&nbsp;</p></div> <span>Screenshot by Ed Bott/ZDNET</span></figcaption></figure><p>That notice tells me I have a monthly plan. No, I have an annual plan that will renew in a month or two. It says I can cancel billing in my Play Store settings. No, I can't. I bought this subscription using the web browser on my Windows PC, and when I tap the Subscriptions button in the Android app it opens a web browser and takes me to my Microsoft account page, where I have to tap the Manage button to find the cancel option.</p><p>It could be worse, I suppose. Just ask the French and Spanish subscribers who got a similar pop-up message telling them their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Office365/comments/1i75h77/microsoft_365_from_10_to_1300_a_month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">price had gone from €10 a month to €13,000</a>. (Those pesky decimals.)</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-home/microsoft-is-changing-the-way-you-sign-in-and-it-could-be-a-security-nightmare/">Microsoft is changing the way you sign in - and it could be a security nightmare</a></strong></p><p>Oh, and I've lost count of the number of people who were baffled and angry that Microsoft had forcibly installed the Copilot app on their devices. It was just a rebranding of the old Microsoft 365 app with the new name and logo, but in my case it was days later before I received yet another pop-up message telling me about the change.</p><h2>Well, surely you can just turn it off. Right?</h2><p>The smartest thing Microsoft could have done was to make this initial release of Copilot an opt-in feature for a few months. They could have said, "We're excited to let everyone try this! Just click OK here!"</p><p>Instead, they turned the feature on for everyone and gave Word users a well-hidden checkbox that reads Enable Copilot. The feature is on by default, so you have to clear the checkbox to make it go away.</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-office-support-in-windows-10-ends-in-october-too-what-that-really-means/">Microsoft Office support in Windows 10 ends in October too - what that really means</a></strong></p><p>As for the other Office apps? "Uh, we'll get around to giving you a button to turn it off next month. Maybe."</p><p>Seriously, the&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/how-to-turn-off-copilot-in-microsoft-365-family-and-personal-subscriptions-bc7e530b-152d-4123-8e78-edc06f8b85f1" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">support page that explains where you can find that box in Word</a>&nbsp;says, "We're working on adding the Enable Copilot checkbox to Excel, OneNote, and PowerPoint on Windows devices and to Excel and PowerPoint on Mac devices. That is tentatively scheduled to happen in February 2025." Until the Enable Copilot button is available, you can't disable Copilot.</p><p>Meanwhile, maybe think twice about using the option to disable all of the connected features in your Office apps. As&nbsp;<a href="https://laurenhough.substack.com/p/there-are-some-swear-words-in-this" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">one writer pointed out</a>&nbsp;(with multiple swear words and some threats aimed in the general direction of One Microsoft Way), doing so can have unintended consequences, like making it appear as though all your files in OneDrive have suddenly disappeared.</p><h2>How long will the Classic option last?</h2><p>If you try to cancel Microsoft 365 to avoid the price increase (or just to say no to the AI features), Microsoft's subscription  management page offers the option to downgrade to a Classic plan, which turns out to be exactly what you signed up for not that long ago, minus the price increase.</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-top-10-brands-exploited-in-phishing-attacks-and-how-to-protect-yourself/">The top 10 brands exploited in phishing attacks - and how to protect yourself</a></strong></p><p>That's purely a retention play, of course. New subscribers can't sign up for this plan, and I expect that it will be discontinued in a year or two.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why is Microsoft doing this?</h2><p>I have yet to see a single person praising the implementation of Copilot in Microsoft 365 or telling Satya Nadella they've gotten their money's worth out of this unexpected upgrade.</p><p>So, why do it at all? I can think of 3 billion reasons. I could plug the numbers into Excel and tell you about it, but let's have Copilot explain instead.</p><figure><div><picture><!----> <img src="" alt="microsoft-copilot-dows-math" width="1280" height="1176.167832167832" fetchpriority="low"></picture></div> <figcaption><div><p>Microsoft Copilot understands how the subscription business model works.</p></div> <span>Screenshot by Ed Bott/ZDNET</span></figcaption></figure><p>Microsoft is halfway through its 2026 fiscal year. It's almost like someone was given instructions at the end of the calendar year to bump up that revenue line for the Office Consumer division.</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-i-easily-added-ai-to-my-favorite-microsoft-office-alternative/">How I easily added AI to my favorite Microsoft Office alternative</a></strong></p><p>Here's the funny thing: The price increase is so big that there will still be a huge positive impact even if 10% of Microsoft 365 Personal and Family customers cancel rather than pay the extra monthly fee. Copilot walked me through the math and concluded, "So, even with 10% of your customers canceling their subscriptions, you would still generate an additional $1.714 billion annually due to the price hike. How do you feel about this adjustment?"</p><p>I feel like I understand why all those complaints are going to go unheard.</p><div id="pinbox-684151ed-848f-4f0d-a5f9-d91e36c294b3"><h4>More Microsoft</h4> <!---->  </div></div></div>]]></description>

<img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" alt="Two caricatures of top-hatted millionaires whose bodies are bulging money-sacks. Their heads have been replaced with potatoes. The potatoes' eyes have been replaced with the hostile red eye of HAL 9000 from Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey.' They stand in a potato field filled with stoop laborers. The sky is a 'code waterfall' as seen in the credit sequences of the Wachowskis' 'Matrix' movies." src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/big-potato.jpg?w=840&amp;ssl=1"></p>
<h2>It's not a crime if we do it with an app (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/25/potatotrac/#carbo-loading">permalink</a>)</h2>
<p>The core regulatory proposition of the tech industry is "it's not a crime if we do it with an app." It's not an unlicensed taxi if we do it with an app. It's not an illegal hotel room if we do it with an app. It's not an unregistered security if we do it with an app. It's not wage theft if we do it with an app.</p>
<p>Inflation is one of the most politically salient factors of this decade, and so much of inflation can be attributed to a crime, done with an app, with impunity for the criminals. The entire food supply has been sewn up by cartels of 2-5 giant companies, and they colluded to raise prices, and bragged about it, and got away with it, because neoclassical economists insist that it's impossible for this kind of price fixing to occur in an "efficient market."</p>
<p>Some of these cartels are well-known, like the Coke/Pepsi duopoly. Pepsi's bosses boasted to their shareholders about "Pepsi pricing power," and how they were able to raise prices over the inflationary increases caused by covid and the Russian invasion of Ukraine:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/11/price-over-volume/#pepsi-pricing-power">https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/11/price-over-volume/#pepsi-pricing-power</a></p>
<p>You might know that pretty much every packaged good in your grocery store is made by one of two companies, Unilever and Procter and Gamble. Both CEOs boasted to their investors about their above-inflation price increases:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/20/quiet-part-out-loud/#profiteering">https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/20/quiet-part-out-loud/#profiteering</a></p>
<p>But other cartels are harder to spot. It may seem like your grocer's eggs department is filled with many different companies' products. In reality, a single company, Cal-Maine Foods, owns practically every brand of eggs in the case: Farmhouse Eggs, Sunups, Sunny Meadow, Egg-Land’s Best and Land O’ Lakes. They made record profits after the pandemic and through bird flu, a fact that CFO Max Bowman attributed to "significantly higher selling prices" and "our ability to adapt to inflationary market pressures":</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/23/cant-make-an-omelet/#keep-calm-and-crack-on">https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/23/cant-make-an-omelet/#keep-calm-and-crack-on</a></p>
<p>But Cal-Maine is comparatively transparent. The other food cartels – especially those that serve the restaurant sector – are harder to spot. In <em>The Lever</em>, Katya Schwenk describes how four companies – Lamb Weston, JR Simplot, McCain Foods and Cavendish Farms – have captured the frozen potato market and all that comes with it (fries, tater tots, etc):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.levernews.com/the-rise-of-big-potato/">https://www.levernews.com/the-rise-of-big-potato/</a></p>
<p>These companies have been hiking prices for years, but <em>really</em> started to turn the screws during the post-covid inflationary period. One of Schwenk's sources is Josh Saltzman, owner of the DC sports bar Ivy and Coney. Ten years ago, Saltzman charged $3 for fries; now it's $6 – and Saltzman's margins have declined. Saltzman has a limited number of suppliers, and they all get their potatoes from Big Potato, and they bundle those potato orders with their other supplies, making it effectively impossible for Saltzman to buy his potatoes from anyone else.</p>
<p>Big Potato controls <em>97%</em> of the frozen potato market, and any sector that large and concentrated is going to be pretty cozy. The execs at these companies all meet at industry associations, lobbying bodies, and as they job-hop between companies in the cartel. But they don't have to rely on personal connections to rig the price of potatoes: they do it through a third-party data-broker called Potatotrac. Each cartel member sends all their commercially sensitive data – supply costs, pricing, sales figures – to Potatotrac, and then Potatotrac uses that data to give "advice" to the cartel members about "optimal pricing."</p>
<p>This is just price-fixing, with an app. The fact that they don't sit around a table and openly discuss pricing doesn't keep this from being price-fixing. What's more, they <em>admit it</em>. A director at McCain said that "higher ups" forbade anyone in the company from competing on price. A Lamb Weston exec described the arrangement as everyone "behaving themselves," chortling that they'd "never seen margins this high in the history of the potato industry." Lamb Weston's CEO attributed a 111% increase in net income to "pricing actions."</p>
<p>Lamb Weston's execs understand that they're driving small restaurants out of business, and that the real beneficiaries are big chains that can pass the price increases onto their customers, like "Chili’s and the Texas Roadhouses and Cheesecake Factory":</p>
<p><a href="https://app.tegus.co/guest/document/view/67Hf3DiMGQ944SkfpRhLfNeiqekjA67sm2dxTCYtjoggUaJXk2chDg9wxMnZ">https://app.tegus.co/guest/document/view/67Hf3DiMGQ944SkfpRhLfNeiqekjA67sm2dxTCYtjoggUaJXk2chDg9wxMnZ</a></p>
<p>This is by no means unique to the potato industry. A data-broker called Agri Stats works with America's largest meat-packers to rig the price of meat – packers send Agri Stats the same kind of data that Big Potato sends to Potatotrac, and Agri Stats sends back the same "recommendations" that allow them to raise meat prices across the board, in lockstep:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/04/dont-let-your-meat-loaf/#meaty-beaty-big-and-bouncy">https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/04/dont-let-your-meat-loaf/#meaty-beaty-big-and-bouncy</a></p>
<p>Lots of food categories are as inbred as meat and potatoes: "four firms controlled nearly 80 percent of the almond milk market, for instance. Three companies controlled 83 percent of the canned tuna market, and four companies controlled more than 86 percent of the microwave popcorn market."</p>
<p>The "price fixing is legal if we do it with an app" gambit is not just about food, either. Apps like Realpage let big corporate landlords – who've bought up a sizable fraction of all the available homes in America – collude to raise rents:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/27/ai-conspiracies/#epistemological-collapse">https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/27/ai-conspiracies/#epistemological-collapse</a></p>
<p>And private equity companies have rolled up all the <em>fire truck</em> companies, hiking the price of trucks, creating backlogs and bottlenecks for parts and service, and starving the nation's municipalities (including Los Angeles) of fire-fighting equipment:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/did-a-private-equity-fire-truck-roll">https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/did-a-private-equity-fire-truck-roll</a></p>
<p>This kind of price-fixing was central to the enforcement actions of the Biden administration's trustbusters at the FTC, and their investigations and actions inspired state AGs and private parties to bring their own antitrust suits. The question is, will Trump's enforcers continue this agenda? And will Trump's judges – steeped in Heritage Foundation economics that insists that monopolies are "efficient" – find in their favor if they do?</p>
<p>Inflation has lots of causes, it's true. But when an industry is consolidated enough to take advantage of a data brokerage or just engage in tacit collusion, <em>any</em> source of inflation – war, disease, weather – allows whole sectors to raise prices together, and keep them high, long after the shock has passed.</p>

<p><span>On the last full day of his country’s existence, South Vietnamese air force Maj. Buang-Ly stole a tiny two-seat airplane. He helped his wife and their five children<b>, </b>ages 14 months to 6 years, into the backseat and storage area before climbing into the pilot’s seat. They took off and headed out to sea while enemy ground fire zipped past them. </span></p>



<p><span>It was April 29, 1975, and chaos had enveloped the nation. Two years earlier, the 1973 Paris peace agreement had theoretically ended the war, but after American combat forces left the country, the North Vietnamese took the opportunity to press their new strategic advantage. The long war between North and South Vietnam paused only briefly before ferocious fighting resumed.</span></p>



<p>In early 1975, the North Vietnamese Army seized key bases in the Central Highlands, and, by the end of March, had captured areas along the coast. The remaining American advisers and many South Vietnamese families began frenzied evacuations on American military aircraft and civilian transport planes.</p>



<p>Those large, fixed-wing aircraft flew thousands of people to hastily constructed camps in the Philippines, Guam and Wake Island. The last plane out of Da Nang, a civilian Boeing 727 on March 29, was unable to retract its landing gear in flight because at least seven of the 290 passengers had climbed into its wheel wells. Soon North Vietnamese forces were shelling Saigon.</p>

<p><b>Buang and his family were stationed on Con Son Island</b><strong>,</strong> about 50 miles off the southern coast and home to one of the last bases still under South Vietnamese control. Used mainly as a prison camp, the island also had a small airfield. When Buang and his wife learned that North Vietnamese forces were closing in, they loaded as many of their possessions as possible into the plane and got airborne—with no plan for what to do next.</p>



<p><span>Their tiny aircraft, an O-1 Bird Dog, was a modified Cessna 170, a light, single-engine tail dragger with fixed landing gear. Ruggedly built and highly maneuverable, Bird Dogs flew over South Vietnam’s terrain during the war, spotting enemy targets and then marking them with white phosphorous rockets to guide U.S. artillery shelling and airstrikes. The planes could take off and land on a dime, but their range was limited to just over 500 miles when fully fueled—and Buang’s fuel tank was not. </span></p>



<p><span>As Buang coaxed the overloaded plane airborne, he faced enormous challenges. The Bird Dog was not designed to operate over water. It lacked sophisticated navigation equipment, life vests and the ability to safely ditch in an emergency. Buang had never seen, much less landed on, an aircraft carrier—and to make matters worse, this Bird Dog had no working radio because Buang had not been able to bring a headset. Still, he knew that his family was more likely to find safety out at sea, where the U.S. Navy was in control, than on the land now controlled by communist forces under Gen. Van Tien Dung.</span></p>



<p><span>After flying for a half-hour, Buang spotted a gaggle of helicopters in the distance heading east. At the time he had no idea they were loaded with friendly evacuees, but it seemed like a good idea to follow them. “I was searching for a safe place,” Buang later recalled. “It made me think there was something out there they could depend on.”</span></p>



<p><span><b>On April 19, 10 days before the Buang family </b>departed Con Son Island, the aircraft carrier USS <em>Midway</em> had received orders to leave Naval Station Subic Bay in the Philippines and make best speed toward Saigon to help evacuate the roughly 5,000 Americans remaining there, including diplomats, CIA agents, contractors and a handful of Marines. <em>Midway</em> and the rest of the 7th Fleet would also evacuate as many friendly Vietnamese as possible. </span></p>



<p><span>The old ship had been in service since September 1945 and was just starting a pier side repair period. Its engineering plant, which had been taken offline for maintenance, needed to be hastily restored to operation, and the ship got underway with fewer sailors than normal. At Subic Bay, <em>Midway</em> offloaded half of the fixed-wing jets in its combat air wing. When the ship reached the South China Sea, it received 10 large <a href="https://www.historynet.com/hh-53-super-jolly-green-giant.htm">Sikorsky H-53</a> helicopters—two U.S. Air Force HH-53s from the 40th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron and eight CH-53s from the Air Force’s 21st Special Operations Squadron. Each of these choppers could comfortably transport 55 passengers at a time. </span></p>



<p><span>The mission, dubbed Operation Frequent Wind, would employ an ad-hoc fleet of helicopters and several elements of the 7th Fleet—an impressive array of combat vehicles—to conduct a massive humanitarian operation, transporting and caring for thousands of refugees. During transit, the carrier’s crew got busy training for the work ahead.</span></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="960" height="640" src="https://www.historynet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Nam-Cessna-refugee-960_640.jpg" alt="Refugees on the Midway are led by the crew to a place where they can get medical care.

<p>Throughout the war, most air operations from carriers like <em>Midway</em> had been combat sorties: bombing, intelligence gathering and combat air patrol. Noncombat logistics operations normally took up only a small slice of a day’s action on the flight deck. The logistics crews usually transferred a few dozen passengers a day, maybe brought onboard a new jet engine or other supplies, and shipped mail via plane or helicopter.</p>



<p>Typically, a junior air transfer officer leading a crew of about a dozen sailors could easily handle the load. But for Operation Frequent Wind, the entire ship and its crew were devoted to the effort. The carrier’s senior enlisted sailors led the rest of the crew in drills designed to account for every imaginable problem.</p>



<p><span>On the morning of April 29, former South Vietnamese Prime Minister and Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky, accompanied by Lt. Gen. Ngo Quang Truong, requested permission to land on the <em>Midway</em>, after making a one-hour, 15-minute helicopter flight from the mainland. Their arrival signaled to the carrier’s officers that Operation Frequent Wind had begun. About 11 a.m. that morning Secretary of State Henry Kissinger finally gave American diplomats the order to evacuate. An American radio station broadcast the secret signal: “The temperature in Saigon is 105 degrees and rising,” followed by Tennessee Ernie Ford’s “White Christmas”</span><span>—</span><span>because the DJ couldn’t find the more well-known Bing Crosby version. The signal told evacuees in Saigon to move to pre-assigned extraction locations, board buses there and head to the airport. </span></p>



<p><span><b>As the official evacuation commenced</b><strong>,</strong> many resourceful Vietnamese commandeered whatever aircraft they could to fly to safety. “At least 74 planes of the South Vietnamese Air Force, including about 30 F-5 fighters, streamed into the U Taphao air base in southern Thailand from South Vietnam without warning,” </span><span><em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em> reported the next day. “The pilots and passengers—about 2,000 people—requested asylum,” and more planes kept arriving. Thai officials declared their intention to return the aircraft to South Vietnam, which soon became impossible as the South was absorbed into a unified Vietnam under Hanoi’s communist leadership.</span></p>



<p><span>More choppers began arriving on <em>Midway</em>’s flight deck. The ship’s contingent of Marines and the sergeant at arms searched the new arrivals for contraband and weapons, confiscating pistols and wads of worthless South Vietnamese cash that they threw over the side. Then they helped passengers into the ship’s command structure on the starboard side, known as “the island,” where crew members gave them food and basic medical care. All but 80 or so of the most dire cases were transferred by helicopter to other ships to be distributed across the whole fleet, a process that went on well into the next day. </span></p>



<p><span>Young, tough sailors who were used to handling bombs, chains and fuel lines amid the roar of jet engines now devoted themselves to caring for bewildered parents, frightened children, the elderly and the sick. The flight deck was choked with choppers and lines of men and women carrying suitcases and children. The hangar bay below decks ran out of room for more aircraft as efforts to aid hundreds of refugees continued there.</span></p>



<p><span>The <em>Midway</em> was commanded by Capt. Lawrence Chambers, the first African-American carrier captain and just the second to graduate from the U.S. Naval Academy when he earned his degree in 1952. Chambers had reported aboard the carrier in January 1975 and been in command for only a few weeks. In a television interview 35 years later, he recalled the scene as he watched from his chair on the bridge, just above the action: “A flight deck is a hazardous operation under normal conditions. And when you see little kids and mothers holding little babies, and airplanes, helicopters are taking off and landing, you just kind of hold your breath.” </span></p>



<p>Weather conditions were not ideal, observed the ship’s air boss, Cmdr. Vern Jumper, from his perch five stories above the flight deck in the Primary Flight Control room<b>. </b>Jumper was responsible for all aspects of flight operations, including any aircraft flying near the ship, all the action on the flight deck, and the work happening down in the hangar bay. He noted rain falling from a 500-foot cloud ceiling, 15 knots (17 mph) of wind over the deck and 5 miles visibility. But the seas remained relatively calm, which meant the deck, though sometimes slick with water, wasn’t pitching.</p>



<p><span>Air traffic controllers inside the ship and landing signals crew on deck used whatever means necessary to keep helicopters in order as they approached. Communication went smoothly with the 10 H-53 helicopters that were part of the operation. They would land, unload, refuel and make repeated trips to Saigon. By mid-afternoon, an additional 45 <a href="https://www.historynet.com/arsenal-uh-1-iroquois-huey-helicopter.htm">UH-1 Iroquois</a> “Huey” helicopters had arrived from the mainland. Most had no ability to communicate with the ship via radio. “We were using hand signals to the pilots to control where they landed on the flight deck,” Jumper recalled 35 years later. Sailors and aircrews also communicated via signal flags and colored signal lamps—red, don’t land; green, OK to land. </span></p>



<p>Every pilot managed his fuel and waited patiently for his turn. At one point, Jumper and his assistant, Cmdr. Pete Theodorelos, counted 26 helicopters circling the carrier while sailors assisted waves of arriving passengers. As soon as a chopper’s rotors stopped twirling, sailors pushed it away from the action, using small rectangular tractors or brute manpower. By packing the incoming aircraft close together, they were able to recover them all. None had to ditch next to the carrier, but the flight deck soon filled to capacity.</p>

<p><b>Toward the end of that wild afternoon</b>, spotters on the carrier saw a tiny two-seat Cessna come into view. Through binoculars they counted at least four people in the plane, which had South Vietnamese markings. The Bird Dog began circling overhead with its landing lights switched on. Periodically the pilot rocked the plane’s wings. A Vietnamese translator was rushed to Primary Flight Control to join Jumper and Theodorelos in the ship’s tower, but attempts to radio the plane were met with static. From the bridge Chambers quickly consulted task force commander Adm. William Harris, who was at his battle station below deck.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The admiral ordered me to tell the Bird Dog to ditch,” Chambers later recalled. A helicopter could be dispatched to drop swimmers in the water and rescue the occupants. Other pilots flying choppers near the rest of the 7th Fleet were putting their aircraft into the sea. They hovered to drop passengers onto the fleet’s smaller ships, including destroyers and supply craft. When all passengers had safely left a chopper, the pilot would maneuver away and steer the machine on a course to safely ditch into open water. At the last moment he would jump clear of the rotors and drop into the sea, then swim toward the nearest vessel.</p>



<p><span>However, the fixed-wing Bird Dog couldn’t hover to drop off its passengers, and its fixed landing gear would cause the plane to flip onto its back as soon as the wheels touched the water. Only a well-trained crew member, properly strapped in, would get out alive. If the plane was ditched, the rest of its occupants had almost no chance. </span></p>



<p>“My judgment told me, if I didn’t give him a chance to land that he was going to crash it on the deck,” Chambers said.</p>



<p>As the Bird Dog circled, the pilot dropped three paper notes from the plane, but they blew over the side before the ship’s crew could snatch them. On the next pass he stuffed a fourth note into his pistol’s leather holster to weigh it down, and sailors rushed to grab the little package after it hit the deck. They read a scribbled message written on a crumpled chart of South Vietnam: Can you mouve [sic] these Helicopter to the other side, I can land on your runway, I can fly 1 hour more, we have enough time to mouve. Please rescue me. Major Buang wife and 5 child.</p>



<p>The message was quickly relayed to the bridge where Chambers was discussing the situation with Jumper over the phone. Ignoring pressure from the admiral, Chambers decided to do whatever was necessary to let the Bird Dog land, even if that meant throwing millions of dollars worth of equipment over the side and possibly being relieved of his command.</p>



<p>“Vern,” Chambers said into the phone, “give me a ready deck.” Jumper called for all available crewmen and volunteers to help prepare the angled flight deck for the Cessna. Meanwhile, with six boilers offline for maintenance, Chambers ordered his chief engineer to transfer the ship’s electric load to the emergency diesel engines and make steam for 25 knots (29 mph).</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="960" height="640" src="https://www.historynet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Nam-Cessna-down-960_640.jpg" alt="Sailors rushed to the deck to hold down Buang’s plane.

(USS Midway Museum)" srcset="https://www.historynet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Nam-Cessna-down-960_640.jpg 960w, https://www.historynet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Nam-Cessna-down-960_640-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.historynet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Nam-Cessna-down-960_640-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"></figure></div>



<p>The captain turned his ship into the wind to prepare for a fixed-wing landing. Fire crews readied their hoses and donned fire-retardant suits. Since the Bird Dog had no tail hook, sailors removed the four landing cables that normally spanned the runway. Other crew members leaned in together to heave three Hueys and one Chinook over the side. When their skids went over the flight deck’s edge, the empty choppers nosed up, twisted, then fell backward into the sea with big splashes.</p>



<p><span>Immediately, five more airborne Huey pilots took advantage of the cleared runway to land and disembark their passengers. Assuming he would be court martialed, Chambers ordered those helicopters thrown overboard as well. He later told interviewers that since he expected to be deposed by prosecutors, he turned away from the action to avoid seeing exactly how many were pushed into the sea. In the same interview Jumper also claimed not to know how many helicopters went overboard. </span></p>



<p><span>The old ship rattled and groaned as its speed increased. Jumper gave the green lamp signal to land. Buang made two practice passes over the ship to get a feel for the approach while translators—in English and Vietnamese—tried to warn him about the dangerous downdrafts that naturally occur behind the ship’s fantail. With no response, the crew could only watch, hoping that he would carry enough power to fly through that turbulence.</span></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="960" height="640" src="https://www.historynet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Buang-family-960_640.jpg" alt="South Vietnamese Major Buang and his family are escorted by a Marine Security Guard across the deck of the USS Midway in one of the most dramatic moments during operation Frequent Wind.

<p><span>Buang lowered the Bird Dog’s flaps and approached in a shallow descent at a speed of 60 knots (69 mph). With the ship providing an estimated 40 knots (46 mph) of headwind to aid the landing, the light plane slowly caught up. It seemed to flutter for a moment just above the deck, then bounced once in the landing area and rolled to a smooth stop in the middle of the runway.</span></p>



<p><span>Dozens of sailors ran toward the plane to grab it in case the aircraft’s momentum was enough to send it over the side, but the Bird Dog stayed where it had stopped. A hodgepodge of&nbsp;</span><span>squadron crew and ship’s company weighed the plane down with their bodies while Buang and his wife, carrying their youngest child, climbed out of the cockpit. He pulled forward the seat and out tumbled the other four children. Cheers rang out and sailors clapped while the family walked into the ship’s island. </span></p>



<p><span><b>Altogether, 71 American helicopters</b> flew a total of 662 sorties from Saigon to the 7th<span>&nbsp;</span>Fleet’s ships, rescuing more than 7,800 people. The 10 Air Force H-53s flew four round trips from the Midway to Saigon, evacuating more than 1,400 personnel from the start of the operation on the morning of April 29 until its end at 9 a.m. on April 30. Three hours later, South Vietnamese Gen. Duong Van Minh surrendered Saigon to North Vietnamese Col. Bui Tin, effectively ending the war—as well as the nation of South Vietnam.</span></p>



<p><span>The Bird Dog Buang-Ly flew that day now hangs at the National Naval Aviation Museum in Pensacola, Florida. Chambers kept his job as the aircraft carrier’s captain and was later promoted to rear admiral; he retired in 1984. Nobody was prosecuted for the estimated $10 million loss of the helicopters that Chambers ordered overboard. The Midway’s crew collected money to help ease the transition for the Buang family, who became seven of the estimated 130,000 refugees from the Vietnam War to eventually resettle in the United States. All seven are now naturalized American citizens. </span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/23/ai_developer_devin_poor_reviews/">https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/23/ai_developer_devin_poor_reviews/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42826022">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>A service described as "the first AI software engineer" appears to be rather bad at its job, based on a recent evaluation.</p>
<p>The auto-coder is called “Devin” and was <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cognition.ai/blog/introducing-devin">introduced</a> in March 2024. The bot’s creator, an outfit called Cognition AI, has made claims such as “Devin can build and deploy apps end to end," and "can autonomously find and fix bugs in codebases." The tool <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cognition.ai/blog/devin-generally-available">reached general availability</a> in December 2024, starting at $500 per month.</p>
<p>"Devin is an autonomous AI software engineer that can write, run and test code, helping software engineers work on personal tasks or their team projects," Cognition's <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://docs.devin.ai/get-started/devin-intro">documentation</a> declares. It "can review PRs, support code migrations, respond to on-call issues, build web applications, and even perform personal assistant tasks like ordering your lunch on DoorDash so you can stay locked in on your codebase."</p>

    

<p>The service uses Slack as its main interface for commands, which are sent to its computing environment, a Docker container that hosts a terminal, browser, code editor, and planner. The AI agent supports API integration with external services. This allows it, for example, to send email messages on a user's behalf via SendGrid.</p>

        


        

<p>Devin is a "<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cognition.ai/blog/evaluating-coding-agents">compound AI system</a>," meaning it relies on multiple underlying AI models, a set that has included OpenAI's GPT-4o and can be expected to evolve over time.</p>
<p>In theory, you should be able to ask it to undertake tasks like migrating code to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://nbdev.fast.ai/">nbdev</a>, a Jupyter Notebook development platform, and expect it to do so successfully. But that may be asking too much.</p>

        

<p>Early assessments of Devin have found problems. Cognition AI posted a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTS2Hz96HYQ">promo video</a> that supposedly showed the AI coder autonomously completing projects on the freelancer-for-hire platform Upwork. Software developer <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/carlbrown">Carl Brown</a> analyzed that vid and debunked it on his <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNmgmwEtoWE">Internet of Bugs YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>The software agent was also called out by another YouTube code pundit for allegedly including <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=927W6zzvV-c">critical security issues</a>.</p>
<p>Now, three data scientists affiliated with <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://answer.ai/">Answer.AI</a>, an AI research and development lab founded by Jeremy Howard and Eric Ries, have <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://devin.ai/">tested Devin</a> and found it completed just three out of 20 tasks successfully.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/22/datacenter_emissions_not_accurate/">Analysts say real datacenter emissions are a dirty secret</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/22/business_value_genai_elusive/">Business value from GenAI remains elusive despite IT spending boom</a></li>

</ul>
<p>In an <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.answer.ai/posts/2025-01-08-devin.html#what-is-devin">analysis</a> conducted earlier this month by <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://hamel.dev/">Hamel Husain</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://isaac-flath.github.io/website/blog.html">Isaac Flath</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://johnowhitaker.dev/">Johno Whitaker</a>, Devin started well, successfully pulling data from a Notion database into Google Sheets. The AI agent also managed to create a planet tracker for checking claims about the historical positions of Jupiter and Saturn.</p>
<p>But as the three researchers continued their testing, they encountered problems.</p>

        

<p>"Tasks that seemed straightforward often took days rather than hours, with Devin getting stuck in technical dead-ends or producing overly complex, unusable solutions," the researchers explain in their report. "Even more concerning was Devin’s tendency to press forward with tasks that weren’t actually possible."</p>
<p>As an example, they cited how Devin, when asked to deploy multiple applications to the infrastructure deployment platform <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://railway.com/">Railway</a>, failed to understand this wasn't supported and spent more than a day trying approaches that didn't work and hallucinating non-existent features.</p>
<p>Of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.answer.ai/posts/2025-01-08-devin.html#appendix-tasks-attempted-with-devin">20 tasks presented to Devin</a>, the AI software engineer completed just three of them satisfactorily – the two cited above and a third challenge to research how to build a Discord bot in Python. Three other tasks produced inconclusive results, and 14 projects were outright failures.</p>
<p>The researchers said that Devin provided a polished user experience that was impressive when it worked.</p>
<p>"But that’s the problem – it rarely worked," they wrote.</p>
<p>"More concerning was our inability to predict which tasks would succeed. Even tasks similar to our early wins would fail in complex, time-consuming ways. The autonomous nature that seemed promising became a liability – Devin would spend days pursuing impossible solutions rather than recognizing fundamental blockers."</p>
<p>Cognition AI did not respond to a request for comment. ®</p>

    <span>“</span> 
     One of those terrible ideas that I am so glad someone tried
    <span>”</span>
  </p>

  <p>- Some guy on reddit</p> 

</div>

<h2 id="but-why">But… Why?</h2>

<p>TL;DR Well, the Steam Deck didn’t fit in my backpack…</p>

<p>The Steam Deck has been a game changer for travel, but I found myself leaving it behind more often than not, as it wouldn’t fit in my backpack, took up a huge amount of carry-on space, and was a hassle to bring down from the overhead compartment when I wanted to use it.
When I did use the Deck, it was either plugged in to AR Glasses (<a href="https://amzn.to/3CpmMgW">XReal Air 2 Pro</a>) or plugged in to a TV. So, I got to thinking: it could be so much smaller and lighter without the build in controller and screen, but that would be ridiculous, right? …right?</p>

<h2 id="️-disclaimer">⚠️ Disclaimer</h2>
<p>“I am not a smart man”</p>

<p>This project was not approved or endorsed in any way by Valve and is generally a very bad idea. I’m honestly surprised it worked and have no idea how long the modified console will survive. The following is provided “as is” and without any expressed or implied warranty. If you choose to attempt this do so at your own risk. Be warned that are likely to “brick” (as in destroy, but pun intended) your console and you might get hurt in the process (lithium batteries and power tools are dangerous, among other things).</p>

<p>This is not a guide, more of a “how I did it”. If there’s enough interest, I might expand this to a more step-by-step style write-up. Until then, feel free to reach out via the <a href="https://github.com/crastinator-pro/steam-brick/issues">issues page</a> page or on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Crastinator_Pro/s/F3Rk6jFndK">reddit</a> if you have any questions. If you’d like to support the project, consider using the affiliate links included on this page.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p><img src="https://github.com/crastinator-pro/steam-brick/blob/main/images/meme.jpg?raw=true" alt="Meme: &quot;screens? where we're going we don't need screens!&quot;"></p>

<p>First of all – huge shoutout to iFixIt for their great <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Steam_Deck">Steam Deck Repair Guides</a> as well as to Valve for supporting the DIY repair and mod community!</p>

<p>This mod was performed on a <a href="https://amzn.to/40MP0f7">1TB OLED Steam Deck</a>, there are some differences between the OLED and LCD models.</p>

<p>The first hurdle on this ridiculous road was figuring out if the Steam Deck would even boot without any peripherals or a screen attached. Working off the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Steam+Deck+Battery+Replacement/149070">battery replacement</a> and <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Steam+Deck+Motherboard+Replacement/148928">motherboard replacement</a> tutorials was able disconnect everything from the motherboard other than the fan – success!
In this state the Deck will boot output display over USB and accept peripherals via an external dock.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/crastinator-pro/steam-brick/blob/main/images/poc.jpg?raw=true" alt="POC: Deck running with bare motherboard"></p>

<h2 id="internals">Internals</h2>

<p>This initial teardown also revealed a useful aluminum(?) frame, unfortunately, you’ll have to remove the screen [link] to remove it from the shell. This shell had some unnecessary “wings” so of course they had to be removed with a rotary tool. With the excess metal removed, I had the perfect internal frame for the Brick.</p>

<p>Note that some of the fan and motherboard cover screws are outer-shell screws which must be added back so everything is properly held in place.</p>

<img src="https://github.com/crastinator-pro/steam-brick/blob/main/images/removed_metal.jpg?raw=true" alt="removed material"></p>

<p>I probably should have removed or masked out the fan before grinding away the metal…</p>

<h2 id="case">Case</h2>

<p>Using my limited CAD abilities, I designed a rudimentary shell for the Brick. The shell has two pegs to align the board and you can add a dollop of PLA with a 3d printing pen to further secure the board to the case. There’s a cutout in the case to accommodate the original power button, and the air intake is sized to accept the metal grill from the original back shell.</p>

<p>I printed out the case in Overture Polycarbonate Pro (PC) [link] which <em>should</em> be  heat-resistant enough not to melt while the deck attempts to run Cyberpunk 2077. Color accents were added in PLA with a 3D printing pen.</p>

<h2 id="result">Result</h2>

<p><img src="https://github.com/crastinator-pro/steam-brick/blob/main/images/IMG_3315.jpg?raw=true" alt="Result and setup"></p>

<p>And there it is, in all its glory: the Steam Brick!
About a 3rd of the size of the Deck, and about 4 times smaller than the Deck’s OEM case. As a bonus, it’s also 24% lighter!</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>Why remove the screen? It wouldn’t have made the build larger!</strong></p>

<p>Keeping the screen would have significantly complicated the build, as you’d need something to keep in in place. More importantly – the brick was built to be tossed in a bag as-is. No case, no screen protector, just throw it in a backpack or suitcase and don’t worry about it!</p>

<p><strong>Why did you do this again?</strong></p>

<p>Because I was so preoccupied with whether or not I could that I didn’t stop to think if I should.</p>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p>The build includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>4x 3M heat set inserts</li>

<ul>
  <li>Accessing the BIOS is currently impossible as it requires holding down the ‘+’ button while powering up, and that button isn’t included in the build. Haven’t found a workaround yet.</li>
  <li>It’s difficult to tell if the Brick is on or not – as the Deck’s indicator light doesn’t indicate on/off status</li>

He said AI will usher in a new era of surveillance that he gleefully said will ensure "citizens will be on their best behavior."</p><p>Ellison made the comments as he spoke to investors earlier this week during an Oracle financial analysts meeting, where he shared his thoughts on the future of AI-powered surveillance tools.</p><!-- Excluded mobile ad on desktop --><p>Ellison said AI would be used in the future to constantly watch and analyze vast surveillance systems, like security cameras, police body cameras, doorbell cameras, and vehicle dashboard cameras.</p><p>"We're going to have supervision," Ellison said. "Every police officer is going to be supervised at all times, and if there's a problem, AI will report that problem and report it to the appropriate person. Citizens will be on their best behavior because we are constantly recording and reporting everything that's going on."</p><p>Ellison also expects AI drones to replace police cars in high-speed chases. "You just have a drone follow the car," Ellison said. "It's very simple in the age of autonomous drones." He did not say if those drones would broadcast the chases on network news.</p><!-- Excluded mobile ad on desktop --><p>Ellison's company, Oracle, like almost every company these days, is aggressively pursuing opportunities in the AI industry. It already has several projects in the works, including one in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-larry-ellison-team-up-ai-farming-tool-starlink-2024-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">partnership with Elon Musk's SpaceX</a>.</p><p>Ellison is the world's sixth-richest man with a net worth of $157 billion, according to Bloomberg. </p><p>Ellison's children have made names for themselves in the film industry. His daughter Megan Ellison founded <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/larry-ellison-daughter-megan-ellison-annapurna-video-games-staff-revolt-2024-9" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">her production company Annapurna Pictures</a> in 2011, and his son David Ellison is set to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/paramount-global-agrees-to-merge-with-skydance-shari-redstone-2024-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">become CEO of Paramount</a> after it completes its merger with Skydance Media.</p>
