<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>The path to creative mastery begins with years of silence. Publish anyway.</p><hr><p>Most things take <em>forever</em> to bear fruit.</p>
<p>Even the most successful creators have spent years (if not decades) putting content out in obscurity. Just a complete total void. Youtube videos with 4 views. Newsletters with 3 subscribers. Podcasts with 10 listeners. Blogs with 6 readers. Songs with 4 downloads. No one but their parents and their spouse consuming their work. And sometimes not even that.</p>
<p>If you’re in it purely for the promised land of love, praise, followers, and fame from millions of people - it’s impossible to sustain. In every field, it takes years of practice, repetition, and “failed performances” before the first hit. In the worst case, artists go their entire life without ever receiving the praise they deserved. Look at Van Gogh - an incredible artist who died unappreciated &amp; broke, in a mental asylum. All of his fame came after his death.</p>
<hr>
<h3>So how do you keep going?</h3>
<p>How do you keep hitting that publish button, over and over again, knowing there’s no one on the other side?</p>
<p>I don’t know. I’m still trying to figure it out.</p>
<p>But I have come across a few frameworks and quotes that I’ve found useful, so I’m sharing them below.</p>
<hr>
<h3>1 — Do things you like, and sometimes the world will agree</h3>
<p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBATMZSVPOw&amp;t=1171s&amp;ab_channel=MyFirstMillion">interview between Shaan Puri and Mike Posner</a> is awesome. In it, Mike talks about his (seemingly) sudden rise to stardom, the rapid fall, and the slow climb back.</p>
<p>After writing music for 10 years — since the age of 6 — Mike’s single <em>Cooler Than Me</em> blew up. No one other than his mom had heard any of his previous songs. <em>Cooler Than Me</em> hit #6 on the Billboard Top 100 — while he was still in college at Duke.</p>
<p>Mike spent the next 7 years trying to chase the same hit, and every song ended up worse than the last. The chase pushed him into depression, drugs, a near-fatal snake bite, a walking journey across the US, and climbing Everest.</p>
<p>Ultimately, he came out with a much healthier attitude (that led to more hits).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do things that you like, and sometimes the world will agree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of chasing hits, Mike only produces music he likes.
Music he thinks is good.<br>
<!-- -->Music he’d listen to.<br>
<!-- -->Music that’s a hit for <strong>him</strong>.</p>
<p>And sometimes, the world agrees.</p>
<hr>
<h3>2 — Push yourself out</h3>
<p>Similar to Mike Posner’s mindset: Instead of trying to figure out <em>what your audience likes</em>, just create what <strong>you</strong> like.</p>
<p>That’ll help sustain motivation when your audience doesn’t really exist. You’ll be more likely to push through plateaus, and you’ll enjoy the process. You’ll also just produce <em>better</em> work.</p>
<p>Best of all? It’ll attract like-minded followers — people who love the work <em>you</em> like to create.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your audience is just <strong>you</strong>, pushed outwards.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3>3 — Build your Binge Bank</h3>
<p>Instead of being disappointed when no one consumes your content, treat these initial pieces of content as an investment. An investment in your <strong>Binge Bank</strong>. What’s that?</p>
<p>Your Binge Bank is the collection of content that your <em>future</em> fans will want to consume. It’s the rabbit hole of content they'll go down. Your audience might not exist now, but when it does in the future (and you can bet it will), they’ll want to go back in time and see everything you’ve produced.</p>
<p>This is why YouTubers with millions of followers have hundreds of thousands of views on their first few videos. Those videos didn’t get any views when they were first published. They were revisited <em>after</em> they became famous, by their most loyal fans.</p>
<hr>
<p>So if you (like me) are publishing into obscurity, this is your gentle reminder.</p>
<p>Keep going.</p></article></div></div>]]></description>

See episode eight, which finds Jack battling a copy of himself — made from his own anger. Lingering shots of trees on fire, gorgeously painted, punctuate the fight.</span></p><p>Toward the end, Jack realizes that his emotions are out of control. We cut to a burning tree again, and the camera moves in closer, up to the bark. Then the flames stop, and the tree dissolves, and a calm waterfall appears. After almost a minute and 20 seconds of no talking (and no characters on screen), we snap to Jack’s face. Yet a story’s been told.</p><p><span>This stuff asked a lot of the kids in Cartoon Network’s audience. Tartakovsky was defiant about it. “I’ve always felt that kids are a lot smarter than we’ve given them credit for, but we’ve never given them a chance to figure things out as they’re watching television,” he said in one interview. Elsewhere: “as long as I can make films, I’ll always treat kids as adults and at the same intelligence level as I am.”</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-158580375" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-visual-world-of-samurai-jack#footnote-3-158580375" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span></p><p><span>The network execs gave him that freedom. Mike Lazzo greenlit the show’s loose, bare pitch over dinner. Linda Simensky explained, “Genndy had done such a good job up until that point — if there was anyone we could trust, it was Genndy.”</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-158580375" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-visual-world-of-samurai-jack#footnote-4-158580375" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span></p><p>In fact, she said, “[W]e were really just excited about the fact that it was so different and so unusual.”</p><p><span>Tartakovsky’s team put together a test for </span><em>Samurai Jack</em><span> (</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0g8zOF7RCQ" rel="">watch</a><span>), animated by the outsource crew in Korea. The higher-ups didn’t </span><em>request</em><span> a test, but Tartakovsky wanted proof. “[I]t came back. And it </span><em>worked</em><span>,” he remembered. Two minutes of wordless action and atmosphere held up. Something similar happened with episode one:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>… luckily for us, the overseas </em><span>[team]</span><em> did an amazing job, and the first episode came back, and I remember being like, “Wow. There’s something here.” ... And the first episode was so silent, too, ‘cause we had that whole flashback sequence ... Mike Lazzo and Linda Simensky ... </em><span>[go in to watch it]</span><em>, and then you’re sitting in this little editing office … and it’s complete silence. ... I’m looking at them, and they don’t have any expression on their faces. And I go, “Wow.” Then I start sweating.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>He figured the show was dead — but the execs were fascinated. “Speechless” was the word Lazzo used.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5-158580375" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-visual-world-of-samurai-jack#footnote-5-158580375" target="_self" rel="">5</a></span><span> This huge, costly experiment in visual storytelling went ahead.</span></p><p><span>Tartakovsky credits a lot of </span><em>Samurai Jack</em><span>’s success to art director Scott Wills. “It really came together when [he] came aboard. ‘Cause when Scott started to paint, all of a sudden, we had lighting, we had mood and atmosphere,” he said in the 2000s.</span></p><p><span>These things were critical for the show. Again: images couldn’t carry without depth and richness. Tartakovsky was looking at live-action movies from the ‘60s and ‘70s — </span><em>Doctor Zhivago</em><span>, </span><em>Lawrence of Arabia</em><span>, Kurosawa films.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-158580375" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-visual-world-of-samurai-jack#footnote-6-158580375" target="_self" rel="">6</a></span><span> Another main influence was Hayao Miyazaki’s work. As Tartakovsky said, films like these:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>… really made the background a character. ... It all kind of came down to filmmaking with me. Because usually we are drawing these backgrounds and they’ll just get a pan and then we’ll just go to the next sequence. I wanted to do, maybe, a minute or two sequence of just establishing the environment. You really get to feel where Jack is … It’s like watching </em><span>Lawrence of Arabia</span><em>, you really </em><span>feel</span><em> that desert. And it’s a really cool feeling and so I thought, “Ah, how much cooler would you feel if you’re looking at these great drawings with this really unique color and a great mood?”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>He wanted to treat background paintings like classic movies treat landscapes — which wasn’t </span><em>done</em><span> on American television. But </span><em>Samurai Jack</em><span> did it. And Wills’ painting techniques (which we covered </span><a href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/i/162725246/painting-the-samurai-jack-way" rel="">in a recent issue</a><span>) made it possible.</span></p><p>The style was unique. Wills took from mid-century cartoons — the abstract geometry and color — and blended them with other things. He wanted to “combine everything that’s good about realistic painting and feature [animation] painting, and everything that’s good about [UPA-type] stylization,” he said. The idea was to “have cinematic lighting, with mood and depth, but at the same time have it feel stylized.”</p><p><span>For the backgrounds to remain engaging across the series, freshness mattered: there were frequent new locations and surprising color choices. “We’d have … a rule: no green grass, no blue sky,” Tartakovsky recalled.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7-158580375" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-visual-world-of-samurai-jack#footnote-7-158580375" target="_self" rel="">7</a></span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3807719,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://animationobsessive.substack.com/i/158580375?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>Stills from </span><em>Samurai Jack</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>And all of this stuff had to be handled delicately, for technical reasons. </p><p><em>Samurai Jack</em><span> doesn’t use black outlines for its characters.

            <guid>44150803</guid>
            <pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 13:42:49 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://stefan-gloor.ch/yomani-hack">https://stefan-gloor.ch/yomani-hack</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44150803">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>In this project, I started to reverse engineer payment card
        terminals because they seemed to be an interesting target for security
        research, given the high stakes involved. Although I initially didn’t
        knew much about this industry, I did expect a ton of security features
        and a very security-hardened device. And to some degree, this was also
        correct.</p>
        <h2>First Look</h2>
        <p>The model I went with is a Worldline Yomani XR terminal. Although it
        seems to be discontinued at the time of writing, this is the model that
        is <i>everywhere</i> in Switzerland. From big grocery chains to the
        small repair shop on the corner, everyone has one or a whole fleet of
        this exact terminal.</p>
        <p>After booting it up and aimlessly clicking through the UI, I did a
        quick port scan, but couldn’t find anything interesting. So naturally,
        I started to take it apart.</p>
        <div>
          <figure>
            <a href="https://stefan-gloor.ch/img/yomani_pcb.jpg"><img src="https://stefan-gloor.ch/img/yomani_pcb.jpg" width="100%" alt="Picture of the main PCB of the Yomani XR terminal with annotation of different board components."></a>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>The housing and the PCBs appear to be well-made. The design consists
        of multiple PCBs: a small connector board for the outward-facing
        connectors, the main board, and a vertical board the card slot sits on.
        The main SoC seems to be a custom ASIC, a dual-core Arm processor
        code-named “Samoa II” in the firmware, but I am jumping ahead.
        According to Worldline documentation, this seems to indeed be a custom
        ASIC, rather than just a rebranded off-the-shelf chip. Next to it,
        there is a small external flash and RAM.</p>
        <h2>Tamper Protections</h2>
        <p>During disassembly, I kept looking for a tamper switch that would
        detect when the device’s housing was opened, like I had seen previously
        on laptops and other devices. However, I couldn’t find such a switch.
        Rather, they use the board-to-board interconnects as a way of detecting
        when the device is opened. Because they use relatively
        pressure-sensitive Zebra strips between the boards, they have to be
        tightly screwed together. Even unscrewing some of the screws is enough
        to break contact and trigger a tamper event. Of course, the tamper
        detection must also work when the power is disconnected, so that’s the
        purpose of the coin cell battery.</p>
        <p>But this is not all in terms of tamper resistance: The “vulnerable”
        PCBs are covered by zick-zack traces that act as a tamper detection
        mechanism. Accidentally breaking a single copper trace during a
        physical penetration attempt (hole drill etc.) is enough to trigger the
        tamper detection.</p>
        <div>
          <figure>

            <figcaption>

            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>The card slot itself is contained in an additional, internal
        housing. Wrapped around this housing, there is a flex PCB acting as
        tamper protection.</p>
        <div>
          <figure>
            <a href="https://stefan-gloor.ch/img/yomani_mesh.jpg"><img src="https://stefan-gloor.ch/img/yomani_mesh.jpg" width="100%" alt="Inner plastic housing is wrapped in a flex PCB with zick zack traces, acting as a temper detection mechanism."></a>
            <figcaption>

            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>After putting the device back together, it was clear that my
        intrusion had not gone undetected. Sure enough, the device would now
        only show a big red screen screaming “TAMPER DETECTED”. In this mode,
        the device seems to be fully unresponsive to any kind of external
        input. So, game over?</p>

        <h2>Chip-Off Firmware Extraction</h2>
        <p>Since any “runtime” exploration seems to be futile now, I wanted to
        take a look a the firmware. For this, I desoldered the on-board flash
        chip, soldered some wires to it in “dead bug” style and proceeded to
        dump the contents.</p>
        <div>
          <figure>
            <a href="https://stefan-gloor.ch/img/yomani_chipoff.jpg"><img src="https://stefan-gloor.ch/img/yomani_chipoff.jpg" width="100%" alt="Flash chip in BGA housing mounted upside-down on a perfboard. Thin copper wires are connected from the chip’s contacts to a flash reader."></a>
            <figcaption>
              BGA flash chip of the card terminal desoldered and connected to a
              flash reader.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>To my surprise, the contents seemed to be entirely unencrypted!
        However, the contents seemed to have a strange ECC layout. Instead of
        following the flash chip’s inherent page layout and putting the ECC
        data in the interleaved spare areas, it appeared as if the some ECC
        data was present in the page and some clear text was in the spare
        areas. With the help of some friends, I figured out the layout: instead
        of using the standard 2048 byte payload + 64 byte ECC/spare layout, it
        uses 3x 694 byte chunks of data each followed by 10 ECC bytes. The ECC
        bytes do not appear to be all used. Instead, the last 16 bytes of the
        spare area seem to act as metadata for the YAFFS2 file system. Now
        normally, there are less ECC bytes per page and therefore the usable
        metadata area for the filesystem is larger than 16 bytes. For this
        reason, the YAFFS2 filesystem had to be patched to work with smaller
        metadata structures.</p>
        <p>I implemented a compatible filesystem reader and with it, I could
        successfully dump the filesystem contents!</p>
        
        <p>Now it was clear that this device runs Linux. I found a standard
        Linux filesystem with a lot of interesting files to browse through. The
        system runs a 3.6 kernel, built with Buildroot 2010.02 (!) in February
        of 2023. The system seems to use a custom bootloader, “Booter v1.7”.
        Although I don’t know how recent the firware version was that I ended
        up dumping, it must have been released after February 2023. So finding
        such an ancient kernel is rather concerning. Userspace-wise, the system
        uses classy init scripts, busybox, and uClibc (final release was 13
        years ago). libcrypt has version 0.9.26, ouch.</p>
        <h2>Finding a Root Shell on Accident</h2>
        <p>Having seen the firmware gave me some new confidence that there
        might be more stuff to find. So I reattached the flash chip using
        wires, ignoring everything I know about signal integrity. To my
        surprise the device booted up again (showing the tamper message).</p>

        <p>My next goal was it to find the serial console of the Linux system.
        Surely, it must have one for debugging. By looking at a boot log, I
        might get some more valuable information. So, equipped with a logic
        analyzer, I started poking.</p>

samoa login: 
</pre>
        <p>It even shows a login prompt, neat! So this is definitely the Linux
        boot log. Many embedded Linux systems will have such a more or less
        exposed serial console, but most of the time the login is disabled
        altogether or a random, hard-to-crack password is either hard-coded or
        generated at boot. Not expecting much, just out of curiosity, I entered
        “root” as the login, and...</p>
        <pre>samoa login: root
~ #
</pre>
        <p>Wait, what!? That’s it? I’m in?</p>
        <p>Well, yes. That was the boring story of how I got the root shell. It
        is just there, exposed. No sophisticated exploit chain, no brute-force
        password cracking required. Additionally, everything seems to still
        work although the device still shows the tamper message.</p>
        <p>Now you may say: well okay, that’s not ideal, but in order to get
        access to the exposed root shell, you need to open up the device, which
        triggers the tamper protection and effectively renders the device
        useless. But in fact, the <b>serial port is accessible from the
        outside!</b>. Without opening up the device and triggering the tamper
        protection, the debug connector can be accessed through a little hatch
        on the back of the device. All an attacker needs is just 30 seconds
        alone with the device to attach to the serial port, log in, deploy
        malware, and leave. This sounds really bad.</p>

          </div>
          <p>Actually, no. Hear me out: During my analysis of this device, it
          became clear that the Linux system is not the whole story. For
          example, there seems to be no graphics driver for the display and the
          only framebuffer device does not seem to do anything. Instead, only
          text strings seem to be passed to a binary
          (<code>display_tool</code>), that issues some inter-processor
          messages. The same goes for the key pad or the card reader itself. I
          could not find any evidence that these peripherals could be accessed
          directly from Linux.</p>
          <p>Instead, there is an entirely separate processor, refered to as
          <code>mp1</code>, that seems to handle all the “secure” stuff, like
          handling the card, getting the pin and showing information on the
          screen. The “insecure” Linux, running on the second processor,
          <code>mp2</code>, only handles the networking, the updating, and the
          business logic.</p>
          <p>The Linux core seems to always boot, regardless of the tamper
          state. From there, the secure core is booted. For this, Linux
          apparently loads a secure bootloader (named <code>loadercode</code>)
          into memory. This loadercode checks whether the tamper protections
          have been triggered and based on the result, either show the red
          screen or continue to boot the actual “secure” image
          (<code>mp1.img</code>, in the Linux filesystem). This secure image
          seems to be properly encrypted and signed by two entities.</p>

                always boots Linux, which in turn loads a secure bootloader and
                the secure image on the second core. The loadercode is what
                displays the tamper messages on screen. The secure image, that
                handles the card, display, and key pad, is properly encrypted
                and signed.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>While concerning, the exposed root shell does not seem to be as
          big of a risk as initially feared.
			While still being a huge unnecessary attack surface, and a massive oversight from the engineers in my opinion,
			I could not find any evidence that sensitive data, such as card details, could become compromised this way.
			Also, I could not definitively proof which firmware versions were vulnerable. During my research, I also encountered devices that
			had a disabled root login. My guess is that somehow this debug feature accidentally made it into production firmware at some point.
			Chances are that this was discovered and fixed internally before I reported it to the manufacturer (as I had no way of updating the firmware,
			or verifying that I was running the latest firmware).</p>
			<p>
			This project was a lot of fun and I wish I had some more time to dig deeper into the firmware and explore more possibilities.
			If you want to take on this challenge, feel free to reach out to me.
			I’d like to thank anyone involved in this project for their valuable input.

   <p>KYIV, Ukraine — A Ukrainian drone attack has destroyed more than 40 Russian planes deep in Russia's territory, a Ukrainian security official told The Associated Press on Sunday, while Russia pounded Ukraine with missiles and drones a day before the two sides meet for a new round of direct talks in Istanbul.</p>   <p>The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose operational details, said the attack took over 1 1/2-year to execute and was personally supervised by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>   <p>The operation saw drones transported in containers carried by trucks deep into Russian territory, he said. The drones hit airfields including the Belaya air base in Russia's Irkutsk region, more than 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles) from Ukraine. It is the first time that a Ukrainian drone has been seen in the region, local Gov. Igor Kobzeva said, stressing that it did not present a threat to civilians.</p>   
   <p>The attack was disclosed on the same day as Zelenskyy said Ukraine will send a delegation to Istanbul for a new round of direct peace talks with Russia on Monday.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5419509-100" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>In a statement on Telegram, Zelenskyy said that Defense Minister Rustem Umerov will lead the Ukrainian delegation. "We are doing everything to protect our independence, our state and our people," Zelenskyy said.</p>   <p>Ukrainian officials had previously called on the Kremlin to provide a promised memorandum setting out its position on ending the war before the meeting takes place. Moscow had said it would share its memorandum during the talks.</p>   <h2>Russian strike hits an army unit</h2>   <p>Russia on Sunday launched the biggest number of drones — 472 — on Ukraine since the full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine's air force said.</p>   <p>Russian forces also launched seven missiles alongside the barrage of drones, said Yuriy Ignat, head of communications for the air force. Earlier Sunday, Ukraine's army said at least 12 Ukrainian service members were killed and more than 60 were injured in a Russian missile strike on an army training unit.</p>   <p>The strike occurred at 12:50 p.m., the statement said, emphasizing that no formations or mass gatherings of personnel were being held at the time. An investigative commission was created to uncover the circumstances around the attack that led to such a loss in personnel, the statement said.</p>   
   <p>The training unit is located to the rear of the 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) active front line, where Russian reconnaissance and strike drones are able to strike.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5419509-101" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Ukraine's forces suffer from manpower shortages and take extra precautions to avoid mass gatherings as the skies across the front line are saturated with Russian drones looking for targets.</p>   <p>"If it is established that the actions or inaction of officials led to the death or injury of servicemen, those responsible will be held strictly accountable," the Ukrainian Ground Forces' statement said.</p>   <h2>Northern pressure</h2>   <p>Russia's Ministry of Defense said Sunday that it had taken control of the village of Oleksiivka in Ukraine's northern Sumy region. Ukrainian authorities in Sumy ordered mandatory evacuations in 11 more settlements Saturday as Russian forces make steady gains in the area.</p>   <p>Speaking Saturday, Ukraine's top army chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said that Russian forces were focusing their main offensive efforts on Pokrovsk, Toretsk and Lyman in the Donetsk region, as well as the Sumy border area.</p>

Sadly it retained the rather large key sizes of the earlier ST models, making typos too easy. It also had the connection for the mouse and joystick under the keyboard, which kept things neat and tidy but was a major pain to connect in the first place. The low profile of the case also meant that the disk drive slot would bump into the keyboard if the two were close together.</p><p><span>Overall, I’d say the keyboard is a solid B+ and it is a sought-after keyboard today for its reliability. This keyboard also </span><a href="https://www.goto10retro.com/p/10-secrets-of-the-atari-mega-ste" rel="">works great with the Mega STE</a><span> and I’d love to get my hands on one.</span></p><p>Other case differences include a built-in fan and a built-in battery-backed clock that ran on simple AA batteries. The fan was probably not really needed, but it likely improved reliability.</p><p>As far as technical specifications, the Mega ST did not have many advantages over a standard 1040ST. Its main improvement was that it had a blitter chip that could move data in memory around fast, which was great for graphics processing.  The Mega ST was the first to include TOS 1.02, which was the first update to TOS in ROM and included several bug fixes.</p><p><span>Perhaps the biggest “innovation” was the RAM. The Mega ST was available with 2MB or 4MB of RAM</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-159691277" href="https://www.goto10retro.com/p/atari-means-business-with-the-mega#footnote-1-159691277" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span>, an enormous amount in 1987. This much RAM was a game-changer for developers and desktop publishing.</span></p><p>Lastly there was an internal bus connector slot, which ended up not really being all that important. The only thing I know that used it were some hard drive kits that would provide a way to squeeze the hard drive inside the Mega ST case. This points out a problem in the case design: it was just too short and didn’t have much room for anything else to be in there.</p><p>It would have made sense for Atari to sell an internal hard drive upgrade for the Mega ST, but instead they sold a separate external hard drive, the MegaFile, that you could place under the Mega ST. Modular perhaps, but more expensive and messier than an internal solution that would also not have external cables or a power supply.</p><p>By far the biggest technical limitation was that the Mega ST ran at the same speed at the 520ST and 1040ST: 8Mhz. The blitter certainly could speed up the display operations of some apps, but the Mega ST basically ran everything at the same speed as the older and much cheaper STs.</p><p>The Mega ST was often promoted in combination with the SLM804 Laser Printer as a complete desktop publishing solution for just $3000 to $4000. At the time this was touted as a full system at the same price as just the laser printer for a Macintosh.</p><p>I don’t recall seeing Atari specifically market the Mega ST to developers, but I suspect a lot of developers found the better keyboard and extra RAM to be worth the upgrade.</p><p><span>In general, I think Atari had a tough time selling such an expensive product</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-159691277" href="https://www.goto10retro.com/p/atari-means-business-with-the-mega#footnote-2-159691277" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span>. Even in 1987, the Atari brand was closely associated with video games and inexpensive computers. Trying to use the Atari brand for more expensive computers aimed at businesses was always going to be difficult. After all, many business would definitely balk at having the Atari label on their desks.</span></p><p>Although I never owned a Mega ST, my Dad did have a Mega ST 2. Since he also had the SC1224 color monitor, I would sometimes use it to play games. I remember hogging his Mega ST to play Dungeon Master quite often. I also remember that the keyboard was really nice and miles better than the one on my 1040ST. He also had an external hard drive, which he was able to place under the Mega ST.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg" width="1042" height="754" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/af783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:754,&quot;width&quot;:1042,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:221734,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.goto10retro.com/i/159691277?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>My Dad’s Mega ST2 setup from the early 90s</figcaption></figure></div><p>The Mega ST was not a huge success for Atari. Although it was announced in early 1987, systems did not start shipping until late 1987 with most not shipping until 1988. The problem was the extra RAM. The Mega ST used 1Mbit DRAM, which actually had a significant price increase and shortage due to tariffs on overseas DRAM.

In this interview, he talks about the transition of this creative field from film to digital, bridging the gap between feature films and episodic productions, learning from different cultures, and what advice he’d give to his younger self. Between all these and more, Christophe dives deep into his work on the second season of “Andor”.</p>

<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: Please tell us about yourself and the path that took you to where you are today.</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: I finished a trade school as a general electrician, but I wanted to do something more, and I went to film school. During your first year you can choose between editing, sound and image – which is light and camera. So we had our first workshop, and I had the camera in my hands, and I knew this was it. I really loved the mix of technical and creative.</p>
<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: Do you feel that you can teach the technical part, but the artistic part comes from within a person, and if one doesn’t have it, it can’t be learned?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: No, I think you can teach both. When I was growing up, I didn’t have a lot of cultural influences in my life, at home or at school. It is something that I grew over the years. When I started at the film school, I noticed that I needed to catch up on it. I spent a lot of evenings around that time watching movies with my friends, and it grew on me.</p>
<p>You can cultivate it the same way you cultivate the technical skills. There are also people who are more artistic than technical. Maybe I am more naturally inclined to be better at the technical side, but I grew and worked on my creative side over the years. I really believe you can grow the creative part of your brain.</p>
<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: Is there such a thing as universally good art vs universally bad art, or is it all subjective?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: It’s subjective. There’s so many forms and styles of art. And that is good, because there’s something for everybody. Everything can be art, and people with different taste can find things that they appreciate.</p>

<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: Was film still a thing when you were in film school?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: We did most of our projects on 16mm, either Bolex or Arriflex SR2. We did a few things on video, but it was really basic at the time. I remember those assignments to film something and edit it ourselves, and it was a nightmare. The computers were slow, the Video cards didn’t work, the software was basic. It’s incredible to see how all of that progressed since then. These days I teach at that same school, and the difference is night and day. They can edit it in DaVinci, they can grade it, and it’s so accessible. Sometimes I’m a bit jealous to see that [laughs].</p>
<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: How was the transition from film to digital for you after you finished the film school?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: When I graduated, most of the productions were still on film. I was exposed to both mediums, and I’m happy about it. I know how to light for film. I still have an analog still camera, and I use it a lot.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I’m so happy that the digital revolution happened. It’s a bigger toolbox for your creativity, especially for night scenes. It’s much easier to light something natural, and to do something with less. I started my career in Belgium, and it’s a smaller market with smaller budgets for TV shows and films – but you still want to make good things. I did a TV show called “Cordon” about 10 years ago. It was an ambitious project for its small budget, and that project started my international career. I don’t think it would have been possible to make that project on film. We had a lot of night scenes on it, and it’s so much different to light a night scene on a digital camera.</p>

<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: There’s a lot of ongoing technological advances in the field, from lights to lenses to sensors. Is it hard to stay up to date on all the latest developments?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: Not for me, because that’s my technical side that I’m interested in. I follow everything, and if there’s something new, I want to test it. But at the same time, I’m a fan of old glass. I like to dig into old equipment and to test new equipment.</p>
<p>Right now there’s a lot of interesting things happening with lights. Camera sensors are getting bigger and we’re getting more pixels, but I don’t think it matters that much. And the camera sensibility has been at a good level for a while now. The latest breakthroughs are all in the LED light space. I used a lot of LED lights on “Andor”. All the lights are RGBW (red, green, blue, white), and you can choose any color you want. There’s someone next to you controlling those lights on their iPad, and you’re almost painting the scene with these controllable lights. You can control the color of each one, you can control the intensity of each one, and you can do it all in real time.</p>
<p>When I graduated, it was all with gel filters, tungsten lights and HMIs. Those lights were shifting their color as they aged, and it was a more time consuming process to tweak the colors. Now you have such fine grained control over LEDs, and it’s the biggest positive change for me in the last few years. Sometimes I still use tungsten lights, but my first preference is LED.</p>

<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: Is there anything today that is a big gap on the technology side?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: Right now everything is going wireless. Video is wireless. Lights are wireless. Sound is wireless. It’s all good, but there’s a lot of congestion on sets with all those things combined. Sometimes those nice tools don’t work because there’s too much technology on set [laughs]. That’s my only complaint.</p>
<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: Getting closer to “Andor”, you’ve spent around 15 years now working on various episodic productions. How do you see audience expectations and production ambitions evolving over that period of time? I look back at how it was in the ’90s, where we had the feature world and the TV world, and there was an almost unbridgeable gap between the two. And now in 2025 that gap is pretty much gone.</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: It’s nice that you say that, because it’s something I fought against for years. Up until about 5 years ago people would say that if you do TV shows, you can’t do feature film work. If you wanted to do something creative on a show, with lights or with a camera, they would push back on it. They would say that it’s a TV show and that it doesn’t need that.</p>
<p>Right now, the audiences watching episodic shows accept and expect a higher level of quality. It’s such a good transition. There are TV shows that look better than films. I worked on some French TV shows where they gave us a lot of freedom even as the budget was not that big, and I’m so happy with what we were able to do there. I’ve been fighting against it for a long time in discussions with agents. They used to push me to go into the feature film world, and I’m happy with where these episodic productions are these days.</p>

<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: Getting to “Andor”, what brought you to it?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: Thanks to David Meanti who is a producer on “Andor”. I knew him from the show “Riviera” that we did a few years ago in the south of France. He was an assistant director on that show, and we had a great working relationship. We kept in touch after that show, as he moved to the UK and started working as a producer. He tried to introduce me to the producers on the first season of “Andor”, but it didn’t work back then. But he kept on trying for the second season, and I’m grateful to David for that. At first I was offered the first 3 episodes, and after that it was extended to the next 3 episodes.</p>
<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: How did you approach bridging this arc between Season 1 and “Rogue One”?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: “Rogue One” is one of the best Star Wars films, and because of that I was so happy when they called me to work on “Andor”. “Rogue One” has a great story and great visuals.</p>
<p>I wanted to elevate “Andor”. The first season was shot on Panavision C lenses on VENICE camera with a cropped sensor. I wanted to use a full frame sensor with a full frame anamorphic lens to get a bit closer to “Rogue One” which was shot on Alexa 65 with anamorphic lenses. A bigger sensor gives you a different feeling, and you see it when you watch a movie in IMAX. With lighting, I wanted to have a natural approach to it.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.pushing-pixels.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/andor-still08.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="1592"><br>

<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: How much time did you have in pre-production to talk about ideas, visuals and inspirations?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: We had a lot of time, and it’s a rare thing. The director Ariel Kleiman and I went through the same process for each episode. We were reading the scripts together, and throwing ideas and brainstorming. We did that twice for each episode, and then we started making moodboards. After that we did another read through, and then we started blocking the scenes. We had a lot of 3D pre-viz with ILM, with our camera and lenses in those virtual sets. That allowed us to start looking for shots and to refine everything.</p>
<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: How difficult is it to stay practical, to capture as much as you can in camera on sets that are literally out of this world?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: On some sets it was more difficult, especially the ones with a lot of green screens. You have to imagine what’s behind as you’re lighting it and trying to see through it. There are limitations when working with green screens. You can’t use too much smoke or haze. You can’t use flares. It becomes less natural for me.</p>
<p>This is why for some sets we used either LED walls or painted backdrops. The wedding scene in episode 3 was time-lapsed. Every time we come back to the wedding, the light was slightly different as the Sun was getting lower and we were getting atmospheric effects. We wanted to create a feeling of an estate with the views on the mountains. Eventually we decided to not use green screens. They painted a nice backdrop of the mountains we used in Barcelona, and that was great. You see the final result in camera, and you can light it more naturally. Another set where we used painted backdrops was when Krennic gives his speech to take control of Ghorman. We had a painted backdrop of snowy mountains, and it worked well.</p>

<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: How was your collaboration with VFX? Was it mainly in post-production, or an ongoing process?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: It was ongoing. We were all in one office, including the art department and VFX. We had a lot of meetings to discuss how this planet should look, what we can do in pre-viz, etc. We had full VFX shots of the TIE fighter flying integrated into the larger sequences. Mohen Leo was the VFX supervisor, and he wanted every VFX shot to be physically grounded. You see that in every VFX shot, including the lighting. Some shots started full VFX and then became sets. Luke Hull, our production designer, was always in those meetings. It was a close collaboration between Ariel the director, myself, the art department and the VFX crew from ILM.</p>
<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: In terms of sets, how much was built on stage and how much was built on location?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: There was a lot built on the stage and back lots at Pinewood and Longcross. Yavin, for example, was all at Longcross. It’s an old military test track, with some buildings and a lot of forest. We used that forest to build Yavin’s landing areas for the fighters. The Ghorman city and plaza were built on a back lot at Pinewood, including most of the interiors.</p>

<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: How much time did you spend shooting the wedding ceremony?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: It was about a week and a half, but we also had a set strike as we were getting close to the finish line. The last bit when they all start dancing like crazy was filmed six months later.</p>
<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: How many countries did this show take you to?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: We were in Barcelona where we shot the Coruscant Senate, and in London where we shot at Barbican and Lloyd’s building.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.pushing-pixels.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/andor-still02.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="1610"><br>

<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: For some of the bigger sets, is it a combination of a physical build and then digital extensions?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: Some of them were fully physical, and some were extended. The Plaza at Ghorman was built physically as one story, and everything above that is a digital extension. I remember how astonished I was the first time I arrived on that set. It was so big. Another example of combining the two was the Ghorman heist sequence. They built quite a bit of those streets, and then above it we had green screens for extensions. The VFX crew was so good at making extensions look so natural.</p>
<p>We had a great collaboration on this show. We knew how we wanted these places to look before we started shooting. I could plan my lighting ahead of time, including the VFX pieces.</p>
<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: The show spends a lot of time at the apartment with Bix. How big was it?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: The nice thing about that set is that everything you see is captured in camera, including the view outside which was an LED wall. That wall allowed us to be more creative and find some extra shots. You have shots from the outside where you see the city below in reflection with raindrops on the window. You see cars passing and light coming in.</p>

<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: Did you want to use different colors for different planets or different sets?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: We wanted every arc of three episodes to feel like its own movie. Our first block was episodes 4 through 6, and we wanted that block to feel cold. Our visual reference for it was the city of Turin in Italy, which is a mountain city. We wanted the feeling of that winter light when the Sun is already behind the mountains, but there’s still light, and it’s all blue. And if the Sun is out, it should be low, with a warm magenta feel to it. We have a lot of rain in these three episodes as well. And then when we shot the next block of the first three episodes, we wanted it to be sunny. It all has a summer feel, with lots of sunlight, including Dedra’s apartment.</p>
<p>Then, within each block you have different planets. Some places are more cold with not a lot of colors. The wedding had a more classical look, and I used tungsten lights there to create that look. Yavin feels like an old Star Wars movie. It was such a nice exercise to play with different looks and moods. It’s a gift to be able to do that.</p>
<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: Was there any color you wanted to stay away from?</em></p>
<p><span>Christope</span>: Yes for certain sets, but not for the whole show. We used a mix of cold moonlight and warm sources on Yavin for consistency, for example.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.pushing-pixels.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/andor-still10.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="1608"><br>

<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: What was your most memorable moment, and what was your most challenging moment on this show?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: The most challenging was Mina-Rau and its grain fields. They planted the grain fields, and we had a window of 3-4 weeks to shoot it. And then, just before we started shooting, we had a set strike and we lost half of our actors. We decided to keep on shooting with non-SAG actors, but pretty much every scene was a mix of SAG and non-SAG. So we started shooting bits and pieces of the scenes, also fighting with the elements [laughs], and then we completed the reverse shots six months later, on a stage during winter time.</p>
<p>Our greens department was cutting all those grain stalks to put on stage, but my main challenge was to keep the lighting consistent and natural. Back when we were shooting in the field, I was already thinking about what would happen later on. I was really meticulous, measuring the light of the field, the light of the Sun, the light of the clouds, and noting all the color temperatures. Then when we came to that stage, we had lots of LED fixtures on the ceiling, and we were able to match those color temperatures everywhere. Another interesting challenge was to recreate the feeling of the air with all of the field particles.</p>
<p>It’s easy when you have one scene outside and then another on the stage, but here we were matching shots within the same scenes. I like those kinds of challenges.</p>
<p>As for the most memorable scene, I loved shooting Yavin. I like being outside, and it also reminded me of the old Star Wars movies. Another one was the heist on the streets of Ghorman. We spent about four weeks, mostly during the night, in the UK winter. It was freezing. We had rain machines. It was hard, but it paid off in the end. It was also my first big set to light. It was a big challenge, and I was so happy with the end result.</p>

<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: How does it feel to see these weeks and months of work compressed into a few hours on the screen?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: Before the episode is shown to the public, I see multiple cuts of it. That’s when I see all the faults. That’s when I think of all the things that I could have done better. And then some months later it hits the streaming network, and now I can see it from a distance – and it’s really nice to see it in its final form.</p>
<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: How was Covid for you and how is it today?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: I’m so happy that it’s all behind me. We still had Covid restrictions when we started working on this season. It was a lot of testing, and it was cumbersome for the entire production. Also, when you work in a mask, it takes away a big part of the human interaction on set. I want to see people that I work with. When you talk with someone and you have a mask on, you lose half of the conversation. From the moment we could work without a mask, it really opened up. Everything became more relaxed. Communication became easier and warmer. It was hard for me to not have the same human interaction with the restrictions in place.</p>
<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: What are your top three favorite movies of all time?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: One of my favorites is “Apocalypse Now”. It’s incredible, and it’s also maybe another reason why I loved shooting Yavin – it’s the same atmosphere. I love “No Country for Old Men” and “Children of Men” with its incredible camera work.</p>

<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: If you had a time machine, and you could go back in time to give your younger self a piece of advice, what would it be?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: Be patient. I was really impatient with everything, as it was so difficult to get into doing fiction. Everything else comes along. I don’t regret any twists and turns of the path that I took.</p>
<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: What keeps you going? You get to travel the world and work on these great productions, but it also involves long hours and sleepless nights, and being away from your family and friends for long periods of time.</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: It’s really hard for the family, and it’s a demanding job. As long as I feel that I keep on learning, that I keep on evolving, that I keep on meeting really nice people I work with, I’m happy. When it starts to feel that it’s becoming a routine and that I’m doing the same things all over again, then I’ll stop and see what’s next. There are several other things I would love to do in my life outside of movies, but for now I still love it.</p>
<p>I’m getting to know new people. I’m learning a lot, be it on a bigger project like “Andor” or on smaller ones. When you travel, you get exposed to other cultures. I was on a production that took us to Ukraine and Kazakhstan, and the locals have a different way of working. I worked a lot in the UK, and their way is different from how they do it in France. I’m about to do two French movies, and I’m looking forward to that. The French way is the artists’ way. They spend the whole day talking about it. In the UK it’s a bit more efficient, maybe [laughs].</p>
<p>As long as I have this feeling, it’s good for me. But if I feel that I’m doing the same thing over and over again, I’d want to stop.</p>
<p><em>Kirill: From all the places you’ve traveled to so far, what’s your favorite cuisine?</em></p>
<p>Christophe: French. When I work in France, I gain 5 kilos every time. The food is so good, and they take a full hour to eat. If you don’t take an hour to eat and production decides to do continuous days, they will strike. It’s too much [laughs]. The UK crews don’t like to stop. They keep on going so they can go home on time to spend at least a bit of time with the family. As far as the food goes, I prefer to work in France.</p>
