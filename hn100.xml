            <article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto">Endurain is a Strava like service that you can selfhost.
It uses for the frontend PHP+HTML+basic JS+Bootstrap CSS, for the backend Python FastAPI and stravalib, MariaDB for the database engine and Jaeger for observability basic usage.
Docker images are available to deploy the service and you can check "docker-compose.yml" file for an example. Environemnt variables detailed bellow.</p>
<p dir="auto">I'm not a developer by profession (my dev concepts are from university ten years ago) so this work had a lot of help from ChatGPT and the main purpose was to learn new technologies and new concepts, so please be gentle.
If you have recommendations for any topic please let me know.</p>
<p dir="auto">Currently the service supports:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Multi-user</li>
<li>Create/edit/delete users</li>
<li>Basic admin and regular users profiles that adapt the interface</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The most grotesque videos on YouTube fit into a specific category. It consists of old footage run through an AI upscaler. Sometimes the videos are colorized, sometimes they’re interpolated to 60 frames per second. Uniformly they look atrocious, smeary, and garish, unless you don’t know what a film is supposed to look like. Increasingly that’s a lot of people, including, evidently, the people responsible for the latest transfers of the movie <em>True Lies</em> and to a lesser extent <em>Aliens</em>, <em>The Abyss</em>, and <em>Titanic</em>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="[4K, 60 fps, color] The lumiere family goes on a trip.1895." width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GHHt-CBKkS0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>There's like a million of these and they're all uniformly disgusting.</figcaption></figure></div><p>If you have never seen the movie <em>True Lies</em>, you are probably under 30. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays an agent in a government counter-terrorist organization that has to fight bad guys while keeping his dangerous lifestyle a secret from his mousey wife played by Jamie Lee Curtis. It’s a goofy big budget action comedy remake that has some fantastic set pieces, an incredible cast, some great bits, and ages exactly how you would expect from an airheaded action movie from 1994. In James Cameron’s career, It’s probably the weirdest movie James Cameron ever made outside of <em>Piranha II: The Spawning</em>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/True.Lies_.1994.2160p.MA_.WEB-DL.DDP5_.1.Atmos_.DV_.HDR_.H.265-FLUX-00_43_12.png?w=710" srcset="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/True.Lies_.1994.2160p.MA_.WEB-DL.DDP5_.1.Atmos_.DV_.HDR_.H.265-FLUX-00_43_12.png?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/True.Lies_.1994.2160p.MA_.WEB-DL.DDP5_.1.Atmos_.DV_.HDR_.H.265-FLUX-00_43_12.png?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/True.Lies_.1994.2160p.MA_.WEB-DL.DDP5_.1.Atmos_.DV_.HDR_.H.265-FLUX-00_43_12.png?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/True.Lies_.1994.2160p.MA_.WEB-DL.DDP5_.1.Atmos_.DV_.HDR_.H.265-FLUX-00_43_12.png?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/True.Lies_.1994.2160p.MA_.WEB-DL.DDP5_.1.Atmos_.DV_.HDR_.H.265-FLUX-00_43_12.png?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/True.Lies_.1994.2160p.MA_.WEB-DL.DDP5_.1.Atmos_.DV_.HDR_.H.265-FLUX-00_43_12.png?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px" loading="lazy"><figcaption>The Folders.

At times it can look passable in motion, but then you notice something out of the corner of your eye: a thick fold of skin, a framed photo of a child, folders that are too thick at the margins, cheeks that look rendered. It’s that familiar dread at the pit of your gut when you spot AI generated imagery, a combination of edges not looking quite right and surfaces that are simultaneously too smooth and too sharp. A crime was committed here, and you can tell.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/Aliens.1986.Special.Edition.2160p.WEB-DL.DDP5_.1.HDR_.H.265-CanadianSupervillainJamesCameron-01_04_14-1.png?w=710" srcset="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/Aliens.1986.Special.Edition.2160p.WEB-DL.DDP5_.1.HDR_.H.265-CanadianSupervillainJamesCameron-01_04_14-1.png?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/Aliens.1986.Special.Edition.2160p.WEB-DL.DDP5_.1.HDR_.H.265-CanadianSupervillainJamesCameron-01_04_14-1.png?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/Aliens.1986.Special.Edition.2160p.WEB-DL.DDP5_.1.HDR_.H.265-CanadianSupervillainJamesCameron-01_04_14-1.png?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/Aliens.1986.Special.Edition.2160p.WEB-DL.DDP5_.1.HDR_.H.265-CanadianSupervillainJamesCameron-01_04_14-1.png?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/Aliens.1986.Special.Edition.2160p.WEB-DL.DDP5_.1.HDR_.H.265-CanadianSupervillainJamesCameron-01_04_14-1.png?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/Aliens.1986.Special.Edition.2160p.WEB-DL.DDP5_.1.HDR_.H.265-CanadianSupervillainJamesCameron-01_04_14-1.png?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Game over.

It’s worth contextualizing who handled these “restorations” – namely Park Road Post, a subsidiary of Peter Jackson’s WingNut Films. They have worked on multiple films in the past, but the two that are most germane here are Jackson’s <em>They Shall Not Grow Old</em> and the 3-part Disney+ documentary <em>The Beatles: Get Back. </em>Both movies recontextualize pre-existing footage and, importantly, do so with an aggressive use of machine learning. <em>They Shall Not Grow Old </em>upscales and colorizes old World War I imagery in an attempt to set the bloodshed in a more modern context, while <em>Get Back</em> recycled footage shot for Michael Lindsay-Hogg’s <em>Let It Be</em>, including moments never before seen by the public, to elucidate the process behind the creation of some of The Beatles’ most iconic songs.&nbsp;</p><p>I understand the intent of using machine learning in both works. In the case of Hogg’s <em>Let it Be</em>,<em> </em>much of the footage was chunky and rough, and they used audio isolation narratively in an interesting way.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/They.Shall_.Not_.Grow_.Old_.2018.1080p.BluRay.Remux_.AVC_.DTS-HD.MA_.5.1-PmP-00_43_55-1.jpg?w=710" srcset="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/They.Shall_.Not_.Grow_.Old_.2018.1080p.BluRay.Remux_.AVC_.DTS-HD.MA_.5.1-PmP-00_43_55-1.jpg?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/They.Shall_.Not_.Grow_.Old_.2018.1080p.BluRay.Remux_.AVC_.DTS-HD.MA_.5.1-PmP-00_43_55-1.jpg?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/They.Shall_.Not_.Grow_.Old_.2018.1080p.BluRay.Remux_.AVC_.DTS-HD.MA_.5.1-PmP-00_43_55-1.jpg?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/They.Shall_.Not_.Grow_.Old_.2018.1080p.BluRay.Remux_.AVC_.DTS-HD.MA_.5.1-PmP-00_43_55-1.jpg?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/They.Shall_.Not_.Grow_.Old_.2018.1080p.BluRay.Remux_.AVC_.DTS-HD.MA_.5.1-PmP-00_43_55-1.jpg?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/They.Shall_.Not_.Grow_.Old_.2018.1080p.BluRay.Remux_.AVC_.DTS-HD.MA_.5.1-PmP-00_43_55-1.jpg?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px" loading="lazy"><figcaption>They should have called it They Shall Grow Really Weird Looking. <em>Credit: Warner Bros.

This is an enthusiastic, clumsy use of a technology on severely damaged footage.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/The.Beatles.Get_.Back_.S01E01.Part_.1.Days_.1-7.2160p.WEB-DL.DDP5_.1.HEVC-TEPES-00_15_55.jpg?w=710" srcset="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/The.Beatles.Get_.Back_.S01E01.Part_.1.Days_.1-7.2160p.WEB-DL.DDP5_.1.HEVC-TEPES-00_15_55.jpg?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/The.Beatles.Get_.Back_.S01E01.Part_.1.Days_.1-7.2160p.WEB-DL.DDP5_.1.HEVC-TEPES-00_15_55.jpg?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/The.Beatles.Get_.Back_.S01E01.Part_.1.Days_.1-7.2160p.WEB-DL.DDP5_.1.HEVC-TEPES-00_15_55.jpg?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/The.Beatles.Get_.Back_.S01E01.Part_.1.Days_.1-7.2160p.WEB-DL.DDP5_.1.HEVC-TEPES-00_15_55.jpg?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/The.Beatles.Get_.Back_.S01E01.Part_.1.Days_.1-7.2160p.WEB-DL.DDP5_.1.HEVC-TEPES-00_15_55.jpg?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/The.Beatles.Get_.Back_.S01E01.Part_.1.Days_.1-7.2160p.WEB-DL.DDP5_.1.HEVC-TEPES-00_15_55.jpg?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Mods are asleep, post smooth Paul. <em>Credit: Disney+</em></figcaption></figure><p>The same is true to a lesser extent for <em>The Beatles: Get Back</em>. Nobody would begrudge Jackson for color grading and restoring rough footage, but the effect is sterilizing and alien. Hair and fur coats are simultaneously shiny and oily, with gorgon-esque strands that undulate and melt into themselves. The folds of skin and clothing have an unnatural heft. The edges of objects will catch and melt into each other. The grain structure is slightly more natural than in <em>They Shall Not Grow Old</em>, but it looks like it was artificially added over heavily denoised footage. <em>Get Back </em>was wildly successful, in part because the only semi-available version of <em>Let It Be</em> is an atrocious DVD transfer, but also on the strength of 60 hours of unused footage, an unseen insight into an iconic band.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/The-Beatles-Now-And-Then-Official-Music-Video-00.01.52.420.jpeg?w=710" srcset="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/The-Beatles-Now-And-Then-Official-Music-Video-00.01.52.420.jpeg?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/The-Beatles-Now-And-Then-Official-Music-Video-00.01.52.420.jpeg?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/The-Beatles-Now-And-Then-Official-Music-Video-00.01.52.420.jpeg?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/The-Beatles-Now-And-Then-Official-Music-Video-00.01.52.420.jpeg?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/The-Beatles-Now-And-Then-Official-Music-Video-00.01.52.420.jpeg?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/The-Beatles-Now-And-Then-Official-Music-Video-00.01.52.420.jpeg?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px" loading="lazy"><figcaption>They should have let it be. <em>Credit: WingNut Films Productions Ltd</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>I wish we had stopped Jackson then and there. As my good friend Danielle joked, this was a trial balloon. People praised Jackson for doing this to Lindsay-Hogg’s footage in the name of restoration, and it emboldened him to do worse things. Before the <em>True Lies </em>debacle, the most recent example of this was the aggressively saccharine and confusing <em>Now &amp; Then</em>, a long unfinished demo now finished by Ringo and Paul, edited together with archival footage of younger John and George composited in an a fashion that can be charitably described as tremendously weird.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Beatles - Now And Then (Official Music Video)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Opxhh9Oh3rg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Every part of this is strange.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Lest I am accused of being a luddite, I firmly believe there are many use cases for this technology. Nvidia’s DLSS and competing variants generally work very well on the games they are trained on. I regularly use <a href="https://nmkd.itch.io/flowframes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flowframes</a> in the rare case that I need interpolation. I have often used waifu2x and now <a href="https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chainner</a> if I need to photoshop a still and my source is bad, and there are databases of countless <a href="https://openmodeldb.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI upscaling models</a>. But the flip side to this is that these technologies are often used in place of proper ingest. “Crap in, crap out” is a truism for a reason. I spend a lot of time regularly capturing VHS and Laserdisc at the highest possible quality for fun, and when I see people who should know better say “Just use Topaz” (a commercial AI upscaler) instead of learning how to correctly ingest footage and deinterlace it, it makes me want to pull out my hair, because it almost uniformly looks bad to anyone who works with video professionally.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Cure - Catch &amp; Why Can't I Be You?

Good archival practices require a lot of institutional knowledge and labor. It’s an art when done well, and the people who do it care so much about what they do. But the modern application of much of AI is precisely about taking labor out of the equation. Why transfer a tape correctly when we can just have a computer guess badly instead? What if crap goes in, and it doesn’t come out?</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/neck.jpg?w=710" srcset="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/neck.jpg?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/neck.jpg?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/neck.jpg?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/neck.jpg?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/neck.jpg?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/neck.jpg?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Neck. NECK! <em>Credit: 20th Century Fox</em></figcaption></figure><p>What makes all of this worse is that <em>True Lies</em>, as I understand it, did not need to be shoved through the AI wringer. According to <a href="https://thedigitalbits.com/item/true-lies-2023-digital-uhd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Digital Bits</a>, Park Road Post had a recent 4k scan of <em>True Lies </em>from the original camera negative. Park Road Post’s own website claims they have a Lasergraphics Director 10K film scanner on the premises. So what is the purpose of adding AI to this mix? Why do that to a perfectly fine-looking film? What is gained here, other than to slightly yassify an Arnold film? At this point, maybe they are simply doing it just to say that they did, because the technology is lying around, like a loaded gun with the safety off.</p><p>Nerds who post on blu-ray forums as a rule often need to calm down, and the forum threads I have read about this are no exception, but there are certain cases where a filmmaker is just wrong about how their films should look. Lucas is the infamous notable example, but Cameron is not innocent here in his treatment of his own films. Wong Kar-wai is another notable example, as what he did to <em>Ashes of Time</em> is criminal as was his recent “remasters” of his movies like<em> In The Mood For Love</em>. In certain rare conditions like this, it’s healthy to question if directors have the best interests of their own films in mind, <a href="https://thedigitalbits.com/item/titanic-4k-25thle-uhd-2023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as Cameron himself personally approved of these remasters</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/In.the_.Mood_.for_.Love_.2000.1080p.UHD_.BluRay.DD5_.1.x264-ZQ-00_01_14.png?w=710" srcset="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/In.the_.Mood_.for_.Love_.2000.1080p.UHD_.BluRay.DD5_.1.x264-ZQ-00_01_14.png?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/In.the_.Mood_.for_.Love_.2000.1080p.UHD_.BluRay.DD5_.1.x264-ZQ-00_01_14.png?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/In.the_.Mood_.for_.Love_.2000.1080p.UHD_.BluRay.DD5_.1.x264-ZQ-00_01_14.png?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/In.the_.Mood_.for_.Love_.2000.1080p.UHD_.BluRay.DD5_.1.x264-ZQ-00_01_14.png?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/In.the_.Mood_.for_.Love_.2000.1080p.UHD_.BluRay.DD5_.1.x264-ZQ-00_01_14.png?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/In.the_.Mood_.for_.Love_.2000.1080p.UHD_.BluRay.DD5_.1.x264-ZQ-00_01_14.png?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Why did you change the color of your movie like this? <em>Credit: Block 2 Pictures</em></figcaption></figure><p>What actually chills my blood more than anything is the thought that a lot of people think this all looks pretty good. You see this mindset at work whenever an AI fetishist posts a stable diffusion image of a woman with 13 fingers, 40 incisors and comically huge breasts. There’s an entire portion of the population that takes overt pleasure in the over-smoothed, perverts that prefer all media to be fast, high frame rate, and scrubbed squeaky clean. The cameras on our phones don’t simply capture images anymore, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/have-iphone-cameras-become-too-smart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they compute them and ‘optimize’ them</a>. It’s Italian Futurism in 4k, a noise reduction death drive. It’s not simply enough for much of digital cinema to look crystal clear and lifeless; the past should be denoised, grain managed and cleaned to conform to that standard. It is expedient and profitable if people don’t remember what film is supposed to look like.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/Aliens.1986.Special.Edition.2160p.WEB-DL.DDP5_.1.HDR_.H.265-CanadianSupervillainJamesCameron-01_16_00.png?w=710" srcset="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/Aliens.1986.Special.Edition.2160p.WEB-DL.DDP5_.1.HDR_.H.265-CanadianSupervillainJamesCameron-01_16_00.png?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/Aliens.1986.Special.Edition.2160p.WEB-DL.DDP5_.1.HDR_.H.265-CanadianSupervillainJamesCameron-01_16_00.png?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/Aliens.1986.Special.Edition.2160p.WEB-DL.DDP5_.1.HDR_.H.265-CanadianSupervillainJamesCameron-01_16_00.png?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/Aliens.1986.Special.Edition.2160p.WEB-DL.DDP5_.1.HDR_.H.265-CanadianSupervillainJamesCameron-01_16_00.png?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/Aliens.1986.Special.Edition.2160p.WEB-DL.DDP5_.1.HDR_.H.265-CanadianSupervillainJamesCameron-01_16_00.png?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/12/Aliens.1986.Special.Edition.2160p.WEB-DL.DDP5_.1.HDR_.H.265-CanadianSupervillainJamesCameron-01_16_00.png?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px" loading="lazy"><figcaption>That's too much detail. <em>Credit: 20th Century Fox</em></figcaption></figure><p>I don’t think anyone gets into preservation to destroy film.

				<div><p>How big is YouTube?</p>
<p>I got interested in this question a few years ago, when I started writing about the <a href="https://theconversation.com/facebook-has-a-misinformation-problem-and-is-blocking-access-to-data-about-how-much-there-is-and-who-is-affected-164838">“denominator problem”</a>. A great deal of social media research focuses on finding unwanted behavior – mis/disinformation, hate speech – on platforms. This isn’t that hard to do: search for “white genocide” or “ivermectin” and count the results. Indeed, a lot of eye-catching research does just this – consider <a href="https://secure.avaaz.org/campaign/en/facebook_threat_health/">Avaaz’s August 2020 report about COVID misinformation</a>. It reports 3.8 billion views of COVID misinfo in a year, which is a very big number. But it’s a numerator without a denominator – Facebook generates dozens or hundreds of views a day for each of its 3 billion users – 3.8 billion views is actually a very small number, contextualized with a denominator.</p>
<p>A few social media platforms have made it possible to calculate denominators. Reddit, for many years, permitted Pushshift to collect all Reddit posts, which means we can calculate what a small fraction of Reddit is focused on meme stocks or crypto, versus conversations about mental health or board gaming. Our <a href="https://redditmap.social/">Redditmap.social platform</a> – primarily built by Virginia Partridge and Jasmine Mangat – is based around the idea of looking at the platform as a whole and understanding how big or small each community is compared to the whole. Alas, Reddit cut off public access to Pushshift this summer, so Redditmap.social can only use data generated early this year. </p>
<p>Twitter was also a good platform for studying denominators, because it created a research API that took a statistical sample of all tweets and gave researchers access to every 10th or 100th one. If you found 2500 tweets about ivermectin a day, and saw 100m tweets through the decahose (which gave researchers 1/10th of tweet volume), you could calculate an accurate denominator (100m x 10) (All these numbers are completely made up.) Twitter has cut off access to these excellent academic APIs and now charges massive amounts of money for much less access, which means that it’s no longer possible for most researchers to do denominator-based work.</p>
<p>Interesting as Reddit and Twitter are, they are much less widely used than YouTube, which is used by virtually all internet users. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/12/11/teens-social-media-and-technology-2023/">Pew reports that 93% of teens use YouTube</a> – the closest service in terms of usage is Tiktok with 63% and Snapchat with 60%. While YouTube has a good, well-documented API, there’s no good way to get a random, representative sample of YouTube. Instead, most research on YouTube either studies a collection of videos (all videos on the channels of a selected set of users) or videos discovered via recommendation (start with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Never Going to Give You Up</a>, objectively the center of the internet, and collect recommended videos.) You can do excellent research with either method, but you won’t get a sample of all YouTube videos and you won’t be able to calculate the size of YouTube.</p>
<p>I brought this problem to Jason Baumgartner, creator of PushShift, and prince of the dark arts of data collection. One of Jason’s skills is a deep knowledge of undocumented APIs, ways of collecting data outside of official means. Most platforms have one or more undocumented APIs, widely used by programmers for that platform to build internal tools. In the case of YouTube, that API is called <a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-project-innertube-helped-pull-youtube-out-of-the-gu-1704946491">“Inner Tube”</a> and its existence is an open secret in programmer communities. Using InnerTube, Jason suggested we do something that’s both really smart and really stupid: guess at random URLs and see if there are videos there.</p>
<p>Here’s how this works: YouTube URLs look like this: <code> https://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=vXPJVwwEmiM</code></p>
<p>That bit after “watch?v=” is an 11 digit string. The first ten digits can be a-z,A-Z,0-9 and _-. The last digit is special, and can only be one of 16 values. Turns out there are 2^64 possible YouTube addresses, an enormous number: 18.4 quintillion. There are lots of YouTube videos, but not that many. Let’s guess for a moment that there are 1 billion YouTube videos – if you picked URLs at random, you’d only get a valid address roughly once every 18.4 billion tries. </p>
<p>We refer to this method as “drunk dialing”, as it’s basically as sophisticated as taking swigs from a bottle of bourbon and mashing digits on a telephone, hoping to find a human being to speak to. Jason found a couple of cheats that makes the method roughly 32,000 times as efficient, meaning our “phone call” connects lots more often. Kevin Zheng wrote a whole bunch of scripts to do the dialing, and over the course of several months, we collected more than 10,000 truly random YouTube videos.</p>
<p>There’s lots you can do once you’ve got those videos. Ryan McCarthy is lead author <a href="https://journalqd.org/article/view/4066">on our paper in the Journal of Quantitative Description</a>, and he led the process of watching a thousand of these videos and hand-coding them, a massive and fascinating task. Kevin wired together his retrieval scripts with a variety of language detection systems, and we now have a defensible – if far from perfect – estimate of what languages are represented on YouTube. We’re starting some experiments to understand how the videos YouTube recommends differ from the “average” YouTube video – YouTube likes recommending videos with at least ten thousand views, while the median YouTube video has 39 views.</p>
<p>I’ll write at some length in the future about what we can learn from a true random sample of YouTube videos. I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about the idea of “the quotidian web”, learning from the bottom half of the long tail of user-generated media so we can understand what most creators are doing with these tools, not just from the most successful influencers. But I’m going to limit myself to the question that started this blog post: how big is YouTube?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://ethanzuckerman.com/wp-content/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-22-at-12.18.43?PM-1.png" alt="" width="1" height="1"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" src="https://ethanzuckerman.com/wp-content/2023/12/tubestats-1024x758.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="758" srcset="https://ethanzuckerman.com/wp-content/2023/12/tubestats-1024x758.jpg 1024w, https://ethanzuckerman.com/wp-content/2023/12/tubestats-600x444.jpg 600w, https://ethanzuckerman.com/wp-content/2023/12/tubestats-150x111.jpg 150w, https://ethanzuckerman.com/wp-content/2023/12/tubestats-768x569.jpg 768w, https://ethanzuckerman.com/wp-content/2023/12/tubestats.jpg 1334w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p>Consider drunk dialing again. Let’s assume you only dial numbers in the 413 area code: 413-000-0000 through 413-999-9999. That’s 10,000,000 possible numbers. If one in 100 phone calls connect, you can estimate that 100,000 people have numbers in the 413 area code. In our case, our drunk dials tried roughly 32k numbers at the same time, and we got a “hit” every 50,000 times or so. Our current estimate for the size of YouTube is 13.325 billion videos – we are now updating this number every few weeks at <a href="https://tubestats.org/">tubestats.org</a>.</p>
<p>Once you’re collecting these random videos, other statistics are easy to calculate. We can look at how old our random videos are and calculate how fast YouTube is growing: we estimate that over 4 billion videos were posted to YouTube just in 2023. We can calculate the mean and median views per video, and show just how long the “long tail” is – videos with 10,000 or more videos are roughly 4% of our data set, though they represent the lion’s share of views of the YouTube platform. </p>
<p>Perhaps the most important thing we did with our set of random videos is to demonstrate a vastly better way of studying YouTube than drunk dialing. We know our method is random because it iterates through the entire possible address space. By comparing our results to other ways of generating lists of YouTube videos, we can declare them “plausibly random” if they generate similar results. Fortunately, one method does – it was <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2068816.2068851">discovered by Jia Zhou et. al. in 2011</a>, and it’s far more efficient than our naïve method. (You generate a five character string where one character is a dash – YouTube will autocomplete those URLs and spit out a matching video if one exists.) Kevin now polls YouTube using the “dash method” and uses the results to maintain our dashboard at Tubestats. </p>
<p>We have lots more research coming out from this data set, both about what we’re discovering and about some complex ethical questions about how to handle this data. (Most of the videos we’re discovering were only seen by a few dozen people. If we publish those URLs, we run the risk of exposing to public scrutiny videos that are “public” but whose authors could reasonably expect obscurity. Thus our paper does not include the list of videos discovered.) <a href="https://publicinfrastructure.org/2023/12/21/notes-from-random-youtube-coding/">Ryan has a great introduction to main takeaways from our hand-coding</a>. He and I are both working on longer writing about the weird world of random videos – what can we learn from spending time deep in the long tail? </p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, we plan to maintain <a href="https://tubestats.org/">Tubestats</a> so long as we can. It’s possible that YouTube will object to the existence of this resource or the methods we used to create it. Counterpoint: I believe that high level data like this should be published regularly for all large user-generated media platforms. These platforms are some of the most important parts of our digital public sphere, and we need far more information about what’s on them, who creates this content and who it reaches.</p>
<p>Many thanks to the Journal for Quantitative Description of publishing such a large and unwieldy paper – it’s 85 pages! Thanks and congratulations to all authors: Ryan McGrady, Kevin Zheng, Rebecca Curran, Jason Baumgartner and myself. And thank you to everyone who’s funded our work: the Knight Foundation has been supporting a wide range of our work on studying extreme speech on social media, and other work in our lab is supported by the Ford Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation.</p>
<p>Finally – I’ve got COVID, so if this post is less coherent than normal, that’s to be expected. Feel free to use the comments to tell me what didn’t make sense and I will try to clear it up when my brain is less foggy.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Amazon will lower the transaction fee it charges sellers from 17% to just 5% for under-$15 apparel items as it faces Shein’s competition.</p>
<p>Amazon is the largest clothing retailer in the U.S., including online and offline retail. But it charges sellers a 17% fee plus additional fees for fulfillment and advertising, making it one of the most expensive Amazon categories to sell in. Amazon increased the fee to 17% from 15% five years ago, in April 2018.</p>
<p>Shein is an order of magnitude smaller than Amazon - its GMV this year, more than $40 billion, is less than 10% of Amazon’s. But most of that $40 billion is in clothing, which Shein is best known for and strongest in. Its supply chain, tuned to introduce thousands of new designs daily while dynamically adjusting which products get manufactured, is uniquely fit for clothing. It is the biggest online-native clothing retailer. </p>
<p>Amazon is reacting to Shein by lowering referral fees from 17% to 5% for clothing items priced under $15. For products priced between $15 and $20, it will decrease referral fees from 17% to 10%. Lower fees will allow sellers to lower prices by a few dollars and maintain the same margin. More expensive items remain at 17%. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.marketplacepulse.com/articles/641/amazon-clothing-referral-fee-now-vs-starting-2024.png" alt="Amazon Clothing Referral Fee Now vs. Starting 2024"></p>
<p>Shein can’t match Amazon’s one-day or two-day delivery, but it can offer bargain prices while taking a week to deliver. Amazon sells products and fast shipping; Shein sells products and slow shipping. The two are inseparable - <a href="https://www.marketplacepulse.com/articles/amazon-sells-fast-shipping-not-products">the logistics are as much part of the product as the products themselves</a>. However, Amazon’s high fees made the price difference even greater. </p>
<p>Amazon will remain more expensive than Shein even after the fee reduction because the biggest cost is fulfillment. Items stored in domestic Amazon warehouses will always be more costly than Shein’s direct shipments to consumers from China, which also skip inspection and taxation by U.S. Customs. </p>
<p>Shein is not a direct competitor to Amazon in general, but in clothing, it absolutely is. Shein has expanded to more categories, started manufacturing outside China, built domestic warehouses, and <a href="https://www.marketplacepulse.com/articles/amazon-sellers-are-joining-shein-marketplace">launched a marketplace</a> to attract sellers. But its core remains clothing shipped from China. Yet Shein’s critical innovation was dressing the supply chain advantage in an experience that delights. Shein looks and feels like a brand store rather than a random selection of products.</p>
<p>Amazon rarely changes referral fees, and reducing the fee by 70% for items in Shein’s key price segment is unquestionably a response to Shein. But even if fees were to go to zero, Amazon would still have no answer for Shein. For instance, Amazon doesn’t have the tens of millions of followers Shein has on Instagram nor the billions of views Shein hauls have on TikTok. Perhaps Amazon doesn’t need to answer, but the seller fee is not it. Focusing on fees is missing the forest for the trees. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="narrow-cont"><p><a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/serp-search-engine-results-page-features-guide/377094/">Google’s search results</a> have been hit by a spam attack for the past few days in what can only be described as completely out of control. Many domains are ranking for hundreds of thousands of keywords each, an indication that the scale of this attack could easily reach into the millions of keyword phrases.</p>
<p><strong>Updated:</strong><br>
The spam was initially discovered by Lily Ray:</p>
<blockquote id="tweet-1737499776386576538" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you currently Google "craigslist used auto parts," every single result in the top 20 is spam, minus the first two results from Craigslist.</p>
<p>— Lily Ray 😏 (@lilyraynyc) <a href="https://twitter.com/lilyraynyc/status/1737499776386576538?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 20, 2023</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Surprisingly, <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-what-to-do-about-spammy-links-from-malicious-domains/449215/">many of the domains</a> have only been registered within the past 24-48 hours.</p>
<p>This recently came to my attention from a series of posts by Bill Hartzer (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhartzer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn profile</a>) where he published a <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/link-graphs-and-google-rankings/435688/">link graph</a> generated by the Majestic backlinks tool that exposed the link networks of several of the spam sites.</p>
<p>The link graph that he posted showed scores of websites tightly <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/seo-internal-links-best-practices/214886/">interlinking</a> with each other, which is a fairly typical pattern for <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/link-building-guide/bad-links-risky-tactics/">spammy link</a> networks.</p>
<h3>Screenshot Of Tightly Interlinked Network</h3>

<p>Bill and I talked about the spam sites over Facebook messenger and we both agreed that although the spammers put a lot of work into creating a backlink network, the links weren’t actually responsible for the high rankings.</p>
<p><strong>Bill said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“This, in my opinion, is partly the fault of Google, who appears to be putting more emphasis on content rather than links.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree 100% that Google is putting more emphasis on content than links. But my thoughts are that the <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/link-building-guide/bad-links-risky-tactics/">spam links</a> are there so that Googlebot can discover the spam pages and index them, even if just for one or two days.</p>
<p>Once indexed the spam pages are likely exploiting what I consider two loopholes in <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-algorithm-history/">Google’s algorithms</a>, which I talk about next.</p>
<h2>Out of Control Spam in Google SERPs</h2>
<p>Multiple sites are ranking for longtail phrases that are somewhat easy to rank, as well as phrases with a local search component, which are also easy to rank.</p>
<p>Longtail phrases are keyword phrases that are used by people but exceedingly rarely. Longtail is a concept that’s been around for almost twenty years and subsequently popularized by a 2006 book called The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More.</p>
<p>Spammers are able to rank for these rarely searched phrases because there is little competition for those phrases, which makes it easy to rank.</p>
<p>So if a spammer creates millions of pages of longtail phrases those pages can then rank for hundreds of thousands of keywords every day in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Companies like Amazon use the principle of the longtail to sell hundreds of thousands of individual products a day which is different than selling one product hundreds of thousands of times per day.</p>
<p>That’s what the spammers are exploiting, the ease of ranking for <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/keyword-research/long-tail-keywords/">longtail phrase</a>s.</p>
<p>The second thing that the spammers are exploiting is the loophole that’s inherent in Local Search.</p>
<p>The local search algorithm is not the same as the algorithm for ranking non-local keywords.</p>
<p>The examples that have come to light are variations of Craigslist and related keywords.</p>
<p>Examples are phrases like <em>Craigslist auto parts</em>, <em>Craigslist rooms to rent</em>, <em>Craigslist for sale by owner</em> and thousands of other keywords, most of which don’t use the word Craigslist.</p>
<p>The scale of the spam is huge and it goes far beyond than keywords with the word “Craigslist” in it.</p>
<h2>What The Spam Page Looks Like</h2>
<p>Taking a look at what the spam page looks like is impossible by visiting the pages with a browser.</p>
<p>I tried to see the source code of the sites that rank in Google but all of the spam sites automatically redirect to another domain.</p>
<p>I next entered the spam URL into the <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/w3c-validator-guide/437030/">W3C</a> link checker to visit the website but the W3C bot couldn’t see the site either.</p>
<p>So I changed my browser user agent to identify itself as Googlebot but the spam site still redirected me.</p>
<p>That indicated that the site was not checking if the user agent was Googlebot.</p>
<p>The spam site was checking for Googlebot IP addresses. If the visitor’s IP address matched as belonging to Google then the spam page displayed content to Googlebot.</p>
<p>All other visitors got a redirect to other domains that displayed sketchy content.</p>
<p>In order to see the <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-valid-html/258881/">HTML</a> of the website I had to visit with a Google IP address. So I used Google’s Rich Results tester to visit the spam site and record the HTML of the page.</p>
<p>I showed Bill Hartzer how to extract the HTML by using the Rich Results tester and he immediately went off to tweet about it, lol. Dang!</p>
<p>The Rich Results Tester has an option to show the HTML of a webpage. So copied the HTML, pasted it into a text file then saved it it as an HTML file.</p>
<h3>Screenshot Of HTML Provided By Rich Results Tool</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/screenshot-html-658423275fce1-sej.jpg" alt="Google Search Overwhelmed By Massive Spam Attack" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20400%20473%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/screenshot-html-658423275fce1-sej.jpg"></p>
<p>I next edited the HTML file to remove any JavaScript then saved the file again.</p>
<p><strong>I was now able to see what the webpage looks like to Google:</strong></p>
<h3>Screenshot Of Spam Webpage</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/screenshot-of-spam-page-65841ab85e154-sej.png" alt="Screenshot of a spam webpage that ranks in Google" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20447%20644%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/screenshot-of-spam-page-65841ab85e154-sej.png"></p>
<h2>One Domain Ranks For 300,000+ Keywords</h2>
<p>Bill sent me a spreadsheet containing a list of keyword phrases that just one of the spam sites ranked for. One spam site, just one of them, ranked for over 300,000 keyword phrases.</p>
<h3>Screenshot Showing Keywords For One Domain</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/screenshot-spreadsheet-65841a432f6d1-sej.png" alt="Image showing a closeup of a spreadsheet with keyword phrases on it" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20320%20420%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/screenshot-spreadsheet-65841a432f6d1-sej.png"></p>
<p>There were a lot of Craigslist keyword phrases but there were also other longtail phrases, many of which contained a local search element. As I mentioned, it’s easy to rank for longtail phrases, easy to rank for local search phrases and combine the two kinds of phrases and it’s really easy to rank for these keyword phrases.</p>
<h2>Why Does This Spam Technique Work?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/local-seo/what-is-local-seo-why-local-search-is-important/">Local search</a> uses a different algorithm than the non-local algorithm. For example, a local site, in general, doesn’t need a lot of links to rank for a query. The pages just need the right kinds of keywords to trigger a local search algorithm and rank it for a geographic area.</p>
<p>So if you search for “Craigslist auto parts” that’s going to trigger the local search algorithm and because it’s longtail it’s not going to take too much to rank it.</p>
<p>This is an ongoing problem for many years. Several years ago a website was able to rank for “Rhinoplasty Plano, Texas” with a site that contained old Roman Latin content and headings in English. Rhinoplasty is a longtail local search and Plano, Texas is a relatively small town. Ranking for that Rhinoplasty keyword phrase was so easy that the latin language website was able to easily rank for it.</p>
<p>Google has known about this spam problem since at least December 19th, as acknowledged in a tweet by Danny Sullivan.</p>
<blockquote id="tweet-1737236506190987682" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes, I already passed that one on to the search team. Here’s a peek. And it’s being looked at. <a href="https://t.co/vJH3EisnXD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pic.twitter.com/vJH3EisnXD</a></p>
<p>— Google SearchLiaison (@searchliaison) <a href="https://twitter.com/searchliaison/status/1737236506190987682?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 19, 2023</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It will be interesting to see if Google finally after all this time figures out a way to combat this kind of spam.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-14879">
            
            

            <div>
                                
                <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API">WebGPU</a> is a new <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/">standards-compliant</a> API that enables high-performance 3D graphics and general-purpose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_parallelism">computations</a> on the Web. WebGPU programs are written in JavaScript but expose GPU functionality, allowing GPU computing to be used in Web content for the first time. Starting in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a> 185, WebGPU can be enabled for early testing and development.</p>
<p>To enable WebGPU, turn on the “WebGPU”, “GPU Process: DOM Rendering” and “GPU Process: Canvas Rendering” feature flags in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari-developer-tools/feature-flag-settings">Feature Flags</a> tab in Safari Preferences. If you don’t see the Feature Flags tab, you need to first check “<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari-developer-tools/enabling-developer-features">Show features for web developers</a>” in the Advanced tab.</p>
<p>Once you have WebGPU enabled in Safari Technology Preview 185, <a href="https://webgpu.github.io/webgpu-samples/samples/particles">try out this example of WebGPU</a>. It utilizes many of the best features of WebGPU.</p>
<figure><video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" src="https://webkit.org/blog-files/webgpu-particles.mov"></video></figure>
<h2>WebGPU JavaScript API</h2>
<p>The WebGPU API is accessed through JavaScript, similar to WebGL.</p>
<h3>Creating a GPUDevice</h3>
<p>In order to use WebGPU, a device must be created. Resources and pipeline state are created from a <code>GPUDevice</code> instance. To create a device with default limits and features which are supported on all devices supporting WebGPU, we can pass zero parameters to the invocations of <code>requestAdapter</code> and <code>requestDevice</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> <span>adapter</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>navigator</span>.<span>gpu</span>.<span>requestAdapter</span>();
<span>device</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>adapter</span>.<span>requestDevice</span>();
</code></pre>
<h3>Configuring a GPUCanvasContext</h3>
<p>The <code>GPUCanvasContext</code> is an interface that allows you to configure how your content will be displayed in the corresponding <code>HTMLCanvas</code> element on the page.</p>
<pre><code><span>context</span> <span>=</span> <span>canvas</span>.<span>getContext</span>(<span>'webgpu'</span>);
<span>const</span> <span>canvasFormat</span> <span>=</span> <span>"bgra8unorm"</span>;

<span>const</span> <span>contextConfiguration</span> <span>=</span> {
    <span>device</span><span>:</span> <span>device</span>,
    <span>format</span><span>:</span> <span>canvasFormat</span>,
    <span>alphaMode</span><span>:</span> <span>'opaque'</span>,
};
<span>context</span>.<span>configure</span>(<span>contextConfiguration</span>);
</code></pre>
<h3>Creating a GPURenderPipeline</h3>
<p>A <code>GPURenderPipeline</code> or a corresponding <code>GPUComputePipeline</code> are used to configure the pipeline state of the graphics driver. This pipeline state is then used in a <code>GPURenderPassEncoder</code> or <code>GPUComputePassEncoder</code> as later illustrated.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> <span>shaderModule</span> <span>=</span> <span>device</span>.<span>createShaderModule</span>({ <span>code</span><span>:</span> <span>wgslSource</span> });
<span>const</span> <span>vertexStageDescriptor</span> <span>=</span> { <span>module</span><span>:</span> <span>shaderModule</span>, <span>entryPoint</span><span>:</span> <span>"vsmain"</span> };
<span>const</span> <span>fragmentStageDescriptor</span> <span>=</span> { <span>module</span><span>:</span> <span>shaderModule</span>, <span>entryPoint</span><span>:</span> <span>"fsmain"</span> };
<span>const</span> <span>renderPipelineDescriptor</span> <span>=</span> {
    <span>layout</span><span>:</span> <span>'auto'</span>,
    <span>vertex</span><span>:</span> <span>vertexStageDescriptor</span>,
    <span>fragment</span><span>:</span> <span>fragmentStageDescriptor</span>,
    <span>primitive</span><span>:</span> {<span>topology</span><span>:</span> <span>"triangle-list"</span> },
};
<span>const</span> <span>renderPipeline</span> <span>=</span> <span>device</span>.<span>createRenderPipeline</span>(<span>renderPipelineDescriptor</span>);
</code></pre>
<h3>Issuing draw calls</h3>
<p>A <code>GPURenderPassEncoder</code> is created to send draw calls to the graphics driver. In the below example, we draw a simple triangle which contains three vertices. A <code>GPURenderPassEncoder</code> can also draw multiple instances of the same geometry or draw from an offset of a vertex buffer.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> <span>colorAttachmentDescriptor</span> <span>=</span> {
    <span>view</span><span>:</span> <span>renderAttachment</span>,
    <span>loadOp</span><span>:</span> <span>"clear"</span>,
    <span>storeOp</span><span>:</span> <span>"store"</span>,
    <span>clearColor</span><span>:</span> { <span>r</span><span>:</span> <span>0.15</span>, <span>g</span><span>:</span> <span>0.15</span>, <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>0.5</span>, <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span> }
};
<span>const</span> <span>renderPassDescriptor</span> <span>=</span> { <span>colorAttachments</span><span>:</span> [<span>colorAttachmentDescriptor</span>] };
<span>const</span> <span>commandEncoder</span> <span>=</span> <span>device</span>.<span>createCommandEncoder</span>();
<span>const</span> <span>renderPassEncoder</span> <span>=</span> <span>commandEncoder</span>.<span>beginRenderPass</span>(<span>renderPassDescriptor</span>);
<span>renderPassEncoder</span>.<span>setPipeline</span>(<span>renderPipeline</span>);
<span>const</span> <span>vertexBufferSlot</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>;
<span>renderPassEncoder</span>.<span>setVertexBuffer</span>(<span>vertexBufferSlot</span>, <span>vertexBuffer</span>, <span>0</span>);
<span>renderPassEncoder</span>.<span>draw</span>(<span>3</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>0</span>); <span>// 3 vertices, 1 instance, 0th vertex, 0th instance.
</span><span>renderPassEncoder</span>.<span>end</span>();
<span>const</span> <span>commandBuffer</span> <span>=</span> <span>commandEncoder</span>.<span>finish</span>();
<span>const</span> <span>queue</span> <span>=</span> <span>device</span>.<span>queue</span>;
<span>queue</span>.<span>submit</span>([<span>commandBuffer</span>]);
</code></pre>
<h2>WebGPU Shading Language</h2>
<p>WebGPU introduces WGSL, a platform independent shading language for the web. Here is an example of a WGSL shader source that would be passed in place of <code>wgslSource</code> in the above API call:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> <span>wgslSource</span> <span>=</span> `
    <span>struct</span> <span>Vertex</span> {
        @<span>builtin</span>(<span>position</span>) <span>Position</span><span>:</span> <span>vec4</span><span>&lt;</span><span>f32</span><span>&gt;</span>,

    }

    @<span>vertex</span> <span>fn</span> <span>vsmain</span>(@<span>builtin</span>(<span>vertex_index</span>) <span>VertexIndex</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span>) <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Vertex</span>
    {
        <span>var</span> <span>pos</span><span>:</span> <span>array</span><span>&lt;</span><span>vec2</span><span>&lt;</span><span>f32</span><span>&gt;</span>, <span>3</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>array</span><span>&lt;</span><span>vec2</span><span>&lt;</span><span>f32</span><span>&gt;</span>, <span>3</span><span>&gt;</span>(
            <span>vec2</span><span>&lt;</span><span>f32</span><span>&gt;</span>( <span>0.0</span>,  <span>0.5</span>),

            <span>vec2</span><span>&lt;</span><span>f32</span><span>&gt;</span>( <span>0.5</span>, <span>-</span><span>0.5</span>));
        <span>var</span> <span>vertex_out</span> <span>:</span> <span>Vertex</span>;
        <span>vertex_out</span>.<span>Position</span> <span>=</span> <span>vec4</span><span>&lt;</span><span>f32</span><span>&gt;</span>(<span>pos</span>[<span>VertexIndex</span>], <span>0.0</span>, <span>1.0</span>);

        <span>return</span> <span>vertex_out</span>;
    }

	<div>
								


<div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In Proclamation 10467 of October 6, 2022 (Granting Pardon for the Offense of Simple Possession of Marijuana), I exercised my authority under the Constitution to pardon individuals who committed or were convicted of the offense of simple possession of marijuana in violation of the Controlled Substances Act and section 48–904.01(d)(1) of the Code of the District of Columbia (D.C. Code).&nbsp; As I have said before, convictions for simple possession of marijuana have imposed needless barriers to employment, housing, and educational opportunities.&nbsp; Through this proclamation, consistent with the grant of Proclamation 10467, I am pardoning additional individuals who may continue to experience the unnecessary collateral consequences of a conviction for simple possession of marijuana, attempted simple possession of marijuana, or use of marijuana.&nbsp; Therefore, acting pursuant to the grant of authority in Article&nbsp;II, Section 2, of the Constitution of the United States, I, Joseph&nbsp;R. Biden Jr., do hereby grant a full, complete, and unconditional pardon to all current United States citizens and lawful permanent residents who, on or before the date of this proclamation, committed or were convicted of the offense of simple possession of marijuana, attempted simple possession of marijuana, or use of marijuana, regardless of whether they have been charged with or prosecuted for these offenses on or before the date of this proclamation, in violation of:</p><p>(1) &nbsp;section 844 of title 21, United States Code, section 846 of title 21, United States Code, and previous provisions in the United States Code that prohibited simple possession of marijuana or attempted simple possession of marijuana;&nbsp;</p><p>(2) &nbsp;section 48-904.01(d)(1) of the D.C. Code and previous provisions in the D.C. Code that prohibited simple possession of marijuana;</p><p>(3) &nbsp;section 48-904.09 of the D.C. Code and previous provisions in the D.C. Code that prohibited attempted simple possession of marijuana; and</p><p>(4) &nbsp;provisions in the Code of Federal Regulations, including as enforced under the United States Code, that prohibit only the simple possession or use of marijuana on Federal properties or installations, or in other locales, as currently or previously codified, including but not limited to 25 C.F.R. 11.452(a); 32 C.F.R. 1903.12(b)(2); 36 C.F.R. 2.35(b)(2); 36 C.F.R. 1002.35(b)(2); 36 C.F.R. 1280.16(a)(1); 36 C.F.R. 702.6(b); 41 C.F.R. 102-74.400(a); 43 C.F.R. 8365.1-4(b)(2); and 50 C.F.R. 27.82(b)(2).</p></div>



<div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My intent by this proclamation is to pardon only the offenses of simple possession of marijuana, attempted simple possession of marijuana, or use of marijuana in violation of the Federal and D.C. laws set forth in paragraphs (1) through (3) of this proclamation, as well as the provisions in the Code of Federal Regulations consistent with paragraph (4) of this proclamation, and not any other offenses involving other controlled substances or activity beyond simple possession of marijuana, attempted simple possession of marijuana, or use of marijuana, such as possession of marijuana with intent to distribute or driving offenses committed while under the influence of marijuana. &nbsp;This pardon does not apply to individuals who were non-citizens not lawfully present in the United States at the time of their offense.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pursuant to the procedures in Proclamation 10467, the Attorney General, acting through the Pardon Attorney, shall review all properly submitted applications for certificates of pardon and shall issue such certificates of pardon to eligible applicants in due course.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day of December, in the year of our Lord two&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;twenty-three, and of the Independence of the United&nbsp;States of&nbsp;America the two&nbsp;hundred and forty-eighth.</p></div>

Gwen’s post says that there are many anomalies that aren’t classified in the ANSI SQL ‘92 spec.</p><blockquote><p><span>It turned out that defining a perfect state and then defining some states where certain anomalies can happen has this fundamental problem: There may be anomalies you didn't think of. So, only three years after the SQL92 standard came out, a very impressive team of researchers published </span><strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0701157.pdf" rel="">A Critique of ANSI SQL Isolation Levels (1995)</a></strong><span>. The paper introduced a whole collection of anomalies that weren't specified in the standard, and therefore were technically allowed at the Serializable level.</span></p></blockquote><p>These new-found anomalies make database isolation ambiguous:</p><blockquote><p>Different databases support different isolation levels, and the same isolation level can mean different things in different databases.</p></blockquote><p><span>This leads to the final post I want to call out: </span><a href="https://jepsen.io/analyses/mysql-8.0.34" rel="">Jepsen’s MySQL Analysis</a><span>. Jepsen is a project run by Kyle Kingsbury alter ego, </span><a href="https://aphyr.com/about" rel="">Aphyr</a><span>. Kyle and his team use Jepsen to break databases. Kyle and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peteralvaro/" rel="">Peter Avlaro</a><span>’s latest post finds anomalies with MySQL and Amazon RDS.</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>We revisit Kleppmann’s 2014 </span><a href="https://github.com/ept/hermitage/blob/master/mysql.md" rel="">Hermitage</a><span> and confirm that MySQL’s Repeatable Read still allows G2-item, G-single, and lost update. Using our transaction consistency checker </span><a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/elle" rel="">Elle</a><span>, we show that MySQL Repeatable Read also violates internal consistency. Furthermore, it violates Monotonic Atomic View: transactions can observe some of another transaction’s effects, then later fail to observe other effects of that same transaction. We demonstrate violations of ANSI SQL’s requirements for Repeatable Read.</span></em></p></blockquote><p>Similar to Gwen’s post, they find anomalies and that don’t adhere to the ANSI ‘92 spec. But the behavior they find is much worse than PostgreSQL’s behavior. If you’re using MySQL, I recommend reading the post; they provide suggestions to mitigate some of the issues.</p><p>But what caught my eye was their plea to the standards bodies:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f8170b4-97c8-4441-8505-e9100af038a6_1590x952.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f8170b4-97c8-4441-8505-e9100af038a6_1590x952.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f8170b4-97c8-4441-8505-e9100af038a6_1590x952.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f8170b4-97c8-4441-8505-e9100af038a6_1590x952.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f8170b4-97c8-4441-8505-e9100af038a6_1590x952.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f8170b4-97c8-4441-8505-e9100af038a6_1590x952.png" width="1456" height="872" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3f8170b4-97c8-4441-8505-e9100af038a6_1590x952.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:872,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:363384,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f8170b4-97c8-4441-8505-e9100af038a6_1590x952.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f8170b4-97c8-4441-8505-e9100af038a6_1590x952.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f8170b4-97c8-4441-8505-e9100af038a6_1590x952.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f8170b4-97c8-4441-8505-e9100af038a6_1590x952.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Jepsen’s call for better isolation levels mirror Gwen’s.

<p>Antibiotic-resistant bacteria have become a rapidly growing threat to public health. Each year, they account for more than 2.8 million infections, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Without new antibiotics, even common injuries and infections harbor the potential to become lethal.</p>
<p>Scientists are now one step closer to eliminating that threat, thanks to a Texas A&amp;M University-led collaboration that has developed a new family of polymers capable of killing bacteria without inducing antibiotic resistance by disrupting the membrane of these microorganisms.</p>
<p>“The new polymers we synthesized could help fight antibiotic resistance in the future by providing antibacterial molecules that operate through a mechanism against which bacteria do not seem to develop resistance,” said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.chem.tamu.edu/faculty/quentin-michaudel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Quentin Michaudel</a>, an assistant professor in the&nbsp;<a href="https://artsci.tamu.edu/chemistry/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Chemistry</a>&nbsp;and lead investigator in the research,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2311396120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published Dec. 11</a>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pnas.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>&nbsp;(PNAS)</a>.</p>
<p>Working at the interface of organic chemistry and polymer science, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.michaudellab.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michaudel Laboratory</a> was able to synthesize the new polymer by carefully designing a positively charged molecule that can be stitched many times to form a large molecule made of the same repeating charged motif using a carefully selected catalyst called AquaMet. According to Michaudel, that catalyst proves key, given that it has to tolerate a high concentration of charges and also be water-soluble — a feature he describes as uncommon for this type of process.</p>
<p>After achieving success, the Michaudel Lab put its polymers to the test against two main types of antibiotic-resistant bacteria — E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) — in collaboration with <a href="https://www.umass.edu/engineering/about/directory/jessica-schiffman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Jessica Schiffman’s</a> group at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. While awaiting those results, the researchers also tested their polymers’ toxicity against human red blood cells.</p>
</div>
<div role="region" aria-label="Texas A&amp;M Team Develops Novel Antibacterial Polymers That Can Kill Bacteria content 1">
<p>“A common issue with antibacterial polymers is a lack of selectivity between bacteria and human cells when targeting the cellular membrane,” Michaudel explained. “The key is to strike a right balance between effectively inhibiting bacteria growth and killing several types of cells indiscriminately.”</p>
<p>Michaudel credits the multidisciplinary nature of scientific innovation and the generosity of dedicated researchers across the Texas A&amp;M campus and country as factors in his team’s success in determining the perfect catalyst for their molecule assembly.</p>
<p>“This project was several years in the making and would not have been possible without the help of several groups, in addition to our UMass collaborators,” Michaudel said. “For instance, we had to ship some samples to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.letterilab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Letteri Lab</a>&nbsp;at the University of Virginia to determine the length of our polymers, which required the use of an instrument that few labs in the country have. We are also tremendously grateful to [biochemistry Ph.D. candidate] Nathan Williams and&nbsp;<a href="https://bcbp.tamu.edu/people/pellois-jean-philippe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Jean-Philippe Pellois</a>&nbsp;here at Texas A&amp;M, who provided their expertise in our assessment of toxicity against red blood cells.”</p>
<p>Michaudel says the team will now focus on improving the activity of its polymers against bacteria — specifically, their selectivity for bacterial cells versus human cells — before moving on to <em>in vivo</em>&nbsp;assays.</p>
<p>“We are in the process of synthesizing a variety of analogs with that exciting goal in mind,” he said.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Police in 34 countries arrested 3500 people and seized assets worth $300 million in the latest iteration of what has become an annual coordinated global crackdown on cybercrime.</p><p><a href="https://www.interpol.int/en/News-and-Events/News/2023/USD-300-million-seized-and-3-500-suspects-arrested-in-international-financial-crime-operation">According to Interpol</a>, Operation HAECHI IV ran from July to December and targeted seven types of scams: voice phishing, romance scams, online sextortion, investment fraud, money laundering associated with illegal online gambling, business email compromise fraud, and e-commerce fraud.</p><p>As a result of the operation, authorities blocked 82,112 suspicious bank accounts, seizing a total of $199 million in hard currency and a further $101 million worth of virtual assets.</p><p>Interpol’s executive director of police services, Stephen Kavanagh, said the “staggering” sum seized was a clear illustration of the incentives that were driving an explosive growth in transnational organized crime.</p><p>“This represents the savings and hard-earned cash of victims,” he said. “This vast accumulation of unlawful wealth is a serious threat to global security and weakens the economic stability of nations worldwide.”</p><p>Interpol said Operation HAECHI IV involved investigators working together to detect online fraud and freeze associated bank and virtual asset service provider accounts using Interpol’s Global Rapid Intervention of Payments (I-GRIP), a stop-payment mechanism which helps countries work together to block criminal proceeds.</p><p>Interpol helped frontline officers identify 367 virtual asset accounts linked to transnational organized crime. Assets in those accounts have been frozen as local police continue their investigations.</p><h2>Dragnet pulls in more AI-powered crime</h2><p>In one case resulting from the operation, Filipino and Korean authorities worked together to apprehend a “high-profile online gambling criminal” who was arrested in Manila after spending two years on the run from Korea's National Police Agency. The illegal gambling operation the man allegedly ran was dismantled.</p><p>Interpol published two “purple notices” – warnings about emerging digital investment fraud practices – during the operation.</p><p>One alerted police around the world to a new scam detected in Korea involving the sale of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with promises of huge returns, which turned out to be a <a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/analysis/crypto-nft-losses-believed-to-hit-25-trillion-says-industry-researcher">“rug pull” scam</a> where the developers abruptly abandon a project and investors lose their money.</p><p>The second purple notice warned about the use of AI and deep fake technology to lend credibility to scams by enabling criminals to hide their identities and to pretend to be a family member, friend, or love interests of the person they are attempting to dupe.</p><p>“The UK leg of the operation reported several cases where AI-generated synthetic content was used to deceive, defraud, harass, and extort victims, particularly through impersonation scams, online sexual blackmail, and investment fraud,” Interpol said.</p><p>“Cases also involved the impersonation of people known to the victims through voice cloning technology.”</p><p>Investment fraud, business email compromise and e-commerce fraud accounted for 75 per cent of cases investigated during the operation.</p><h2>Arrests and seizures keep growing</h2><p>A similar operation last year, <a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/brief/interpol-cybercrime-crackdown-leads-to-seizure-of-130m">HAECHI III</a>, netted almost 1000 arrests and $130 million in assets.</p><p>“HAECHI IV’s 200 per cent surge in arrests shows the persistent challenge of cyber-enabled crime, reminding us to stay alert and keep refining our tactics against online fraud, which is why INTERPOL operations like this are so important” Kavanagh said.</p><p>The first operation in the series, HAECHI-I, involved police from nine countries in Asia working together between September 2020 and March 2021 to make 585 arrests and seize $83 million.</p><p>Interpol’s head of National Central Bureau in Korea, Kim Dong Kwon, praised the international policing effort that led to the increased results achieved by HAECHI IV.</p><p>“Despite criminals' endeavors to gain illicit advantages through contemporary trends, they will eventually be apprehended and face due punishment. To accomplish this, Project HAECHI will consistently evolve and expand its scope.”</p><p>As SentinalOne explained in a 2021 <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-in-cybersecurity-week-49-3/">post about HAECHI-II</a>: in Korea, Haechi is a popular mythical animal widely used as a symbol of justice. The countries participating in this year’s operation were: Argentina, Australia, Brunei, Cambodia, Cayman Islands, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Japan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Liechtenstein, Malaysia, Maldives, Mauritius, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Poland, Korea, Romania, Seychelles, Singapore, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States and Vietnam. Hong Kong also participated.</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

                                        <p>A central Ohio building that once served as the global headquarters for CompuServe has been recognized with historic marker status by the state.</p><p>At its height in the 1990's, the pioneering tech company — one of the first to offer commercial internet services — was known by the public for online forums that offered news, message boards and data file transfers. The firm also introduced the GIF image format back in 1987.</p><p>“This may be the first historical marker about the internet. Most history is not recognized and celebrated in your lifetime, but this is and its really special,” said Ohio Lt. Governor Jon Husted at a dedication event featuring state officials and former CompuServe CEO Jeff Wilkins. “Today we have a vibrant, growing tech economy in the state of Ohio. And it began right here.”</p><p>The company opened its headquarters in 1973 and, according to records housed at the Columbus Metropolitan Library, closed the location in the summer of 2006. Ohio's historical markers program, started in the 1953, commemorates unique sites that shape state history.</p><p>Wilkins, who co-founded CompuServe in 1969, also attempted settle a classic internet argument over the pronunciation of the GIF image format at the dedication. He recalled a story about how Steve Wilhite, the engineer who helped create the format, once held up a sign at an awards ceremony read: “It’s pronounced JIF.”</p>

Earlier this year, </span><em>Motley Fool</em><span> was already reporting that </span><a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/02/21/hyperloop-startups-are-dying-a-quiet-death/" rel="">things were tough in Hyperloop world</a><span> with startups “dying a quiet death” as higher interest rates meant investors weren’t going for projects that were clearly never going to pay off.</span></p><p><span>Hyperloop One, previously known as </span><em>Virgin</em><span> Hyperloop One, was struggling too. Last year it finally had to admit its passenger tube dreams were never going to be realized, so it tried to </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60478719" rel="">convince some Emiratis</a><span> that narrow, low-capacity tubes were actually going to be a great way of moving cargo. Well, they clearly didn’t buy it for long because yesterday </span><em>Bloomberg</em><span> reported Hyperloop One is </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-21/hyperloop-one-to-shut-down-after-raising-millions-to-reinvent-transit" rel="">finally shutting down</a><span>.</span></p><p>To be clear, Hyperloop One is not associated with Musk himself. After launching in 2014, it was partly funded from Richard Branson’s fortune for a while, but even that didn’t last, with the Virgin branding disappearing along with the vision for transforming passenger transportation. I sincerely hope the media (and investors) take its collapse as a sign to stop giving any oxygen to Hyperloop fantasies. The technology was never really meant to go anywhere. Its main goal was always to stop a better transport future from being realized.</p><p>A decade on, people often forget what was really motivating the Hyperloop when Musk first started pushing it. In the early 2010s, there was a big debate around California’s plan to build a high-speed rail line from Los Angeles to San Francisco, with further extensions to San Diego and Sacramento to follow. Naturally, conservative, automotive, and airline interests were vehemently opposed to a technology that Japan and Europe had been living with for decades arriving on American shores because it threatened their commercial interests.</p><p><span>Elon Musk, as an automaker and (let’s be honest) somewhat of a conservative himself, eagerly adopted the arguments against the bullet train with his own spin. He began incessantly repeating a line he </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qox_m6jyfmA" rel="">doled out</a><span> at the D11 conference with Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher in 2013, calling it, “the slowest bullet train in the world and the most expensive bullet train per mile in the world” — and that meant it not only had to be opposed, but that the geniuses in Silicon Valley could surely do better than people who actually had a clue about trains and transportation.</span></p><p><span>When he unveiled the Hyperloop concept, Musk claimed that building it on the Los Angeles to San Francisco route would not only result in a far faster trip, but would also cost only a fraction of the price — as little as $6 billion. That figure was immediately debunked by people who </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130819164738/http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/8/14/economists-don-tbelievethehyperloop.html" rel="">actually understood what went into building that kind of infrastructure</a><span>, with the real cost estimated around at least $100 billion, even though it would have far less capacity than a high-speed train. But there’s another feature that’s often forgotten: the Hyperloop was also for cars. “You just drive on, and the pod departs,” Musk told </span><em>Bloomberg Businessweek</em><span> in </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130815003336/http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-08-12/revealed-elon-musk-explains-the-hyperloop" rel="">his first interview</a><span> about the idea. That fantasy would show up again in the Boring Company a few years later.</span></p><p><span>In 2013, Musk’s star was rising. He was gracing the covers of magazines and being hailed as our future-builder. He’d already served as inspiration for Robert Downey Jr.’s take on Tony Stark in </span><em>Iron Man</em><span> and was largely seen as a man who could do no wrong. When he chose to speak out against the bullet train, that amplified the campaign against it, further seeping political support from an already challenged project. And that was the point. Musk never had any intention of building the Hyperloop. He only needed it to help kill or substantially delay the high-speed rail project and the alternate vision of sustainable </span><em>collective</em><span> transportation it offered. It threatened his interests as an automaker and his elite vision of “individualized” mobility that simply worked better for him.</span></p><p><span>In 2015, Ashlee Vance’s biography </span><em>Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future</em><span> was published to an audience eager to consume a hagiography of the man supposedly saving the world and preparing us to colonize the stars. But buried within those 300-odd pages was an admission that many people seemed to have glossed over. On the subject of the Hyperloop, Vance wrote,</span></p><blockquote><p>Musk told me that the idea originated out of his hatred for California’s proposed high-speed rail system. … He insisted the Hyperloop would cost about $6 billion to $10 billion, go faster than a plane, and let people drive their cars onto a pod and drive out into a new city. At the time, it seemed that Musk had dished out the Hyperloop proposal just to make the public and legislators rethink the high-speed train. He didn’t actually intend to build the thing. … With any luck, the high-speed rail would be canceled. Musk said as much to me during a series of e-mails and phone calls leading up to the announcement.</p></blockquote><p><span>The only thing that could be clearer is if Vance released the e-mails and phone calls he’s referring to, but what he wrote is conclusive enough. Years later, after I </span><a href="https://twitter.com/parismarx/status/1167410460125097990" rel="">began</a><span> </span><a href="https://time.com/6203815/elon-musk-flaws-billionaire-visions/" rel="">resurrecting</a><span> that passage, Vance </span><a href="https://jalopnik.com/did-musk-propose-hyperloop-to-stop-california-high-spee-1849402460" rel="">claimed</a><span> my telling was “vaguely accurate but a disingenuous take on the situation.” Speaking to </span><em>Jalopnik</em><span> in 2022, he said, “I honestly do not think that was the goal of Hyperloop at all. I think if there was a better public transport system, my impression — and I think it’s genuine — is that Elon would be all for it.” Yet that completely contradicted what he had written years earlier, that Musk wanted to make lawmakers “rethink the high-speed train” and hoped it “would be canceled.”</span></p><p><span>Vance’s original telling is more credible because stopping collective transport projects has become a pattern for Musk. He proposed the Hyperloop to imperil high-speed rail. He also proposed the Boring Company tunnel system as his solution to traffic, after previously believing </span><a href="https://la.curbed.com/2018/11/9/18077612/elon-musk-mayor-garcetti-tunnels-boring-company" rel="">double-decker highways</a><span> would do the trick, instead of advocating for much better public transit because he felt transit was “</span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-awkward-dislike-mass-transit/" rel="">a pain in the ass</a><span>” and suggested it was filled with serial killers. Counter to Vance’s more recent suggestion, there’s no evidence Musk would back better public transit, but plenty that he wanted to stall out plans for improved collective transport altogether. He did exactly that with the Boring Company: selling cities </span><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/08/elon-musks-biggest-boondoggle.html" rel="">useless tunnels</a><span> that were rarely ever built and which often displaced realistic transit plans.</span></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.disconnect.blog/p/the-hyperloop-was-always-a-scam?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.disconnect.blog/p/the-hyperloop-was-always-a-scam?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p><span>Unfortunately, the harm of the Hyperloop went far beyond California. Companies claiming they’d realize the bullshit idea claimed to be moving forward with projects in </span><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-after-hype-over-hyperloop-why-theres-a-question-mark-over-ultra-modern-project-6223864/" rel="">India</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/uae/transport/virgin-hyperloop-aims-for-2022-test-launch-as-chief-warns-against-rushing-technology-1.842589" rel="">Dubai</a><span>, </span><a href="https://lareleveetlapeste.fr/lhyperloop-delon-musk-un-fiasco-planetaire-qui-a-coute-plus-de-55-millions-deuros-a-la-metropole-de-toulouse/" rel="">France</a><span>, </span><a href="https://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/alta-hyperloop-project-awaiting-government-meeting-committing-to-stop-in-red-deer-1.6217544" rel="">Canada</a><span>, and countless other parts of the world only for every single one to amount to nothing. Sure, some short tubes got built in a few places to try to keep squeezing money out of investors and governments, but the only thing they really achieved was to distract people with fantasies while they could’ve been focused on building something real.</span></p><p><span>In the time since California started talking about high-speed rail and Elon Musk interjected with his fantasy to help sidetrack it, China moved ahead and built a network consisting of 42,000 kilometres (26,000 miles) of track. Europe is continuing to expand its own network, and Japan is building a maglev line that will run at speeds of over 500 km/h (310 mph). The first segment from Tokyo to Nagoya could </span><a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/12/15/japan/maglev-shinkansen-opening-delayed/" rel="">open by 2027</a><span>. Not to be outdone, China is working on </span><a href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/travel/china-completes-first-operation-of-worlds-fastest-train-that-travels-at-600-kmhour-16321471.htm" rel="">a maglev of its own</a><span> to beat its Japanese rivals.</span></p><p><span>While the Hyperloop deception spread far and wide, nowhere was it stronger than in the United States. As countries around the world </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_high-speed_railway_lines" rel="">moved forward</a><span> with real transport improvements, North Americans were distracted by the fantasies of clueless, but self-confident tech moguls. They left people trapped in their cars and denied better options to get around that people in many other parts of the world — even those that are quite a bit poorer — take for granted. Now all they can do is shovel money at automakers to try to power cars with batteries instead of internal combustion engines. They have no vision for a better, less car dependent alternative.</span></p><p>The tech industry’s move into transportation was not only a failure; it was an active campaign to deny the public access to better transit and trains because the billionaires of Silicon Valley don’t personally want to get around that way. The Hyperloop was one part of that, but so were the Boring Company, ride-hailing services, and self-driving cars. The Hyperloop’s failure provides a lesson we’re learning far too late: that Silicon Valley won’t deliver us a better world if they can’t find some way to profit off it. We need to stop falling for their grand deceptions, and tell our media to stop echoing them too.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>
