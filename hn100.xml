<p xmlns:plos="http://plos.org">Hegemonic psychiatric models in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, centered on the notion of disease, were willing to consider a single ’natural’ primary cause—either biochemical or neurophysiological–as sufficient explanation for complex psychological and social phenomena like psychosis or depression. The pharmacological treatment of mental health conditions came to be understood solely in terms of metabolic replenishment to fight a putative ’chemical imbalance’, without a true need to delve into the recesses of the patients’ minds and bodies.</p>
<p xmlns:plos="http://plos.org">These overly simplistic models collapsed in the past two decades, and the trend is now the opposite, towards the recognition that mental health conditions are to a large extent, a social construct produced by lifestyles that jeopardize the essential tenets of good health: sleep, nutrition, exercise, introspection, and mind-body connection. Although psychiatric drugs are widely prescribed as ’effective’ treatment, the number of people diagnosed with mental health conditions has increased substantially in the past decades. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the prevalence of mental health conditions has risen from 416 million people in 1990 to over 615 million people in recent years [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref001">1</a>]. Similarly, the U.S. National Survey on Drug Use and Health has reported significant increases in rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, particularly among young adults, over the past decade [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref002">2</a>]. A significant increase in the diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children has also been reported in the U.S. [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref003">3</a>] and other countries. These increases have been attributed to better diagnosis and the increasing prevalence of conditions like anxiety and depression, which likely reflect the negative impact of contemporary lifestyle on mental health. Nevertheless, two other factors often overlooked, may also contribute to explain increase: the iatrogenic effects of psychotropic drugs, and overdiagnosis due to financial conflicts of interest, or prejudice against neurodivergence, as may be the case of ADHD and certain forms of autism.</p>
<p xmlns:plos="http://plos.org">Like Thomas Insel, head of the National Institute of Mental Health for 13 years, publicly acknowledged during the 2017 Psychedelic Science meeting in Oakland, even though psychiatrists feel that they have come a long way in recent decades, patients are drowning in anxiety, depression, despair, and suicide. At the same time, there is a growing interest in traditional holistic practices and therapies, from Yoga, Qigong, and Capoeira, to gardening, meditation, and dreamwork. What is going on?</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section1"><h2>Medicalization should be reduced</h2><p>How can this situation be changed? First, psychiatry must reduce medicalization as a commitment to doing no harm, by engaging in the multidimensional construction of alternatives to the conventional paradigm, which despite being dominant, is ineffective in the face of the complex challenges that involve mental care, such as stigma, social exclusion, and violation of rights. Medicalization reduction works not with the concept of ’disease’, which explains the processes related to health-suffering-care solely in biological, chemical, and physical terms. Instead, it seeks to broaden the understanding of these processes through the dialogue with different sources of knowledge to create therapeutic environments capable of favoring the development of emancipation and autonomy, increasing the possibilities of the person in care to act on the problems and challenges that arise in life without resourcing to mandatory medical treatment, making use of health services only when necessary and focusing on the active participation of the subject in the treatment. Importantly, this approach works with the ’biographical perspective’, a fundamental principle related to the understanding that each person has a story to tell, which expresses the knowledge arising from their own experience.</p>
<p>In its most recent global report on mental health, the World Health Organization (WHO) drew attention to the urgency of transforming mental health care towards providing care based on respect for the rights and dignity of the people assisted: “<em>Around the world</em>, <em>mental health needs are considerable</em>, <em>but responses are insufficient and inadequate</em>” [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref001">1</a>]. An important aspect of the report is the emphasis placed on the importance of lived experience and the presentation of successful stories of medicalization reduction, which include many successful practices documented across several countries from the 1970s onwards, in the wake of the Psychiatric Reform. Consolidated examples of crisis care in Mental Health include the ‘Open Dialogue’ approach [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref004">4</a>], the ‘Soteria Houses’ [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref005">5</a>], and peer-run nursing homes such as ‘Peer Respite’ [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref006">6</a>], which have contributed to the reduction of chronicity, disabilities, and other harmful effects of the conventional ways of treating acute crises and psychic emergencies. Particularly interesting are the practices based on peer support, i.e., on mutual support between people who go through similar health distress and have the objective of enhancing the overcoming of the difficulties brought about by the experience of mental suffering through a relationship of equality, trust, and mutual respect between the participants of the group, i.e., the peers. The individual´s environmental and social setting seems to be the first target that should be addressed in any kind of treatment for mental health.</p>
</div>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section2"><h2>Mens sana in corpore sano</h2><p>There must be a change of focus from ‘disease’ to ‘healthy lifestyle’. To a large extent, rather than chemical imbalance in isolation, it is the physiological, hormonal, and psychological imbalance caused by poor sleep, inadequate nutrition, and scant exercise that snowballs into severe individual and social suffering. Psychiatry and other health-related specialties must engage in a consistent effort to rescue the basic tenets of health. There is abundant evidence that poor sleep increases the risks for a plethora of problems ranging from cognitive and emotional impairment to anxiety, depression and withdrawal of human helping [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref007">7</a>]. Fixing bedtime habits to promote better sleep is a simple yet critical step towards improving mental health.</p>
<p>Adequate nutrition is another key factor that often gets overlooked in the pursuit of better mental health. Unhealthy diets based on ultra-processed products, lacking in fibers and fermented food, and contaminated with pesticides and fertilizers, can decrease the microbiome diversity, promote body inflammation, hinder the immune response and lead to various disorders, including anxiety and depression [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref008">8</a>]. It is urgent to incorporate non-processed food, rich in fiber and fermented ingredients, into standard diets across the globe. It is also urgent to end the starvation that reaches nearly 10% of the world’s population.</p>
<p>Regular suitable exercise is the third essential aspect of mental health that often gets neglected. Sedentary lifestyles with little physical activity and much recreational screen time are associated to various mental health risks [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref009">9</a>]. Passive behaviors like watching television have been linked to an increased risk of depression [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref010">10</a>]. Fortunately, even a few minutes per day of moderate to vigorous exercise can have a major positive impact on cognition, mood, and overall health. In particular, non-Western integrative practices such as Yoga and Capoeira show promise to improve cognition, mood and overall well-being [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref011">11</a>,<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref012">12</a>]. Beyond the benefits rooted in the exercise´s characteristics and physiological demands, their practitioners embrace them as a philosophy of life, fostering a sense of belonging and community that promotes a healthy mental environment.</p>
</div>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section3"><h2>Inner dialogue is necessary</h2><p>A dialogue with the more visceral and subjective aspects of the mind is crucial for a healthy life, including the key role played by sexuality, and creative activities such as active imagination. A deeper engagement with proprioception, interoception and introspection can greatly catalyze healing processes, broadening self-understanding, and improving well-being. Non-iatrogenic activities such as nature exposure [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref013">13</a>], art therapy [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref014">14</a>], and gardening [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref015">15</a>] are protective against mental suffering. These expressive outlets offer unique, personalized paths towards healing and self-discovery, offering a holistic and integrated approach to psychiatry.</p>
<p>Likewise, the dialogue with discourse-based depth psychology, interrupted for nearly a century, should be resumed. Psychotherapy has proved itself not just as clinically effective, but also essential for treatment of most psychiatric cases [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref016">16</a>]. The quantitative structural analysis of patients’ dreams can offer profound insight into their mental state, as shown to be the case for the early diagnosis of schizophrenia [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref017">17</a>]. The analysis of the emotional content of dream reports, in particular nightmares, can provide valuable insight into different neurological conditions [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref018">18</a>]. Furthermore, automated speech analysis through machine learning can be successfully used to detect and track emotions over time [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref019">19</a>]. The emotional relevance of dreaming and the clinical effectiveness of talk therapy underscore the need for a multidimensional approach to mental health care, capable of listening attentively to the patients. Discourse analysis at the structural and symbolic levels gives introspective access to deeper layers of the psyche, may help to build the sense of meaning in life, and must be more widely integrated into treatment plans.</p>
</div>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section4"><h2>Psychiatry must dream a better society</h2><p>Mental health conditions are often caused by physiological imbalance that is socially constructed. Deficits in sleep, nutrition, exercise, introspection, and other pillars of good mental health do not occur in the vacuum, they are produced by how we live. Precarious working and housing conditions, unemployment, racism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, physical and symbolic violence, the war on people that use certain drugs, and other forms of social bias all contribute to mental suffering and need to be considered systemically. The individual’s environmental and social setting must be understood and improved through integrative practices. It is time to strive towards a more naturalistic and benign approach to promoting mental well-being, by strengthening the connections to one’s own body, nature, and community.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.madinamerica.com/2024/06/988-records-shared/">https://www.madinamerica.com/2024/06/988-records-shared/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40628395">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><em>Editor’s Note: This story is the second in a two-part series on 988. This piece addresses issues around privacy and the sharing of the contents of conversations for AI development. The first part addresses the increase in unwanted or coercive police and EMS interventions after 988’s implementation, and can be found here: <a href="https://www.madinamerica.com/2024/06/dramatic-rise-in-police-interventions-on-988-callers/">Dramatic Rise in Police Interventions on 988 Callers.</a></em></p>
<p><span>P</span>eople who call, text, or chat to the new national 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline are regularly greeted with a generic disclaimer that conversations may occasionally be recorded for quality assurance or training purposes. What callers are not told, however, is that their ensuing “confidential” conversation with a counselor in a time of crises may become part of an ever-growing cache of millions of recordings and transcripts of intimate conversations—and be shared, without caller consent, with researchers, AI developers, and corporations for their own undisclosed purposes in a rapidly growing AI industry.</p>
<p>Privacy experts and users themselves are increasingly concerned—and critical of the lack of transparency from <a href="https://988lifeline.org/">988Lifeline</a> administrators <a href="https://www.vibrant.org/">Vibrant Emotional Health</a> (Vibrant), and of the lack of appropriate oversight from the federal <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration</a> (SAMHSA). Indeed, call-center privacy policies range from sparse or non-existent to contradictory and downright deceptive about what’s actually occurring with 988 conversation data—and Vibrant and SAMHSA are refusing to even publicly discuss the evident problems.</p>
<p>While aggregated data such as numbers of calls, reasons for calls, and demographic information about callers is generally uncontroversial, the recorded or transcribed content of people’s conversations is much more personal.</p>
<h5><strong>988 privacy policies—and the dubious lack of them</strong></h5>
<p>As part of her work for a forthcoming <a href="https://translifeline.org/hotline/">Trans Lifeline</a> report on crisis hotlines, <a href="https://www.liz-latty.com/">Liz Latty</a> researched the terms of service and privacy policies for 988Lifeline and many of its participating call centers. Her conclusion about their data sharing practices? “At every turn, they distance themselves from clear, direct, concise, concrete communication on any of this,” said Latty. “There’s a huge, willful effort to obscure anything and everything that they’re doing. It’s not an accident.”</p>
<p>Reviewing more than fifty call center websites randomly for this article, and investigating other sources of information, it was difficult not to reach similar conclusions.</p>
<p>The 988Lifeline involves <a href="https://988lifeline.org/crisis-centers-by-state-and-u-s-territory/">200 call centers</a>, and conversation recordings and transcripts are apparently being stored in numerous places—with Vibrant and each call center, and/or with innumerable third-party software platforms that each call center may be using for managing calls, texts, or chats, including <a href="https://www.icarol.com/988-software/">iCarol</a>, <a href="https://www.ringcentral.com/us/en/blog/national-suicide-prevention-lifeline/">RingCentral</a>, <a href="https://coastalcloud.us/client-stories/life-affirming-work-bringing-modern-solutions-to-the-988-national-suicide-prevention-lifeline/">Coastal</a>, and Vibrant’s own “unified platform.”</p>
<p>Yet many call centers had <a href="https://carelinealaska.com/988-2/">no visible privacy policies</a> at all, while others were operated by health care companies that <a href="https://memorial.health/Resources/7ad07ff2-22c9-42af-a531-0e289b760aa1/MH-Privacy-Practices-ENG.pdf">outlined</a> their Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy obligations but didn’t mention 988 data.</p>
<p>Others had policies covering only website visitors—and even those were misleading. <em>The Markup</em> <a href="https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2023/06/13/suicide-hotlines-promise-anonymity-dozens-of-their-websites-send-sensitive-data-to-facebook">uncovered</a> that dozens of 988 websites covertly included tracking tools, such as buttons for 988-chat that also sent users’ personal information to Facebook.</p>
<p>Contradictory claims were common. For example, Vibrant promoted 988Lifeline as “<a href="https://988lifeline.org/about/">a leader in… mental health crisis care</a>” offering “confidential” conversations with trained counselors. However, Vibrant’s less prominent <a href="https://988lifeline.org/chat-terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a>—copied by many 988 call centers—emphasized in large capital letters that talking to a 988 counselor “DOES NOT CONSTITUTE” either “MENTAL HEALTH CARE” or “CONFIDENTIAL” communication.</p>
<p><a href="https://epic.org/">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a> (EPIC) counsel Chris Frascella called these latter claims a “red flag” that Vibrant wants to avoid HIPAA’s confidentiality requirements for mental health care records. “The fact that they’re saying it suggests that’s what they’re trying to do,” said Frascella.</p>

<p>SAMHSA’s 988 <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/988/faqs">FAQ</a> claimed that calls are recorded for internal “quality assurance” and “training” only, and Vibrant’s website <a href="https://988lifeline.org/chat-terms-of-service/">stated</a>, “Any information provided by you or collected on you will not be shared or disclosed with any third party.” Yet elsewhere on its website, Vibrant was openly <a href="https://988lifeline.org/research-proposals/">offering access to 988 data to third parties</a> “for research purposes” that could involve <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1521/suli.2007.37.3.291">secretly listening in</a> on conversations, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/sltb.12769">reviewing masses of recorded conversations</a>, or cross-linking datasets “that could potentially identify individuals who contacted the 988 Lifeline.” The “<a href="https://988sc.org/crisis-services-policy">Crisis Services Policy</a>” for South Carolina 988 also confirmed that “content of conversations” might be shared with “partners, researchers, or third parties.”</p>

<p>In a joint response to <em>Mad in America</em>, SAMHSA and Vibrant provided assurances that access to personally identifiable information of 988 contacts, such as full names and device numbers, is carefully restricted. But both declined to directly answer any of a dozen other submitted questions about 988 privacy policies and Vibrant’s or any call centers’ sharing or selling of audio or text records of conversations.</p>
<p>Some call centers are definitely profiting.</p>
<h5><strong>Sharing conversation data—the scandal that’s worsening</strong></h5>
<p>In 2022, <em>Politico</em> <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/28/suicide-hotline-silicon-valley-privacy-debates-00002617">exposed</a> that the nonprofit Crisis Text Line (CTL) had created <a href="https://loris.ai/">Loris</a>, a for-profit arm developing commercial customer-service software, and had shared with Loris millions of transcripts of conversations with people in crises. An FCC Commissioner <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/carr-letter-ftc-03222022.pdf">urged the Federal Trade Commission</a> to investigate whether CTL had obtained proper informed consent from texters.</p>
<p>CTL claimed the conversations were “<a href="https://www.crisistextline.org/blog/2022/01/31/an-update-on-data-privacy-our-community-and-our-service/">anonymized</a>.” However, while device numbers can be removed, during such crisis conversations people share many intimate—and potentially identity-revealing—details about themselves and their activities, workplaces, schools, family, and relationships.</p>
<p>Amid public outrage, CTL turned off the tap to Loris and published <a href="https://www.crisistextline.org/digital-rights/">more transparent policies</a>. Today, though, CTL is a 988 backup center and still <a href="https://www.crisistextline.org/data-philosophy/">shares records of conversations</a>&nbsp;with third parties.</p>
<p>Tim Reierson was the person who originally drew media attention to CTL’s commercial data-sharing. Since then, he’s spent much of his spare time <a href="https://reformcrisistextline.com/">researching and advocating</a> for better privacy practices at crisis hotlines. “It’s a calling, that I’m unable to leave or walk away from,” he said.</p>
<figure id="attachment_256970" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-256970"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.madinamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Picture4-257x300.jpg" alt="" width="257" height="300" srcset="https://www.madinamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Picture4-257x300.jpg 257w, https://www.madinamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Picture4-129x150.jpg 129w, https://www.madinamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Picture4-696x812.jpg 696w, https://www.madinamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Picture4-150x175.jpg 150w, https://www.madinamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Picture4-429x500.jpg 429w, https://www.madinamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Picture4.jpg 762w" sizes="(max-width: 257px) 100vw, 257px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-256970">Tim Reierson</figcaption></figure>
<p>Reierson loved volunteering at CTL. He was profoundly affected by texters who were struggling through much more oppressive or abusive circumstances than he’s ever lived through. “The situations that I listened to would keep you awake,” he said. “And it did keep me awake.”</p>
<p>At the same time, Reierson became inspired by the power of connection—how a fellow human simply “being there,” like hand holding, could help people find their own way to a better place. Over time, within him grew feelings of respect, responsibility, and even protectiveness towards these people he’d never met.</p>
<p>Then he learned how these same people were secretly being used by CTL. Reierson said he found it “deeply offensive” and “felt sick, physically so ill” about their being exploited as fodder for commercial machine-learning products—such as in eCommerce customer services and AI feedback on “agent effectiveness” at crisis call centers.</p>
<p>Reierson believes the much-touted notion that AI can learn “techniques” of compassionate human connection—and help or replace call-attendants—is “pseudoscience” and dangerous. “That is where a door is open to the loss of humanity,” said Reierson. “Analyzing a transcript, they are just words or letters put together in a certain order… The ‘being there’ is important. The warmth coming through.”</p>
<p>Even more, he criticizes crisis lines’ “betrayal” and exploitation of users. Reierson described circumstances that can make people, including children, desperately reach out for the one-to-one privacy that crisis hotlines promise—such as threats of domestic abuse, feelings of shame, or fears of public exposure. And then 988Lifeline secretly records these difficult, intensely personal, private confessions and shares them with others for their own purposes. “I have no tolerance for deception,” said Reierson.</p>
<p>Since the CTL scandal, though, these practices have actually—if somewhat surreptitiously—expanded and become embedded <em>within </em>988Lifeline.</p>
<h5><strong>Intimate conversations make the richest AI</strong></h5>
<p>The for-profit company <a href="https://protocallservices.com/">Protocall</a> runs the <a href="https://nmcrisisline.com/">New Mexico Crisis and Access Line 988 service</a> (NMCAL) and, in partnership with <a href="https://www.lyssn.io/">Lyssn</a>, a for-profit developing AI tools for behavioral health, received $2.1 million from the National Institute of Mental Health in 2023. Protocall and Lyssn are <a href="https://www.lyssn.io/nimh-awards-lyssn-first-of-its-kind-988-grant/">using recordings of 988 calls</a> to create software that will purportedly “evaluate the quality of crisis counseling” and teach call-attendants how to “sharpen their skills.”</p>
<p>When I pointed out to Protocall Privacy Officer Laura Schaefer that NMCAL’s <a href="https://nmcrisisline.com/privacy-policy/">privacy policy</a> didn’t disclose how the company handles 988 conversation data, Schaefer said, “We’ve got to do better at that.” Schaefer said that Protocall’s controls on personally identifiable information abide by HIPAA. However, the company doesn’t believe HIPAA applies to recorded conversations. Nevertheless, Schaefer later emailed that Protocall would add a “disclaimer” about using recorded conversations “for research” and would allow individual callers to request that recording be stopped.</p>
<p>The 988 call center Georgia Crisis and Access Line (GCAL) <a href="https://988ga.org/">appeared</a> to be operated by the Georgia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities (GDBHDD). GCAL’s website provided no terms of service or privacy policy. It also wasn’t disclosed that, in fact, Georgia’s 988 system is operated by the for-profit company <a href="https://behavioralhealthlink.com/crisis-services/georgia-crisis-and-access-line/">Behavioral Health Link</a> (BHL)—which I discovered only thanks to a tip from Reierson.</p>
<p>GCAL, GCAL’s Steering Committee, GDBHDD’s public affairs office, BHL, and BHL’s privacy officer all did not respond to many messages over months asking about GCAL’s privacy practices.</p>
<p>However, BHL’s own <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20240420160314/https:/behavioralhealthlink.com/privacy-policy/">privacy policy</a> said the company is “not a Covered Entity under HIPPA” (sic), and shares data it gathers with “Business Associates”—including <a href="https://www.carelonbehavioralhealth.com/perspectives/anniversary-of-988">Carelon Behavioral Health</a>, subsidiary of the even larger corporate giant <a href="https://www.elevancehealth.com/who-we-are/companies">Elevance Health</a>. Carelon also directly <a href="https://www.nh988.com/">operates New Hampshire 988</a> and has <a href="https://www.carelonresearch.com/">research</a> divisions using crisis conversations in AI tools to help <a href="https://www.carelonbehavioralhealth.com/content/dam/digital/carelon/cbh-assets/documents/global/Why-telebehavioral-health-is-here-to-stay-Comfort-convenience-and-effectiveness.pdf">deliver telehealth</a>. BHL described using caller data for developing <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20221202203617/https:/behavioralhealthlink.com/saas/">voice analysis technology</a> to assess the “emotional state” of callers, to “<a href="https://behavioralhealthlink.com/harnessing-artificial-intelligence-to-revolutionize-behavioral-health-care/">predict potential relapses</a>,” and to <a href="https://behavioralhealthlink.com/behavioral-health-software/">link</a> call center data with people’s electronic health records.</p>
<p>Elevance media liaison Tina Gaines confirmed via email that Carelon has access to GCAL “data systems” with which the company is doing unspecified “work.” She did not answer questions about Carelon’s uses of New Hampshire conversation recordings.</p>
<p>BHL’s research and development lead is <a href="https://behavioralhealthlink.com/about-us/leadership/">John Draper</a>, Vibrant’s former 988 director—and so perhaps a barometer for this burgeoning industry. While acknowledging in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lyTAkRnjRc">recent talk</a> that rampant nonconsensual privacy invasions fueling AI development could “break down public trust,” Draper nevertheless called himself a “huge fan” of Lyssn’s work and expressed enthusiasm about the role that AI can play in the future of crisis care.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/saving-lives-american-988-quality-service-plan.pdf">Report to Congress</a>, SAMHSA said “new technologies” would soon be monitoring calls in “real time” and helping call-attendants flag which callers might be at “imminent risk” of taking their own lives and therefore require police/EMS interventions. Ironically, people who’ve been subjected to such unwanted interventions and have asked for recordings of their calls to mount complaints against 988Lifeline have been told by Vibrant that all recordings are “confidential” and they must obtain court orders to get copies of their own calls. (See part one: <a href="https://www.madinamerica.com/2024/06/dramatic-rise-in-police-interventions-on-988-callers/">Dramatic Rise in Police Interventions on 988 Callers</a>.)</p>
<p>For one of those callers, Elle, learning subsequently about 988Lifeline’s data-sharing practices has been one more way that calling 988 has left her feeling used and abused. “I think it’s vastly inappropriate for them to monetize people’s pain and suffering,” said Elle. “And it feels extremely dystopian, and violative and disgusting.”</p>
<h5><strong>Simple Solutions</strong></h5>
<p>Is Reierson worried about what he sees in 988Lifeline’s privacy policies?</p>
<p>“It’s what I don’t see,” Reierson answered. “We have a basically unregulated environment. There isn’t any restriction on the secondary uses of those conversations. And I feel that SAMHSA and Vibrant Emotional Health, they both are negligent on this issue.”</p>
<p>Jason Kelly of <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (EFF) was also critical. “If I’m a caller of a helpline, I don’t expect that data from the call to be used to create an AI product. These [uses] are just totally off bounds, or should be, and should be very clear in any policy that an organization would have.”</p>
<p>Kelly raised questions about the risks of calling 988 for people seeking abortions or supporting a child’s gender transitions, especially if calls or recordings get transferred to states where those practices are now illegal. “It really makes me nervous,” said Kelly. “That data privacy issue really matters.”</p>
<p>Asked about such cross-state scenarios, Vibrant and SAMHSA declined to respond.</p>
<p>There would seem to be a solution: A brief, straightforward, highly visible privacy policy covering all 988 call centers that actually does what 988Lifeline advertises it does—protect the absolute confidentiality of all callers. Routinely delete recorded conversations within a very limited time. And implement a process for gathering clear, informed consent from both callers and call-attendants for their conversations to be shared for any research projects.</p>
<p>EPIC’s Frascella believes that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) could have cause to weigh in. “If you don’t say something in a privacy policy that you should say, then that is an unfair, deceptive act or practice,” he said. “It’s possible that the FTC might have authority to go after some of these [988] service providers.”</p>
<p>Reierson is especially disturbed by how Vibrant and SAMHSA are characterizing 988Lifeline as <em>not</em> a mental health service—thereby removing public legal protections that exist with health services even as 988Lifeline operates like a health service by providing counseling, keeping records on callers, and instigating police wellness checks and mobile crisis team visits with or without consent. “That makes 988 dangerous,” he said. “If we continue on as we are, these problems of accountability are just going to entrench further.”</p>

<p><strong>Edit: I want to preface this by saying yes the practices here are very bad and embarrassing (and we've since added robust unit/integration tests and alerting/logging), could/should have been avoided, were human errors beyond anything, and very obvious in hindsight.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This was from a different time under large time constraints at the very earliest stages (first few weeks) of a company. I'm mostly just sharing this as a funny story with unique circumstances surrounding bug reproducibility in prod (due again to our own stupidity) Please read with that in mind</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/asim-1717965968-0.png" alt="Asim Shrestha"></p>
<p>We first turned on monetization for our startup last May. We had low expectations but were pleasantly surprised when we got our first customer within an hour of launching. It was a magical moment. We sent them a thank you, gave each other a toast, and, given we’d just spent two late nights getting everything ready, promptly went to sleep.</p>
<p>We woke up that morning with over 40 gmail notifications of user complaints. E v e r y t h i n g seemed to have set on fire overnight. None of these users could subscribe. We had no idea why.</p>
<h3 id="our-path-to-monetization">Our path to monetization 🛣️</h3><p>For some background, May was the start of the S23 YC batch and we were unsure about the optimal direction to take post launch. Dalton, our YC group partner, advised us to use paying subscribers as a compass and told us to double whatever monthly price we already had in our heads. Eventually (and reluctantly) we landed at $40 a month. Following the meeting, we immediately got to work getting monetization set up. Our project was originally full stack NextJS but we wanted to first migrate everything to Python/FastAPI. We got this done (with some help from ChatGPT), got stripe fully integrated… and then followed this up with five days of the least sleep we’d get the whole month. (Yes five days was a long time to find this bug)</p>
<p>During that stretch of five days, we started to dread waking up—knowing we’d just be greeted with 30/40/50 emails of complaints. I still like to ponder exactly how many customers we lost through this. 50 emails/day x 5 days x <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mn>40</mn><mi>a</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi><mo>=</mo></mrow></math>10,000 a month in lost sales<strong>—and that was only from people who cared enough to complain.</strong> We’d respond to these emails like clock-work everyday. They would complain about an infinite loading spinner when they clicked subscribe, we’d investigate by opening a new account, verify that subscriptions were completely fine for us, and then carry on with our day confused. Nothing we did would replicate the issue, and even more strangely, we got close to zero complaints throughout our actual working hours.</p>
<h3 id="the-10000-hallucination">The $10,000 hallucination 💰</h3><p>The journey from identifying the issue to actually resolving it felt like it took months. Fast forwarding five days, countless emails, hundreds of sentry logs, long discord messages with stripe engineers, and hours upon hours of staring at five key files later, we found it 🎉. Try to see if you can spot it yourself before reading on.</p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/asim-1717965976-0.png" alt="Asim Shrestha"></p>
<p>If you haven’t found it yet, the culprit was a single, innocent looking line. A line that was the bane of our existence for that week. A line that quite literally cost us $10,000. The dreaded line 56.</p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/asim-1717965990-0.png" alt="Asim Shrestha"></p>
<p>What happened was that as part of our backend migration, we were translating database models from Prisma/Typescript into Python/SQLAlchemy. This was really tedious. We found that ChatGPT did a pretty exceptional job doing this translation and so we used it for almost the entire migration. We copy pasted the code it generated, saw everything worked fine, tried it in production, saw it also worked, and went on our merry way. At this point however, we still used our Next API for all database insertions. Python was only ever reading from the database. The first time we started actually inserting DB records in Python was when we implemented subscriptions. Though we created completely new SQLAlchemy models during the process by hand, we ended up just copying over the same format that ChatGPT wrote for our existing models. What we failed to notice was that we were copying over the same issue with the way we were generating IDs in all our models.</p>
<h3 id="bug-catching">Bug Catching 🐛</h3><p>The issue with line 56 was that we were just passing in a single hardcoded ID string instead of a function or lambda to generate UUIDs for our records, . This meant that for any given instance of our backend, once a single new user had subscribed and used this ID, no other user could perform the subscription flow again as it resulted in a unique ID collision. This problem became really well hidden because of our backend setup. We had eight ECS tasks on AWS, all running five instances of our backend (overkill, yes we know, but to be fair we had AWS credits). This meant any single user had a pool of potentially 40 unique IDs they could land upon.</p>
<p>During the work day, this was fine. We probably committed 10-20 times a day (directly to main of course) which would cause new backend deployments to occur, giving us 40 new IDs for customers to potentially use. At night however, when we finally stopped making commits (how lazy of us right?), the single ID in every server would get captured and cause all new subscriptions to have ID collisions. Users would start with 40 possible servers that could allow them to subscribe, and quickly end up with near zero as the night progressed. Finally solving this was like a weight being lifted from our shoulders. Adam quickly pushed up the fix after discovering this and for the first time that week we could finally rest easy (well not really since we still had ten other fires but those are stories for another write up).</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion 🤖</h3><p>In retrospect, however painful those five days were, it was one of those startup moments we’ll never forget. Like all startups, we've made a ton of mistakes throughout our journey with this perhaps being the worse. Maybe I'll share some of the rest down the line. We’re just happy that we can now look back at those days and laugh. Yes we should have done more testing. Yes we shouldn't have copy pasted code. Yes we shouldn't have pushed directly to main. Regardless, I don't regret the experience.</p>

<p>I've always been a fan of the Lego Technic series, especially those models that have gears and cranks and moving parts.
But it seems that Lego is shifting the focus of the Technic series away from functional models, so I had to take matters into my own hands.
I think an orrery is the perfect project to build out of Lego Technic parts as it makes for a cool display set and is functional at the same time.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery">orrery</a> is a scientific instrument that models the motion of the celestial bodies.
These are typically the orbital period and the period of the rotation around the axis of a body.
For example, the time it takes the moon to travel around the earth once is ~27 times the time it takes the earth to rotate around it's own axis (a day).
This relation is accurately modelled in an orrery.
However, the orrery does not model distances or the relative sizes of the celestial bodies.</p>
<p>I was very excited when I saw this <a href="https://jkbrickworks.com/earth-moon-and-sun-orrery/"><em>Earth, Moon and Sun Orrery</em> design by JK Brickworks</a> in 2016:</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/jkbrickworks.jpg">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/jkbrickworks_1280.jpg" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>This inspired me to build my own orrery with the same spheres for the sun, earth and moon, but my own custom designed mechanism:</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/orrery1.jpg">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/orrery1_1280.jpg" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>While working on this, I experimented with <a href="https://marian42.de/article/partdesigner/">3D printing custom fixtures to put Lego gears in</a>, but eventually moved on to building an orrery out of Lego parts only.
This orrery is special in the sense that it was designed by me, but it doesn't have any features beyond what the design from JK Brickworks has to offer.
It models the orbit of the earh around the sun, the orbit of the moon around the earth, and the spin of the sun, earth and moon.</p>
<p>The moon is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking">tidally locked</a> to the earth, meaning it rotates once per orbit.
One half of the moon always faces the earth and the other always points away from it.
(This also means that if you're on the surface of the moon, the earth always stays in the same spot in the sky.)
The tidal locking means that the rotation of the moon easy to implement in an orrery, since the moon will move correctly as soon as it is attached to an arm that goes around the earth at the correct orbital period.
You only model the orbital period and get the rotational period for free.</p>
<p>To improve upon my first model, I wanted to add two more features: The axial tilt of the earth and the inclination of the orbit of the moon.</p>
<h2>Axial tilt</h2>
<p>The rotational axis of the earth is tilted 23.5° relative to its orbital plane.
For the orrery, this means that the rotational axis of the earth is not pointing straight up.
To make matters worse, the axis always points in the same direction.
It does not rotate relative to the stars or the table that the orrery stands on, but it has to rotate relative to the main arm that holds the earth.
So not only does the earth itself rotate, the part that holds the earth also needs to rotate to cancel out the rotation of the arm.</p>
<p>Modelling this feature allows us to use the orrery to explain the origin of the seasons.</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/earth_axial_tilt.jpg">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/earth_axial_tilt_1280.jpg" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>To construct the actual tilted holder for the earth sphere, I used an <a href="https://www.brickowl.com/catalog/lego-angle-connector-3-157-5-32016-42128">angled connector</a> with a 22.5° angle, which is only one degree off the correct angle.</p>
<h2>Inclination of the orbit of the moon</h2>
<p>The second pehonomenon I wanted to model in my orrery is the fact that the plane of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon">the moon's orbit</a> is inclined relative to the plane of the earth's orbit.
The real inclination angle is 5.15°, which you would barely notice if it was modelled accurately.
But the inclination of the moon's orbit plays in important role in explaining when eclipses occur, so I think it is useful to model an exaggerated orbital inclination.</p>
<p>In the orrery, we need to make the moon go up and down along its journey around the earth.
My mechanical solution for this problem is inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL7bUoLnCN4">this video</a>.
The moon arm has a wheel that rides on a tilted <a href="https://www.brickowl.com/catalog/lego-1-4-circle-gear-rack-11-x-11-24121-43038">circular gear rack</a>.
A parallelogram linkage keeps the moon vertically aligned.
Just like the attachment point for the earth, this assembly rests relative to the stars, meaning it needs to rotate relative to the main arm.</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/mooninclination.png">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/mooninclination_1280.png" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>In summary, there are four parts on the earth arm that need to rotate at the correct rate:</p>
<ul>
<li>the earth,</li>
<li>the base for the earth (to ensure the correct direction of the axial tilt),</li>
<li>the moon,</li>
<li>the inclination ring for the moon.</li>
</ul>
<p>In theory, the earth base and the moon inclination ring could be a single part (both should rotate at the same rate).
But making a tilted ring out of Lego parts is difficult enough and I didn't manage to do it in a way where the moon "rides" on it while it is driven from the outside.
Thus, the solution to this is to make the moon inclination ring a separate assembly.</p>
<p>Being able to move the tilted ring independently allows us to implement an additional astrodynamic phenomenon, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_precession#Nodal_precession"><em>precession of the nodes of the orbit of the moon</em></a>.
It turns out that the direction in which the upper and lower parts of the orbit are pointing isn't fixed after all.
They slowly rotate around the moon, once every 18.6 years.</p>
<h2>Concentric axes</h2>
<p>One problem specific to building an orrery in Lego is achieving concentric rotation.
In a traditional orrery, you can have an unlimited number of parts rotating around the same axis just by placing tubes of increasing size inside each other.
But these tubes don't exist as Lego pieces.
For the earth-moon system, I need four assemblies rotating independently around the same axis.</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/concentric_axes.png">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/concentric_axes_1280.png" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>Here is how I achieved it for the earth-moon subassembly:
The first axis (1) is a regular Lego Technic axle.
It drives the rotation of the earth.
The second axis (2) is built using a Lego Technic turntable.
It is responsible for the orbit of the moon.
The third axis (3) is a circular gear rack.
It fulfills the same role as a turntable, just with an inner radius large enough to fit another turntable inside it.
This part is the tilted ring that is needed to model the orbital inclination of the moon.
Now there is only one axis missing, which is the rotating holder for the earth (4).
Remember, it needs to rotate relative to the main arm of the orrery so that the rotational axis of the earth points at a constant direction.
This is done with a second turntable stacked on top of the first one.</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/gearcasing.png">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/gearcasing_1280.png" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>To drive it, I'm using this trick:
The <a href="https://www.brickowl.com/catalog/lego-differential-gear-casing-6573"><em>Differential Gear Casing</em></a> has a round hole and gears at both ends.
That means an axle can be placed inside it and rotate independently.
This can be used to transmit torque by connecting gears at both ends.
This serves the purpose of the aforementioned tubes that don't exist as Lego parts, with the exception of this gear casing.
The gear casing drives some gears on the first turntable, which in turn drive the second turntable.</p>
<h2>Gear sequences</h2>
<p>The earth-moon subassembly has four axes that need to rotate at the correct period, namely the earth, the moon, the earth's base and the moon's inclination ring.
The entire orrery has two more: the rotation of the sun around its own axis and the rotation of the main arm, which makes the earth travel around the sun in 365.25 days.</p>
<p>The sun is not a solid body and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_rotation">spins at different speeds depending on the latitude</a>.
For orrery design, that means that any rotational period between 24 and 38 days can be argued to be correct, since there is a latitude of the sun where the surface rotates at this period.</p>
<p>This gives rise to the problem of finding a gear sequence for a given transmission ratio.
In my orrery, one rotation of the crank corresponds to one day.
So to get the main arm to rotate once every 365.25 days, it needs to be connected to the crank using a gear sequence with a transmission ratio that is as close as possible to 365.25.</p>
<p>The gear ratio of a gear sequence is the product of the fractions of tooth numbers for each pair of gears in the sequence.</p>
<p>To find a sequence of Lego gears, there are some additional constraints.
Most importantly, we are limited by the gears that Lego actually makes:</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/allgears.png">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/allgears.png" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>Notice the <a href="https://www.brickowl.com/catalog/lego-worm-gear-shape-axle-4716">worm gear</a> in the above image.
It's special because it behaves like a one tooth gear, i.e. paired with a 24 tooth gear, it will create a transmission ratio of 1:24.
But it can only be the driving gear in a pairing, not the driven gear.</p>
<p>Suppose we want to achieve a transmission ratio of 17:23.
This could be done easily with a pairing of a 17-teeth and a 23-teeth gear in a traditional orrery.
But these teeth numbers aren't available as Lego gears, so we have to find another way.</p>
<p>I made <a href="https://marian42.de/gears/?targetratio=17/23&amp;error=default&amp;incl2d=false&amp;gears=default">a tool</a> to find Lego gear sequences for a given transmission ratio.
For our example of a 17/23 ratio, the app finds plenty of solutions with slightly different ratios, for example a ratio of 20/27, which is only 0.22% off from the target ratio:</p>
<figure>
    <video autoplay="" loop="" muted="">
        <source src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/sequence_example.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
</figure>
<p>The problem of finding a gear sequence for a given transmission ratio is connected to some interesting ideas from number theory.
It is closely related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization">prime factor decomposition</a>.
In fact, an exact solution is only possible if all the prime factors in the target ratio are also available as prime factors in the available gears.</p>
<p>The tool will start from the target fraction (or slightly different fractions when searching for approximate solutions) and go through a list of expansions of that fraction that are possible with the prime factors given by the available gears.
For each fraction, it will calculate all sequences of gears that have the numerator or denominator of that fraction as their product.</p>
<p>Given such a pair of sequences of driver gears and follower gears, the app still needs to decide which driver gear is paired with which follower gear.
This is important in the context of Lego gears because some pairings are more practical than others in a Lego project.
In particular, if a pair of gears has a tooth sum that is divisible by 16, the distance between the axles is a whole number of Lego units.
This combination is the easiest to build.</p>
<p>Here is an example of pairing a 24 and 40 tooth gear.
The tooth sum is <code>64 = 4 * 16</code>, which tells us that the gears will be four Lego units apart.</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/gear_pairing.png">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/gear_pairing_1280.png" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>If the tooth sum is divisble by 8, the distance can be achieved by placing the axle at a half unit offset, which is possible with various building techniques:</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/gear_pairing_2.png">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/gear_pairing_2_1280.png" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>The app has a "Fit gears" tab which will show you possible ways of connecting any given pair of gears.
For example, this is what I call a "2D connection".
These gears fit together if you offset them 1 unit in one direction and 2 units in the second direction, since their distance is quite close to <code>sqrt(1² + 2²)</code>:</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/2d_connection.png">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/2d_connection.png" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>In addition, there are also gears that Lego calls <a href="https://www.brickowl.com/search/catalog?query=bevel%20gear&amp;cat=6835">"bevel gears"</a>, they have <code>n * 8 + 4</code> teeth and can be connected perpendicularly, allowing you to change the plane of the meachnism.</p>
<p>So for any pair of a driver and follower gear, there are potential ways to connect them, but some combinations are easier to build and some are harder.
My app assigns a "cost" to each possible pairing of driver and follower gear based on how they can be connected.
If the teeth numbers add up to a multiple of 16, they are the easiest to connect, meaning the cost is the lowest.
Once the tool has a set of driver gears and follower gears, it uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm">Hungarian algorithm</a> to generate a matching with minimal cost.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a result when searching for a sequence with a ratio of π:</p>
<figure>
    <video autoplay="" loop="" muted="">
        <source src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/sequence.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
</figure>
<p>There is one more interesting mathematical curiosity I want to mention.
Lego's differential gears have the property that the differential casing rotates at a rate that is the mean of the rates of the two connected axles.
For example, if one axle rotates onces per second and the other axle three times per second, the casing will rotates twice per second (<code>(1 + 3) / 2</code>).
We can exploit this to achieve prime factors that are otherwise impossible with Lego gears.</p>
<p>For example, there are no Lego gears with a tooth number that is a multiple of 13, so transmission ratios that include 13 as a prime factor are not possible with the standard approach.
To achieve a transmission ratio of 13, the gear ratio calculator gives us this sequence:</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/differential.png">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/differential_1280.png" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>The inputs axles spin at a rate of 1 and 25 and the resulting rate is <code>(1 + 25) / 2 = 13</code>.
This how this sequence could be built:</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/differential_assembly.png">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/differential_assembly_1280.png" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>In this example, the blue axle spins 13 times as fast as the red axle.</p>
<p>This brings us to the end of the digression about gear sequences.
The app is available <a href="https://marian42.de/gears">here</a> if you want to try it out.
The Typescript <a href="https://github.com/marian42/gears">source code</a> is also available.</p>
<p>Here are all the gears in the final orrery design:</p>

        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/mechanism_1280.png" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>These are the rotational and orbital periods in the orrery, comparing them to the real-world values:</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/error_table.png">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/error_table_1280.png" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>The mechanism was mostly designed using physical parts and my gear sequence app.
This is a work in progress photo:</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/arm_wip.jpg">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/arm_wip_1280.jpg" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>One of the main challenges during the design of the orrery, besides making it work at all, was to get the orrery to run smoothly.
The final design has 70 gears and each additional gear adds a little bit of friction.
Another source for resistance is the weight of the earth as it spins relatively fast and thus contributes a lot to the torque needed to run the orrery.
I put a lot of effor into making the orrery run smooth.
But the mechanism can easily get stuck, for example if any moving part is assembled too tight or if the orrery gathers dust.
During assembly, it is important to make sure that every moving part has a some slack.</p>
<p>One way to work around this problem is to apply a little bit of silicone spray.
This will make the orrery run effortlessly without any problem.
But arguably a Lego set should be judged by how well it works on its own and purists will say this is like gluing parts together.</p>
<h2>Designing the foot</h2>
<p>I took this photo when I first managed to get the entire mechanism to work.
This contains the first version of a foot I designed, which has a Lego motor to drive the orrery.</p>
<figure>

        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/foot_wip_1280.jpg" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>It turns out that this motor is really loud when it runs and it ruins the experience of using the orrery.
I envision it as a piece that you can use to explain and demonstrate astrodynamic phenomena to someone.
But this doesn't work when the motor noise makes it impossible to have a conversation, so I decided to remove the motor.</p>
<p>Designing the foot turned out quite tricky, it's an artistic challenge more than a technical one.
I went for a 12-segment design, which is a nod to the twelve months and has a <a href="https://collections.whipplemuseum.cam.ac.uk/objects/9010/">tradition in orrery design</a>.</p>
<p>I designed most of the foot digitally using Bricklink Studio.
This part lends itself more to digital design since it doesn't move.
Due to the 12-fold symmetry, testing any idea requires a large number of parts.</p>
<p>Here are some iterations on the foot design:</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/stand_designs.png">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/stand_designs_1280.png" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>You can see that each design has a little lever to disengage the driving mechanism from the main arm.
This allows you to move the arm freely, which is quite useful in practice.</p>
<p>Here is a video of the final orrery design in action:</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>I used <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page">Bricklink Studio</a> to make a digital model of my orrery.
During the design process, I switched back and forth between buildig with physical parts and designing digitally.</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/studio.png">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/studio_1280.png" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>I also used this program to create digital building instructions.
My takeaway from this is that it works really well for small models, but it has serious usability problems on larger models.
When you make changes to the model or change an early step in the instructions, it will often break the layout of the instructions in many places so that most of it needs to be redone.
This was a lot of tedious work, but I ended up with a 264 page, 436 step instructions PDF.</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/instructions_example.png">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/instructions_example_1280.png" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>I'm selling the digital instructions for 20€ on <a href="https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-88534/marian/sun-earth-moon-orrery/">Rebrickable</a>.
On Rebrickable, you get a parts list and some really useful tools to help aquiring the parts (even without buying the instructions).
For example, you can tell it which Lego sets and parts you own and based on that it will know which of the required parts of the orrery you already have.
It also helps you with buying the parts you don't have.
Rebrickable estimates that the total cost of the required parts is 260€.
Together with the cost of the instructions, this makes the whole project quite expensive for potential buyers.
I ended up selling a few instructions, but ultimately this project wasn't a commercial success.
In hindsight, it might have been a better idea to give the instructions away for free.</p>
<p>To promote the listing on Rebrickable, I made an animation that shows the movement of the gears in the orrery.
I used <a href="https://www.mecabricks.com/">Mecabricks</a> to convert the Bricklink Studio design into a scene file that contains 3D meshes of all the parts.
This could then be opened in Blender, where I created all the animations and the camera movement.
Just like making the instructions, this is realtively straight forward, but it became quite complex due to the large number of parts in the design.
Here is the resulting animation (at 45 seconds, the structural parts fade out to reveal the mechanism):</p>

<h2>Lower partcount design</h2>
<p>The above design aims to make the best possible Lego orrery with few compromises.
This is at the expense of having a high part count and some parts that are hard to get.
I made a modified <a href="https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-95743/marian/sun-earth-moon-orrery-reduced-part-count/">design with a lower part count</a> by redesigning the foot.</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/panels_foot.jpg">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/panels_foot_1280.jpg" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>The foot in this version is much lighter, has less ornaments and uses Technic parts instead of traditional bricks.
It has one crank instead of two.
To make it easier to get the parts for this orrery, I changed the design so that it uses as many parts as possible from Lego's <a href="https://rebrickable.com/sets/42082-1/rough-terrain-crane/#comments">Rough Terrain Crane</a>.
I chose this set because it was well reviewed, had a low cost per part, and many people own it.
Unfortunately, Lego has now stopped selling it.</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/panels_render.jpg">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/panels_render_1280.jpg" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>Many parts in my first orrery design use a "traditional" color scheme where gears, pins and axles are mostly gray and black.
This color scheme was used by Lego in the past and is often preferred by fans.
In the new design, I use the same colors that Lego uses in its current products, which means the parts are easier to get and more of them can be taken from the red crane.
The new, more colorful palette makes the building instructions easier to follow, but the colors can look out of place in the orrery.</p>
<h2>Other orreries</h2>
<p>I released the instructions for my orrery in September 2021.
A few months later in 2022, CaDA released <a href="https://decadastore.com/products/solar-system-c71004w">an orrery</a> designed by JK Brickworks.
This is the designer behind the "original" Lego Orrery from 2016, which got me interested in this hobby in the first place.</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/cada_orrery.jpg">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/cada_orrery.jpg" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>The feature set of this orrery is similar to mine, with the exception that it doesn't model the inclination of the orbit of the moon.
As you can see, omitting this feature lowers the complexity considerably and allows for a much simpler and more reliable design.
The lower part count makes this orrery more accessible to a wider audience.
I'm very impressed with this design and I think it's the best product to get for anyone interested in building an orrery.</p>
<p>Two years later in 2024, Lego released their own orrey design.
I was quite excited at the prospect of an official Lego orrery, but I was disappointed by the execution.</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/lego_orrery.jpg">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/lego_orrery_1280.jpg" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>This orrery has the same feature set as the one from CaDA, it has the earth's axial tilt, the moon's orbit but not its inclination.
Compared to the CaDA design, it has less parts but is more expensive.
I think Lego were too aggressive in reducing the part count.
The orrery is very fragile and wobbly.
For the sun and earth, they went with custom hemisphere pieces.
I like the idea, as it allows the bodies to be perfectly spherical.
But the parts have very prominent connection holes, which are unneccesary and ruin the look.
The earth has the continents printed on it, which is a nice idea but the prints were poorly aligned in my model.</p>
<p>All in all, I would recommend the CaDA orrery over this one.
But I'm excited to see that building block orreries are reaching a bigger audience and I hope that companies like CaDA and Lego will offer more elaborate designs in the future.</p>
<h2>Outlook</h2>
<p>This is a mockup of an idea to model all the planets in the solar system without vertical stacking (well, except for the inner planets, but it's mostly a flat design).
The four outer planets would move on four tracks of <a href="https://www.brickowl.com/catalog/lego-small-tread-link-3873-15379">chains</a> that are held in place by the vertical poles (the chains are not shown in the render).
The chain would be driven by a gear attached to the base and the planet would be attached to one of the chain link pieces.
Note that in this setup, the planets only travel around the sun, but don't spin around their own axes.</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/fullsolarsystemconcept.jpg">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/fullsolarsystemconcept_1280.jpg" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>This concept is inspired by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUdlSYC1cCE">design for a clock from Akiyuki</a>.
It's hard to tell if the chain could handle the weight of a brick-built planet.
Either way this build would be crazy in terms of dimensions, part count and cost.
At the moment, I'm not planning to continue working on this concept.</p>
<p>If you remove the constraint of no vertical stacking, the problem becomes only slightly easier, but possible as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTkIezjNLS8">demonstrated by Chris Orchard and Brent Waller</a> in their <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/c600ea70-0e2d-4192-8bbc-79eecbc796e4">Lego Ideas campaign</a>.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@marian42/110136556159649621">next project</a> is to build an orrery using laser cut acrylic sheets instead of Lego parts.
This removes a lot of constraints on the gears and parts that can be used, but has the added difficulty that I need to manufacture these parts myself.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><em><strong>Prelude: </strong><span>Michael Levin is a scientist at Tufts University who many have described as one of the most revolutionary biologists of our age. His work has been featured everywhere from </span><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/robots-made-from-human-cells-can-move-on-their-own-and-heal-wounds/" rel="">Scientific American</a><span> to the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU" rel="">Lex Fridman podcast</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/05/10/persuading-the-body-to-regenerate-its-limbs" rel="">The New Yorker</a><span>. I spent the past month reading a bunch of his papers and interviews in an attempt to answer the question: what is Michael Levin on about and why does it matter? The essay below is the result of that investigation.</span></em></p><p>What are the biggest mysteries in science? When we ask this question we tend to talk about big picture topics like dark matter, consciousness, aliens, and parallel universes. We don’t talk as much about something that is more commonplace yet equally astonishing: how does the human body construct itself out of a single cell, like when a single fertilized egg cell develops into an embryo and ultimately into a fully-fledged adult?</p><p>We don’t tend to ask this question because we’re used to it—babies are born, acorns turn into trees, and eggs hatch into chickens every day. But there is indeed something perplexing about it. Think about what your cells have to do in the process of constructing your body: they have to coordinate their positions to follow a detailed architecture of bones, skin, muscles, and organs; they have to construct and wire together the hundred billion neurons of your brain; each cell has to decide what kind of cell to specialize into, and how much to duplicate to ensure all the proportions of your body parts are correct. How do so many individual units cooperate to self-assemble into a large, functional whole?</p><p>Well, let’s first consider a very different kind of functional whole: the computers, cars, and other machines that make up our built environment. These things are also complex functional wholes that are made up of countless tiny parts. But they’re “dead” in the sense that they don’t construct and heal themselves. The only thing that enables all the tiny parts to work together is the fact that we designed and put together all the parts ourselves, meticulously executing a detailed plan. The trouble with biology is that you don’t get this kind of top-down planning: when an egg cell proliferates into a full body, there is no “central command center” that has access to the entire developing body and can dictate what each part does. There is no brain around to tell the body how to construct the brain itself.</p><p><span>In the absence of top-down design, our conventional picture of biology is that everything happens in a bottom-up manner: molecular mechanisms dictate the functions of cells, which dictate the functions of your organs and which ultimately control your body. What is the thing at the very bottom of this hierarchy—the foundation for everything else in life? The genome. Genes are considered the fundamental code of life, so when it comes to figuring out questions of how the body develops, or how to cure diseases or change specific biological traits, we tend to look there. We spend much of our research efforts doing things like studying the gene that </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAX6" rel="">triggers the construction of eyes</a><span>, or trying to identify the genetic underpinnings of Alzheimer’s and cancer, or studying how mutations in a specific gene alters a fruit fly’s </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period_(gene)" rel="">circadian rhythm</a><span> Ever since we </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genome_Project" rel="">finished sequencing</a><span> the human genome back in 2003, we’ve been inundated by genomic data that we don’t quite know what to do with, but the emphasis is primarily on how genes and chemical pathways determine the high-level structure of the organism.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-145450276" href="https://www.bitsofwonder.co/p/a-revolution-in-biology#footnote-1-145450276" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span></p><p><span>That is, until Michael Levin (and many others) entered the scene. They came in and said: genes are great, and they do contain much of the necessary information for building our bodies. But they don’t contain all of it, and they are not always a useful level of abstraction of understanding how the body develops, and consequently they are not always the best way to intervene with biology (e.g. to regenerate damaged organs, or to cure diseases like cancer). If you’ve ever done any programming, you know that there are many levels of abstraction—higher-level and lower-level programming languages, higher-level and lower-level API’s—at which you can try to understand or manipulate the software that runs in your computer. Levin’s point is that genes are like machine code, and modern-day programmers never think about machine code—they think about higher-level software constructs like objects, modules, and applications. The bold claim embedded in his work—the real revolution here—is that higher levels of abstraction and control meaningfully exist in biology. And one of the ways in which this higher level of abstraction manifests is in something called </span><em>the bioelectric network</em><span> of the organism.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-145450276" href="https://www.bitsofwonder.co/p/a-revolution-in-biology#footnote-2-145450276" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span></p><p><span>We usually think of neurons as the only cells in our body that produce intelligent behavior by communicating in large networks. Neurons are constantly communicating with each other in the form of electrical patterns on their membrane and neurotransmitters, which are chemicals that transfer messages between cells. But it turns out that cells throughout the body have the </span><a href="https://shamay.com/bioelectricity/" rel="">exact same building blocks</a><span> for such communication. They do the same communication, but slower. Levin and company call this the </span><em>bioelectric network</em><span>, as distinguished from a neural network.</span></p><p>In the past few decades we’ve discovered all the ways in which bioelectric networks distributed through the body do the same kinds of things that brains do: store memories, solve problems, and guide development. To get a sense of the bioelectric network in action, we have to talk about a mind-blowing creature called the planarian. This little critter (about 2cm in length) is a developmental “genius” of sorts: it doesn’t age, it doesn’t get cancer, and it is extremely regenerative, capable of regenerating any part of its body that gets cut off, even if it’s cut up into more than 250 pieces.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e4ad91a-8810-456b-a95e-e8a5433b2854_2000x2188.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e4ad91a-8810-456b-a95e-e8a5433b2854_2000x2188.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e4ad91a-8810-456b-a95e-e8a5433b2854_2000x2188.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e4ad91a-8810-456b-a95e-e8a5433b2854_2000x2188.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e4ad91a-8810-456b-a95e-e8a5433b2854_2000x2188.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e4ad91a-8810-456b-a95e-e8a5433b2854_2000x2188.png" width="386" height="422.32005494505495" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6e4ad91a-8810-456b-a95e-e8a5433b2854_2000x2188.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1593,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:386,&quot;bytes&quot;:860033,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e4ad91a-8810-456b-a95e-e8a5433b2854_2000x2188.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e4ad91a-8810-456b-a95e-e8a5433b2854_2000x2188.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e4ad91a-8810-456b-a95e-e8a5433b2854_2000x2188.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e4ad91a-8810-456b-a95e-e8a5433b2854_2000x2188.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>Diagram depicting the planarian’s ability to regrow even when cut into many pieces, from </span><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-023-01780-3" rel="">this paper</a><span>.</span></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>The question we asked earlier—how an egg cell expands into a full body—applies equally to how the planarian regenerates its entire body from just a tiny piece of tissue.

You now have two half-worms, and each of those half-worms is tasked with rebuilding the rest of its body. There’s a crucial decision here that the cells have to make: what part of the body do we already have, and what part do we need to build?

They’ve done things like getting frogs to </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1084952109000974?" rel="">develop extra limbs</a><span>, and getting them to develop </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22159581/" rel="">an eye in their gut</a><span>, or an eye in their tail that </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41536-017-0012-5" rel="">they can actually see out of</a><span>. The end goal that Levin dreams of is an “anatomical compiler” – a program which takes as input a specification for an arbitrary organ or body plan, and outputs the specific set of chemical and electrical signals needed to generate that organ. Imagine 3-d printing entire synthetic organs and organisms, except instead of having to specify all the micro-level details, you can just give a high-level description like “an extra eye at the tail.” This is Dall-E but for biology. And in the very long run, it could be the answer to virtually all of biomedicine, including traumatic injury, birth defects, degenerative disease, cancer, and aging.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-145450276" href="https://www.bitsofwonder.co/p/a-revolution-in-biology#footnote-6-145450276" target="_self" rel="">6</a></span></p><p><span>So on a practical level, the impact of Levin’s work is a shift away from genes as the only determinant of structure, shifting instead towards the bioelectric network. But there’s a broader thesis here, which is recognizing that the terms “intelligence” and “cognition” apply to much more of biology than we tend to think. The very process of development has an intelligence of its own: for example, if you take a tadpole (the precursor to a frog), and manually scramble its facial organs, those facial organs will </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22411736/" rel="">relocate back to the correct place</a><span> as the tadpole matures.</span></p><p>The developing body of the tadpole is actively moving towards a “goal” state: it’s not a hard-coded system that blindly follows a predetermined set of steps encoded in the genes. The manual scrambling the experimenters created (called “picasso frogs”) is a situation that would not have occurred in the evolutionary environment, so it can’t be something it was specifically selected for.</p><p><span>There are many more examples of such adaptability in biological systems, found at the level of individual cells and groups of cells. Levin defines “intelligence” as the capacity to achieve the same goal via different means, and over the years he and others have documented case after case of such adaptability. If a developing embryo is surgically cut into two, it develops into two separate, healthy twins rather than two half-bodies; the embryos restructure themselves on-the-fly in response to external perturbations. If a newt salamander’s cells are artificially enlarged, the tubules in its kidneys still develop to be the same objective size, by simply using fewer cells per tube. It’s like the cells are cooperating to produce a fixed tube size no matter how large the individual cells are. As the individual cells are made to be bigger and bigger, the salamander even develops tubules out of a </span><em>single</em><span> cell that turns in on itself:</span></p><p><span>So we have all these examples of fractal intelligence, at layers up and down the biology stack. But the profound flip-side of intelligence is </span><em>creativity</em><span>: biology is capable of not just recovering the same functionality when perturbed, but of adopting entirely new kinds of functionality when given the right set of prompts. Levin’s team has taken skin cells from an embryonic frog, and given them certain signals to create “biobots” </span><a href="https://wyss.harvard.edu/news/team-builds-first-living-robots-that-can-reproduce/" rel="">that move on their own and even self-replicate</a><span>. (Again: no genetic modifications, just taking ordinary stem cells and giving them drugs.) More recently they’ve taken cells from adult human lung tissue, and used them to construct moving biobots that can </span><a href="https://wyss.harvard.edu/news/scientists-build-tiny-biological-robots-from-human-cells/" rel="">heal damaged neurons</a><span>. There’s a whole world of latent creativity to be discovered at all levels of biology, and the potential applications are endless. Imagine creating little biobots that can attack cancerous cells, or clean up toxins in the environment, or heal degenerated nervous tissue.</span></p><p><span>The bigger, mind-blowing perspective shift in Levin’s work is to rethink what we think counts as an “agent”, with “goals” that it pursues. Is a cell an agent? An embryo? What about a liver? What about your immune system? Levin hypothesizes that way before evolution discovered agency and intelligent information-processing in brains, it had already discovered it in lower-level systems—in morphogenesis (the process by which an organism develops its high-level structure), in bacterial colonies, and even in </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33748699/" rel="">networks of genes</a><span>. These are systems that we have trouble viewing as autonomous entities capable of forming memories or having goals. But what I think is truly special about Levin’s work is that he doesn’t just advocate a shift in perspective from an armchair: his team has been putting in decades of experimental work demonstrating the validity and promise of these ideas. His focus has been not just on philosophizing about what is intelligence and agency, but instead asking: what definitions, what frameworks, will lead to the most fruitful lines of empirical research and potential applications? Once we view cells and groups of cells as having an innate intelligence, we can leverage that intelligence to our own ends.</span></p><p><span>It’s not just biomedicine that stands to gain from this perspective shift: if we think of our brains, our organs, and our cells as all having the same basic building blocks for cognition, then we can share tools and ideas from across fields. The notion of “cognitive science” expands beyond just the study of neurons in the brain, to any cell type that coordinates together, or really any collective at all, including groups of humans. Specific parallels have already been studied, like studying cancer as a </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33961843/" rel="">“dissociative identity disorder” of cell groups</a><span>, or the finding that ant colonies </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081714" rel="">succumb</a><span> to </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26930477/" rel="">“visual illusions”</a><span> of the same kind that brains do. Levin says that all intelligence is collective intelligence: all of these “diverse intelligences” are ultimately made up of parts, a large number of subunits that have their own competencies and lower-level intelligence, combining to produce something greater than the whole. We tend to think of ourselves as individuals, as an indivisible unit, but the same “collective intelligence” label applies to each one of us: you are ultimately a collection of a hundred billion neurons (and trillions of other cells) cooperating together, each cell having its own competencies and subgoals that sometimes even conflict. It's strange to think of ourselves in this way, our brains being on the same spectrum as a colony of ants or a flock of geese, but once you look into the details of how we function it's hard to see it any other way. Just as the human world is a society of selves, your body is a society of cells. The connection might be more than mere metaphor.</span></p><p><em><span>Credit to </span><a href="http://suzanneknop.com/" rel="">Suzanne</a><span> for feedback on earlier drafts and </span><a href="https://silenceinbetween.substack.com/p/current-understanding-of-biology" rel="">this post</a><span> for originally introducing me to Levin’s work.</span></em></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">                
                <em>2021-02-13</em><br><h2 id="baggins">Background</h2><p>In the beginning, the CPU was created.
This has made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move.</p><p>Though computers have only gained in popularity, in our interactions with them we have increasingly attempted to interact less with the CPU; and more and more with the abstractions that simply <i>happen</i> to be implemented atop CPUs.
One of the earliest such abstractions was the <b>instruction set architecture</b> (ISA).
The idea was this: instead of writing code for a specific CPU, you would design an abstract specification for one: a language, if you will, that could be spoken by multiple different CPUs.
You would then write code according to that instruction set, in that language, and it could be interpreted by any CPU implementing that instruction set.
This was desirable partly because it allowed code to be written once and run multiple places—the first inklings of portability, rising!—but mostly because it allowed you to think only of the specification while you wrote your code, and perhaps even forget for a moment that there was a CPU underlying it all.</p><p>Ahhh, the power of abstraction in the morning...</p><p>Another such abstraction was the <b>mnemonic assembler</b>.
Before the assembler was created, CPUs and ISAs were instructed using numbers which had special meaning to the ISA in question.
For example, consider the following number<sup id="b0"><a href="#f0">0</a></sup> (in octal form, for no particular reason):</p><pre>030514</pre><p>In the context of the ISA implemented by the CRAY-1,<sup id="b1"><a href="#f1">1</a></sup> that number is understand to mean ‘add the contents of registers A1 and A4, and store the result in register A5’.
The association between this numeric form and its meaning under the ISA is completely arbitrary, and serves only to remind our poor programmers that they are serving a CPU, whose native language is written with arbitrary numbers.
Wouldn’t it be nice if, instead of meaningless <span>030514</span>, our CPU could understand a form like this one?</p><pre id="cray!">A5	A1+A4</pre><p>(This latter form, while no less arbitrary than the other, is arbitrary in a way which matches preexisting human arbitrarinesses.
 This makes humans feel warm and fuzzy inside, like they’ve conquered a part of the machine kingdom with their superior human intellect, and is called a ‘mnemonic’.)</p><p>Unfortunately, while CPUs are equally capable of parsing numbers like <span>030514</span> and strings of words like <span>A5	A1+A4</span>, they are much slower at the second.
Thus, a compromise was borne: a mnemonic assembler would be a program (like all programs, it would run on a CPU implementing an ISA), and it would translate mnemonic forms like <span>A5	A1+A4</span> into machine forms like <span>030514</span>.
This allows humans to <i>pretend</i> that the CPUs understand their own native language, while still allowing the CPUs themselves to run at tolerable speeds.</p><p>At this point, it is worth making a couple of things devastatingly clear.</p><p>First, an assembler that runs on a given ISA may produce machine code for that ISA, or machine code for a completely different ISA.<!--(An assembler that produces code for a different ISA than that on which is runs is sometimes called a ‘cross assembler’, à la ‘cross compiler’.)--></p><p>Second, there is almost always a 1:1 correspondence between the mnemonics inhaled by a given assembler and the instructions it spits out.  (Where there is not, the situation is generally close enough to 1:1 as to make no ends.)</p><p>Third, mnemonics were not standardised the same way that ISAs were.  A given set of mnemonics only works on one ISA, but there might be any number of other mnemonic-sets that also work on that ISA.  (Despite this, a number of tropes tend emerge which are shared by all mnemonic-sets targeting a given ISA.)</p><p>We are now ready to attack the problem at hand.</p><p id="names">There is a popular group of ISAs variably known as:</p><ul><li>x86
 <ul><li>x86-64?
  <ul><li>EM64T?
   <ul><li>x64??
    <ul><li>AMD64???</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>IA-32
 <ul><li>IA-32<b>e</b>???</li></ul></li></ul><span>(The question marks have been added for comedic effect.
 In point of fact, they are about as funny as the overproliferation of names that this ISA seems to accumulate<sup id="b2"><a href="#f2">2</a></sup> in much the same way that a pile of cow dung accumulates flies or this sentence accumulates words.
 Unlike a pile of cow dung, however, no clarity emerges when you swat it; only more confusion.
 Which being said, you should still clean your CPU at least annually: use soap, warm water, and a soft rag to get the gunk out of the transistors.)</span><p>This ill-fated ISA, which has more addressing forms than names and is so immensely complicated that you need to read a 5000-page tome<sup id="b3"><a href="#f3">3</a></sup> plus an additional 400 or so pages of unofficial reference before you can even begin to be qualified to understand the consequences of a single of its instructions, will henceforth be referred to as ‘“SIB”’.
I give it that name not so much to deliberately sow confusion (though that is definitely a contributing factor) as because that’s the only name that everybody seems to agree is associated with it.
(This is also the reason its name is quoted: it’s the only word, indeed the only idea in this missive I didn’t make up from whole cloth, ripped cloth, cheese cloth, pins, pinheads, camembert,<sup id="b4"><a href="#f4">4</a></sup> angels, のっぺらぼう.)</p><p>Because ‘SIB’ is, inexplicably, enduringly popular, a lot of assemblers have been made for it.
As I mentioned, though different assemblers are not always compatible with each other, tropes and commonalities tend to emerge.
In fact, there are two incompatible sets of tropes; they are generally called ‘AT&amp;T syntax’ and ‘Intel syntax’, and you can read about the differences <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language#Syntax">here</a>.</p><p>...but you knew all of this already.
If I’ve done my due diligence, you were incited by the title but are still looking for something to disagree (or agree) with strongly.
Patience!</p><p>I contend that the AT&amp;T syntax is harmful and bad, and should never be used, for any reason, under any circumstances, by anyone.
Here’s why:</p><h2 id="the-real-biggy">AT&amp;T syntax is broken</h2><p>This is the single greatest sin perpetrated by the AT&amp;T syntax.
If not for this, it would be sufficient to say that Intel syntax was superior.
If not for this, the use of AT&amp;T syntax would be at least be acceptable, at least be moral,<sup id="b5"><a href="#f5">5</a></sup> even if still in supremely poor taste.
If not for this, it would be <i>possible</i> to write correct programs using the AT&amp;T syntax.</p><p>Now, to be clear, I don’t expect advanced safety features from an assembler.
I don’t expect dependent types, or linear types, or even any types at all.
<i>But I would pretty damn well appreciate it if my assembler didn’t <b>actively</b> try to sabotage me!</i></p><p>Let me show you an example.
Here’s an annotated snippet of Intel-style ‘SIB’ assembly:</p><pre>mov	eax, 28            ; (1) store the immediate value 28 in the EAX register
mov	eax, dword [28]    ; (2) load one ‘dword’ (4 bytes) from memory location 28 and store it in the EAX register <!--;     (on some assemblers, ‘dword’ should be replaced with ‘dword ptr’, or just elided entirely)--></pre><p>Here’s another snippet, AT&amp;T syntax this time:</p><pre>movl	$28, %eax          ; (1) store the immediate value 28 in the EAX register
movl	(28), %eax         ; (2) load one ‘(l)ong’ (4 bytes) from memory location 28 and store it in the EAX register <!--;     (on some assemblers, the ‘l’ can be elided)--></pre><p>Good so far?
Reasonable?
Good.</p><p>I present to you two more candidates, again in AT&amp;T syntax:</p><pre>movl	28, %eax           ; (3) ???
movl	($28), %eax        ; (4) ???</pre><p>Before you continue reading, I want you to imagine what it would make <i>sense</i> for those instructions to mean.
Should they even be correct?
If you happen to already know, try to forget (pray for oblivion from the horror...)</p><p>If you don’t know, make your best guess.</p><p>Ready?
Here they are again, with annotations this time:</p><pre>movl	28, %eax           ; (3) same as (2)
movl	($28), %eax        ; (4) load one long from the memory location indicated by symbol ‘$28’ and store it in the EAX register</pre><p>Wait, what?</p><p>Go back and read that again and tell me in what world that could possibly be okay.
Tell me in what world an assembler that silently accepts the above forms, that is almost certainly corrupting your meaning in a way you don’t intend, could <i>possibly</i> produce correct code.
Tell me you would <i>never</i> forget to put a <span>$</span> in front of an immediate, and that you would never accidentally put one in a displacement.</p><p>This doesn’t even have anything to do with Intel syntax.
This isn’t a win for Intel over AT&amp;T.
This is just AT&amp;T syntax being straight-up batshit fucking bonkers for no very good reason.</p><p>All it would take to redeem AT&amp;T syntax—okay, maybe not redeem, but at least elevate from <i>Cocytus</i> to <i>Phlegyas</i>—would be to make syntaxes (3) and (4) illegal.
That’s it.
Want to help?
Send a patch to your local AT&amp;T-style assembler to make it warn for both of those forms.
Give it a command-line flag to err instead of warning.</p><h2>AT&amp;T is backwards</h2><p>Having eaten the proverbial elephant, it is time to start addressing the smaller fry.<br>
Smaller fry: you have done an admirable job of thorning my side.<br>
Reader: following are reasons why the AT&amp;T operand order is backwards.</p><p>I’m sure you’re familiar with the issue, but here’s a quick refresher.
Intel first:</p><pre>mov	eax, ebx           ; (1) load one dword from the EBX register and store it in the EAX register
add	eax, ebx           ; (2) load a dword each from the EAX and EBX registers, add them together, and store the result (truncated to a dword) in the EAX register</pre><p>AT&amp;T:</p><pre>mov	%ebx, %eax         ; (1) load one dword from the EBX register and store it in the EAX register
add	%ebx, %eax         ; (2) load a dword each from the EAX and EBX registers, add them together, and store the result (truncated to a dword) in the EAX register</pre><p>In general, Intel instruction mnemonics take the form ‘&lt;op&gt; &lt;destination&gt;, &lt;source&gt;’, where AT&amp;T uses ‘&lt;op&gt; &lt;source&gt;, &lt;destination&gt;’.</p><p>Before continuing, I want to establish a couple of things.</p><p>First, the consistency argument is bunk.
The consistency argument in favour of Intel syntax is illustrated by the following example:</p><blockquote>Putting the destination first is more consistent with other, higher-level languages like C.
<span>mov eax, ebx</span> is analogous to <span>eax = ebx</span>, and <span>add eax, ebx</span> to <span>eax += ebx</span>.  In general, <span>op x, y</span> is analogous to <span>x op= y</span>.</blockquote><span>This is a classic logical fallacy: it’s an appeal to authority.
It doesn’t say <i>why</i> the syntax is better, just asserts that somebody else (C) thinks it’s better.
A slight variant on the argument says that making mnemonic assembler syntax reminiscent of the syntax of higher-level languages will make the language easier to learn for people who already know higher-level languages.
This may be <i>somewhat</i> true, but the fact of the matter is that:</span><ul><li>Though assembly is a very difficult language to master or become expert in, the primary roadblock is not the syntax.  The syntax is quite simple and regular and doesn’t represent very much of a roadblock.</li>
<li><i>Because</i> assembly is so difficult to master, we should rather optimize it for experts than for beginners, to alleviate, to whatever extent possible, the higher-level difficulties.  That is, assembly’s difficulty curve is not front-loaded.</li></ul><hr><p>Second, the linguistic argument is bunk.
The linguistic argument in favour of AT&amp;T syntax is illustrated by the following example:</p><blockquote>Putting the destination second is consistent with phrasal forms in English.
<span>mov %ebx, %eax</span> is analogous to ‘move EBX to EAX’, and <span>add %ebx, %eax</span> to ‘add EBX to EAX’.
 In general, these correspond to the idiomatic English form ‘&lt;verb&gt; &lt;object&gt; to &lt;indirect object&gt;’.
 Where Intel syntax demands awkward productions like ‘move to EAX from EBX’.</blockquote><span>All the arguments against the consistency argument apply; but it also bears mentioning that assembly and English are different languages.
In particular, the way objects and verbs interact is different (and this hints at the real reason that AT&amp;T syntax is backwards).
It’s somewhat telling that assembly has no equivalent to the word ‘to’, and few enough production rules to count on both hands.</span><hr><p>So, why does it make more sense to put the destination first?</p><p>Mutation!
The bane of every programmer’s existence!</p><p>In higher-level languages, we frequently try to minimize mutation, or at least keep it under control.
But guess what—<i>every single instruction in assembly mutates</i>.
Even the venerable <span>NOP</span> effectively increments the instruction pointer.</p><p>Mutation is, in fairness, not a universal evil, but it does complicate a reader’s mental model of the code.
Like the GOTO, cursed by Djikstra, it adds path dependence to every line of code that follows it.
Meaning that in order to understand the code you read, you need to have a handle on where the mutation happens.
Putting the destination operand first <i>emphasizes the site of mutation</i>.<sup id="b6"><a href="#f6">6</a></sup></p><h2 id="purl">This ain’t <span>%perl</span></h2><p>(Or, these sigils are making a din!)</p><p>AT&amp;T syntax puts a <span>%</span> in front of register names and a <span>$</span> in front of immediate values.
Unsigiled words are always displacements; either a number or the name of a label.
The <span>$</span> we have already established is almost as bad as using <span>cat /dev/urandom</span> as your assembler.
But let’s consider the <span>%</span>.</p><p>On its face, the idea seems to have some merit.
Indeed, the GNU assembler seems to recognize this: if you pass it the flag <span>-msyntax=intel</span> (or use the <span>.intel_syntax</span> directive in source code), you get intel syntax.
Really.
The whole shabang.
Except—you still have to put <span>%</span>s on your registers.
If you want to not have to do that, you have to additionally specify <span>-mnaked-reg</span> (or <span>.intel_syntax <b>noprefix</b></span>).</p><p>Not only that, but if you look at some older assembly code of mine, it uses this mode: intel syntax, but with <span>%</span>s littered all over the place.
So I sympathize.
Really, I do.
I’m not going to make a pretense of presenting the arguments in favour, because I <i>know</i> the arguments in favour.
But, ultimately, I don’t think the the <span>%</span>s help.</p><p>The deal is this: humans are <i>really</i> good at context-sensitive parsing.
Probably better than computers.
The computer sees an identifier in its entirety, then compares it against its in-built list of registers.
Only once it’s done that can it know if the identifier refers to a label or a register.
But <i>humans</i>—when you, a human see a branching instruction, you <i>immediately</i> know that the operand is going to be a label.
99% of the time you’re right.
The remaining tiny fraction of the time, your internal branch-predictor does a little backtracking and sets you to rights.</p><p>Identifier operands to branching instructions are almost always labels, and identifier operands to non-branching instructions are almost always registers.
This is the kind of context-sensitivity that humans are <i>really</i> good at, given a small amount of practice.
The result is that, to the expert eye, a sea of <span>%</span> is mostly just noise.</p><h2>Suffixesq arew annoyingw</h2><p>Did somebody mention small fry?
This kind of stuff is really not a big deal; but when you get down to it, it’s kind of astounding how AT&amp;T syntax managed to get everything wrong, even the little things.</p><p>First order of business: elision.
Ever assembler I know of will accept the equivalent of this (Intel):</p><pre>mov	rax, [rdi]</pre><p>or this (AT&amp;T):</p><pre>mov	(%rdi), %rax</pre><p>even if they would really <i>prefer</i> for you to write one of</p><pre>mov	rax, qword [rdi]

movq	(%rdi), %rax</pre><p>There are only a few cases where you really need to manually include size information; off the top of my head, I can only think of: sign- or zero-extended moves out of memory, and operations involving a memory and immediate operand.
However, style conventions may still mandate size annotations.
For both AT&amp;T and Intel syntax.
And this is quite reasonable, as these annotations can help to catch bugs; for example:</p><pre>mov	eax, qword [rdi]   ; oops!
	                   ; this was probably unintended
	                   ; the assembler can err here
                           ; where it wouldn’t be able to if we just said ‘mov	eax, [rdi]’

movq	(%rdi), %eax       ; same story...</pre><p>Here, again, Intel wins.
It lets you express the constraints of your data, and the assembler will check that the requisite operation really can be performed.
You express your <i>intent</i> at a higher level, without even having to complicate the implementation.</p><p>But this isn’t actually the problem with the suffixes.
The problem is that they obscure the distinction between dissimilar operations.
Consider (AT&amp;T):</p><pre>movq	......
movl	......
movsbl	......
movzbl	......
movb	......
movl	......</pre><p>It’s not exactly easy to tell the difference between movsbl and movzbl here.
The entire instruction column gets lost in a sea of mov...
The ubiquitous b and l suffixes make the movq seem like the odd one out!</p><p>Admittedly, even on Intel, movzx and movsx are not that distinct from each other.
But they are rare enough (compared with mov) that taking a little extra time on them is acceptable.
The problem here is that you can’t even tell them apart from the movs!</p><p>When every mov has junk after it, it becomes harder to spot patterns.
It’s hard to convince your visual cortex that a movq and a movl are the same type of thing, but that both are very different from a movsbl.
(Sure, movq and movl are different.
 They have different operand sizes.
 A move to a register to another register is also different from a move to memory from an immediate; AT&amp;T makes no distinction there.
 But, perhaps more to the point, the <i>meaning</i> of a mov may be different in different places, regardless of the operand size.
 This isn’t something that can usefully be encoded on the level of assembly.
 A strength of a good language is the versatility and modularity of its primitives.)
Whereas it’s immediately obvious that mov is the same as mov, and that movzx is distinct.</p><h2>[ADDRESSING MODES]</h2><p>Example time!  Intel/AT&amp;T; you know the drill:</p><pre>mov	eax, [edi + 8*ebx + 3]   ; load 4 bytes from the memory location indicated by EDI + 8*EBX + 3 and put them in EAX.
                                 ;    Duh, self-explanatory.
mov	3(%edi,%ebx,8), %eax     ; load 4 bytes from the memory location indicated by 3(%edi,%ebx,8) and put them in %eax.
                                 ;    D-whaat?</pre><p>All right, what’s going on here?
I have a theory:<sup id="b7"><a href="#f7">7</a></sup> AT&amp;T secretly wants ‘SIB’ to be a RISC architecture; in other words, an architecture where only the ‘load’ and ‘store’ instructions affect memory.
They would <i>really</i> like you to write:</p><pre>sibold	3, %edi, %ebx, 3, %eax	; the famous 5-operand load instruction; use (s)cale 2<sup>3</sup>, (i)ndex %ebx, (b)ase %edi,
                                ;    and (o)ffset 3 to get a memory address; load 4 bytes from it and put them in %eax</pre><p>If ‘load’ and ‘store’ really were the only instructions that could affect memory, as on a RISC architecture, then that would be fine.
But they’re not, and we need an unambiguous syntax for memory operands.
So they went with this parenthesized nonsense.</p><p>It’s actually not <i>that</i> bad once you know it, and as I’ve mentioned before, being familiar to users of higher-level languages is not very important.
But the syntax is not without its problems.
The fact that the offset goes outside the parentheses throws off humans’ internal parsetreebranch predictors.
(It makes you think you’re going to see an immediate operand.)
And the parentheses cause ambiguity for macro assemblers (that is, pretty much all of them) where you can evaluate constant arithmetic expressions in-line and use parentheses to override precedence.</p><h2>Intel is ubiquitous</h2><p>Now we’re getting to the really low-down, dirty, nasty, below-the-belt stuff.
They say not to kick somebody while they’re down; but if you’ve already beaten them five times in a fair fight, there’s really nowhere to go next.</p><p><i>Everybody</i> uses Intel!
And I mean, everybody.
Every assembler, every disassembler, every reverse-engineering tool, every debugger.
Documentation from Intel and AMD’s official manuals, as well as most of the unofficial ones.
Inline assemblers for the D, Rust, and Zig reference compilers, and Microsoft’s C compiler.</p><p>Everybody except for GCC and the GNU toolchain (and its clones, Clang and TCC), who just have to be different.<sup id="b8"><a href="#f8">8</a></sup>
All the cool kids are doing it, why won’t you?
Even assemblers for other architectures use syntax that looks a <i>lot</i> like Intel syntax.
Even the Plan 9 assembler, made by many of the same AT&amp;T employees who made Unix and the original AT&amp;T assembler, walks back on some of AT&amp;T’s horrible mistakes (though unfortunately none of the important ones).<sup id="b9"><a href="#f9">9</a></sup></p><p>Be the trend!</p><p>(Is this really a reason to use Intel syntax?
 I think it is.
 AT&amp;T is somewhat entrenched in the unix world, where it’s used in components of the kernels and system libraries of most unices.
 But it’s not un-noteworthy that pretty much all non-trivial applications written assembly and targeting ‘SIB’ use the Intel syntax.
 Nor that all reverse-engineering tools—reverse-engineering being the area where readability of assembly is probably most important—use the Intel syntax.
 Nor that most assemblers—including newly-developed, open source ones—choose Intel syntax, like FASM, NASM, YASM, as well as, as previously mentioned, inline assemblers for D, Rust, and Zig.</p><p> Were all other things equal, it would be best to go with the standard solution.
 The fact that they are not only accentuates matters.)</p><h2>In closing</h2><p>Please, please, <i>please</i> stop using AT&amp;T syntax.</p><p>For your own sake and the world’s.</p><h2>Addenda</h2><p>(Or, non-reasons to use AT&amp;T syntax.)</p><p>I sometimes see arguments to the effect that AT&amp;T syntax is easier for machines to parse while Intel is easier for humans to parse;
or that AT&amp;T is easier for compilers to emit automatically while Intel is easier to write by hand;
or that AT&amp;T is closer to the actual instruction encoding;
or that sentences with fewer words are easier for humans to understand.
This is all nonsense.</p><p>It has a tiny kernel of truth: in the instruction encoding, size information really does go with the operation code, not the operands.
(Technically, it goes in between.)
That’s it.</p><p>Operand order is neither src,dst nor dst,src; it depends on the specific instruction.
Whenever an instruction has both a register and memory operand, the register operand goes first.
When an instruction has a memory and an immediate operand, the memory operand goes first.
And register goes before immediate.
When there are two register operands, they can usually go in either order; the assembler has a choice of encodings.</p><p>As noted, AT&amp;T syntax is more ambiguous and has more special cases than Intel.
Though it is also true that Intel needs to infer the context in which a label is used.</p><p>But you know what?</p><p>This is small fucking fry.</p><p>This is <i><b>inconsequential</b></i>.</p><p>This, in the grand scheme of things, is about on par with a water molecule asking Poseidon if it can have the weekend off to frolic in the clouds.</p><p>Poseidon doesn’t care about water molecules.
He has a whole damn <i>ocean</i> to worry about!</p><p>Worrying about water molecules instead of fluid dynamics and materials while your boat is sinking is pretty much the same as thinking that computer programs care what kind of assembler they ingest or excrete.
It’s completely trivial.</p><p>You know what’s hard?
Supporting all the operand encodings ‘SIB’ allows is <i>hard</i>.
Writing a good register allocator is <i>hard</i>.
Supporting a thousand different object formats used by different OSes is <i>hard</i>.
Making a good macro system is <i>hard</i>.
Creating a high-quality, correct mapping from assembly to a higher-level representation is <i>hard</i>.
These are tasks which are <i>hard</i> for assemblers and compilers and decompilers and other tools which interact with assembly.
Intel?
AT&amp;T?
Completely irrelevant.</p>
                <h2>Notes</h2><ol start="0"><li id="f0"><a href="#b0">(back)</a><br>(If you are not a pedant, you may skip the following paragraph.)<p>Yes, this is not technically a number, but a sequence of bytes which under the ASCII interpretation forms a sequence of numerals which can be interpreted under the big-endian octal base-radix representation to produce a number equivalent to that formed by the binary base-radix interpretation of a series of electrical impulses on a number of CPUs produced by CRAY.
I say this not because it’s interesting—though it is—but simply to deter the hair-splitters.
In fact, it is not a sequence of bytes at all but a set of anomalies in the brightnesses of the LEDs in your monitor.
(Unless you have printed it out, or photographed it, or transcribed it by hand.)
What is interesting is the glyphs and their interpretation, not their representation.</p></li><li id="f1"><a href="#b1">(back)</a><br>The CRAY-1 was a cute little (by modern standards) RISC with a relatively regular encoding; all instructions were either 16 or 32 bits.
(A copy of the reference manual can be found <a href="http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/cray/CAL/2240000B_Prelim_CAL_RefMan_Dec75.pdf">here</a>.)
Here’s what basic arithmetic instructions looked like:
<pre>g                       h                 i                 j                 k
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----
|    Operation code                       | Destination reg |  Source reg #1  |  Source reg #2
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----</pre>
<p>(The opcode is broken into two sections: the ‘g’ section, which comprises the first 4 bits, and the ‘h’, which gets the following 3.  I don’t know why.)</p>
<p>Though this form seems fairly simple to write by hand, there are special cases aplenty that justify the assembler (as well as more complicated instructions that go beyond basic arithmetic).
For instance, the zero register has special meaning to many instructions.
As mentioned earlier, 030514 represents something similar to A5 ← A1+A4.
The leading 7 bits are 030, which is the opcode for ‘add’; 5 is the destination register; and 1 and 4 are the source registers.
All this is fairly intuitive.
But consider something like 030510; you might expect that to mean A5 ← A1+A0, but it in fact means A5 ← A1+1.
(Not because A0 is some kind of ‘one register’, like ARM’s xzr or RISC-V’s x0; it’s just a special case for that instruction.
 030501, for instance, means A5 ← A1.)
An assembler lets you write the latter mnemonic form and get the correct result.
</p></li><li id="f2"><a href="#b2">(back)</a><br>Note the same rant applies to ARM.</li><li id="f3"><a href="#b3">(back)</a><br>The 5000-page tome is <a href="https://software.intel.com/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/documents-tps/325462-sdm-vol-1-2abcd-3abcd.pdf">here</a>.
There’s also a <a href="https://developer.amd.com/resources/developer-guides-manuals/">3000-page one</a> by AMD.
(In fact, this makes matters worse; both volumes are frequently confusing, so you need to keep both on hand in case one gives a better explanation than the other.)
And the unofficial references are <a href="https://www.agner.org/optimize/">Agner Fog’s</a> (specifically volumes <a href="https://www.agner.org/optimize/#manual_asm">two</a> and <a href="https://www.agner.org/optimize/#manual_microarch">three</a>).
</li><li id="f4"><a href="#b4">(back)</a><br>I like camembert. And brie. Gouda is really good too.</li><li id="f5"><a href="#b5">(back)</a><br>Though still not as moral as haskal.<!--&lt;meta name=sexp-is-better attr=pcj-is-fun not-using-xhtml=suck-it sgml=sad /&gt;--></li><li id="f6"><a href="#b6">(back)</a><br>
I think there’s even an argument to be made that a form like ‘dst op src’ would be superior to ‘op dst, src’ (like the CRAY <a href="#cray!">uses</a>).
But for some instructions that makes less sense; ‘eax inc’ is fine, but ‘.loop jnz’ less so, as what’s important is the act of jumping, not the jump destination.
Perhaps some pseudo-instructions could be implemented that would let you write ‘rip cmovnz .loop’ (à la ARM) and the right thing would happen; but that’s a hack at best.
But really, the current mode is fine.
With properly indented code the target operands are all aligned anyway, so it’s not difficult to scan them.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've blocked the user so they can't see this post to give you time to address this if you've been compromised. </p>

<p>Long story short, if you've installed and used that node, your browser passwords, credit card info, and browsing history have been sent to a Discord server via webhook. </p>

<p>I've been personally affected by this. About a week after I installed this package, I got a ton of malicious login notifications on a bunch of services, so I'm absolutely sure that they're actively using this data. </p>

<p>Here's how to verify:</p>

<p>The custom node has custom wheels for the OpenAI and Anthropic libraries in <a href="https://github.com/AppleBotzz/ComfyUI_LLMVISION/blob/main/requirements.txt">requirements.txt</a>.  Inside those wheels are malicious code. You can download the wheels and unzip to see what's inside. </p>

<p><strong>If you have the wheel labeled 1.16.2 installed:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's actually installing 1.16.3, which doesn't exist. There is no 1.16.3 — the release history goes from 1.16.2 to 1.17. <a href="https://pypi.org/project/openai/#history">https://pypi.org/project/openai/#history</a></li>
<li>Inside that package, you'll find /lib/browser/admin.py. This file reads your browser data and stores it in your temp directory in a subdirectory with the format pre_XXXXX_suf. Inside, you'll find C.txt and F.txt, corresponding to Chrome or Firefox data. </li>
<li>The file contains an encrypted string. When you decrypt, it points to a Discord webhook: <a href="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1226397926067273850/8DRvc59pUs0E0SuVGJXJUJSwD_iEjQUhq-G1iFoe6DjDv6Y3WiQJMQONetAokJD2nwym">https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1226397926067273850/8DRvc59pUs0E0SuVGJXJUJSwD_iEjQUhq-G1iFoe6DjDv6Y3WiQJMQONetAokJD2nwym</a></li>
<li>This file is sending your data to that webhook. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If you have 1.30.2 installed:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Again, it's compromised. You'll find openai/_OAI.py. Inside are two encrypted strings that are Pastebin links. I won't paste them here so you don't accidentally download the files... </li>
<li>The first Pastebin link contains another encrypted string that, when decrypted, points to another Discord webhook: <a href="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1243343909526962247/zmZbH3D5iMWsfDlbBIauVHc2u8bjMUSlYe4cosNfnV5XIP2ql-Q37hHBCI8eeteib2aB">https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1243343909526962247/zmZbH3D5iMWsfDlbBIauVHc2u8bjMUSlYe4cosNfnV5XIP2ql-Q37hHBCI8eeteib2aB</a></li>
<li>The second contains the URL for a presumably malicious file, VISION-D.exe. The script downloads and runs that file. </li>
<li>From looking at the rest of the code, it looks like the code is creating a registry entry, as well as stealing API keys and sending them to the Discord webhook. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Here's how to tell if you've been affected:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Check C:\Users\YourUser\AppData\Local\Temp. Look for directories with the format pre_XXXX_suf. Inside, check for a C.txt and F.txt. If so, your data has been compromised. </li>
<li>Check python_embedded\site-packages for the following packages. If you have any installed, your data has been compromised. Note that the latter two look like legitimate distributions. Check for the files I referenced above. 

<ol>
<li>openai-1.16.3.dist-info</li>
<li>anthropic-0.21.4.dist-info</li>
<li>openai-1.30.2.dist-info</li>
<li>anthropic-0.26.1.dist-info</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Check your Windows registry under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\OpenAICLI. You're looking for FunctionRun with a value of 1. If it's set, you've been compromised. </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Here's how to clean it up:</strong> </p>

<p>At least, from what I can tell... There may be more going on. </p>

<ol>
<li>Remove the packages listed above. </li>
<li>Search your filesystem for any references to the following files and remove them:

<ol>
<li>lib/browser/admin.py</li>
<li>Cadmino. py</li>
<li>Fadmino. py</li>
<li>VISION-D.exe</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Check your Windows registry for the key listed above and remove it. </li>
<li>Run a malware scanner. Mine didn't catch this. </li>
<li>Change all of your passwords, everywhere. </li>
<li><strong>F*** that guy.</strong> </li>
</ol>

<p>Before you assume that this was an innocent mistake, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/u/applebotzz">u/applebotzz</a> updated this code <em>twice,</em> making the code harder to spot the second time. This was deliberate. </p>

<p>From now on, I'll be carefully checking all of the custom nodes and extensions I install. I had kind of assumed that this community wasn't going to be like that, but apparently some people are like that. </p>

<p>F*** that guy. </p>

You needed the ability to sell yourself and your work.  You needed to attract funding. You needed the kind of interpersonal savvy that got you invited to speak at conferences and made people eager to mentor and support you. You needed to know how to do things that I have never had any interest in (flattering people, schmoozing, being agreeable when you disagree, even when you are 100% certain you are correct). You needed to know how to climb the political ladder, to value a hierarchy that had always seemed, at best, wholly uninteresting (and, at worst, antithetical to good science.) I wasn’t interested in those kills. I did not want to play political games. Nor did I think I should have to.</p></blockquote><p><span>A couple of months ago I wrote a piece called </span><a href="https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/the-flight-of-the-weird-nerd-from" rel="">“The flight of the Weird Nerd from academia”</a><span>, in which I argued there is a trend wherein Weird Nerds are being driven out of academia by the so-called Failed Corporatist phenotype.  Katalin Karikó is a perfect example of a Weird Nerd. I recently argued that many Weird Nerds (I called them autistics, but people really hated that</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-144974567" href="https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/the-weird-nerd-comes-with-trade-offs#footnote-2-144974567" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span>), have </span><a href="https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/autism-and-the-internet-will-defeat" rel="">found a refuge on the Internet</a><span>, where their strengths are amplified and their weaknesses are less important. There, I make the case for why these people are uniquely suited for creative intellectual endeavours and why they might slip through the cracks in a lot of normal jobs. Judging from a (short) lifetime of personal observations as well as the vitriol launched at Kariko for daring to not be “normal”, I suspect some explicit pro-Weird Nerd norms have to exist in an institution that seeks to properly utilize these people, for the benefit of us all. To formalize this:</span></p><p><span>“</span><em>Any system that is not explicitly pro-Weird Nerd will turn anti-Weird Nerd pretty quickly.”</em></p><p>That is because most people, while liking non-conformism in the abstract and post-facto, are not very willing to actually put up with the personality trade-offs of Weird Nerds in practice. There is an increasing number of people right now who are thinking about how to build better intellectual institutions (e.g. those who study metascience.) Yet surprisingly little attention is given to human capital outside of  “Let’s increase immigration” (a good idea, don’t get me wrong.) But if the rule turns out to be true, I think it’s worth thinking about what kind of people one wants to attract in these institutions and how to keep them there. And I believe the conversation here starts with accepting a simple truth, which is that Weird Nerds will have certain traits that might be less than ideal, that these traits come “in a package” with other, very good traits, and if one makes filtering or promotion based on the absence of those traits a priority, they will miss out on the positives. It means really internalizing the existence of trade-offs in human personality, in an era where accepting trade-offs is deeply unfashionable, and structuring institutions and their cultures while keeping them in mind.</p><p><span>In </span><a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/nobel-prize-mrna-covid-vaccine-science-scientists-6m6w5cqh0" rel="">one of her interviews</a><span>, Katalin Karikó recalls her mother calling her from Hungary around the time when the Nobel Prizes were awarded and asking her if that year she was going to win it. The question, in its loving naivete, must have stung worse than an insult: not only was Karikó not close to this remarkable feat, she was actually unsuccessful by much less ambitious metrics. Put simply, she had left her family in Hungary to work in the US, but for little actual measurable reward, be it status or money. Karikó did not get grants. Karikó did not get tenure. What Karikó did was work until late at night on a topic people did not pay that much attention to at the time: mRNA for vaccines. And she did that for decades. Paul Graham talks about an underrated quality one needs for extreme success, namely the willingness to be low status. And Karikó had plenty of that: she lived her convictions, in this case the conviction in the importance of mRNA through rejections, humiliations (her office was vacated without her having received prior notice) and hardship. I would go even further and say: she had intellectual courage. </span></p><p>People often mistake a non-descript combination of conscientiousness coupled with high intelligence with Genius. By that definition, there is some decent amount of Genius in Science. Some people, like those getting mad at Karikó for that passage, go even further: Genius is so abundant in Science, that we can barely find our way through it: we are drowning in it! Of course, this is just a “feel-goodism” people like to tell themselves. Genius is very rare, in Science and outside of it, and it’s linked to intellectual courage, the quality Karikó had an abundance of. And it’s not only that Genius as a whole is rare in the population: it also usually shines in specific places. Karikó was a Genius at Biology and maybe at nothing else. For someone to be a Genius, many pieces have to fall into place: the right personality has to be there, the right happenings have to happen and so on. We should catalyze the right circumstances for Genius to manifest itself more, instead of diminishing them. In Kariko’s case, it seems like the unnecessarily political nature of Science and the fact that her specific workplace was not very Weird Nerd- friendly were obstacles. It’s good they did not stop her. But there are probably many 70%, or 80% or 95% Katalin Karikos who were not merely hampered, but stopped. And that’s probably a huge loss.</p><p><span>To have so much intellectual courage one has to be a bit mad. It’s hard to believe this needs to be said, but the no trade-off world many people like to pretend is real does not, in fact, exist. It’s reasonable to expect Weird Nerds or anyone else for that matter to be ethical and not become toxic colleagues. And listening to the interviews with Karikó one hardly gets the impression that she was toxic: there is a Jesus-like quality to </span><a href="https://josephnoelwalker.com/147-katalin-kariko/" rel="">the way she talks</a><span> even about the people who had wronged her — for example about a Professor who threatened to have her deported. It’s hard to imagine that coming from a “jerk”, as many have called her. But it’s also hard to believe someone like her could ever become the most pleasant interlocutor at a dinner party, or the most socially adept and organized manager. And that is fine. We need her in the lab, not at fancy dinners.</span></p><p><span>Now, one could argue that Karikó and Weird Nerds should just </span><em>learn to be strategic and suck it up</em><span>, like most people do</span><em>. </em><span>I sensed quite a bit of </span><em>schadenfreude </em><span>from people suggesting we should be making people like her suffer through the same arduous processes as everyone else. Of course, if I was Katalin Karikó ’s friend, I would advise her to try and play the political game if that’s what’s needed. Maybe it would have been better for her in the moment. But it might be the case that if she did listen to such advice, she would have been so drained of energy that less time would have been spent pursuing her interests. Or she would have just switched research fields to work on something more popular. </span></p><p>Everything comes at a cost: spend more time worrying about politics, there will be less time for science. What’s more, the kind of people who really care about science or truth to the extent that Karikó did, are not the same people that get motivated by playing politics or being incredibly pleasant. There is a strong anti-correlation between these interests (that of course does not mean there is no one who is good at both.) Selecting future intellectuals based on traits like Agreeableness or Extraversion might not be only unnecessary, but actually harmful. We might be actively depleting the talent pool of the kind of people we do want to see in academic institutions.</p><p><span>A full scientific career these days is a bit of a cacophony. It starts with doing a lot of what is essentially grunt work in a lab or on a computer. Slowly, one moves up the ladder and gains more independence. Postdoc is probably the stage that maps best to what people usually imagine when they think of a scientist: that’s when one is fully in charge of their projects, but also spends their day-to-day doing actual scientific work. Ironically, it’s also the most precarious: postdocs are often in their 30s, jumping between relatively  short term contracts. The way out of this is to become a PI, or Principal Investigator. In 2011, the average age at which a biomedical scientist gets their first R01 grant to establish their independent career as a </span><a href="https://drugmonkey.wordpress.com/2012/02/14/updating-the-age-of-first-nih-r01-award-trends-flatlining/" rel="">PI is 42</a><span>, having increased from 36 in the 80s. It has probably increased since then. As a PI, interpersonal skills become more and more important: one has to forge collaborations, write and get grants, take care of the fragile mental health of confused PhD students so they can produce work and so on. The skills required to be a successful PhD student and postdoc are in many ways very different from those required to be a good PI, almost as if they were different careers.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8929f743-7b0a-44aa-bae4-0da87d57070d_2298x1510.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8929f743-7b0a-44aa-bae4-0da87d57070d_2298x1510.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8929f743-7b0a-44aa-bae4-0da87d57070d_2298x1510.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8929f743-7b0a-44aa-bae4-0da87d57070d_2298x1510.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8929f743-7b0a-44aa-bae4-0da87d57070d_2298x1510.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8929f743-7b0a-44aa-bae4-0da87d57070d_2298x1510.png" width="1456" height="957" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8929f743-7b0a-44aa-bae4-0da87d57070d_2298x1510.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:957,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:516701,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8929f743-7b0a-44aa-bae4-0da87d57070d_2298x1510.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8929f743-7b0a-44aa-bae4-0da87d57070d_2298x1510.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8929f743-7b0a-44aa-bae4-0da87d57070d_2298x1510.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8929f743-7b0a-44aa-bae4-0da87d57070d_2298x1510.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Age at first R01 grant </figcaption></figure></div><p><span>It’s at this young PI stage that Karikó ’s career hit a wall: after she became an Adjunct Professor, she stopped advancing further.

But some of it was probably her personality, as she says herself.

It is also somewhat more clear if a scientific piece of work is completely bad. There is feedback from industry, with most start-ups in biotech these days coming out of academic labs: this provides a strong incentive for innovation. Such quality check mechanisms are on much more shaky ground in fields like Humanities, where feedback from society can happen on the order of decades.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-3836983834587188524" itemprop="articleBody">
<p>I can't remember how I first came across these near-ultrasonic 'beacons' ubiquitous in PA systems. I might have been scrolling through the audio spectrum while waiting for the underground train; or it might have been the screeching 'tinnitus-like' sensation I would often get near the loudspeakers at a local shopping centre.</p>

<p><img alt="" data-original-height="355" data-original-width="1040" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhCLaN93e4G6KQRBoHUTc1Kiuwi1OMfX8X0Xl4OljgQrQv8OE-IdQbyPUknY7fD0CznNyHvFlc8EXA4UqY7NxTULgdIaoSZK6dcvjIQafDNi60TW-At0leFRvWRaD863sEmuOoAyxYSSYcO7u5PZeNWXvuAAJCC7rmG981uV6jYiVSEfk6mvRHbPQTaZTFd/s520/pilots.png" srcset="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhCLaN93e4G6KQRBoHUTc1Kiuwi1OMfX8X0Xl4OljgQrQv8OE-IdQbyPUknY7fD0CznNyHvFlc8EXA4UqY7NxTULgdIaoSZK6dcvjIQafDNi60TW-At0leFRvWRaD863sEmuOoAyxYSSYcO7u5PZeNWXvuAAJCC7rmG981uV6jYiVSEfk6mvRHbPQTaZTFd/s1040/pilots.png 2x" width="520"></p>

<p>Whatever the case, I learned that they are called pilot tones. Many multi-loudspeaker PA systems (like the <a href="https://wiki.zenitel.com/wiki/VPA_-_Public_Address_Amplifiers#Speaker_line_fault_detection">Zenitel VPA</a> and <a href="https://axystunnel.com/en/products/end-of-line-detection-eol">Axys End of Line detection unit</a>) employ these roughly 20-kilohertz tones to continuously measure the system's health status: no pilot tone means no connection to a loudspeaker. It's usually set to a very high frequency, inaudible to humans, to avoid disturbing customers.</p>

<p>However, these tones are powerful and some people will still hear them, especially if the frequency gets below 20 kHz. There is one such system at 19.595 kHz in my city; it's marked green in the graph above. I've heard of several other people that also hear the sound. I don't believe it to be a sonic weapon like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mosquito">The Mosquito</a>; those use even lower frequencies, down to 17 kHz. It's probably just a misconfiguration that was never fixed because the people working on it couldn't experientially confirm any issue with it.</p>

<h3>Hidden modulation.</h3>

<p>Pretty quickly it became apparent that this sound is almost never a pure tone. Some kind of modulation can always be seen wiggling around it in the spectrogram. Is it caused by the background music being played through the PA system? Is it carrying some information? Or is it something else altogether?</p>

<p>I've found at least one place where the tone appears to be amplitude modulated by the lowest frequencies in the music or commercials playing. It's probably a side effect of some kind of distortion.</p>

<p>Here's a spectrogram plot of this amplitude modulation around the strong pilot tone. It's colour-coded so that the purple colour is coming from the right microphone channel and green from the left. I'm not quite sure what the other purple horizontal stripes are here.</p>

<p><img alt="" data-original-height="406" data-original-width="597" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg-_T-Ac5llsRcSWkgbsql-M4SF5kKSWCvDIq1IU7EalUEF91fpCK8dkKArMjo-WCfzt3rAfmTy-XD0IVOBJR9qOcbPPLO6RnJ0K16IHwK_w1vheTbVVzXG9LNhNAlSTCNJaqQ0PG93FqgxqJfnVdPxihg3dxgB7SWrv__ry7GsZjdfnRSG-AQTL8pYZUtG/s520/pilot_modulation.jpg" width="520"></p>

<p>But this kind of modulation is rare. It's more common to see the tone change in response to things happening around you, like people moving about. More on that in the following.</p>

<h3>Doppler-shifted backscatter.</h3>

<p>Look what happens to the pilot tone when a train arrives at an underground station:</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgSd5MGkEHuqMDmuszJNqDgQ2dRl3cnYHFqr5KnUYCK43dQFJuQa0rYiPMPOyrn9lt11UfRjzfwfGw5SEUQv9wmNPRkZ56li-bau7tgmifno7wDhxxMvdt0-_II4CWhS_OpHqw8LyY9RTpqh4pWRVwthlXgd6kXRwap4yAPGlXbtRGM4NWnD2Xgx99gGIVI/s681/metro-doppler.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="526" data-original-width="681" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgSd5MGkEHuqMDmuszJNqDgQ2dRl3cnYHFqr5KnUYCK43dQFJuQa0rYiPMPOyrn9lt11UfRjzfwfGw5SEUQv9wmNPRkZ56li-bau7tgmifno7wDhxxMvdt0-_II4CWhS_OpHqw8LyY9RTpqh4pWRVwthlXgd6kXRwap4yAPGlXbtRGM4NWnD2Xgx99gGIVI/s520/metro-doppler.jpg" width="520"></a></p>

<p>The wideband screech in the beginning is followed by this interesting tornado-shaped pattern that seems to have a lot of structure inside of it. It lasts for 15 seconds, until the train comes to a stop.</p>

<p>It's my belief that this is backscatter, also known as reverb, from the pilot tone reflecting off the slowing train and getting Doppler-shifted on the way. The pilot tone works as a continuously-transmitting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bistatic_sonar">bistatic sonar</a>. Here, the left microphone (green) hears a mostly negative Doppler shift whereas the right channel (purple) hears a positive one, as the train is passing us from right to left. An anti-aliasing filter has darkened the higher frequencies as I wasn't yet aware I would find something interesting up here when recording.</p>

<p>A zoomed-in view of this cone reveals these repeating sweeps from positive to negative and red to green. Are they reflections off of some repeating structure in the passing train? The short horizontal bursts of constant tone could then be surfaces that are angled in a different direction than the rest of the train. Or perhaps this repetition reflects the regular placement of loudspeakers around the station?</p>

<p><img alt="" data-original-height="574" data-original-width="1356" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgIpMblTl7xXcQEPtN2gOGfa_EDP2KZJCikptc6K3crsBYg9p5H3Ua_z-qUXmXEEJvHiW1Sy4-wBWVYZwSPz1kaezgqgSaCqUjZhyphenhyphenPKFOAeL99kgdY6NW8M0FEmE2ErVQLAcpzcPm9UQXWM3uCEozlvoIIasHP6LfRA4sDCM_kXc-7q1k8TIlUfDKoleVrF/s520/metro-doppler-2.jpg" srcset="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgIpMblTl7xXcQEPtN2gOGfa_EDP2KZJCikptc6K3crsBYg9p5H3Ua_z-qUXmXEEJvHiW1Sy4-wBWVYZwSPz1kaezgqgSaCqUjZhyphenhyphenPKFOAeL99kgdY6NW8M0FEmE2ErVQLAcpzcPm9UQXWM3uCEozlvoIIasHP6LfRA4sDCM_kXc-7q1k8TIlUfDKoleVrF/s1040/metro-doppler-2.jpg 2x" width="520"></p>

<h3>Moving the microphone.</h3>

<p>Another interesting experiment: I took the lift to another floor and recorded the ride from inside the lift. It wasn't the metal box type, the walls were made of glass, so I thought the pilot tone should be at least somewhat audible inside. Here's what I got during the 10-second ride. It's a little buried in noise.</p>

<p><img alt="" data-original-height="260" data-original-width="567" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh_0XjZC3uU7NrdCj3qXOspv4F11P_c1oNm-TGuo-oC_fGRxSQpazMgTKxn2_jlv9dMpSGMuy35kmBqEFKyJSZAcmkaC0blyshTYSSdeORjtFXiY3bDg2ahuctUkXzJw2PV_Mjrm_273hpl6HrTa4r7wGo2J0Nfn-o_-vClCx6q2PVyiUcvUuvHxGOkpyMf/s520/hissi.jpg" width="520"></p>

<h3>Scooter calculation.</h3>

<p>For the next experiment I went into the underground car park of a shopping centre. I stood right under a PA loudspeaker and recorded a person on a scooter passing by. A lot of interesting stuff is happening in this stereo spectrogram!</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhd8dFTuxIGzjNucYd5NajbKS6-G3bBQywiSqN4LKMhUVkHyN7ZiOdWBqBPi7tr-0oWFMh-Pl-8TX_fbcNGJe2aw8_mEZ5S-tF-9UAUk7zulsUuW018fXjHQq40b39DZACbHKvx3xdfbaXhCAHUS3oY4ESKZPJqLO_R1S_D6iVxfxsMCNsfVoxMI5XxItpC/s670/skede-doppler.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="500" data-original-width="670" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhd8dFTuxIGzjNucYd5NajbKS6-G3bBQywiSqN4LKMhUVkHyN7ZiOdWBqBPi7tr-0oWFMh-Pl-8TX_fbcNGJe2aw8_mEZ5S-tF-9UAUk7zulsUuW018fXjHQq40b39DZACbHKvx3xdfbaXhCAHUS3oY4ESKZPJqLO_R1S_D6iVxfxsMCNsfVoxMI5XxItpC/s520/skede-doppler.jpg" width="520"></a></p>

<p>First of all, there seems to be two pilot tones, one at 19,595 Hz and a much quieter one at 19,500 Hz. Are there two different PA systems in the car park?</p>

<p>Second, there's a clear Doppler shift in the reverb. The frequency shift goes from positive to negative at the same moment that the scooter passes us, seen as the wideband wheel noise changing color. It looks like the pattern is also 'filled in' with noise under this Doppler curve. What all information can we find out just by looking at this image?</p>

<p>If we ignore the fact that this is actually a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bistatic_radar#Doppler_shift">bistatic doppler shift</a> we could try and estimate the speed using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_radar#Frequency_variation">a formula on Wikipedia</a>. It was pretty chilly in the car park, I would say 15 °C. The speed of sound at 15 °C is 340 m/s. The maximum Doppler shift here seems to be 350 Hz. Plugging all these into the equation we get 11 km/h, which sounds like a realistic speed for a scooter.</p>

<p>Why is it filled in? My thought is these are reflections off different points on our test subject. There's variation in the reflection angles and, consequently, magnitudes of the velocity component that causes frequency shifting, down to nearly zero Hz.</p>

<h3>What now?</h3>

<p>What would you do with this ultrasonic beep all around you? I have some free ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Automated speed trap in the car park</li>
  <li>Detect when the escalators stop working</li>
  <li>Modulate it with a positioning code to prevent people getting lost in the maze of commerce</li>
  <li>Use it to deliver ads somehow</li>
  <li>Use it to find your way to the quietest spots in a shopping centre</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>Today I want to start with a comment by a colleague, Texas antitrust lawyer Basel Musharbash, observing a restaurant trying to do a renovation in Dallas. “Something funky is happening in the building materials supply chain,” he </span><a href="https://twitter.com/musharbash_b/status/1790487013239447927" rel="">wrote</a><span> . “A 3,000 sq. ft. commercial space in a strip mall shouldn’t cost $720,000 to renovate into an Italian food joint.” He’s right. It shouldn’t. And yet it does.</span></p><p>This attitude of ‘something is very wrong with our society’ is everywhere now. Corporate procurement officers just assume costs are going up, it’s in budget projections for the Defense Department, and we expect cost overruns on everything. ‘Inflation’ is now a catch-all for a basic view that stuff is just going to suck more and more. </p><p>So what’s going on? Today’s piece is about a concept I am going to call ‘economic termites,’ which are instances of monopolization big enough to make investors a huge amount of money, but not noticeable enough for most of us. An individual termite isn’t big enough to matter, but the existence of a termite is extremely bad news, because it means there are others. Add enough of them up, and you get our modern economic experience.</p><p>The concept of an economic termite is the cousin to Cory Doctorow’s ‘enshittification’ or Yves Smith’s ‘crapification,’ terms that describe how a platform gradually degrades the quality of its service as it gains market power and gets pushed to extract cash by financiers. Economic termites describes where these same forces get into the mostly unseen business foundations of our society and profiteer.</p><p>These termites are in the infrastructure or guts of business, like recruiting services, construction equipment or software, the industrial gasses that go into chemicals and electronics, and so forth. It’s the stuff you don’t see that makes our world turn, there’s fortunes to be made, and bottlenecks to foster.</p><p>They also explain a dynamic we all face, a profound wariness in our society, a sense that stuff just costs more and is more difficult, for no discernible reason. Added up, these end up sapping our faith in the American system, because they make what seem like simple problems become not just unsolvable, but not even capable of being diagnosed. In this issue, I’ll cover some of the companies you don’t realize are gnawing at the foundation of our society - Verisign, Autodesk, Linde, Assa Abloy, Gracenote, and LinkedIn. And yes, there are legal tools to address them. But first we have to realize that these bottlenecks are everywhere. </p><p>We’ll start with a corporation I pay to host this newsletter.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dc0adfe-d2c2-43d7-9ee0-35bb86edc8be_1200x900.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dc0adfe-d2c2-43d7-9ee0-35bb86edc8be_1200x900.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dc0adfe-d2c2-43d7-9ee0-35bb86edc8be_1200x900.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dc0adfe-d2c2-43d7-9ee0-35bb86edc8be_1200x900.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dc0adfe-d2c2-43d7-9ee0-35bb86edc8be_1200x900.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dc0adfe-d2c2-43d7-9ee0-35bb86edc8be_1200x900.jpeg" width="1200" height="900" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7dc0adfe-d2c2-43d7-9ee0-35bb86edc8be_1200x900.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:900,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;The secret ingredient is crime : r/MitchellAndWebb&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="The secret ingredient is crime : r/MitchellAndWebb" title="The secret ingredient is crime : r/MitchellAndWebb" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dc0adfe-d2c2-43d7-9ee0-35bb86edc8be_1200x900.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dc0adfe-d2c2-43d7-9ee0-35bb86edc8be_1200x900.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dc0adfe-d2c2-43d7-9ee0-35bb86edc8be_1200x900.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dc0adfe-d2c2-43d7-9ee0-35bb86edc8be_1200x900.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>A few months ago, Verisign - which is the government-designated monopolist that runs the registration of .com addresses - announced </span><a href="https://domainnamewire.com/2024/02/08/verisign-announces-com-price-hike-to-10-26/" rel="">a price hike</a><span>, from $9.59 per year for .com addresses to $10.26. If you’ve ever bought or renewed a website, Verisign has gotten some of your money. I have to pay this fee to register TheBigNewsletter.com domain name, every year. So does everyone else who has a domain name.</span></p><p>An increase of less than a dollar a year is not a big deal. But over the decades, these price hikes have been routine. A few years ago, the price to renew a .com domain was $6 a year. Then $7. Then $8. Verisign has hiked prices every year, up to the maximum set by the government (until Trump removed the price cap altogether in 2018.)</p><p>Today, Verisign is the single most profitable company in the stock market, a great example of an economic termite. In 2013, its operating margins were 54.7%, by 2023 they grew to a crazy 67.1%. Verisign doesn’t invest this money; in 2023, it spent $882 million of it on stock buybacks. Its expenses are basically running a simple database, its strategy is to hike prices just below what will be noticed, and its method is to have politically connected people like Clinton Justice Department official Jamie Gorelick - who is one of Merrick Garland’s good friends - on its board.</p><p>Where did Verisign’s monopoly come from? Well, it was due to the last four administrations choosing to ‘privatize’ domain registration to a ‘multi-stakeholder group,’ the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which has a deal with Verisign to allow it to maintain the monopoly. ICAAN could at any point put the contract out on domain management for bid, and you’d see corporations come in at $2/year, certainly much less than $10.26. But they haven’t ever done that. Their contract strikes me as unlawful, a straightforward agreement in ‘restraint of trade.’ Yet, Verisign has a weird agreement with U.S. government’s National Telecommunications Information Administration (NTIA), which is widely perceived to provide the firm with legal cover for its clearly monopolistic behavior. </p><p>In less than three months, the NTIA, which is run by former Google lobbyist Alan Davidson, has a choice of whether to renew its agreement with Verisign. I don’t know what Davidson will decide. He might not perceive it as worth his time to fight with this economic termite. But he should, because termites are a bad sign.</p><p>Also, I want my money back!</p><p>Talk to anyone in architecture or engineering design for big construction projects, and it’s not hard to find complaints about software provider Autodesk, which sits in the computer aided design (CAD) space. “I have personally been bullied by Autodesk while CTO at a design firm using predatory practices that dictated pricing unlike any software contract I've negotiated in my 30 year career,” one BIG reader wrote me. “I continue to hear stories from all leaders in the industry with aspirations to create a sustainable, human centered built environment, but limited by pricing and poor quality of a single tool (Autodesk).”</p><p><span>Autodesk is the classic economic termite. As one Wall Street analyst </span><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4632529-autodesk-q2-earnings-pricing-power-continue-sustain-growth-near-term" rel="">put it</a><span> in praising the stock, “Like other software suites providing extensive support for customer workflows, ADSK's offerings can demand premium prices due to their prevailing market dominance. When juxtaposed with the overall expenses of a </span><strong>construction project, which might reach millions of dollars, the cost of these products remains relatively minor</strong><span>.”</span></p><p><span>There are rivals in the market, but as another source noted, “The switching costs associated with CAD software are gargantuan, a reality incumbents leverage&nbsp;more&nbsp;or less mercilessly.” The result, he added, is that “there’s not all that much organic innovation in the past 25 years, but lots of steady growth.” Just going to Glassdoor, there are a </span><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Autodesk-Reviews-E1155.htm" rel="">large number of employee complaints</a><span> consistent with a firm that has market power, mostly about poor leadership and constant reorganizations due to acquisitions, but extending to unethical sales practices and a few claims of fraud. </span></p><p><span>In 2020, UK based architecture firms </span><a href="https://www.archpaper.com/2020/07/leading-architecture-firms-pen-open-letter-to-autodesk/" rel="">penned</a><span> an open letter to Autodesk complaining about high prices and poor innovation, “censuring the Silicon Valley-based design software and services giant for the mounting ownership costs—an increase as much as 70 percent over a five-year span through the end of 2019—of its central </span><a href="https://www.archpaper.com/tag/bim/" rel="">BIM</a><span> product, </span><a href="https://www.archpaper.com/tag/revit/" rel="">Revit</a><span>.” The software, they argued, has “remained mostly stagnant and that firms dependent on the aging software (it’s now 20 years old) have been faced with, among other things, ever-changing licensing models, aggressive sales tactics in enterprise licensing, and a lack of understanding of the business dynamics within the industry that the company serves.”</span></p><p><span>The likely reason for this market power is that Autodesk makes it hard to switch, both through technical means and aggressive sales tactics. As one customer said in the </span><a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/3ds-max-ideas/stop-being-an-abusive-monopoly/idi-p/10304199" rel="">Autodesk forums from</a><span> a few years ago, “The only feature request I’ll make is antitrust action against Autodesk.”</span></p><p>Generative AI might change the dynamic in the industry, but if there isn’t antitrust action, it will be deployed poorly.</p><p>In 2018, the second and third largest industrial gas companies, Linde and Praxair, combined to become the biggest firm in a very concentrated industry. Industrial gasses are chemicals, like oxygen, nitrogen and argon, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, helium, acetylene and specialty gases, that go into a ‘countless’ number of products, from MRI machines to frozen fish to semiconductors to steel to carbon capture and renewable energy. The Biden Inflation Reduction Act has supercharged the industry.</p><p><span>The merger was a controversial deal within the government, with the Trump Federal Trade Commission blessing the deal, though requiring the new firm to sell off some assets to a private equity joint venture. (FTC Commission Chopra </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/1416947/1710068_praxair_linde_rc_statement.pdf" rel="">dissented</a><span> and opposed the merger.) </span></p><p><span>Immediately after the combination with Praxair, Linde announced substantial </span><a href="https://www.linde.com/news-and-media/2019/linde-announces-price-increases-effective-december-1-2019" rel="">price hikes</a><span>, and it has continued to increase prices ever since. In the last quarter of 2023, for instance, according to Linde’s investment documents, its sales in the U.S. </span><a href="https://www.linde.com/news-and-media/2024/linde-reports-full-year-and-fourth-quarter-2023-results" rel="">grew</a><span> by 6%, “driven by 5% higher pricing and 1% volumes.” And the root of its pricing power isn’t hidden; in 2022, its 10% boost in profit was, according to the </span><a href="https://assets.linde.com/-/media/global/corporate/corporate/documents/investors/full-year-financial-reports/2022-linde-annual-report-to-shareholders.pdf" rel="">corporation’s annual report</a><span>, “primarily due to higher pricing… driven by merger related assets.” Operating margins went from about 10% in 2019 to 16% in 2022 to 27.6% in 2023. In 2023, the company paid out 50% more to investors than it invested into the business.</span></p><p>Today, the industry is a lot like Verisign, on a larger scale. Industrial gases are essential to customers, but also an afterthought, because they are usually a small percentage of the customer’s cost. No one really cares if there are price hikes, as long as the gases are delivered. It’s also hard to switch, distribution is a bottleneck, and long-term supply contracts are common. The result, for Linde, is high operating margins, low investment, and lots of dividends and buybacks.

Long story short they agreed to partner with my company, they had us design our IOS/Android app to their code, and I developed my lockers around one of their smart lock products. After spending over $500,000 into the partnership, they decided to pull support. Causing my app to crash and all of my locations to be uninstalled. Now we are not operational and are at risk of forced failure for NO REASON. They believe that because I am a startup company, I cannot fight back. </span></p></div></blockquote><p>A bit of coercion leads to no innovation, and then a few pennies drawn from the pocket of every homebuyer, landlord, and renter out there…</p><p><span>In 2016, Nielson’s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/20/nielsen-acquires-gracenote/" rel="">acquired</a><span> a corporation called Gracenote for $560 million, which provides metadata for movie, music and TV listings for use in user interfaces on cable, satellite, streaming services, automobiles, hotels, and hardware.

And because data is woven into an organization’s fabric, switching costs are quite high. The restrictions on the use of data make moving gradually to another provider of data almost impossible, and prevent the use of different forms of data to make discovery of content better and cheaper.</p><p>I can’t find pricing information, but since Nielson’s is now owned by private equity/hedge fund Elliot Management, I suspect they aren’t shy about taking advantage of market power. Another dime out of every viewer’s pocket.</p><p><span>Over the years, professional recruiters have been telling me about increasingly worse terms offered by LinkedIn. What’s the problem? Is LinkedIn really a monopoly? Well maybe not from a consumer’s perspective. But from the perspective of recruiting firms? That case is more compelling. “LinkedIn is the&nbsp;</span><em>only</em><span>&nbsp;dominant social professional network, with ~1 billion public resumés,” I was told. “They have no true competitors in ‘sourcing software’ for recruiters searching to attract passive job candidates for most all veins of corporate work.” There’s also direct evidence of market power. Earlier this year, LinkedIn imposed a 174% price increase on its customers, who are professional recruiters that scour the database for potential hiring. </span></p><p>And I looked into it, and yes, this one looks like a market power story. In fact, Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn and a big political donor, wrote a book called “Blitzscaling” in which he discussed the importance of getting big before anyone else. He used that recipe to build LinkedIn, the largest professional social media network, before selling it to Microsoft in 2017 for $26 billion. (Microsoft also owns GitHub, which is the other key place to source mid-career technical talent.)</p><p><span>There are a number of mechanisms LinkedIn uses to maintain its monopoly. The key is, as Google and Amazon do in their areas of network dominance, to </span><em>deny scale </em><span>to potential rivals. While most people think a LinkedIn profile is a public facing resume, in fact, Microsoft fiercely controls who can access that data in bulk, </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-supreme-court-revives-linkedin-bid-shield-personal-data-2021-06-14/" rel="">litigating</a><span> to deny the use of LinkedIn profiles to potential rivals, except for </span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/crowder-etal-linkedin-complaint.pdf" rel="">certain companies</a><span>, “such as Google,” which are whitelisted. Why would Google be allowed to search LinkedIn profiles? I’m guessing there’s a market allocation agreement. After all, it would seem pretty trivial for Google to launch a rival product, but it hasn’t. </span></p><p>Thousands of small agencies rely on LinkedIn, and have been gradually driven out of business as Microsoft, its owner, generates more revenue. These make it slightly more expensive to hire, an indirect tiny cost borne by everyone in the economy.</p><p>I could on, and I eventually will. (For instance, Waste Management is an obvious termite.) But you get the point. Small hidden tollbooths everywhere eventually foster economic tyranny.</p><p>Now of course it’s not all hidden. There are big monopolies in our economy. Live Nation/Ticketmaster, for instance, is likely responsible for big price increases in live entertainment, and UnitedHealth Group is driving up prices in health insurance. Oil price-fixing, rent price-fixing, and meat price-fixing are each individually a big deal. But the aggregate cost increases we’re seeing in random areas often can’t be traced to one big villain. But they can be traced to many small ones. </p><p>Where did these economic termites come from? We decided four and a half decades ago that monopolies were good. After 1998, the Antitrust Division stopped bringing monopolization cases, and in 2005, the Supreme Court unanimously endorsed monopolization as foundational to the health of American economy. After twenty years of not bringing cases, business executives realized the best way to run a business was to create a tollbooth in some mostly unnoticed part of society. So now, each supply chain is made up of a bunch of different bottlenecks, too small to notice.</p><p>That said, there are commonalities among these industries that make these problems easier to solve. Most of these firms use the tactic of building a network or standardizing a business on their platform, and then denying necessary scale to their rivals through technical, contractual, or business tactics. They often use exclusive contracts. They also often rely on expansive patent, copyright, or trademark claims, sometimes government sanctions for their market power. They are ‘capital light,’ usually in opposition to the new industrial policy goals of ‘bending metal.’ </p><p>As the big antitrust claims work through the courts, and as government policy design moves away from supporting consolidation, trends in business will change. Executives will get worried about being sued. Rivals will start calling lawyers, class action attorneys will see more opportunity, journalists will write more stories, and judges will learn. It’s becoming easier to see analogies and bring private cases. And over time, we’ll start to once again see these kinds of monopolization techniques as we do other moral wrongs based on unfairly exploiting power.</p><p><span>Thanks for reading!
