<p><span>Anime – what started as a niche genre of manga and animation has become a multi-billion dollar </span><a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/anime-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>industry</span></a><span> in its own right, with chart-topping games like </span><a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/pokmon-go-catches-nearly-8-billion-in-eight-years/#:~:text=Niantic's%20Pok%C3%A9mon%20Go%20has,launched%2C%20according%20to%20AppMagic%20estimates." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Pok</span><span>é</span><span>mon Go</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1208573/genshin-impact-player-spending-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Genshin Impact</span></a><span> grossing billions and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_Slayer:_Kimetsu_no_Yaiba_%E2%80%93_The_Movie:_Mugen_Train" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>movies</span></a><span> like Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba becoming one of the highest grossing films of the year.

We estimate the total </span><b>market size of anime to be north of $50B</b><span>, once accounting for anime, comics, and games (</span><a href="https://www.data.ai/en/go/the-state-of-anime-gaming-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>data</span></a><span>.ai, </span><a href="https://www.precedenceresearch.com/anime-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Precedence Research</span></a><span>).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Yet, </span><b>we believe that anime is just getting started – today, new technologies and business models are accelerating a once niche industry to even greater heights</b><span>. Anime is where the future of creation and play is happening, whether with innovative games on our phones, user-created fanfictions and games, roleplaying as the characters themselves, or interactions with AI-versions of these fictional beings. We believe that anime will become one of the dominant formats through which we consume and engage with content.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The usual lifecycle of an anime fan looks something like this: they are introduced to the format with great IP – the Attack on Titan anime or the One Piece live action show or one of the miHoYo games. They then deepen their fandom through new forms of social and creative engagement (UGC, VTubing, community formation, cosplay, etc.). </span><b>What we’re most excited about is how anime engagement has evolved from passive to interactive over the last few years. </b><span>This has happened along a few different axes:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>AI companions</b><span>, an evolution of classic visual novels, are the most popular for anime characters and IP. They are quickly becoming one of the dominant forms of roleplay.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>UGC platforms</b><span> (user-generated content) such as Roblox allow anime fans to create their own renditions of popular anime games much more easily than ever before. Fans can express their creativity with play that they define themselves.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Anime studios</b><span> are adopting new AI technologies to create content faster and more cost effectively, but they are also iterating on new core loops with AI-native character interactions.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>VTubing</b><span> has transformed the way millions of anime fans interact with their favorite characters in new social and parasocial relationships by allowing any fan to roleplay as the characters themselves.&nbsp;</span></li>

<h2><span>A Quick History of Anime</span></h2>
<p><span>Anime is a genre of animation that originated from Japan and is known for its distinctive art style: bright colorful graphics, strong outlines, large, exaggerated eyes and features, and brightly colored hair. It originated in the early 1900s with visual strips, but really started becoming more popular in the 60s and 70s with shows like </span><i><span>Astro Boy, Lupin III, Akira, Mobile Suit Gundam, </span></i><span>and of course, Hayao Miyazaki’s works at Studio Ghibli. Anime entered the mainstream in the 2000s with popular shounen anime like Naruto, One Piece, and now Attack on Titan. You might see football players referencing the Attack on Titan </span><a href="https://twitter.com/chargers/status/1367264349581148170" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>salute</span></a><span> as a celebration, or pop culture memes all around the internet.</span></p>
<p><span>Nowadays anime is more popular than ever: </span><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/sony-crunchyroll-specialty-streamer-asian-content-1235352518/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Crunchyroll</span></a><span> estimated that viewership doubled between 2020-2022 alone to over 300M fans worldwide. </span><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/japan-content-boom-1235753598/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Netflix</span></a><span> reported in 2022 that over half of its subscribers worldwide watched some anime content on its platform. The top 4 </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1327143/discord-top-gaming-servers-worldwide-by-number-of-members/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Discord servers</span></a><span> worldwide are all anime-related. Anime is also a medium that caters to many different audience types, from mature </span><i><span>seinen </span></i><span>anime like </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0434706/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Monster</span></a><span> to classic action </span><i><span>shounen </span></i><span>like </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9335498/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_demon%2520slayer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Demon Slayer</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0409591/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_naruto" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Naruto</span></a><span>, from female-oriented </span><i><span>shoujo </span></i><span>like </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816397/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_ouran%2520" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Ouran High School Club</span></a><span> to contemplative slice of life stories like </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0807832/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_6_nm_2_q_mushi" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Mushi-shi</span></a><span>. Because of this broad appeal, there’s a huge community of diverse fans that have engaged with the medium over many years and developed strong affinity toward IP and characters. This affinity has led to one of the most popular use cases of AI recently –&nbsp; AI waifus and husbandos.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>The Rise of AI Waifus / Husbandos</span></h2>
<p><span>First, to explain popular slang – what is a </span><a href="https://www.cbr.com/anime-waifu-popularity-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>waifu</span></a><span> or husbando? Waifus / husbandos are fictionalized girls and guys who viewers feel some level of emotional or romantic attachment to. This isn’t as rare of an occurrence as one might think; </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/c/2024/1/22/24034466/anime-viewer-survey-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Polygon</span></a><span> reported that 44% of surveyed anime viewers reported developing a crush on an anime character. “The other 56% are lying,” the report jokes. After all, anime fans tend to express their fandom deeply through merch, fanart, conventions, cosplay, and other means (66% make some form of fan art according to </span><a href="https://view-su2.highspot.com/viewer/64d51fda505755b87e89cb58#_ga=2.94274269.1720429966.1709007503-1299405015.1706207646" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>fandom</span></a><span>). So it’s not surprising that they would also develop a deep attachment to the characters. Anime Expo in LA for instance, routinely attracts hundreds of thousands of fans each year, the a16z team included.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Waifu / husbando culture derives from visual novels, and AI companions are the logical extension of these animated storybook games. Originally, </span><a href="https://medium.com/mammon-machine-zeal/a-brief-history-of-visual-novels-641a2e6b1acb" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>visual novels</span></a><span> were serialized books with anime-styled pictures in between. But now the term colloquially refers to the digital version in which the player has agency, with branching storylines where you roleplay as the main character, advancing through the plot and choosing to romance other male/female characters. This is a relatively niche market (</span><a href="https://reports.valuates.com/market-reports/QYRE-Auto-26F13788/global-visual-novel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>~$150M</span></a><span> according to some sources), but one that has an outsized impact on the industry. For example, Fate/Grand Order, one of the most successful gacha games with $5B+ cumulative revenue, is descended from a visual novel called Fate/Stay Night.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The structure of the visual novel with branching dialogue trees is a precursor to modern AI companions today. While there are many practical use cases for AI-simulated human interactions – AI as therapist, as teacher, as assistant, etc. – one of the most popular realizations are as friends and romantic companions (more on the broader companion space from my colleagues </span><a href="https://a16z.com/its-not-a-computer-its-a-companion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>here</span></a><span>). For instance, </span><a href="https://beta.character.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>character.ai</span></a><span>’s top characters are all from Genshin Impact; Raiden, Yae Miko, and Hu Tao take some of the top spots at 390M, 202M, and 113M messages respectively as of the time of this blog, compared to Elon Musk at a mere 40M messages. Other top characters are Gojo Satoru (638M) from popular shounen </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12343534/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Jujutsu Kaisen</span></a><span> and Levi Ackerman (250M) from </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2560140/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Attack on Titan</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>Many of the top companion sites like </span><a href="http://janitorai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>janitorai</span></a><span>, </span><a href="http://chub.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>chub.ai</span></a><span>, or </span><a href="http://spicychat.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>spicychat.ai</span></a><span> also feature anime companions – ranging from roleplay with school bullies to overprotective sisters to… furries? – as some of their top personalities. There are also vertically specific companion apps for anime: </span><a href="http://crushon.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>crushon.ai</span></a><span> is an 18+ example, </span><a href="https://www.talkie-ai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>talkieai</span></a><span> is relatively safe-for-work, while </span><a href="https://hyper.online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Hyper</span></a><span> includes VTuber-esque live facial elements. There’s </span><a href="https://www.moemate.io/?page=1&amp;tags=featured" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>moemate</span></a><span> which allows you to bring the companions cross-browser and play games like chess and checkers, and </span><a href="https://kajiwoto.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>kajiwoto</span></a><span> that allows you to more deeply customize your prompts and datasets and share them on server.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>AI is deepening the previously parasocial relationships we had with our favorite anime characters from passive linear media, into powerful new, interactive relationships</b><span>. The reason why anime is so resonant as a genre for AI companions is because character affinity / romance is already built into many of the best anime stories. The majority of top anime games and visual novels are role playing games that feature a romance mechanic, and so it’s natural for fans to want to deepen their connection to their favorite IP and characters through active interactions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As AI advances, the interactions will become non-scripted and more multi-modal: we’ll interact with our companions through voice and text, their animations and reactions will be generated in real time, we’ll be able to play games with them, and they’ll have longer context windows to remember our shared history together. We’re already seeing startups pushing the boundaries for how we interact with content. </span><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=chat.sekai.app&amp;hl=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Sekai</span></a><span> is using AI to create short, bite-sized videos of you and anime characters in fanfiction-esque scenarios. Meanwhile, there are several stealth studios that are building </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otome_game" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>otome games</span></a><span> in the vein of </span><a href="https://loveanddeepspace.infoldgames.com/en-EN/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Love and Deep Space</span></a><span> ($200m+ annualized revenue, SensorTower), but where the side quests, dates, and interaction texts in the game are AI-generated.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>UGC Democratizes Creation for Anime Fans</span></h2>
<p><b>Anime is the new playground for content creation.</b><span> Fans often engage with anime IP by creating their own versions of art, novels, and games, and innovation is happening across the stack. There’s </span><a href="https://nijijourney.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Nijijourney</span></a><span> for art, </span><a href="https://novelai.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>NovelAI</span></a><span> for fanfiction, </span><a href="https://www.fanbox.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>pixivFANBOX</span></a><span> for creator support, and UGC-platforms for games. For instance, several of the top Roblox games are based on IP like One Piece or One Punch Man, and for a platform with over 60M DAU and 300M MAU, this is a very broad player base of anime fans. In particular, Roblox is a good proxy for what’s trending with the younger generation given its </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1190869/roblox-games-users-global-distribution-age/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>demographic</span></a><span> skews towards kids and teens. Similar to how AI companions give fans a new way to interact with IP, UGC allows them to reimagine and remix their favorite IP in wholly new contexts.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>There are a few notable reasons for the popularity of these games. The first is that there’s clear player demand against a shortage of high quality anime IP games; one example is Palworld’s recent success as the “Pokemon with guns” game, selling </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-sells-15-million-on-steam-in-a-month" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>over 25M copies</span></a><span> in a month across Steam and Xbox Game Pass. The second reason is that the anime IP licensing landscape is notoriously difficult to navigate for developers, creating a potential undersupply of games. Besides the language and cultural barrier, IP may be owned by different parties for different regions and different formats (movie, game, manga, etc.). Large aggregators like Crunchyroll and Funimation may already own exclusive licenses for certain IPs altogether. Some startups like </span><a href="https://en.kasagilabo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Kasagi Labo</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.layerlicensing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Layer</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.story.foundation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Story Protocol</span></a><span> are tackling this issue to make IP more democratized and easier to access.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>We believe that as new AI tools emerge and existing UGC platforms embrace AI, we’ll see the barriers to creation drop and the release of even more fan-created transmedia content. </b><span>Roblox has already incorporated </span><a href="https://aibusiness.com/nlp/roblox-gives-users-ai-tools-to-generate-3d-models-from-text-for-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>AI into user workflows</span></a><span>, and Google’s DeepMind team recently announced </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2402.15391v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Genie</span></a><span> which can convert prompts into 2D playable environments. The Tencent team also recently unveiled </span><a href="https://gamegen-o.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>GameGen-O</span></a><span> which pushes the boundaries for generated open world games like Genshin Impact.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Beyond UGC platforms, AI models and tools are enabling first-time creators to make compelling anime content that previously would only have been possible with a team of professionals. For art, </span><a href="https://nijijourney.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Nijijourney</span></a><span> is an image diffusion model focused on generating high-quality anime images from text, a collaboration between </span><a href="https://spellbrush.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Spellbrush</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.midjourney.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Midjourney</span></a><span>. There are also various fine-tuned Stable Diffusion models (a few </span><a href="https://civitai.com/tag/anime" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>here</span></a><span> hosted on citiv.ai) that capture different styles and poses, some trained on SD 1.5, others like </span><a href="https://civitai.com/models/260267" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Animagine XL V3</span></a><span> on SDXL 1.0. </span><a href="https://yodayo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Yodayo</span></a><span> integrates AI generated anime art and character chatbots together, and </span><a href="https://pixai.art/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>pixai.art</span></a><span> contains models that mimic popular IP (Genshin, Pokemon, Blue Archive, etc.).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For animations and video there are several options available for the aspiring creator. </span><a href="https://runwayml.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>RunwayML</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://lumalabs.ai/dream-machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Luma Labs</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.hedra.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Hedra</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://pika.art/login" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>PikaLabs</span></a><span> have built foundation models for text-to-video generation. One can use </span><a href="https://domoai.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>domoAI</span></a><span> for anime-specific polish, and </span><a href="https://magnific.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>MagnificAI</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.topazlabs.com/topaz-photo-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Topaz Labs</span></a><span> to enhance images and image-to-video prompts. </span><a href="https://elevenlabs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>ElevenLabs</span></a><span> is used for voiceovers and dubs, and </span><a href="https://www.udio.com/"><span>Udio</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://suno.com/"><span>Suno</span></a><span> are used for music. For manga/comics, there are companies like </span><a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/shortbread" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Shortbread</span></a><span> that are helping to create webcomics and manga more seamlessly, with context and consistency between scenes and shots. There’s still a way to go to improve model accuracy, speed, and cost, but it’s clear that as these tools evolve they will empower more creators that might previously have lacked technical or artistic skills to bring their anime ideas to life.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Anime Game Studios Lead the Way&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>On the other side of the spectrum, professional game studios are leading the charge for high production-value consumer experiences that build on or create new IP. </span><b>Anime games are some of the highest grossing in the games industry, </b><a href="https://www.data.ai/en/insights/mobile-gaming/state-of-anime-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>accounting for 20%</b></a><b> of spend on the mobile app store despite only having usage penetration of &lt;3%</b><span>. For example, Monster Strike has out-earned Candy Crush ($7.6B cumulative revenue vs. $6.9B) on a much smaller player base of 10M MAU vs. Candy Crush’s 70M+ MAU (SensorTower, 2016-19). Meanwhile, miHoYo’s Genshin Impact is on track to be one of the highest earning games of all time at its current trajectory (see below), with nearly $4B earned since launching just over three years ago.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Total-Lifetime-Net-Revenue-of-Top-Grossing-Anime-Mobile-Games-1.png" alt="" width="2000" height="1354" srcset="https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Total-Lifetime-Net-Revenue-of-Top-Grossing-Anime-Mobile-Games-1.png 2000w, https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Total-Lifetime-Net-Revenue-of-Top-Grossing-Anime-Mobile-Games-1-300x203.png 300w, https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Total-Lifetime-Net-Revenue-of-Top-Grossing-Anime-Mobile-Games-1-1024x693.png 1024w, https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Total-Lifetime-Net-Revenue-of-Top-Grossing-Anime-Mobile-Games-1-768x520.png 768w, https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Total-Lifetime-Net-Revenue-of-Top-Grossing-Anime-Mobile-Games-1-1536x1040.png 1536w, https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Total-Lifetime-Net-Revenue-of-Top-Grossing-Anime-Mobile-Games-1-400x271.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"></p>
<p><span>There are two ways that anime game studios broaden the horizon for players. First, they usually create the highest quality games of the most popular IPs like Dragon Ball, Pokemon, or Dragon Quest. Six of the top 10 highest grossing anime games are based on existing IP, allowing fans to interact directly with the characters themselves. Second, they often innovate on core game loops or technology: miHoYo’s Genshin Impact was one of the first true cross-platform anime games, GungHo’s Puzzles &amp; Dragons mixed match-3 and RPG mechanics for the first time, and Riot’s Valorant was one of the most accessible entries into tactical first person shooters. There are also&nbsp; several stealth startups experimenting with weaving LLMs into visual novel gameplay.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So, what makes these games so compelling and why do they make so much money? We theorize that there are a few key components that contribute to their success:&nbsp;</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Proven, better, new. </b><span>A lot of the games that have become breakout hits like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Go" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Pokemon Go</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genshin_Impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Genshin Impact</span></a><span>, or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_%26_Dragons" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Puzzle &amp; Dragons</span></a><span> combine familiar systems with some form of unique gameplay innovation. For Pokemon it was the unique location-based game system combined with being the first Pokemon game on the mobile platform and for Genshin it was combining the open world gameplay of Zelda with the RPG elements of a traditional gacha and true cross-platform play. However, for many games, the bulk of many systems will be borrowed from the existing status quo and best-in-class from other games: banner-based live ops and events, gacha monetization, power creep and player progression, character personality archetypes like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundere" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>tsunderes</span></a><span>, etc.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>RPG at its core. </b><span>Almost all the highest grossing games this year were role-playing games (RPGs). In this genre, players have one, or multiple characters that they “role-play” as by leveling them up, fighting monsters, equipping items, changing builds, etc. This isn’t surprising given that RPGs make up the highest spend for all mobile games (31%) despite having some of the lowest downloads by genre (3%). They are simply very deep games that the most hardcore gamers tend to gravitate towards, and can monetize well through pay for power or gacha.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Strong / compelling IP. </b><span>It’s not an accident that six of the top ten anime games license popular IP for their titles. In anime games, because character collection is a primary driver of gameplay and monetization, IP is very important to drive that core motivation. Story matters.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Gacha monetization. </b><span>Gacha games have some of the highest average revenue per user (ARPU) in the industry and is a reason why Japan has some of the highest </span><a href="https://asoindex.io/mobile-growth/why-arpu-in-japan-surpasses-other-countries" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>ARPU by country</span></a><span>. Gacha traces its history back to </span><a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2017/08/19/lifestyle/gachapon-tracing-evolution-japans-colorful-toy-capsules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>gachapon</span></a><span>, Japanese toy machines that dispense a random toy each time you put in a coin. The modern equivalent would be trading card packs such as in FIFA Ultimate Team. There is some controversy over this monetization practice, but more recent games have raised S-tier earn rates, added pity drops, and increased the drip of premium currency to balance out monetization and fun.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>For now, we’ve been covering mostly free-to-play (F2P) mobile games. However, there are several successful PC/console anime games as well: </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/698780/Doki_Doki_Literature_Club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Doki Doki Literature Club</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1687950/Persona_5_Royal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>the Persona series</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34459938" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>the Final Fantasy series</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Emblem" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>the Fire Emblem series</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/787480/Phoenix_Wright_Ace_Attorney_Trilogy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Phoenix Wright</span></a><span>, just to name a few. Many of these game franchises have been sold quite successfully through a premium business model. For instance, the Final Fantasy VII remake was one of the most anticipated in the series, and </span><a href="https://twitter.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1252583111390408706" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>sold over 3.5M copies in the first 3 days</span></a><span>. After three years, it’s now sold over </span><a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1702446167185883194?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>7 million copies total</span></a><span>.</span></p>

			
	
<p><span>There are several startups that have taken up the mantle in the West to build anime games for a global audience, and we’re excited to see what kinds of new experiences they create for players. </span><a href="https://www.odysseyinteractive.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Odyssey Interactive</span></a><span> is building competitive multiplayer PvP games like </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjOXlvs87Lo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Omega Strikers</span></a><span>. </span><a href="https://www.pahdolabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Pahdo Labs</span></a><span> is building a UGC platform starting with the anime game Starlight Re:Volver. </span><a href="https://believer.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Believer</span></a><span> is building an open world drawing on inspiration from Genshin Impact. </span><a href="https://www.studiosai.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Studio Sai</span></a><span> has made a hybrid dating action game, while </span><a href="https://starmi.com/our-vision#" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Starmi</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.gaudiumstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Gaudium</span></a><span> are both creating collectible hero gacha action games. These are just a few of the studios that are focused on realizing anime worlds for players. We believe that these studios will continue to push the boundaries of gameplay and technology, and we’re excited to see these new experiences come to fruition.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>VTubing Blurs Human-Digital Interactions</span></h2>
<p><span>We’ve seen how AI companions, UGC, and games allow players different ways of interacting with popular anime IP. VTubing takes it to the next level where fans can </span><i><span>become </span></i><span>popular anime characters themselves. VTuber stands for “Virtual YouTuber” and refers to a content creator who overlays an anime facial / body rig that tracks their real time motion and projects a digital avatar onto the stream (e.g. </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4YaOt1yT-ZeyB0OmxHgolA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Kizuna AI</span></a><span>). This phenomenon likely spawned from virtual idols such as </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Hatsune Miku</span></a><span> that exist as fully digital characters, similar to virtual influencers like </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/lilmiquela/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Lil Miquela</span></a><span> in the west. There are various things that VTubers will do on stream, usually a mix of singing, chatting, dancing, and gaming. It allows for the creator to adopt a different personality, and makes it easier to create content regardless of appearance or age.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Growth-of-VTubing-Hours-Watched-Over-Time.png" alt="" width="2000" height="1291" srcset="https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Growth-of-VTubing-Hours-Watched-Over-Time.png 2000w, https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Growth-of-VTubing-Hours-Watched-Over-Time-300x194.png 300w, https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Growth-of-VTubing-Hours-Watched-Over-Time-1024x661.png 1024w, https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Growth-of-VTubing-Hours-Watched-Over-Time-768x496.png 768w, https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Growth-of-VTubing-Hours-Watched-Over-Time-1536x991.png 1536w, https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Growth-of-VTubing-Hours-Watched-Over-Time-400x258.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"></p>
<p><span>Today, VTubing is a relatively small but fast-growing community that has potential to ride the anime wave into a much larger segment of content viewership and creation. While VTubers only represent </span><a href="https://blog.gamesight.io/vtuber/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>0.4% of all streamers on Twitch</span></a><span>, they represent 5.7% of total viewership. And in the first half of 2023, VTubing viewership rose by 28% despite overall Twitch views staying flat. Some of the top VTubers like </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChgPVLjqugDQpRLWvC7zzig" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Ironmouse</span></a><span> have millions of viewers, and are professionally run by organizations like </span><a href="https://www.vshojo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>VShojo </span></a><span>or </span><a href="https://hololivepro.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Hololive</span></a><span>. </span><b>One day, VTubing could become just as ubiquitous as Memojis on Apple FaceTime or Snapchat filters.</b></p>
<p><span>Startups are tackling this market from a few different angles. </span><a href="https://ironvertex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Iron Vertex</span></a><span> is the go to for professional rigs done by designers experienced in Live2D, but if you need a cheaper option, startups like </span><a href="https://hyper.online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Hyperonline</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.gohibe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>GoHibe</span></a><span> are making it easier than ever to design your own avatar. </span><a href="http://mtion.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Mtion.tv</span></a><span> meanwhile helps users design the background and environment for their avatar with visual based programming. There’s also VTubers like </span><a href="https://virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki/Neuro-sama" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Neuro-sama</span></a><span>, which is an AI that represents a human VTubing streamer, and platforms that are native to the VTuber experience like </span><a href="https://anilive.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Anilive</span></a><span>. If anime companions represent the human-digital relationship and multiplayer games the human-to-human relationship, then VTubing sits in the middle as a unique parasocial relationship mixing digital and human interactions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span>Today, anime is more than an art style, it’s a content format and cultural aesthetic that has transcended gender, race, age, and geography to become one of the largest and most profitable creative industries. Anime is also leading the way for digital play, turning previously passive consumption of linear media into a new dynamic form of entertainment. We’re excited about how anime is shaping the future of interactivity through its embrace of new technologies and business models: from AI agents to UGC platforms, from artistry tools to novel game mechanics, from interactive VTubing to new anime platforms. It’s clear that the best is yet to come for current and future anime fans.&nbsp;</span></p>

And he did it, remarkably, using little more than oil, water, and a pen. His inspiration was none other than Benjamin Franklin.</p><p>Sometime around 1770, while visiting London, Franklin became intrigued by a phenomenon he had observed during his transatlantic voyage. Specifically, he noticed that when ships discarded greasy slops into the ocean, the surrounding waves would calm. This ancient practice of oiling the seas to pacify turbulent waters was known to the Babylonians and Romans, but Franklin decided to investigate further.</p><p><span>On a windy day in London, he walked to a pond on Clapham Common. Carrying a small quantity of oil — "not more than a Tea Spoonful," according to his diary — Franklin poured it onto the agitated water. The oil spread rapidly across the surface, covering "perhaps half an Acre" of the pond and rendering its waters "as smooth as a Looking Glass." Franklin documented his observations in detail; they can be read today on the </span><a href="https://claphamsociety.com/articles/29two-american/" rel="">Clapham Society's</a><span> website.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce72e1d4-91cf-4c50-990c-a6854b54b669_800x600.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce72e1d4-91cf-4c50-990c-a6854b54b669_800x600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce72e1d4-91cf-4c50-990c-a6854b54b669_800x600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce72e1d4-91cf-4c50-990c-a6854b54b669_800x600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce72e1d4-91cf-4c50-990c-a6854b54b669_800x600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce72e1d4-91cf-4c50-990c-a6854b54b669_800x600.jpeg" width="800" height="600" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ce72e1d4-91cf-4c50-990c-a6854b54b669_800x600.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:600,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:59086,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce72e1d4-91cf-4c50-990c-a6854b54b669_800x600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce72e1d4-91cf-4c50-990c-a6854b54b669_800x600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce72e1d4-91cf-4c50-990c-a6854b54b669_800x600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce72e1d4-91cf-4c50-990c-a6854b54b669_800x600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Clapham Common in London.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Franklin's oil drop experiment, of course, was just one in a long line of “amateur” science experiments. He was also the first to demonstrate that lightning is electrical in nature (via his famous kite experiments), and he charted the Gulf Stream’s course across the Atlantic ocean, noting that ships traveling from America to England took longer than those going the opposite direction. His experiments at Clapham Common are not nearly as well-known.</p><p><span>But Franklin was a careful experimenter, repeating his oil drop multiple times and taking notes each time. In his journal, he opined on how much oil might be needed to calm various areas of ocean (he was thinking specifically about applications for the Royal Navy) but never grasped the </span><em>molecular implications</em><span> of his experiments. It wasn't until more than a century later that Lord Rayleigh, whose real name was John William Strutt, revisited Franklin's experiment with a brilliant new perspective.</span></p><p>An academic at the University of Cambridge and a baron by title, Rayleigh was renowned for his work in physics. The Rayleigh number, a common parameter used to describe the flow of water, is named for him; as is Rayleigh scattering, which explains how photons diffuse through the atmosphere and color the sky blue. Rayleigh also discovered the noble gas, Argon, earning a Nobel Prize for it in 1904.&nbsp;</p><p>But a little experiment that Rayleigh performed in 1890, inspired directly by Franklin's observations, is not nearly as well-known.</p><p><span>Rayleigh carefully measured a tiny volume of olive oil — 0.81 milligrams, to be exact — and placed it onto a known area of water. The oil quickly spread out and covered an area, which Rayleigh precisely measured. And then he did something that Franklin never thought of: </span><strong>Rayleigh</strong><span> </span><strong>divided the volume of the oil by the area it covered, thus estimating the thickness of the oil film.</strong><span> Assuming that the oil formed a single layer of molecules — a monolayer — then the thickness of the oil film is the same thing as the </span><em>length </em><span>of one oil molecule.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This is how Lord Rayleigh became the first person to figure out a single molecule’s dimensions, many years before anyone could </span><em>see </em><span>such molecules.</span></p><p>Here is his equation:</p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\(Thickness = {\dfrac{Volume}{Area}} = {\dfrac{0.00081 cm^3}{\dfrac{1}{4}\pi \times (84 cm)^2}} \approx 1.63 \times 10^{-7}\)</span></p></div><p><span>Rayleigh’s final result was </span><strong>1.63 nanometers</strong><span>. Olive oil is mainly composed of fat molecules called </span><em>triacylglycerols</em><span>, and we now know that they measure about 1.67 nanometers in length, implying that Rayleigh’s “primitive” estimates were off by just 2 percent. His original paper detailing the experiment can be found </span><a href="https://damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gold/pdfs/teaching/old_literature/Rayleigh1890.pdf" rel="">here</a><span>.</span></p><p>I love this story because it shows, at least anecdotally, how deep scientific insights can emerge from the simplest of experiments. It's a testament to the idea that you don't always need sophisticated equipment to unlock the secrets of nature — sometimes, all it takes is a drop of oil and a bit of ingenuity.</p><p><span>For those interested in delving deeper into the history of these oil drop experiments, Charles Tanford's book, </span><em><a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/ben-franklin-stilled-the-waves-9780192804945?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;" rel="">Ben Franklin Stilled the Waves</a></em><span>, offers an extensive exploration.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81be1d2b-1449-4b9a-b636-462ce4890599_820x494.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81be1d2b-1449-4b9a-b636-462ce4890599_820x494.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81be1d2b-1449-4b9a-b636-462ce4890599_820x494.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81be1d2b-1449-4b9a-b636-462ce4890599_820x494.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81be1d2b-1449-4b9a-b636-462ce4890599_820x494.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81be1d2b-1449-4b9a-b636-462ce4890599_820x494.png" width="820" height="494" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/81be1d2b-1449-4b9a-b636-462ce4890599_820x494.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:494,&quot;width&quot;:820,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:626652,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81be1d2b-1449-4b9a-b636-462ce4890599_820x494.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81be1d2b-1449-4b9a-b636-462ce4890599_820x494.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81be1d2b-1449-4b9a-b636-462ce4890599_820x494.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81be1d2b-1449-4b9a-b636-462ce4890599_820x494.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>An excerpt from Lord Rayleigh’s published manuscript.</figcaption></figure></div></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

People have become dramatically more capable over time; we can already accomplish things now that our predecessors would have believed to be impossible.</p><p>We are more capable not because of genetic change, but because we benefit from the infrastructure of society being way smarter and more capable than any one of us; in an important sense, society itself is a form of advanced intelligence. Our grandparents – and the generations that came before them – built and achieved great things. They contributed to the scaffolding of human progress that we all benefit from. AI will give people tools to solve hard problems and help us add new struts to that scaffolding that we couldn’t have figured out on our own. The story of progress will continue, and our children will be able to do things we can’t.</p><p>It won’t happen all at once, but we’ll soon be able to work with AI that helps us accomplish much more than we ever could without AI; eventually we can each have a personal AI team, full of virtual experts in different areas, working together to create almost anything we can imagine. Our children will have virtual tutors who can provide personalized instruction in any subject, in any language, and at whatever pace they need. We can imagine similar ideas for better healthcare, the ability to create any kind of software someone can imagine, and much more.</p><p>With these new abilities, we can have shared prosperity to a degree that seems unimaginable today; in the future, everyone’s lives can be better than anyone’s life is now. Prosperity alone doesn’t necessarily make people happy – there are plenty of miserable rich people – but it would meaningfully improve the lives of people around the world.</p><p>Here is one narrow way to look at human history: after thousands of years of compounding scientific discovery and technological progress, we have figured out how to melt sand, add some impurities, arrange it with astonishing precision at extraordinarily tiny scale into computer chips, run energy through it, and end up with systems capable of creating increasingly capable artificial intelligence.</p><p>This may turn out to be the most consequential fact about all of history so far. It is possible that we will have superintelligence in a few thousand days (!); it may take longer, but I’m confident we’ll get there.</p><p>How did we get to the doorstep of the next leap in prosperity?</p><p>In three words: deep learning worked.</p><p>In 15 words: deep learning worked, got predictably better with scale, and we dedicated increasing resources to it.</p><p>That’s really it; humanity discovered an algorithm that could really, truly learn any distribution of data (or really, the underlying “rules” that produce any distribution of data). To a shocking degree of precision, the more compute and data available, the better it gets at helping people solve hard problems. I find that no matter how much time I spend thinking about this, I can never really internalize how consequential it is.</p><p>There are a lot of details we still have to figure out, but it’s a mistake to get distracted by any particular challenge. Deep learning works, and we will solve the remaining problems. We can say a lot of things about what may happen next, but the main one is that AI is going to get better with scale, and that will lead to meaningful improvements to the lives of people around the world.</p><p>AI models will soon serve as autonomous personal assistants who carry out specific tasks on our behalf like coordinating medical care on your behalf. At some point further down the road, AI systems are going to get so good that they help us make better next-generation systems and make scientific progress across the board.</p><p>Technology brought us from the Stone Age to the Agricultural Age and then to the Industrial Age. From here, the path to the Intelligence Age is paved with compute, energy, and human will.</p><p>If we want to put AI into the hands of as many people as possible, we need to drive down the cost of compute and make it abundant (which requires lots of energy and chips). If we don’t build enough infrastructure, AI will be a very limited resource that wars get fought over and that becomes mostly a tool for rich people.</p><p>We need to act wisely but with conviction. The dawn of the Intelligence Age is a momentous development with very complex and extremely high-stakes challenges. It will not be an entirely positive story, but the upside is so tremendous that we owe it to ourselves, and the future, to figure out how to navigate the risks in front of us.</p><p>I believe the future is going to be so bright that no one can do it justice by trying to write about it now; a defining characteristic of the Intelligence Age will be massive prosperity.</p><p>Although it will happen incrementally, astounding triumphs – fixing the climate, establishing a space colony, and the discovery of all of physics – will eventually become commonplace. With nearly-limitless intelligence and abundant energy – the ability to generate great ideas, and the ability to make them happen – we can do quite a lot.</p><p>As we have seen with other technologies, there will also be downsides, and we need to start working now to maximize AI’s benefits while minimizing its harms. As one example, we expect that this technology can cause a significant change in labor markets (good and bad) in the coming years, but most jobs will change more slowly than most people think, and I have no fear that we’ll run out of things to do (even if they don’t look like “real jobs” to us today). People have an innate desire to create and to be useful to each other, and AI will allow us to amplify our own abilities like never before. As a society, we will be back in an expanding world, and we can again focus on playing positive-sum games.</p><p>Many of the jobs we do today would have looked like trifling wastes of time to people a few hundred years ago, but nobody is looking back at the past, wishing they were a lamplighter. If a lamplighter could see the world today, he would think the prosperity all around him was unimaginable. And if we could fast-forward a hundred years from today, the prosperity all around us would feel just as unimaginable.</p></div></section></div>]]></description>

				<div id="exhibition"><h2><em>What, Me Worry?</em> The Art and Humor of <em>MAD</em> Magazine</h2></div><div><div><p><strong>June 8, 2024 through October 27, 2024</strong></p>
<p>This exhibition explores the unforgettable art and satire of MAD, from its beginnings in 1952 as a popular humor comic book to its emergence as a beloved magazine that spoke truth to power and attracted generations of devoted readers through the decades. MAD’s influence and cultural impact will be explored in this landmark installation, which features iconic original illustrations and cartoons created by the magazine’s <em>Usual Gang of Idiots</em>—the many artists and writers who have been the publication’s mainstays for decades. These include Sergio Aragonés, David Berg, John Caldwell, Bob Clarke, Paul Coker, Jack Davis, Mort Drucker, Will Elder, Duck Edwing, Frank Frazetta, Kelly Freas, Al Jaffee, Bob Jones, Harvey Kurtzman, Don Martin, Norman Mingo, Harry North, Paul Peter Porges, Antonio Prohías, Jack Rickard, Irving Schild, Charles Schulz, John Severin, Marie Severin, Angelo Torres, Basil Wolverton, Wally Wood, and George Woodbridge. The art of next generation visual humorists will also be on view, including Emily Flake, Mark Fredrickson, Drew Friedman, Rick Geary, Keith Knight, Peter Kuper, Liz Lomax, Dave Manak, Hermann Mejia, Rick Meyerowitz, Teresa Burns Parkhurst, C.F. Payne, Roberto Parada, Tom Richmond, Johnny Sampson, Dale Stephanos, Mark Stutzman, Rick Tulka, P.C. Vey, Sam Viviano, James Warhola, and Richard Williams.</p>

</div></div><div><div><p>It is difficult to imagine a time when satirical, irreverent humor was not common across media, but in the 1950s, anti-establishment humor was not the cultural norm. An iconic illustrated humor magazine that has been surreptitiously enjoyed by millions for more than seventy years, MAD was the first to ironically and humorously poke holes in all aspects of American life—from movies, television, music, art, and advertising to superheroes, celebrity culture, and the political scene of the day. Special features like Spy vs. <em>Spy, MAD Fold-Ins, MAD’s Maddest Artists</em>, and <em>MAD’s Marginals</em>, which have been longtime favorites, continue to delight.</p>
<p>First published in 1952, MAD originally launched as an EC comic book series founded by editor Harvey Kurtzman and publisher William Gaines, with its inaugural issue titled <em>Tales Calculated to Drive You Mad</em>. In 1955, with MAD No. 24, the comic was reimagined as an illustrated magazine, releasing it from the censure of the Comics Code Authority. The publication’s now legendary parodies of <em>Superduperman</em> and <em>Starchie</em>, takeoffs on the classic DC superhero and Archie comics, respectively, launched MAD into the stratosphere. Between 1952 and 2018, five-hundred-fifty magazine issues were published, along with a multitude of special issues, paperbacks, and compilation projects.</p>
<p>More than 150 original works of art will be on view, including a special highlight gallery devoted to the art of Mort Drucker, the award-winning caricaturist and illustrator who contributed to MAD for more than five decades. Paintings, drawings, cartoons, ephemera, artifacts, and media will tell MAD’s indelible story and explore the impact of this venerable publication on American humor, media, culture, and society. &nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>The Usual Gang of Idiots and Other Suspects: MAD Magazine and American Humor</p></h2></div><div><p><strong>Zoom Webinar (online)<br>
</strong>Friday, October 18 from 6pm to 8pm<br>
Saturday, October 19 from 10am to 3:30pm</p>
<p>Join us for this lively exploration of the art and history of MAD—the long-running humor magazine and counter-culture touchstone that has attracted readers and spoken truth to power for more than seven decades. MAD’s unique brand of subversive humor, as well as its evolution and impact, will be discussed by illustrators, cartoonists, editors, writers, historians, and collectors whose deep knowledge of the subject and personal contributions have sustained the magazine’s legacy over time.</p>
<p>The program is organized in conjunction with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nrm.org/madmagazine" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>What, Me Worry? The Art and Humor of MAD Magazine</strong></a>&nbsp;at the Norman Rockwell Museum, on view until October 27, 2024.</p>

<p><strong>August 11, 2024 – RadioRadioX &nbsp;–</strong> The exhibit effectively captures the essence of MAD Magazine, as a mirror reflecting the absurdities of contemporary life, while also serving as a time capsule of humor from the 1950’s to the present day. … In hindsight, regarding my initial thoughts on the mash-up on Norman Rockwell and MAD Magazine, I was incredibly mistaken. The two meld together perfectly! <a href="https://radioradiox.com/2024/08/11/review-what-me-worry-the-art-and-humor-of-mad-magazine-exhibit-at-the-norman-rockwell-museum/"><strong>READ MORE…</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>July 13, 2024</strong><strong> – National Review –</strong> “What, Me Worry?” is the line that launched 550 issues of<em> MAD</em>, the current-events satire magazine. It’s the mantra of <em>MAD</em>, the fictional Alfred E. Neuman’s claim to literary fame, and the title of a show that offers a captivating look at <em>MAD</em>’s art, humor, and history. The show is at the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Mass. The Rockwell Museum is a temple to the artist whose illustrations defined an age, but it covers all manner of illustration art. It’s a place that does everything right. &nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2024/07/what-me-worry-and-mad-at-the-norman-rockwell-museum/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">READ MORE…</a></strong></p>

</a></h4>
<p><strong>July 9, 2024</strong><strong> – Art New England Magazine –</strong> In a fraught election season, this retrospective on the art of pioneering counter-cultural MAD magazine illustrates how laughter can be a tool for social and political change. Co-curated by the Rockwell’s chief curator Stephanie Haboush Plunkett and illustrator/art journalist Steve Brodner, it showcases over 250 images by more than thirty artists in a dense, yet comic, multilayered exhibition that says as much about artistic collaboration as it does about lampooning American culture.&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong><a href="https://artnewengland.com/what-me-worry-the-art-and-humor-of-mad-magazine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">READ MORE…</a></strong></p>

</a></h4>
<p><strong>June 17, 2024 – Jewish Federation of the Berkshires – </strong>As a consumer of creative work, my tastes run decidedly toward the “trying to figure it all out” parts of a creator’s output than the “telling it like it is,&nbsp;<em>man</em>” parts of their oeuvre. The figuring-things-out works are often raw products of youthful exuberance. As artists mature, too many can’t resist the urge to foist the&nbsp;<em>very important truths</em>&nbsp;they’ve come to understand upon their audiences. Though I understand that impulse, I much prefer (for example) listening to the figuring-it-all-out Beatles tunes like “I Should Have Known Better” to the telling-it-like-it-is-<em>man</em>&nbsp;Beatles anthems like “All You Need is Love.” As I approach my golden years, I will take lightness, yearning, and cheek over weighty messages eight days a week.&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.jewishberkshires.org/community-events/berkshire-jewish-voice/berkshire-jewish-voice-highlights/an-appreciation-of-mad-and-it-usually-jewish-gang-of-idiots" target="_blank" rel="noopener">READ MORE…</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>June 11, 2024 – The Daily Heller – </strong>When Harvey Kurtzman, the godfather of alternative comics, walked into a nondescript classroom in SVA’s main building back in the early fall of 1970, the din of student chattering instantly stopped. We all sat anxiously waiting for him to start critiquing, one-by-one, the previous week’s assignment.

<p dir="auto">Designing floor plans is difficult because various constraints must be satisfied by the layouts of the internal walls. This paper presents a novel shape representation and optimization method for designing floor plans based on the Voronoi diagrams. Our Voronoi diagram implicitly specifies the shape of the room using the distance from the Voronoi sites, thus facilitating the topological changes in the wall layout by moving these sites. Since the differentiation of the explicit wall representation is readily available, our method can incorporate various constraints, such as room areas and room connectivity, into the optimization. We demonstrate that our method can generate various floor plans while allowing users to interactively change the constraints.</p>

<ul>

<p> UX/SCRAPER: use imdb-graphql-urls.json (also try to fetch them from master in github, this way we can update the urls if imdb changes them - without creating a new release)</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p> UX/SCRAPER: propagate actual errors of imdb scraping to the test result (i.e. errors in graphql querying instead of $IMDB_something is NULL)</p>

  <summary>v1.3.37-a6</summary>
<h3>Features (v1.3.37-a6)</h3>
<h4>Series: Media Property Dialog</h4>
<ul>
<li> FEAT: make series clickable and expand to episodes listing for the selected series, show affected number of episodes vs. total number of episodes</li>
<li> UX: remove the episodes section (in favor of episodes sections for all listed series)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Series: IMDB Rating Dialog</h4>
<ul>
<li> FEAT: IMDB Rating heatmap like <a href="https://whattowatchon.tv/" rel="nofollow">https://whattowatchon.tv</a>
<ul>
<li> make medialist item card a shared component (now used in medialist as well as SeriesIMDBRatingDialog)main list "jumps" and THEN reloads with the filter applied (possibly a fix for another issue)</li>
<li> prevent certain activities while in IMDB Rating Dialog mode</li>
</ul>

<p>Our teardown lab is filled with iPhone 16 parts, and we’ve been having a blast playing with them. Apple’s latest smartphone series has largely underwhelmed tech reviewers, who are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24247538/apple-iphone-16-pro-review">mixed</a> on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24247479/apple-iphone-16-plus-review-camera-control-screen-battery">usefulness</a> of the new dedicated camera button and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/20/the-iphone-16-launches-today-without-its-most-hyped-feature-apple-intelligence/">twiddling their thumbs</a> waiting for Apple Intelligence to drop.</p>



<p>But in our world, it’s a big deal: the iPhone 16 lineup makes three big leaps for repairkind.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Hot-Wiring the iPhone 16: New Battery Removal and Complete Teardown" width="456" height="257" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M6jBXI6CR9s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p><strong>First:</strong> The adhesive that secures the battery, in the vanilla and Plus models, is this fancy new sticky stuff that can debond when you pass an electrical current through it. That means no more reliance on finicky, brittle adhesive strips, just a consistent, easily repeatable process. It will require a new tool, of course—more on that later.</p>



<div><p><strong>Second:</strong> The 16 Pro battery has a hard steel case instead of a soft pouch, a form factor that looks familiar from the Apple Watch. Every time we’ve heard electronics manufacturers suggest that repairs could be dangerous because of lithium-ion batteries, we point out that the power to make battery repairs safer is in their hands: Hard cell batteries instead of soft pouch batteries won’t get accidentally punctured by a slip of a screwdriver, and so they’re way less likely to catch fire. Since the Pro doesn’t feature the new adhesive, getting the battery out may sometimes require prying, and a hard case will make that process safer. The one model with no battery improvements? The flagship 16 Pro Max.</p><p><strong>Third: </strong><a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/64865/iphone-14-teardown">We’ve lauded</a> the “enter through either the front or the back” design that debuted on the base iPhone 14, but it took two generations for Apple to trickle that innovation up to their pro phones. It’s here on all models now—and it looks like it’s here to stay. Having to remove an expensive, fragile, ProMotion OLED during a repair path isn’t ideal, so being able to avoid it for simple repairs streamlines procedures.</p></div>

<p>And that’s not even counting iOS 18’s new “Repair Assistant,” which aspires to end the parts pairing software barriers to repair. When we tested it out with the iPhone 15 series earlier this week, we thought it was <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/100266/the-end-of-parts-pairing-almost">promising, if not quite ready for prime time</a>. But it worked impressively smoothly on our vanilla iPhone 16: one click to pair and calibrate all components at once, and no bugs to be found.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Fancy New Sticky Stuff</h2>



<p>The earliest rumors of new electrically-releasing battery adhesive came back in June, when <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-explores-novel-method-for-making-iphone-batteries-more-replaceable">Wayne Ma at The Information</a> reported that Apple was testing technology to make DIY repair easier.</p>



<p>When adhesive manufacturer Tesa <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-explores-novel-method-for-making-iphone-batteries-more-replaceable">released a video</a> showing their new “Debonding on Demand — Electrical Release” process, we were convinced. We have high confidence that this Tesa technology is adhering the battery.</p>



<figure><video autoplay="" controls="" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/09/21110752/electrial-relase-psa-battery-mounting_11134808_195005897.webm" playsinline=""></video></figure>



<p>As soon as Apple’s official iPhone 16 repair manuals dropped (which was actually <em>on</em> launch day, something we love to see), we hustled over to their battery guide, which sure enough <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120642">described passing 9V</a> through this fancy new adhesive.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="880" height="600" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/09/21110804/image-4.png" alt=""><figcaption>This image is from Apple’s official iPhone 16 battery repair guide.</figcaption></figure>



<p>So, how does this magical adhesive work? <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/admi.202101447">This research paper</a> sheds some light:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In the second scenario, anodic delamination is caused by the oxidation of the surface of the aluminum substrate and migration of Al3+ into the adhesive. This will lead to fast debonding since the substrate layer bonded to the adhesive is no longer supported.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>What does this jargon mean? Imagine an Oreo cookie with a thick layer of double-stuf creme. You figured out that if you dip just the bottom cookie in some milk and twist the cookie apart, the filling will always stick to the top cookie.<br>Similarly, when we zap the adhesive, the current oxidizes the negative/anode mating surface and loosens the adhesive from it. The adhesive “filling” between the battery and the frame will then stick to whichever surface that’s connected to the positive terminal.</p>



<h3>Trial Run of Our Next FixHub Tool</h3>



<p>When the time came to crack open the new phones, we were ready with a prototype of our new iPhone battery repair tool: a USB-C cable on one end, alligator clips on the other. We plugged it into our <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/products/fixhub-power-series-portable-soldering-station">FixHub Power Station</a>, clipped the ground wire to a nearby screw, and attached the red wire to a silver tab next to the battery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our cable was set up to deliver 12V, and since Tesa suggested that their adhesive would release in 60 seconds at 12V, we waited a minute: Sure enough, the battery lifted out with no force, and the case underneath was <em>almost</em> residue-free (though the battery side remained tacky). You’ll probably still want to take a pass with <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/36877/ask-ifixit-everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-isopropyl-alcohol?srsltid=AfmBOoqCIheKnOsGA8xJUAjLe1u1pgQ82Wp0e-VC9pHiWklldk9QRBQb">isopropyl alcohol</a> before you put a new battery in, but you won’t have to scrape out adhesive strip remnants like in iPhones of yore.</p>

</figure>



<p>One of the biggest problems with the current stretch-release adhesive strips—the ones still used in the 16 Pro and Pro Max—is that they get more and more brittle over time. In older phones, repair techs essentially expect that they’re going to have to apply a solvent under the battery to get the adhesive to disengage—not a huge deal, but depending on the solvent and how careful you are with application, it can damage other internal components. Only time will tell how this new adhesive ages; Apple’s own repair manual suggests that the adhesive <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120642">may take longer to disengage</a> over time. They say you can use up to 30V to trigger the electrical release. We tried releasing our battery at several different voltages. At 20V, the battery released in about 5 seconds. At 5V, it took a tad over 6 minutes.</p>

<p>The adhesive sits inside a well in the frame, specially machined to create ridges and rough surfaces for the glue to adhere to. A close up under <a href="https://www.evidentscientific.com/en/">Evident Scientific’s</a> microscope really brings this simple but beautiful structure to life.</p>

<h3>This Phone Needs a New Tool. Is That a Repairability Problem?</h3>



<p>The last time iPhone repair <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/14279/apples-diabolical-plan-to-screw-your-iphone">required a brand new tool</a>—when Apple began sealing phones with their proprietary five-pointed screw, the pentalobe—we <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/14279/apples-diabolical-plan-to-screw-your-iphone">raised a fuss</a>. At the time, nobody outside official Apple repair shops had access to the driver, which effectively blocked repairs until we reverse-engineered it. This is pretty different. Any hardware store around the world will sell you a set of alligator clips and a 9V battery, at a reasonable price.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Everyone fixing one of these phones is going to need a power supply of some kind. Apple’s 9V battery solution is perfectly fine, but USB-C can also output the needed power and is in some cases more convenient (9V batteries have <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-arent-9-volt-batteries-used-much-anymore?top_ans=1477743673943660">fallen out of favor</a>). Good news: we’re already working on a ruggedized version of our prototype to include with our <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Parts/iPhone/Batteries">battery repair kits</a>.</p>



<h3>Is It Reversible?</h3>



<p>If we connected the 9V in reverse, would that rebond the adhesive? Nope. The adhesive remained ungrippy. The reverse polarity did have an effect: when we reverse-zapped a new phone, the zap released the battery, but the adhesive residue stuck to the frame instead of the battery. Before that, a positive zap consistently left the residue on the battery. If you’re trying this at home, be sure to get the polarity right so you have less residue to clean up on the frame!</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1920" height="1080" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/09/21153624/iPhone_16_TD_9-1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/09/21153624/iPhone_16_TD_9-1.jpg 1920w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/09/21153624/iPhone_16_TD_9-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/09/21153624/iPhone_16_TD_9-1-1600x900.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"><figcaption>With the correct polarity, the adhesive sticks to the battery and leaves the frame clean (right). With reversed polarity, the adhesive sticks to the frame instead (left).</figcaption></figure>



<p>It doesn’t seem like this adhesive is intended to be multi-use. We’re guessing that Apple will sell batteries with the new adhesive already applied (the repair manual describes “peeling the pink release liner” off the adhesive). </p>



<h3>Easy Battery Repairs Matter</h3>



<p>There was a time when cell phone battery replacements hardly deserved being called a repair—you’d pop the back cover off with your thumbnail and stick in a new battery. Fairphone has proven that <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/87664/fairphone-5-keeping-it-10-10">this is still possible</a> in the form factor of a modern smartphone, with an IP55 rating.</p>



<p>But until the industry goes the way of Fairphone (or chooses that’s where they want to innovate), battery replacements will remain the repair most worth talking about. Batteries are consumables. They’ll eventually wear out, no matter how durable the rest of your phone is. Extending a phone’s life by a year saves about <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2773167722000115">100x the phone’s weight</a>&nbsp; in CO2 emissions, and easy battery replacements are a necessary part of that lifespan extension.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/11/apple-makes-iphone-16-batteries-easier-to-replace">people have speculated</a> that the new adhesive is aimed at helping Apple comply with new European Right to Repair regulations that passed recently, but we don’t think that’s what’s going on here. There are two regulations that address battery repairs: <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/1670/oj">Ecodesign for Smartphones</a> and the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/1542/oj">new Battery Regulation</a>, each with slightly different requirements for compliance, both requiring easily removable batteries. Europe will probably enforce one or the other. The <a href="https://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/product-bureau/sites/default/files/2023-11/Battery%20RR%20-%20stakeholder-%2030October23.pdf">Joint Research Commission has suggested</a> that Ecodesign will likely supersede, but it’s not yet settled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regardless, in either case, we don’t believe the changed battery adhesive affects compliance—stretch-release adhesive and electrical-release adhesive under a battery seem to be equally compliant. However, display removal is a sticking point for both regulations: The iPhone 16 display removal is not compliant with the Ecodesign Directive because of the use of pentalobe screws, and it’s not compliant with the battery regulation because it requires heat for entry. If Apple could use this new voltage-release adhesive to open the phone, that might get them compliant with the Battery Regulation.</p>



<h2>Improved Thermal Handling of AI Workloads</h2>



<p>How well the iPhone can dissipate heat has always mattered: When the processor gets too hot, it has to throttle down and reduce performance. In this new world of AI, with on-device machine learning models, performance is going to matter more than ever. Faster models are more intelligent and can give you better suggestions or photo enhancements.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1365" height="768" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/09/21145821/iPhone_16_TD_43.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Thermal paste transfers heat from the A18 to this sink. The orange insulator on the sink prevents it from spilling on the smaller components.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Apple has significantly changed up their approach to dissipating heat from the main A18 processor with a new, ferrous heat sink. In this photo it looks like an EMI shield, but it’s actually a solid block of material. This sink sits inside the mainboard sandwich, soldered to the inside of the RF half of the logic board—which has an L-shaped footprint, similar to iPhones past and the 15 Plus from last year. Thermal paste transfers heat from the A18 to this sink.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1365" height="768" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/09/21145823/iPhone_16_TD_45.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Markup indicates where the sink and insulator sit on top of the SoC.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Intriguingly, this heat sink only covers about half of the A18 SoC. If the alignment of the die markings match Apple’s marketing photos, then the heat sink is over the Neural Engine, Apple’s machine learning hardware. The more efficiently they can run their Neural Engine, the better it will work. These improvements will enable the iPhone to run at maximum performance longer than previous designs.</p>

<h2>Is the Camera Control Button … a Button?</h2>



<p>Aside from the delayed Apple Intelligence, the feature that’s got everyone talking in this lineup is the new dedicated camera button. Yes, it does physically actuate. Yes, it’s a button. But there’s more to it than that. When we pulled it out, we discovered that it’s got its own tiny integrated circuit.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="3273" height="980" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/09/21205639/iPhone_16_TD_35-2.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/09/21205639/iPhone_16_TD_35-2.jpg 3273w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/09/21205639/iPhone_16_TD_35-2-1536x460.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/09/21205639/iPhone_16_TD_35-2-2048x613.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 3273px) 100vw, 3273px"></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, the button seems to be laser-welded to the frame. Buttons in past models <a href="https://youtu.be/3oC1R3H4-zE?feature=shared&amp;t=936">featured a latch mechanism</a> that made them fully replaceable and repairable. Now, if the button malfunctions, you’ll have to replace the whole frame. The welds appear unnecessary, except to attach the button and its IC to the frame. There’s a new “enclosure” component in the service history of the phone, and we confirmed it’s tracking this IC—when we swapped out a button, “enclosure” popped up in the history. </p>



<p>Chips enable parts pairing, the software barrier to repair that has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/12/technology/iphone-repair-apple-control.html">increasingly plagued</a> Apple products. But since the new Repair Assistant mode worked flawlessly for us on the iPhone 16, a new serialized part is less of a red flag today than it was before.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1919" height="1080" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/09/21150708/camera-control-button-watermarked.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/09/21150708/camera-control-button-watermarked.jpg 1919w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/09/21150708/camera-control-button-watermarked-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/09/21150708/camera-control-button-watermarked-1599x900.jpg 1599w" sizes="(max-width: 1919px) 100vw, 1919px"></figure>



<p>The spot where the button slots into the frame previously held a 5G mmWave antenna in the iPhone 15 (and every model back to the 12). Now there seems to be just one mmWave antenna left, sitting up against the camera assembly. Will that affect the phone’s signal strength?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also noticed this interesting flex cable epoxied onto the bracket holding the button in place. This is likely the “force sensor”—a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_gauge">strain gauge</a> that converts tiny amounts of deformation into changes in resistance. The iPhone uses this to sense half-presses before the button actually clicks.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1750" height="1080" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/09/21150722/Force-sensor-watermarked.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/09/21150722/Force-sensor-watermarked.jpg 1750w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/09/21150722/Force-sensor-watermarked-1536x948.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/09/21150722/Force-sensor-watermarked-1458x900.jpg 1458w" sizes="(max-width: 1750px) 100vw, 1750px"></figure>



<h2>Settling the Score</h2>



<p>Last year, we awarded the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/iPhone_15">iPhone 15</a> a lowly four out of ten, primarily due to the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/82493/we-are-retroactively-dropping-the-iphones-repairability-score-en">real-world complications</a> that parts pairing causes. This year, Apple has changed their tune. Accordingly, we’re changing ours.</p>



<p>Let’s start with the basics: Apple’s repair manuals are well written, well above the average we see from other manufacturers, and it’s awesome (like, really cool!) that Apple had them ready for launch day. Our only real gripes are a lack of schematics for board-level repairs, and missing repair procedures for the charge port or any buttons. Everything else looks great.</p>



<p>Repair parts aren’t on sale yet, but if Apple matches what’s already available on the 15-series, they’ll get quite a bit of credit there—mostly a good offering with a few omissions (no charge ports, buttons, or enclosure, for instance) and a display assembly that’s too pricey to be an attractive repair option for most people.</p>



<p>The new battery procedure is the design highlight. We repeatedly deactivated the adhesive with a variety of tools and timings, and the procedure seems very robust. We really like that you don’t need an expensive proprietary tool for this: You could rig up any 9V battery with whatever length of wire you’ve got lying around, and you’re set. We’d still prefer screws or some other fastener that’s easier to reverse—this will require cleanup/prep before installing a new battery (which presumably comes with fresh adhesive pre-applied, otherwise folks will have to get creative). And the adhesive supplier will need to make this glue available to the repair market. Still, this is a really cool innovation.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="5398" height="3036" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/09/21214156/iPhone_16_TD_17-1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/09/21214156/iPhone_16_TD_17-1.jpg 5398w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/09/21214156/iPhone_16_TD_17-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/09/21214156/iPhone_16_TD_17-1-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/09/21214156/iPhone_16_TD_17-1-1600x900.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 5398px) 100vw, 5398px"></figure>



<p>The dual-entry design, first introduced on the 14 series, remains very elegant. Once inside, lots of components are independently accessible with little to no additional disassembly. The layout is smart, prioritizing access to critical repairs like battery and camera replacement. In past models, it was normal to see, for example, battery pull tabs blocked by a Taptic Engine, which was blocked by a speaker, which was blocked by a big grounding bracket—all of that having to come out in sequence. The 16’s design offers independent access to the battery, the speaker, the Taptic Engine, cameras, display, back cover, and so on. It’s really thoughtfully laid out.</p>



<p>The largest remaining obstacles to repair: Apple continues to use a variety of fussy screw types. The display and rear panel adhesive requires heat to get inside. But we’re beyond pleased that Repair Assistant worked effortlessly, which removes our biggest complaint about the last few models of iPhone.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I am currently working on a Rust to .NET compiler, <code>rustc_codegen_clr</code>. To get it to work, I need to implement many Rust features using .NET APIs. One of such features is panicking and unwinding.</p>

<p>This article is the first one in a series about Rust panics, unwinding, and my implementation of them in .NET.</p>

<p>In this part, I will look at unwinding (the compiler side of panicking), and in the next one, I will explain the Linux GNU <code>std</code> implementation of panicking.</p>

<h2 id="how_a_rust_to_.net_compiler_works:_quick_recap">How a Rust to .NET compiler works: Quick recap</h2>

<p>Before I talk about the project, I should probably explain what it is. It is a "rust compiler backend" - but what does that mean?</p>

<p>You can imagine it as a compiler plugin, which replaces the very last step of compilation (code generation). Instead of using LLVM to generate native code, my project turns the internal Rust representation called MIR, into .NET Common Intermediate Language. CIL is then stored inside .NET assemblies, which allows the .NET runtime to load, and execute the compiled Rust code easily. <img src="https://fractalfir.github.io/images/rustc_codegen_clr_inner_workings_graph.png" alt=""></p>

<p>From the perspective of the Runtime, the compiled Rust looks identical to unsafe C#. So, the Rust code can easily call .NET functions and create .NET objects. In theory, there is nothing you can do in C# that can't be done in Rust too.</p>

<p>I am also working on making calling Rust from C# easier. The project allows you to define .NET classes in pure Rust. In the future, the safety of your interop code will be fully checked by the Rust compiler.</p>

<pre><code>// Early WIP syntax, subject to change.
dotnet_typedef! {
  class MyClass inherits [Some::External::Assebmly]SomeNamespace::SomeClass{
    virtual fn ToString(_this:MyClass)-&gt;MString{
      "I am a class defined in Rust!".into_managed()
    },
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>The end goal is to allow near-seamless interop between Rust and C# / F#. Ideally, the users of your Rust .NET library may not even realize that it is written in Rust.</p>

<h2 id="panicking_vs_unwinding">Panicking vs unwinding</h2>

<p>Now that I laid down some basics about how <code>rustc_codegen_clr</code> works, I will probably need to quickly explain what unwinding and panicking are.</p>

<p>While the terms panicking and unwinding are related, and sometimes used interchangeably, they are nonetheless 2 different things.</p>

<p>Panicking is the name for the feature of the Rust language. When you use the <code>panic!</code> macro, this is the feature you are using. Panicking is very similar to exceptions, and is used in Rust to signal an error in the program logic.</p>

<p>So, when you expect an operation could fail, you use the <code>Result</code> type. When an operation should not fail(a failure indicates a bug), you should use <code>panic!</code>s.</p>

<pre><code>// Reading and parsing a file can fail, so we return a `Result` to tell the consumers of our API that they should handle it. 
fn decode_file(path:&amp;Path)-&gt;Result&lt;DecodedFile, DecodeError&gt;{
  // ...
}
// A person's birth date can't be earlier than the current date. 
// If it is, then either that person is a time traveler, or we have a bug.
fn calcualte_age(date_of_birth:Date)-&gt;Duration{
  if Date::now() &lt; date_of_birth{
    panic!("Found a time traveler!");
  }
  // ...
}</code></pre>

<p>In general, <code>Result</code>s are used where an error is expected, and should be handled by the user of the API, while panics tend to be used when something unexpected happens(eg. an assertion fails, an array is indexed out of bounds).</p>

<p>While panicking is not used as commonly as <code>Result</code>s, it is still used in quite a few places(eg. in unit tests). So, this feature must work well.</p>

<p>Panicking is currently <em>implemented</em> using unwinding, but that does not have to be the case in the future - you can implement panicking in other ways(eg. a panic can simply terminate the program).</p>

<p>Those other implementations have their drawbacks, but there are (rare) situations in which using something other than unwinding makes sense.</p>

<p>Unwinding refers to a specific implementation of panicking, where the stack is <em>unwound</em> - traversed upwards, function by function, while the data on the stack is dropped.</p>

<p>When I refer to unwinding, I will talk about the specific implementation on the compiler level. Here, things like cleanup blocks or the exact implementation of certain intrinsic matter.</p>

<p>When I talk about panicking, I will refer to the implementation present inside the standard library. From the perspective of std, it just calls a few intrinsics and functions, and it does not care how things are implemented under the hood.</p>

<h2 id="unwinds_on_the_compiler_level.">Unwinds on the compiler level.</h2>

<p>At the conceptual level, an unwind is relatively easy to understand.</p>

<p>An unwind travels up the call stack, popping stack frames of each function along the way, and dropping (disposing of) the stack-allocated objects held by that function.</p>

<p>So, if we had some functions like this:</p>

<pre><code>fn a(){
  let numbers = vec![0;100];
  b();
}
fn b(){
  let hello_string = "Hello World".to_string();
  c();
}
fn c(){
  let some_value = Box::new(64);
  panic!();
}</code></pre>

<p>During an unwind(caused by the panic in <code>c</code>), first the <code>some_value</code> would be dropped, then the unwind would go up the call stack, into <code>b</code>. The <code>hello_string</code> would then be dropped, unwind would continue up to <code>a</code>, and drop the vector <code>numbers</code> it allocated.</p>

<p>This process would continue until the unwind encounters a special intrinsic named <code>catch_unwind</code>. The exact signature and behavior of <code>catch_unwind</code> is not relevant for now, so I will discuss it in the next article.</p>

<p>Looking at this process, you might ask yourself a question:</p>

<p>How does an unwind know what and how to drop? I mean, dropping a <code>Vec&lt;i32&gt;</code> is very different from dropping a <code>Box&lt;i32&gt;</code>, so how do we know how all the objects in that stack frame need to be dropped? How can we tell where a pointer to the string <code>hello_string</code> is on the stack, and how can we know what to do with it?</p>

<p>This process of dropping (disposing of) all the data in a stack frame is the responsibility of special pieces of code called "cleanup blocks"</p>

<h2 id="blocks_in_general">Blocks in general</h2>

<p>Before I explain what a cleanup block is, I should probably explain MIR blocks in general.</p>

<p>Each function in the Rust Mid-level Intermediate Representation (MIR) is made up of a series of basic blocks.</p>

<p>Those blocks represent the control flow of a program.</p>

<p>A block is made up of a bunch of statements, and a terminator.</p>

<p>The statements in a block are executed in sequence, and can't diverge or branch in any way. No matter what happens, they will get executed, one by one.</p>

<p>The terminator, on the other hand, can change the control flow of a function.</p>

<p>It can call other pieces of code, jump to some other block, resume an unwind, or abort the execution of a program.</p>

<p>While this may seem a bit odd at first, it is a very convenient representation. It makes analyzing control flow almost trivial - since we know that only terminators can change how the code is executed, we don't have to check each statement to figure out the relationships between blocks.</p>

<p>Another nice side-effect of this distinction is that it simplifies unwinding and cleaning up stack frames.</p>

<p>Since only a terminator can call other functions,  only terminators can panic. Executing a statement will never panic, since statements can't change the control flow of a program.</p>

<p>So, when we want to specify how to deal with a stack frame during an unwind, we only need to do so for each terminator.</p>

<p>Now that I explained what a basic block is in the context of MIR, I can show exactly what a cleanup block is.</p>

<h2 id="cleanup_blocks">Cleanup blocks</h2>

<p>As I mentioned before, a cleanup block is not called during “normal” execution. The sole purpose of a cleanup block is dropping (disposing of) all the things in a given stack frame. So, during an unwind, when we want to figure out how to drop a particular frame, we simply call the specified cleanup block.</p>

<p>The Rust compiler generates such a cleanup block every time it needs something to get dropped during an unwind.</p>

<p>This concept can be a bit hard to grasp, but a small example should make it easier to follow. I will demonstrate how a cleanup block works, by using some Rust-inspired pseudocode.</p>

<p>Let's say we have a program like this:</p>

<pre><code>fn test(x:u32){
bb0:{
 let x = 7;
 // If an unwind happens during this function call, `numbers` will not be yet owned by us.
 // Since we only have ownership of `numbers` once the we allocate the vector(using this function), 
 // dropping it during an unwind is the responsibility of the callee.
 // So, we don't need a cleanup block.
 let numbers = vec![x] -&gt; [return bn1, unwind continue];
}
bb1:{
 // Up till this point, there was nothing to drop. Now, after the variable `numbers` was allocated, there is something to drop,
 // so we specify that the cleanup blocks bb4 need to be called if an unwind happens.
 x = 8;
 do_something(&amp;numbers) -&gt;[return bn2; unwind bn4];
}
bb2:{
 x = 9;
 // Since calling pass_ownership requires passing the ownership of `numbers`, dropping it is the responsibility of the callee.
 // So, we don't specify any cleanup blocks.
 pass_ownership(numbers) -&gt; [return bn3, unwind continue];
}
b3:{
 return;
}
// The cleanup block generated by the compiler
bb4 (cleanup):{
 // If this block is called, then we need to dispose of `numbers`. So, we drop it.
 drop(numbers);
 unwind resume; // Continues the unwind
 }
}</code></pre>

<p>The real MIR looks a bit different(no variable names, explicit types of locals, calls that return nothing assign a <code>()</code> value), but this should give you a rough idea about how everything works.</p>

<p>As you can see here, cleanup blocks are not really all that scary. Despite the fancy name, they are eerily similar to <code>finally</code> or <code>using</code> in C#.</p>

<pre><code>// If an exception occurs, numbers.Dispose() will be called.
using(Vec&lt;int&gt;  numbers = new Vec{x}){
  do_something(ref numbers);
}</code></pre>

<p>The main difference between <code>using</code>/<code>finaly</code> and a cleanup block is that it is only called when an unwind happens, while <code>using</code> disposes of the resource when the control flow leaves it. So, it will get called when an exception occurs, but also just during normal execution.</p>

<p>Still, despite those differences, unwinds and exceptions map to each other nicely, and exception handlers can be used to implement cleanup blocks.</p>

<p>There are, of course, some differences between the two which make this not a 1 to 1 translation.</p>

<p>MIR cleanup blocks can jump to other cleanup blocks, and a .NET execution handler can’t jump into another exception handler.</p>

<p>Working around that required some tinkering, but it was not a big problem.</p>

<p>Now that I talked a little bit about cleanup blocks in general, I thought I might mention another oddity of unwinds in Rust.</p>

<p>Drop flags are variables, whose sole purpose is to tell a cleanup block if it should drop something or not.</p>

<p>Hang on a minute, did I not just tell you that we only need at most one cleanup block for each terminator, since only terminators can cause an unwind?</p>

<p>If we already have separate cleanup blocks for different terminators, why do we need additional flags to tell the cleanup block what to drop?</p>

<h3 id="to_drop_or_not_to_drop:_that_is_the_question!">To drop or not to drop: that is the question!</h3>

<p>Suppose we have some code like this:</p>

<pre><code>// Example taken from the Rustonomicon
// https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/drop-flags.html
let x;
if condition {
    x = Box::new(0);        // x was uninit; just overwrite.
    println!("{}", x);
}
// x goes out of scope; x might be uninit;
// check the flag!</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, x may or may not be initialized, depending on the condition.</p>

<p>If x is not initialized, then dropping it is UB. If it is initialized, then not dropping it would be a mistake.</p>

<p>To solve this, the compiler introduces a second variable, which checks if x is initialized.</p>

<pre><code>let x;
// Hiden, compiler-generated drop flags
let _is_x_init = false;
if condition{
    x = Box::new(0);  
    _is_x_init = true;
    println!("{}", x);
}
if _is_x_init{
   drop(x);
}</code></pre>

<p>You may say: well, that example is very contrived, and no one writes code like this! You just have to move the definition of x within the body of the if statement, and there would be no problem!</p>

<pre><code>if condition{
  let x = Box::new(0);
  println!("{}", x);
  // x is always initialized here, so we can drop it.
} </code></pre>

<p>Yeah, I would be shocked if someone wrote code exactly like this anywhere. But, this is the simplest possible example of the need for drop flags.</p>

<p>More realistic examples are far more complex, and this is the easiest way to showcase why drop flags are needed.</p>

<h2 id="optimizing_cleanup_blocks_is_hard.">Optimizing cleanup blocks is hard.</h2>

<p>Now that I explained how rust cleanup block works, and how they get turned into exception handlers, I want to highlight a few problems  I encountered while optimizing them.</p>

<p>Currently, the Rust code compiled for .NET suffers from massive slowdowns in a few key areas.</p>

<p>While I don't want to discuss the exact numbers since I am not 100% confident in them, I can at least highlight some general trends.</p>

<p>Rust compiled for .NET is, as expected, always slower than native Rust. However, it is not <em>that</em> much slower. In quite a few benchmarks, it is within 1.5 - 2x of native code - which I feel like is a pretty acceptable result. In the majority of cases, it is no more than 5x slower than native code. This is not great, but it is also not a bad starting point, seeing as my optimizations are ridiculously simple, and not all that effective.</p>

<p>Being wrong fast is not impressive, so I am mostly focusing on compilation accuracy and passing tests right now.</p>

<p>However, a select few benchmarks jump out. Some of them are pretty much expected (eg. a benchmark showing the vectorization capabilities of LLVM), but other ones may seem a bit more surprising at first.</p>

<p>One particularly problematic area is complex iterators, some of which take 70x more time to execute in NET.</p>

<p>That is, of course, unacceptable. You may ask yourself: what causes this slowdown?</p>

<p>Even though those benchmarks never panic, the cost of the unwinding infrastructure is still there. Just disabling unwind support(which just removes all the exception handlers) speeds up this problematic benchmark by 2x.</p>

<p>Of course, being 35x slower than native is still nothing to brag about, but it at least guides us toward the underlying problems.</p>

<p>Let us look at one of the problematic functions, decompiled into C# for readability.</p>

<pre><code>// NOTE: for the sake of this example, the custom optimizations performed by `rustc_codegen_clr` were disabled. 
public unsafe static void _ZN4core4iter8adapters3map8map_fold28_$u7b$$u7b$closure$u7d$$u7d$17hce71e23625930189E(Closure2n22Closure1n11Closure1pi8v * P_0, RustVoid acc, long elt) {
  //Discarded unreachable code: IL_002b, IL_006f
  Closure1n11Closure1pi8 * f_;
  bool flag;
  long item;
  try {
    f_ = &amp; P_0 - &gt; f_0;
    flag = true;
    void * ptr = (void * ) 8 u;
    Tuple2i8 tuple2i;
    tuple2i.Item1 = elt;
    tuple2i = tuple2i;
    item = _ZN4core3ops8function5FnMut8call_mut17hd1566fb973e9735aE(ptr, tuple2i.Item1);
  } catch {
    if (flag) {}
    throw;
  }
  try {
    flag = false;
    Tuple3vi8 tuple3vi;
    tuple3vi.Item2 = item;
    tuple3vi = tuple3vi;
    RustVoid rustVoid;
    _ZN4iter13for_each_fold28_$u7b$$u7b$closure$u7d$$u7d$17hfc540be8426f74d2E(f_, rustVoid, tuple3vi.Item2);
  } catch {
    if (flag) {}
    throw;
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>You may immediately notice something very odd. All the exception handlers in this function are effectively nops!</p>

<p>In some other examples, those <code>catch</code> blocks do assign some values to local variables, but, as soon as the handler finishes execution, those locals will be discarded anyway - since the exception will be rethrown(an unwind will resume).</p>

<pre><code>catch {
  nint num6 = (nint) self.b.v;
  if (num6 != 1 || flag) {}
  throw;
}</code></pre>

<p>And what about those useless ifs? They are empty, so they can't do anything at all!</p>

<p>Those ifs, weird assignments, and empty handlers are ghosts of removed drops.<br></p>

<h2 id="in_search_for_the_empty_cleanup_blocks">In search for the empty cleanup blocks</h2>

<p>The example I showed you is nothing more than a faithful recreation of the original optimized MIR passed to me by the Rust compiler front end. All those useless blocks and instructions are there because the compiler explicitly asked me for them.</p>

<p>You may think: why would <code>rustc</code> explicitly request a useless block? Can’t it see that it does nothing?</p>

<p>I mean, the sole reason for MIRs existence is optimization. If this is its only job, surely it would be better at it?</p>

<p>Well, what if I told you that the purpose of MIR optimizations is not to make your code faster, but to make compilation faster?</p>

<p>How on earth does an extra step in compilation make it faster?</p>

<h3 id="doing_more_to_do_less.">Doing more to do less.</h3>

<p>Well, as you may know, LLVM is not exactly the fastest thing in the world. It is <em>very</em> good at producing fast code, but it takes its sweet time to do it.</p>

<p>Let us say we know that a certain kind of LLVM optimization is quite slow, but we found a faster way to achieve the same thing, by using the unique properties of Rust.</p>

<p>Well, if <code>rustc</code> did just that, then LLVM wouldn't need to perform its own costly optimization, and compilation time would improve.</p>

<p>This kind of scenario is not very common. We can, however, exploit a different property of Rust to make a lot of optimizations way faster.</p>

<p>The nice thing about generics is that they allow for a lot of code to be shared. What if, instead of optimizing the “final” monomorphized versions of a function(like what LLVM does), we could optimize the generic one?</p>

<p>Look at this function:</p>

<pre><code>fn do_sth&lt;T:Copy&gt;(val:&amp;T){
 let tmp = *val;
 do_sth_inner(&amp;tmp, 8);
}</code></pre>

<p>For each different type, <code>T</code> LLVM will receive a different version of this function from <code>rustc</code> Each of those variants needs to be optimized separately. Let us imagine we call this function with 1000 different Ts. This means LLVM will have to optimize 1000 different versions of this function. This will take time.</p>

<p>However, we could try optimizing the generic version of this function. We might not be able to perform all the optimizations, but we should be able to perform quite a few of them. In this example, we could avoid storing the value of <code>val</code> in <code>tmp</code>. Since we only use the address of <code>tmp</code> to pass it to another function, <code>val</code> is an immutable reference to <code>T</code>, and <code>tmp</code> is a bitwise copy of what <code>val</code> points to, this optimization is OK.</p>

<pre><code>fn do_sth&lt;T:Copy&gt;(val:&amp;T){
 do_sth_inner(val, 8);
}</code></pre>

<p>In one move, we optimized all the possible variants of <code>do_sth</code>. LLVM  would have to do the same thing each time <code>do_sth</code> is used. So, for any function that is used more than once, we should save some compilation time.</p>

<p>This is the main reason MIR exists. If we can optimize stuff before handing it to LLVM, we can save time. Disabling MIR optimizations would not slow the final native code all that much, but it would make LLVM have to do more work - which would increase compile times.</p>

<h3 id="limitations_of_mir">Limitations of MIR</h3>

<p>So, we now know that MIR optimization operates on generic functions and that they can leverage Rust-specific information(eg. borrows) to perform certain optimizations faster.</p>

<p>However, there are some problems with this approach.<br></p>

<p><code>rustc</code>  can't perform certain kinds of MIR optimizations, since they might not be valid for all possible <code>T</code>s. For example, if the type in our example was <code>Clone</code>, and not <code>Copy</code>, we would not be able to optimize it all that much.</p>

<pre><code>fn do_sth&lt;T:Clone&gt;(val:&amp;T){
 let tmp = val.clone();
 do_sth_inner(&amp;tmp, 8);
}</code></pre>

<p>The clone could have side effects(eg. incrementing an atomic reference counter), and dropping <code>tmp</code> could also do something(eg. decrementing an atomic reference counter).</p>

<p>This is not a problem in most cases - since LLVM operates on monomorphized functions(functions with <code>T</code> replaced by some type, like <code>i32</code>), it can still perform this optimization, where applicable.</p>

<p>You can now probably guess why the iterator code I showcased had empty exception handlers(and cleanup blocks) - those blocks are not always empty.</p>

<h2 id="ghost_drop">Ghost drop</h2>

<p>When you look at the original example, you might notice it operates on <code>long</code>s(aka <code>i64</code>s). Dropping an <code>i64</code> is a NOP.</p>

<p>During compilation, when the cleanup block in question is processed, my backend encounters a drop. When it encounters a drop, I use <code> Instance::resolve_drop_in_place</code> to get information about how to drop a variable.</p>

<pre><code>let drop_instance = Instance::resolve_drop_in_place(ctx.tcx(), ty).polymorphize(ctx.tcx());
  if let InstanceKind::DropGlue(_, None) = drop_instance.def {
    //Empty drop, nothing needs to happen.
    vec![CILRoot::GoTo { target: target.as_u32(), sub_target: 0}.into()]
  } else {
  // Handle the drop
}</code></pre>

<p>One of the possible ways to drop something is calling the "DropGlue". Drop glue is <em>basically</em> a function that calls the drop implementation. However, when something (like an <code>i64</code>) does not need dropping, the drop glue can be <code>None</code>. If it is <code>None</code>, then there is nothing to do during a drop. In such a case, I do nothing(besides jumping to the next block).</p>

<p>So, this "empty" drop compiles into nothing - that explains our empty exception handlers. In reality, those handlers look more like this:</p>

<pre><code>catch {
  nint num6 = (nint) self.b.v;
  if (num6 != 1 || flag) {
    // Ghost drop
    drop_i64(&amp;item); // Drops the i64 - does nothing.
  }
  throw;
}</code></pre>

<p>But the <code>drop_i64</code> is never generated, since it is not needed.</p>

<h2 id="optimizing_exception_handlers">Optimizing exception handlers</h2>

<p>Optimizing exception handlers is very important for Rust to run well inside the .NET runtime. The biggest problem with them is the amount of byte code those things create. Remember - each Rust block can have its own cleanup bloc, and jumping between exception handlers is not allowed in .NET. This means that I have to store multiple copies of certain blocks.</p>

<p>This huge amount of exception handlers is not liked by the .NET JIT. I will admit that I am not an expert when it comes to understanding how RyuJIT works - I only have a <strong>very</strong> rough idea about how all the pieces fit together. Still, I feel like I know enough to speculate about the cause of the slowdowns I observed.</p>

<p><code>rustc_codegen_clr</code> is not yet all that good at optimizing code, so it generates a lot of CIL. Each unneeded exception handler, unused variable - all that adds up.</p>

<p>While the .NET JIT is pretty good, and can optimize most of the inefficiencies away, the increased bytecode size still has an impact. Internally, most JIT's (including RyuJIT) use certain heuristics to estimate if certain optimizations are worth it. So, a JIT may use metrics like the number of exception handlers, locals, and the size of bytecode, to try to guess how large the final compiled function is.</p>

<p>Since I emit a lot of code (quite a bit of it useless), the JIT "thinks" my functions are bad optimization and inlining candidates.</p>

<p>The exact formula used to calculate the cost of operations like inlining is not all that relevant to this post (you can <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/02e95ebff119189ac2d65e4a641980ccb3ea1091/src/coreclr/jit/inlinepolicy.cpp#L4">find it here</a>), but I still wanted to highlight some things that seem to explain what I observed.</p>

<p>Looking at the default inlining policy, it seems like RyuJIT will not inline a function, if it exceeds a certain limit of basic blocks.</p>

<pre><code>// Code snipet from: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/02e95ebff119189ac2d65e4a641980ccb3ea1091/src/coreclr/jit/inlinepolicy.cpp#L577

// CALLEE_IS_FORCE_INLINE overrides CALLEE_DOES_NOT_RETURN
if (!m_IsForceInline &amp;&amp; m_IsNoReturn &amp;&amp; (basicBlockCount == 1))
{
  SetNever(InlineObservation::CALLEE_DOES_NOT_RETURN);
}
else if (!m_IsForceInline &amp;&amp; (basicBlockCount &gt; MAX_BASIC_BLOCKS))
{
  SetNever(InlineObservation::CALLEE_TOO_MANY_BASIC_BLOCKS);
}</code></pre>

<p>This limit seems to currently <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/02e95ebff119189ac2d65e4a641980ccb3ea1091/src/coreclr/jit/inlinepolicy.h#L154">be 5</a>.</p>

<p>Since I need to duplicate all used cleanup blocks for each handler (jumping between exception handlers is not allowed), most handlers contain multiple blocks.</p>

<p>Let us say we have 2 handlers, with 2 blocks each. That alone already adds up almost to the inline limit.</p>

<p>When I removed all the exception handlers from an assembly, I removed a lot of those blocks, allowing the JIT to inline more functions.</p>

<p>Overall, removing this dead code, and reducing complexity, encourages the JIT to perform more optimizations.</p>

<p>You may wonder: why do JIT's use heuristics like this, and why do they only perform optimizations in certain cases?</p>

<p>JIT's try to be fast at compiling code. You don't want to have to wait a couple of minutes for your .NET app to start. So, a JIT has a limited time budget. It has to weigh the benefit of any give optimization against the time it would take. You don't want the JIT to spend a lot of time optimizing a complex function, if it can spend the same time optimizing 100 simpler ones.</p>

<p>In general, JIT's focus on code that is used often, and does not take a lot of time to optimize. This way, they can give you some pretty decent performance, while also compiling CIL very quickly.</p>

<p>If the CIL I generate is simpler, then the JIT can "see" that optimizing it will not take too long. By better preparing a .NET assembly for JIT compilation, I can reduce the amount of needless work a JIT needs to do, allowing it to perform other, highly beneficial optimizations.</p>

<p>Of course, you should take this paragraph with a pinch of salt. While I am pretty confident in what I wrote, I am still an amateur when it comes to JIT's. So, I might have misunderstood something or missed some finer detail.</p>

<h2 id="removing_empty_handlers">Removing empty handlers</h2>

<p>Now that I expalined why those optimzations are needed, I will show how I implemented them.</p>

<p>To remove a useless cleanup block(or exception handlers) I first need a good way of detecting them. Originally, I went with a more complex solution: First, I would simplify each block separately, removing all the side-effect-free statements before a <code>rethrow</code>.</p>

<pre><code>// Since assigning a constant to a local has no other side effects, and this bit of CIL is followed by a rethrow instruction, we are free to remove it.
ldc.i4.0
stloc.0
rethrow
// Simpler, equivalent version
rethrow</code></pre>

<p>Next, I would replace unconditional jumps to lone <code>rethrow</code> ops with <code>rethrow</code>s.</p>

<pre><code>br bb1
bb1:
rethrow
// Simpler, equivalent version
rethrow</code></pre>

<p>After a few more steps dealing with conditionals, most handlers would get simplified away into a single <code>rethrow</code> instruction.</p>

<pre><code>catch [System.Runtime]System.Object{
pop // Ignore the exception Object
rethrow
}</code></pre>

<p>As a last step, I would simply remove those trialy-NOP handlers.</p>

<p>This approach had a lot of advantages - in cases where it was not able to fully optimize something away, it would still simplify it considerably.</p>

<p>However, the added complexity made this optimization a bit error-prone. For the sake of simplicity, I have overlooked some of the non-obvious issues. Most of them were caused by some of the tech debt the project has. Fixing them requires some additional refactors, which are just not done yet.</p>

<p>Since the code in cleanup blocks only runs during an uwnind(so not during normal excution), debuging it is a bit of a pain.</p>

<p>Any issues in cleaup blocks will also be very hard to notice:removing a necessary cleanup block can just lead to a memory leak. So I need to get all the optimzations operating on them to be perfect.</p>

<p>In order to avoid those issues, I have decided to go with a much simpler, more conservative approach for now.</p>

<p>It is not as good at optimizing stuff away, but it can still improve things a fair bit.</p>

<p>I simply go through all the CIL in the handler, checking if it can cause observable side effects.</p>

<p>For example, assigning a const value to local has no side effects, while setting a value at some address has side effects.</p>

<p>If a handler only consists of assignments to locals, jumps, and a rethrow, then it can't have any side effects, so we can just remove it.</p>

<p>After this optimization(and other CIL optimizations implemented by <code>rustc_codegen_clr</code>), the iterator function I showed before looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public unsafe static void _ZN4core4iter8adapters3map8map_fold28_$u7b$$u7b$closure$u7d$$u7d$17hce71e23625930189E(Closure2n22Closure1n11Closure1pi8v * P_0, RustVoid acc, long elt) {
  //Discarded unreachable code: IL_0025, IL_0047
  Closure1n11Closure1pi8 * f_ = &amp; P_0 - &gt; f_0;
  void* ptr = (void*) 8u;
  Tuple2i8 tuple2i;
  tuple2i.Item1 = elt;
  Tuple3vi8 tuple3vi;
  long num = (tuple3vi.Item2 = _ZN4core3ops8function5FnMut8call_mut17hd1566fb973e9735aE(ptr, tuple2i.Item1));
  RustVoid rustVoid;
  _ZN4iter13for_each_fold28_$u7b$$u7b$closure$u7d$$u7d$17hfc540be8426f74d2E(f_, rustVoid, tuple3vi.Item2);
}</code></pre>

<p>Don't get me wrong - there are still a lot of optimizations to be done(the whole function can be optimzed to one line, and easily inlined), but this is far better than what we had before.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I hope you liked this deep dive into Rust unwinding, drop flags, and MIR optimizations. Originally, this was just supposed to be a "short introduction" to unwinding, after which I would talk about how panics work in <code>std</code>.</p>

<p>Well, it turns out unwinds are a bit complex. Since this article is already one of my longest, I will have to split it into 2-3 parts.</p>

<p>I also plan to explain the difficulties with Rust code catching arbitrary .NET exceptions and talk a little bit more about safe Rust / .NET interop.</p>

<p>So, look forward to that :).</p>

<h2 id="the_project_is_1_year_old,_gsoc,_and_special_thank_you_s.">The project is 1 year old, GSoC, and special <code>thank you</code>s.</h2>

<p>Oh, I almost forgot! <a href="https://github.com/FractalFir/rustc_codegen_clr">`rustc_codegen_clr`</a> turned 1 year old on August 28th! I would like to thank You for the amazing reception it received (over 1.4 K stars on Github, and a lot of very nice comments).</p>

<p>I(and my project) also participated in Rust GSoC 2024. I originally planned to write an article summarizing GSoC and celebrating the project's birthday, but I was unable to do so due to health reasons. I want to thank my GSoC mentor, Jack Huey, for mentoring me and helping me with some of the organizational stuff. Helping me to stay on track was really important for me since I work better when I have a sense of direction. This may seem small, but receiving even a tiny bit of feedback helps a lot.</p>

<p>I also wanted to thank Jakub Beránek(one of the Rust people behind Rust GSoC 2024) for his work organizing and managing Rust GSoC. Good management is almost invisible: everything just goes according to plan. Still, it is something to appreciate.</p>

<p>I am, in general, a bit of a messy and forgetful person, so I really appreciate that everything was going smoothly.</p>

<p>Since I am talking about the organizational stuff, it would be a crime not to thank the Google GSoC team for making GSoC in the first place. To be quite honest, I assumed that the team behind GSoC had to be pretty sizable since everything worked like a well-oiled machine. Learning how small it is(2.5 people) was a big shock to me, and made me appreciate their work even more.</p>

<p>I also want to express my gratitude towards the wider members of the Rust project, who helped me tremendously. It would be hard to list everyone who answered my question by name, but I would like to explicitly mention <code>Bjorn3</code>, who answered quite a lot of them.</p>

<p>One of the greatest things about GSoC was receiving feedback and help from a lot of different people.</p>

<p>Overall, GSoC has been a blast, and I met a lot of truly amazing people there. Each project felt like something impactful, and all my interactions with other Rust GSoC contributors were amazing.</p>

<p>Meeting all of those people passionate about Rust gave me a lot of confidence in the future of the language.</p>
