<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Intel’s Optane memory modules launched with a lot of fanfare in 2015, and were recently
discontinued, in 2022, with similar fanfare. It was a sad day for me, a lover of
abstraction-breaking technologies, but it was forseeable and understandable.</p>
<p>At the time of Optane’s launch, a lot of us were excited about the idea of having a new storage
tier, sitting between DRAM and flash. It was announced as having DRAM endurance and speed with
the persistence and size of flash. It was a futuristic memory technology, but the technology of
the future met the full force of Wright’s Law.</p>
<h2 id="wrights-law">Wright’s Law</h2>
<p><em><strong>Each doubling of production volume corresponds to a 20% decrease in cost</strong></em>.</p>
<p>This is the simple statement of Wright’s Law. It was originally developed by a man named Theodore
Wright in the 1930’s when looking at the production of airplane parts. Since then, it has been
verified to hold in many different industries, although the cost reduction seems to vary between
10 and 25% depending on the industry. Despite the industry difference, the history of
semiconductor technology has actually followed Wright’s Law more closely than Moore’s Law: The
density increases predicted by Moore’s Law tend to speed up and slow down with demand growth,
exactly as predicted by Wright’s Law.</p>
<p>During the last 7 years, DRAM and Flash have both experienced massive increases in density and
production volume, and in turn, Wright’s Law has given us cheaper, faster, bigger devices.</p>
<h4 id="dram-production-2015-2022">DRAM Production 2015-2022</h4>
<p>The lifetime of DDR4 memory roughly matches the lifetime of Optane. DDR4 was introduced a few
years before 2015, and became cost-effective compared to DDR3 around 2015-2016. Today, DDR5 RAM
and the CPUs that can use it have just recently been introduced to the market. Over this time,
RAM price per bit has roughly halved, and global RAM production has grown by a factor of about
10-15. However, due to competition between AMD and Intel, the number of memory channels per CPU
has also roughly doubled. Thus, a server in 2022 holds about 4x as much RAM as a server in 2015,
and memory cost as a share of system cost has increased by a factor of 2. Memory bandwidth has
increased by a factor of about 3 due to a doubling of memory channels and the channels getting
faster.</p>
<p>This means that both the capacity argument of Optane (“a system with Optane DIMMs can hold more
memory”) has diminished over time, and the performance gap between Optane and DDR memory has also
grown. A two-socket server populated with RDIMMs can now hold several TB of memory, so the value
proposition of Optane for memory capacity has been eliminated.</p>
<h4 id="flash-is-a-spectrum">Flash is a Spectrum</h4>
<p>Flash memory comes in four flavors, based on the number of bits stored in each cell. Single-level
cell (SLC) flash stores one bit per cell. It has the lowest density, but the longest endurance and
highest speeds. MLC (multi-level cell) holds two bits per cell, and is worse on speed and
endurance than SLC, but better than TLC (triple-level cell). Most SSDs today use TLC flash: it
offers a good balance between price and endurance, and most workloads are read-heavy, so there
isn’t a lot of stress on the memory arrays. QLC (quad-level cell) has recently been introduced to
the market as a capacity SSD technology: QLC has even lower endurance and speed than TLC, but
increases the capacity a lot. PLC (penta-level) is on the horizon, promising to continue the
trend.</p>
<p>On the back of this distinction, we can see a natural tiering of flash: using TLC or QLC for
capacity (in place of disk for all but the largest datasets), and using SLC for caching and
write-heavy workloads. This means that SLC flash is a direct competitor to Optane, but it
has the advantages of being much cheaper per bit without being a lot slower.</p>
<h4 id="flash-production-2015-2022">Flash Production 2015-2022</h4>
<p>After Optane’s launch, Flash memory technology advanced quickly. In 2015, NVMe drives had been out
for about a year or two. NVMe drives and the controller chips that ran them were still working out
the kinks. Understandably, Intel also created NVMe drives with Optane, offering much better read
and write latencies than NVMe drives with flash. Not only did Optane offer faster access than
flash, but it had the advantage of being a simpler, more reliable form of memory that didn’t need
complicated controller algorithms.</p>
<p>As time went on, companies quicly improved the speed, reliability, and density of each flash
technology. In 2015, TLC was roughly in the position QLC occupies today: mostly for read-only and
read-heavy workloads. Now, TLC is the workhorse flash technology used for general-purpose drives,
as its speed and endurance have improved. Similarly, SSD controller chips have also improved over
time, allowing them to work faster and make better use of the flash chips on an SSD. Lots of money
goes into R&amp;D work for flash, and it shows.</p>
<p>In the last 7 years, flash has grown to be the dominant storage technology: going from almost 20x
more per bit than hard drives to just 5x more per bit. In addition, SSD latency has dropped by
a factor of 2 due to control chips getting more powerful and algorithms getting better. Flash
bandwidth has increased to the point where an SSD can saturate a PCIe gen 4 x4 link. A modern
SLC SSD can be found with read latency under 30 microseconds, and even TLC SSDs can get close to
100 microsecond latencies.</p>
<p>Flash has advanced so much over the last 7 years that if the trend continues, I may be eulogizing
the magnetic hard drive in 2030. Flash is eating the storage world for good reason: it can offer
high speeds and high capacity, and while it had some rough edges, we have learned how to work with
it very well.</p>
<h4 id="optane-and-wrights-law">Optane and Wright’s Law</h4>
<p>Clearly, as time has advanced, Optane’s position in the memory hierarchy has been getting crushed
between expanding DDR4 DRAM and flash that is getting faster and faster. Both of these
technologies have had much more innovation and R&amp;D over the last 7 years than Optane, and it shows.
In retrospect, Intel was fighting an uphill battle if they wanted to treat Optane simply as a point
on the memory hierarchy. To make the project successful, they needed it to be a unique value add.</p>
<h2 id="the-value-proposition-of-optane">The Value Proposition of Optane</h2>
<p>After the dust settled, Optane modules only ended up having a small price difference with DRAM
modules of the same size, but were almost as slow as SLC flash, and only had 3-5x the endurance of
flash memory. The NVMe drives were faster, but not that much faster, than SLC flash. The only
value-add that was left was the abstraction difference with normal memory: Optane offered
<strong>persistence on the memory bus</strong>.</p>
<p>If you have worked on a database or a storage system, you will know how valuable this can be: lots
of code in high-throughput storage systems is there to make sure that transactions persist as
quickly as possible. Conceivably, if the normal memory writes involved in that transaction can
make it persistent, you can delete a ton of code. You could even conceivably run a small database
on an <code>mmap</code>-ed Optane file, and persistence would be given to you for free. Oh wait… a lot of
databases <code>mmap</code> their backing files already.</p>
<h4 id="persistence-on-the-memory-abstraction">Persistence on the Memory Abstraction</h4>
<p>It turns out that what developers mostly would have wanted from Optane they got from BSD and Linux
in the form of <code>mmap</code>. <code>mmap</code>-ing a file allows you to treat the contents of the file as though
they are in memory, and allows the filesystem and a cache to handle the rest. The parts of the
file you have accessed recently are in memory, while other parts of the file are fetched from disk
when you demand them - your access triggers a page fault, which in turn triggers a read from the
filesystem. Writes to the file are handled in the background. This is not the fastest way to
access files, but it is a very convenient one, and it works well enough for many high-performance
key-value databases like LevelDB, LMDB, SQLite, QuestDB, RavenDB, and more.</p>
<p><code>mmap</code> had one more secret weapon: the filesystem. If the media backing the filesystem wore out,
the filesystem (and the layers underneath it) could detect and correct issues. Optane had no
such protection.</p>
<p>When Intel thought they were enabling a whole new class of high-performance databases by offering
persistence on the memory bus, they were really offering a performance boost compared to persistent
databases using <code>mmap</code>. It might not even have been a performance boost: Optane slowed down your
median read and write operations in exchange for avoiding those page faults, so if your working set
was small or mostly fit inside RAM, <code>mmap</code> and NVMe flash was actually faster.</p>
<h4 id="persistent-memory-and-caches">Persistent Memory and Caches</h4>
<p>It turns out that offering persistence on the memory bus runs into abstraction problems with the
current memory controllers on CPUs. The memory controllers and cache hierarchies are designed
assuming that memory is dumb and volatile, and they can indefinitely delay writes to save
bandwidth.</p>
<p>The initial solution that Intel came up with was an instruction, <code>CLFLUSH</code>, that flushed a cache
line to memory. However, <code>CLFLUSH</code> was a serializing instruction, like <code>CPUID</code>, so it ended up
flushing the CPU pipeline as well as the cache hierarchy when it was issued. Worse, flusing the
cache line would invalidate it, so if you wanted to read the value back after writing it, you would
incur a cache miss. It was later supplemented by <code>CLFLUSHOPT</code> and <code>CLWB</code> which also could be used
to flush and write back cache lines without incurring the same performance penalty.</p>
<p>However, when Optane memory started to come out, <code>CLFLUSH</code> was the only instruction from this suite
that was available, meaning that initial performance tests suffered from both the speed difference
between Optane and DRAM and the substantial overhead of the <code>CLFLUSH</code> instruction. Intel would
probably have had a much easier time selling Optane if their core architecture were ready.</p>
<h4 id="alternative-methods-of-persistence">Alternative Methods of Persistence</h4>
<p>Also between 2015 and 2022, several companies were offering a different kind of persistent DIMM.
Instead of using a special type of memory, this kind of persistent DIMM used normal DRAM, but added
some flash memory and a small controller circuit on the back that saved the contents of the DRAM
to flash every time the power started to dip.</p>
<p>To make sure that the contents of the DIMM were safe, these persistent DIMMs had a supercapacitor
or small lithium ion battery (usually kept in a 2.5 inch drive bay and connected to the DIMM
through a cable) that kept the DIMM powered while the rest of the system was going down. On
power-up, the DIMM would restore the memory contents.</p>
<p>These were later specified by JEDEC as “NVDIMM-N” modules (standing for Non-volatile Dual Inline
Memory Module - NAND flash type).</p>
<p>Still, these alternatives have some problems: they are a lot thicker than normal memory DIMMs, and
they can’t offer the capacity that Optane modules could offer. However, they don’t have the same
durability problems that Optane and flash do, since the flash is rarely written, and they operate
at the same speed as the rest of the system’s memory.</p>
<h2 id="thank-you-optane">Thank You, Optane</h2>
<p>So many technologies have become successful around Optane and the promises it held. Unfortunately,
Optane was not one of them.</p>
<p>SSDs using SLC flash offer blazing fast performance with a block abstraction, and enterprises and
database developers learned how to take advantage of the differences between SSDs that were small
and fast, using SLC flash, and SSDs that were slower and larger, with TLC and QLC flash. Some SSD
manufacturers also saw the idea of a caching drive and competed by adding SLC caching to their TLC
SSDs. Most high-end consumer SSDs today do this for you.</p>
<p>For the few customers who needed persistence on the memory bus, the JEDEC NVDIMM standards emerged,
with the flagship NVDIMM-N modules allowing you to have a DRAM module that was both persistent
<em>and</em> fast, and an additional standard to cover future persistent memory technologies. Intel’s
new instructions allow users to take advantage of these new modules, adding a fundamental
capability to CPUs.</p>
<p>Optane has helped us learn to build computing systems that take advantage of the spectrum of
“legacy” storage and memory technologies. I, for one, am sad to see it go, but happy that I won’t
miss it.</p>

<p>A radical theory that consistently unifies gravity and quantum mechanics while preserving Einstein's classical concept of spacetime has been announced in two papers published simultaneously by UCL (University College London) physicists.

										  
											        </p>
										 
										 											  
<p>Modern physics is founded upon two pillars: quantum theory on the one hand, which governs the smallest particles in the universe, and Einstein's theory of general relativity on the other, which explains <a href="https://phys.org/tags/gravity/" rel="tag">gravity</a> through the bending of spacetime. But these two theories are in contradiction with each other and a reconciliation has remained elusive for over a century.
</p><p>The prevailing assumption has been that Einstein's theory of gravity must be modified, or "quantized," in order to fit within quantum theory. This is the approach of two leading candidates for a quantum theory of gravity, string theory and <a href="https://phys.org/tags/loop+quantum+gravity/" rel="tag">loop quantum gravity</a>.
</p><p>But a new theory, developed by Professor Jonathan Oppenheim (UCL Physics &amp; Astronomy) and laid out in a paper in <i>Physical Review X,</i> challenges that consensus and takes an alternative approach by suggesting that spacetime may be classical—that is, not governed by quantum theory at all.
</p><p>Instead of modifying spacetime, the theory—dubbed a "postquantum theory of classical gravity"—modifies quantum theory and predicts an intrinsic breakdown in predictability that is mediated by spacetime itself. This results in random and violent fluctuations in spacetime that are larger than envisaged under quantum theory, rendering the apparent weight of objects unpredictable if measured precisely enough.
</p><p>A second paper, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43348-2">published</a> simultaneously in <i>Nature Communications </i>and led by Professor Oppenheim's former Ph.D. students, looks at some of the consequences of the theory, and proposes an experiment to test it: to measure a mass very precisely to see if its weight appears to fluctuate over time.
</p><p>For example, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in France routinely weigh a 1kg mass which used to be the 1kg standard. If the fluctuations in measurements of this 1kg mass are smaller than required for mathematical consistency, the theory can be ruled out.
</p><p>The outcome of the experiment, or other evidence emerging that would confirm the quantum vs. classical nature of spacetime, is the subject of a 5000:1 odds bet between <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/oppenheim/pub/quantum_vs_classical_bet.pdf">Professor Oppenheim and Professor Carlo Rovelli and Dr. Geoff Penington</a>—leading proponents of quantum loop gravity and <a href="https://phys.org/tags/string+theory/" rel="tag">string theory</a> respectively.


											  													    </p>
											  
											  <p>For the past five years, the UCL research group has been stress-testing the theory, and exploring its consequences.
</p><p>Professor Oppenheim said, "Quantum theory and Einstein's theory of general relativity are mathematically incompatible with each other, so it's important to understand how this contradiction is resolved. Should spacetime be quantized, or should we modify quantum theory, or is it something else entirely? Now that we have a consistent fundamental theory in which spacetime does not get quantized, it's anybody's guess."
</p><p>Co-author Zach Weller-Davies, who as a Ph.D. student at UCL helped develop the experimental proposal and made key contributions to the theory itself, said, "This discovery challenges our understanding of the fundamental nature of gravity but also offers avenues to probe its potential quantum nature.
</p><p>"We have shown that if spacetime doesn't have a quantum nature, then there must be random fluctuations in the curvature of spacetime which have a particular signature that can be verified experimentally.
</p><p>"In both quantum gravity and classical gravity, spacetime must be undergoing violent and random fluctuations all around us, but on a scale which we haven't yet been able to detect. But if spacetime is classical, the fluctuations have to be larger than a certain scale, and this scale can be determined by another experiment where we test how long we can put a heavy atom in superposition of being in two different locations."
</p><p>Co-authors Dr. Carlo Sparaciari and Dr. Barbara Šoda, whose analytical and numerical calculations helped guide the project, expressed hope that these experiments could determine whether the pursuit of a quantum theory of gravity is the right approach.

    </div>

<p>Dr. Šoda (formerly UCL Physics &amp; Astronomy, now at the Perimeter Institute of Theoretical Physics, Canada) said, "Because gravity is made manifest through the bending of space and time, we can think of the question in terms of whether the rate at which time flows has a quantum nature, or classical nature.
</p><p>"And testing this is almost as simple as testing whether the weight of a mass is constant, or appears to fluctuate in a particular way."
</p><p>Dr. Sparaciari (UCL Physics &amp; Astronomy) said, "While the experimental concept is simple, the weighing of the object needs to be carried out with extreme precision.
</p><p>"But what I find exciting is that starting from very general assumptions, we can prove a clear relationship between two measurable quantities—the scale of the spacetime fluctuations, and how long objects like atoms or apples can be put in quantum superposition of two different locations. We can then determine these two quantities experimentally."
</p><p>Weller-Davies added, "A delicate interplay must exist if quantum particles such as atoms are able to bend classical spacetime. There must be a fundamental trade-off between the wave nature of atoms, and how large the random fluctuations in spacetime need to be."
</p><p>The proposal to test whether spacetime is classical by looking for random fluctuations in mass is complementary to another experimental proposal that aims to verify the quantum nature of spacetime by looking for something called "gravitationally mediated entanglement."
</p><p>Professor Sougato Bose (UCL Physics &amp; Astronomy), who was not involved with the announcement today, but was among those to first propose the entanglement experiment, said, "Experiments to test the nature of spacetime will take a large-scale effort, but they're of huge importance from the perspective of understanding the fundamental laws of nature. I believe these experiments are within reach—these things are difficult to predict, but perhaps we'll know the answer within the next 20 years."
</p><p>The postquantum theory has implications beyond gravity. The infamous and problematic "measurement postulate" of quantum theory is not needed, since quantum superpositions necessarily localize through their interaction with classical <a href="https://phys.org/tags/spacetime/" rel="tag">spacetime</a>.
</p><p>The theory was motivated by Professor Oppenheim's attempt to resolve the black hole information problem. According to standard <a href="https://phys.org/tags/quantum+theory/" rel="tag">quantum theory</a>, an object going into a black hole should be radiated back out in some way as information cannot be destroyed, but this violates <a href="https://phys.org/tags/general+relativity/" rel="tag">general relativity</a>, which says you can never know about objects that cross the black hole's event horizon. The new <a href="https://phys.org/tags/theory/" rel="tag">theory</a> allows for information to be destroyed, due to a fundamental breakdown in predictability.

After a two-year delay and negotiations over its rollout, the company adopted a novel but cost-effective plan to bring ultrafast internet speeds to Kentucky’s largest city. This February, only 16 months after it turned on its service, Google Fiber announced plans to turn it off, making Louisville, one of only 19 cities to get Google Fiber since its launch in 2010, the first to lose it. Now, the most visible sign of the tech giant’s screw up is lying all over the roads.</p><p>“I literally just got done driving around, looking at streets with Google,” said Metro Councilman Brandon Coan. Strands of errant sealant are “everywhere,” he said outside a coffee shop in his district, one of a few where Google Fiber ran lines before its abrupt departure. “I’m confident that Google and the city are going to negotiate a deal … to restore the roads to as good a condition as they were when they got here. Frankly, I think they owe us more than that.”</p><p>The damage goes deeper than the roads. In Louisville, a minor league city with major league ambitions<strong>,</strong> Google Fiber left behind disappointed consumers, unfulfilled promises of transformative economic development, and a slew of embarrassing headlines for a city that allowed the tech giant to use it as a guinea pig.<br></p><p>But Google Fiber got something out of its time here. It learned that nanotrenching—the cost-saving process of burying fiber optic cables just two inches underground—was a bust. “We currently do not have plans that call for 2 inch trenches, our primary specifications are focused on going deeper,” a Google Fiber spokesperson said in an email.</p><p>“It is such a shame to think that we wouldn’t be having any of this conversation if they would have dug their little holes two inches deeper,” Coan said.</p><hr><p>In October 2017, when Google Fiber started signing up customers in three Louisville neighborhoods, the ISP was a year removed from a “pause” that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://money.cnn.com/2016/10/26/technology/google-fiber-cuts/index.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://money.cnn.com/2016/10/26/technology/google-fiber-cuts/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">saw its CEO resign and more than 100 employees laid off</a></span>. Turns out, disrupting the telecom industry is wildly expensive, full of intractable regulatory challenges, and opposed by powerful incumbent companies.<br></p><p>The plan in Louisville was to revive the effort with what some were calling <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.techrepublic.com/article/google-fiber-2-0-targets-the-city-where-it-will-stage-its-comeback-as-at-t-fiber-prepares-to-go/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/google-fiber-2-0-targets-the-city-where-it-will-stage-its-comeback-as-at-t-fiber-prepares-to-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Fiber 2.0</a></span>. But first, the city had to agree to one major stipulation: Google Fiber wanted to see if it could scale a method for installing fiber cables that was easier to implement, and easier on the bottom line, than hanging lines from utility poles.</p><p>The company had buried fiber lines in other cities, but in Louisville it wanted to go shallower. Nanotrenching called for burying cables just two inches underground, rather than the typical six inches. The company also wanted to cover the trenches with epoxy, rather than the typical asphalt mix. In an email, a Google Fiber spokesperson said the company had “already performed limited trials of two-inch trenches in other markets, and believed it was a promising new method of deployment.” In Louisville, Google Fiber wanted to see if two-inch trenches would work at scale, an attempt that the spokesperson described as “ambitious” and a “lean into innovation.”</p><p>Local leaders were concerned. The city sent a team to other cities where a company spokesperson said<strong> </strong>“limited trials” with two-inch trenches had been conducted, and it sought the advice of outside experts.</p><p>“What [Google Fiber] told Louisville was that they didn’t think they could make their traditional construction work, but would we be open to letting them use a new construction technique,” said Grace Simrall, Louisville’s Chief of Civic Innovation and Technology. “There were lots of aspects that we asked a lot of questions about, trying to make them aware that we thought this might have challenges, but they, having done parts of Nashville and San Antonio this way, told us they felt confident they could make this work.”</p><p>After years of trying to woo Google—an effort that included <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.courier-journal.com/story/money/companies/2019/02/08/google-fiber-makes-louisville-pay-the-price-with-exit/2813479002/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/money/companies/2019/02/08/google-fiber-makes-louisville-pay-the-price-with-exit/2813479002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spending around $400,000 on legal fees</a></span> to defend an ultimately unused city ordinance that made it easier for Google Fiber to use utility poles—Louisville was in no position to say no.</p><p>Ted Smith, Simrall’s predecessor in City Hall, began working to make the city more “fiber friendly” in 2011 and credited three-term Mayor Greg Fischer, a Democrat, with recognizing that “mid-sized American cities were getting left behind.”<strong> </strong>(Disclosure: My wife is a Democratic State Representative from a part of Louisville that did not receive Google Fiber.)</p><p>“We worked very hard for many years to make the case that Louisville was a city that understands the value of cost-effective high-speed broadband,” he said.</p><p>It’s little surprise then that Louisville agreed to let Google futz around with its roads.

By March of 2018, just five months after Google Fiber launched its nanotrenching trial, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wdrb.com/news/belknap-neighborhood-residents-concerned-over-sloppy-installation-of-high-speed/article_4bc2a61e-8640-57f0-aba9-3dd4cb3d39e5.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wdrb.com/news/belknap-neighborhood-residents-concerned-over-sloppy-installation-of-high-speed/article_4bc2a61e-8640-57f0-aba9-3dd4cb3d39e5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the method began to fail</a></span>. Not only was the sealant spilling out onto roads, leaving fiber lines exposed, but the shallow trenches left cables vulnerable during routine road maintenance.</p><p>“If anyone understood road technology or tire technology, [they] would know it’s going to be a problem,” said Jim Hayes, president of the Fiber Optics Association and a decades-long veteran of the industry. <br></p><p>The problem, Hayes said, is that tires easily grabbed the epoxy and ripped it out of the ground. The shorter trench walls also left less asphalt for the sealant to adhere to. Typical microtrenching, a “well-accepted method of installing fiber,” involves burying cables at least six inches deep with a groove that’s no more than an inch wide, Hayes said. “I’ve never heard of any problems with microtrenching.”</p><p>Last summer Google Fiber pitched a solution to the problem it created. It would rip out the epoxy and fill in the trenches with asphalt. “It was like, ‘Oh, in retrospect, that seems like an obvious way to fill the hole in the road,’” Coan said.</p><p>“They bid out the work to replace the sealant with asphalt,” Simrall said. But before the work started, Google Fiber saw customers lose service when the process of repaving roads damaged fiber lines. “So they shifted their attention to addressing that,” she said.</p><p>Then, last month, Google Fiber threw up its hands and quit. The company wouldn’t say how many customers it had at that point, only that the number was “very small” compared to other Fiber cities. Last summer, the local Fox TV affiliate found that the company <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wdrb.com/news/business/sunday-edition-where-is-google-fiber-mostly-in-the-highlands/article_569112e0-421e-58ef-be24-c2e42e5e53d2.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wdrb.com/news/business/sunday-edition-where-is-google-fiber-mostly-in-the-highlands/article_569112e0-421e-58ef-be24-c2e42e5e53d2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had pulled permits to wire areas covering about 11,000 households</a></span>, but it’s not clear how many installations were completed.</p><p>In a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://fiber.googleblog.com/2019/02/louisville_7.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://fiber.googleblog.com/2019/02/louisville_7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a></span>, Google Fiber explained what happened. “[T]rialing” a “different type of construction method” in Louisville had failed, it said. Fixing it would be too expensive, so instead, it was skipping town, and taking the lessons learned elsewhere.</p><p>“This was not an easy decision for us,” a Google Fiber spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “We came to Louisville because Google Fiber is working to change an entrenched industry and we saw a chance to bring great service to Louisville’s residents. Naturally there will be unexpected challenges when you do something ambitious, and at scale, for the first time and we underestimated some of those hurdles. We couldn’t be more appreciative of the partnership we’ve had with the City of Louisville, which embraced the need for competition in this industry as part of its larger initiatives around innovation and emerging technology.”</p><p>Simrall insists that Google Fiber was “very sincere in their belief they could make it work,” and had planned to use two-inch trenches in all other Google Fiber cities if it did. That’s little consolation to many Louisvillians, who watched one of the world’s richest companies sweep into town with major fanfare, rip up the roads to test an unproven technique, and peace out when it bombed.</p><p>“I was shocked. I was disappointed,” said Candace Jaworski, president of the Louisville Digital Association, a non-profit that pushes for innovation in Louisville and campaigned to bring Google Fiber here. Jaworski was looking forward to one day becoming a Google Fiber customer and seeing the change broadband could deliver to Portland, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2016/11/29/study-louisville-neighborhoods-among-poorest/94541828/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2016/11/29/study-louisville-neighborhoods-among-poorest/94541828/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the country’s poorest neighborhoods</a></span> and one of the first where Google Fiber was available.</p><p>“Google Fiber getting in and getting folks into the internet out in the West End was going to be huge with catching up that part of town with the rest,” Jaworski said. “Talk about dangling a carrot and not ever being able to get it.”</p><p>Ben Carter was lucky enough to get bite of that carrot. An attorney in the Highlands, Carter said Google Fiber provided wildly fast internet and “rock solid” customer service for the time he had it. When he got the news that Google Fiber was ending its operations in Louisville, he was disappointed, and not just because he would lose the blazing internet speed that he enjoyed primarily for its “Tim Allen, way-more-power-than-you-need” quality.</p><p>“It seemed like Louisville was batting above its weight a bit in terms of what cities were getting Google Fiber,” he said of the “coup” that the city pulled off in landing Google Fiber. “Louisville isn’t often on those lists.”</p><p>Now that Google Fiber is gone, Councilman Coan is worried that Louisville’s reputation will take a hit. “If you’re not paying attention, you’d say, ‘Oh, well. Louisville is just not a good enough city for Google Fiber.’ That’s not true.”</p><p>In the end, it may be that Google Fiber was not good enough for Louisville. Alphabet seems to be scaling back the ambitions of Google Fiber as wireless broadband technology advances and the limitations of fighting entrenched telecom giants become clear, said Matt Wood, the vice president of policy at broadband advocacy group Free Press. Its experimentation in Louisville is evidence enough that Google Fiber was looking for a new way forward.

<p>Farmland often harbors a multitude of pathogens which attack plants and reduce yields. A Swiss research team has now shown that inoculating the soil with mycorrhizal fungi can help maintain or even improve yields without using additional fertilizers or pesticides. In a large-scale field trial, plant yield increased by up to 40%.

										  
											        </p>
										 
										 											  
<p>Intensive use of fertilizers and pesticides on fields reduces biodiversity and pollutes the environment. There is, therefore, great interest in finding sustainable ways to protect yields without using agricultural chemicals. One example of alternative biologicals is mycorrhizal fungi, which are beneficial organisms that help plants acquire nutrients.
</p><h2>Yields improved by up to 40%</h2>
<p>A team of researchers from the universities of Zurich and Basel, Agroscope, and the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL) has now shown for the first time on a large scale that applying mycorrhizal fungi in the field works. The fungi were mixed into the soil before sowing crops on 800 trial plots at 54 maize farms in northern and eastern Switzerland.
</p><p>"On a quarter of the plots, the mycorrhizal fungi enabled up to 40% better yields. That's huge," says the study's co-lead, Marcel van der Heijden, a soil ecologist at the University of Zurich and at Asgroscope. But there's a catch: on a third of the plots, the yield did not increase and sometimes even decreased. The research team was initially unable to explain why this happened.
</p><h2>Pathogens in the soil</h2>
<p>In their search for the cause, the researchers analyzed a variety of chemical, physical, and biological soil properties, including the biodiversity of soil microbes. "We discovered that the inoculation functioned best when there were lots of fungal pathogens already in the soil," says co-first author Stefanie Lutz from Agroscope, the federal center of competence for Agricultural Research.
</p><p>"The mycorrhizal fungi act as a kind of protective shield against pathogens in the soil that would weaken the plants." As a result, the normal yield can be maintained in fields where, without mycorrhizal fungi, there would have been losses. In contrast, mycorrhizal fungi had only a minor effect on fields that were not contaminated with pathogens.
</p><p>"The plants there are strong anyway and grow excellently. The use of <a href="https://phys.org/tags/mycorrhizal+fungi/" rel="tag">mycorrhizal fungi</a> in such cases brings no additional benefits," says the other first author, Natacha Bodenhausen from the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture.
</p><p>The aim of the study was to be able to predict the conditions under which mycorrhizal inoculation works.
</p><p>"With just a few soil indicators—mainly <a href="https://phys.org/tags/soil/" rel="tag">soil</a> fungi—we were able to predict the success of inoculation in nine out of 10 fields, and thus could also predict the harvest yield even before the field season," says the study's co-lead Klaus Schläppi of the University of Basel. "This predictability makes it possible to target the use of the fungi in fields where they will work. That's a <a href="https://phys.org/tags/crucial+element/" rel="tag">crucial element</a> for developing these technologies into a reliable agricultural method," says Schläppi.
</p><p>Further research is still required to find out the easiest way to spread the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/fungi/" rel="tag">fungi</a> over large areas. Nevertheless, "the results of this field trial represent a big step toward a more sustainable agriculture," concludes Marcel van der Heijden.

<p>Before we get into it, I want to address some folks who read my last post and were upset that WOTC doesn't obfuscate their client-side code. I actually think it is really rad that they don't! <em>Very</em> motivated folks (read: people who make paid cheats, botters who sell accounts, etc) will always find ways to deobfuscate and analyze client logic they are interested in anyway. All the obfuscation does is raise the barrier to entry in order keep out less invested folks, which means less hacks overall, sure, but it also means less bored nerds like me who just want to poke at something on the weekend. These bored nerds are the sorts of people who report vulnerabilities that they find! You want these people looking at your game! This is my opinion for most games, but <em>especially</em> card games, because the client does even less than usual.</p>
<p>Card games are usually pretty tough targets for game hacks because they are turn based, and not a lot of information needs to move between the client and the server. This means that card games are excellent candidates for being 100% server-side authoritative, meaning that the server keeps track of the entire game state and only tells the client what it needs to know.</p>
<p>Unlike a fast-paced shooter where the opponent team's models may need to be loaded before you can see them (allowing for wallhacks), or computationally heavy routines like player movement may be offloaded to the client to save resources (allowing for speedhacks), card games are relatively chill in terms of resource consumption and the information boundaries are concrete. All a player can do is play cards and read the board state, and the server tells the player what they can do and when.</p>
<p>This means the client will do very little work itself and it will only be given information about unrevealed cards as the cards are played (by an opponent) or drawn (by you). Unrevealed information such as an opponent's hand or the decks never exists locally so they cannot be read. You can't shuffle the deck in a specific order, or change what card you draw. The server just performs these verbs for you and tells you the result. This in stark contrast to something like a first-person shooter, where a player has a lot of verbs and agency available to them at all time. That results in abuses like this:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our MW2 cheat is now done and we're currently in closed testing. This means our cheat will be ready when the game launches, with all the features you'd expect.<br>Once the game is launched you'll be able to get our cheat at a discounted price for a limited time, don't miss it! <a href="https://t.co/65N4T0ieFl">pic.twitter.com/65N4T0ieFl</a></p>— EngineOwning.to (@engineowningto) <a href="https://twitter.com/engineowningto/status/1574143483392446464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2022</a></blockquote> 
<p>In this first-person shooter hack, all that revealed information is already stored and cached within the client - the hack just draws it to screen. Because of the fast-paced and dynamic nature of the game, this information must be available client-side before a player gains line-of-sight to an enemy or object. Otherwise, all of the enemy or object data would have to be sent over the wire realtime at the moment line-of-sight is gained and rendered (and then immediately deleted after line of sight is broken).</p>
<p>Performance and latency issues get in the way of that. <em>For now</em>, at least. Check out Riot's anti-wallhack blog <a href="https://technology.riotgames.com/news/demolishing-wallhacks-valorants-fog-war">HERE</a> about how they minimized client-side player position data. They are making gains in this realm.</p>
<p>So yeah. In something like a card game, since the actions a player can take are limited and happen at a set time, the client does not need to store data before it is needed. This also makes the logic to detect invalid actions, like playing a card that is not in your hand or out of turn much easier to implement. I think that's part of the reasong why you don't see a big cheating ecosystem around card games the way you do around FPSes. That doesn't mean that bugs don't exist still though! So let's explore one.</p>
<h2>Where to start</h2>
<p>For a card game, I thought that the best course of action was to take a look at the network communication. This is a good rule of thumb for game hacking in general - my favorite defcon talk is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAUf_ygqsDo">just 45 minutes of MMO hacking war stories</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/_EBFE">Manfred</a>. It is really worth a watch. You will see that the root of all the analysis he performs to find all these bugs comes down to reversing the network protocol. He has custom tooling built that hooks whatever function send/recieves messages after they have been decrypted (if there's encryption) and displays the traffic in some sort of hex viewer UI. It also seems like it has the ability to edit the requests before they are sent to the server or interpreted by the client, and replay messages.</p>
<p>Since MTGA is written in C#, the nice thing is that we don't need to do all the fancy stuff he does of hooking the ingress and egress of traffic. Instead, we can very easily manipulate in-game objects at runtime using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/reflection-and-codedom/reflection">reflection</a>, including accessing private fields and methods. <a href="https://www.mayer.cool/writings/Unity-Hacking-101-Hacking-with-Reflection/">I have a basic tutorial on how to do this if you are curious</a>. All I needed to do was find the client code and start taking a look. From there I could fiddle with the client at runtime as needed.</p>
<h2>A lead</h2>
<p>Looking at decompiled C# is also really nice because it utilizes <a href="https://jorudolph.wordpress.com/2010/08/03/net-metadata-tokens/">metadata tokens</a> to associate elements of the compiled code with their human-readable names, which are still stored in the compiled .NET assembly. That means I can see all the function, variable, and class names that the developers wrote when they wrote their code. It turns the decompilation of non-obfuscated .NET assemblies into essentially source code review!</p>
<p>So I started searching for functions I would associate with joining a match, as that is where I would expect a lot of the client initialization for a specific game against an opponent to begin. Lo and behold, there was a <code>JoinMatch</code> function!</p>
<p>This function was quite long (over 200 lines long), and a lot of it was just dealing with the player metadata, like rank, cosmetics, etc. Down at the bottom though, I got what I was looking for:</p>
<pre><code>private void JoinMatch(NewMatchCreatedConfig matchConfig)
{
    ...
    this._matchManager.ConnectAndJoinMatch(connectionConfig, matchConfig.controllerFabricUri, matchConfig.matchId);
    if (matchConfig.matchType == MatchType.NPE)
    {
        this._npeState.NewNPEOpponent(connectionConfig.MatchDoorHost, connectionConfig.MatchDoorPort, matchConfig.controllerFabricUri, matchConfig.matchId, this._matchManager, this._assetLookupSystem);
        return;
    }
    if (matchConfig.matchType == MatchType.Familiar)
    {
        this._botTool.NewBotOpponent(connectionConfig.MatchDoorHost, connectionConfig.MatchDoorPort, matchConfig.controllerFabricUri, matchConfig.matchId, !flag3, this._cardDatabase, this._accountInformation, this._matchManager, this._assetLookupSystem);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>A function named <code>ConnectAndJoinMatch</code> that takes in our match configuration information. Nice. That is likely where our game connects to the match for the first time! ...But that's not all that is there. There are two other checks <em>after</em> we connect to the game server. Do you know what those are?</p>
<p>They are Sparky!</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with MTGA, Sparky is sort of MTGA's mascot. Embodied as a small wisp of light, Sparky guides new players through the tutorial and are always available to practice new decks against. Essentially, its a cute dressing up of the tutorial and bot match features of MTGA.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mayer.cool/writings/I-Hacked-Magic-the-Gathering/Sparky.jpg" alt="Sparky"></p>
<p>Adorable.</p>
<p>Well, I got totally side-tracked by this. Sparky is implemented in a pretty interesting way. As you can see there, if the match type is either <code>NPE</code> (which I assume stands for "New Player Experience") or <code>Familiar</code> (a standard bot match), other functions are called, which seem to take in a lot of the same information as the function to join a match as a player. Why would that be the case? Because under the hood, any time you play a bot in MTGA, the bot logic runs locally on your machine! It just also connects to the same match server as you, but all the decision-making process for what it is playing runs inside your game running on your computer.</p>
<p>I was totally surprised by this, because it means that a (mostly) fully-functioning bot capable of playing arbitrary games of Magic: The Gathering has a small enough footprint to run locally on your machine. I would have thought that a game as complex as MTG would require a lot of overhead in terms of creating an AI opponent. But nope! You can actually check out all of the logic for Sparky, including a few places in the debug UI where WOTC developers reached a corner case that they felt was not worth implementing. I don't blame them - MTG is a beast of a game to try to have full coverage for!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mayer.cool/writings/I-Hacked-Magic-the-Gathering/corner1.png" alt="Corner Case 1"></p>
<p>Here's my personal favorite, it is reminiscent of the leaked <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k238XpMMn38">Valve</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9uvdTHYNHk">Yandex</a> source code comments:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mayer.cool/writings/I-Hacked-Magic-the-Gathering/corner2.png" alt="Corner Case 2"></p>
<p>Don't worry anonymous WOTC developer - we've all been there.</p>
<h2>The devil's in the implementation (details)</h2>
<p>Let's take a closer look at what exactly happens when you start a bot match:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mayer.cool/writings/I-Hacked-Magic-the-Gathering/jwt.png" alt="JWT"></p>
<p>There's a lot of code here that you don't have to worry about. But check out the highlighted portion. The actual logic handler for the bot is housed inside of a class called <code>HeadlessClient</code>. That class is, well, a headless client. The bot doesn't need to render a game board or anything, so it just connects to a game server and plays the game in its brain, like a Magic: The Gathering <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmXwdoRG43U">Magnuss Carlsen</a>.</p>
<p>Since the headless client is also spawned from your game, it uses the same user credentials to authenticate to the game server - in this case a user ID called <code>PersonaID</code> and a <a href="https://jwt.io/">JSON web token</a> that is granted to your game after you successfully log in. Standard web authenication.</p>
<p>To me that was interesting though, because it means that the game servers don't see anything wrong with the same client essentially connecting to both sides of a match.</p>
<p>Were bot match game servers unique in this regard? I doubted that they were. If that were the case, I didn't think that WOTC would have implemented the bot logic client-side. To me one of the benefits of offloading the bot client is that all game servers can run exactly the same and the clients will worry about connecting, filling the appropriate seats, and interfacing with the server properly.</p>
<p>I mean "seat" literally too! That's how the game keeps track of which player you are, since the credentials are the same for a bot match:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mayer.cool/writings/I-Hacked-Magic-the-Gathering/seatid.png" alt="SeatID"></p>
<h2>Match takeovers!</h2>
<p>So, as we know from <a href="https://www.mayer.cool/writings/Unity-Hacking-101-Hacking-with-Reflection/">my tutorial on using reflection to hack unity games</a>, we can use game objects to our own ends and alter their behavior. So to test if I could connect to both sides of a <em>regular</em> match, instead of a bot match, I could use a lot of the game logic already written for the bot and matchmaking! I just had to make my own headless client, determine what seat in the game I was, and then connect the client to the other seat. The code I came up with can be found in Appendix A right below this section.</p>
<p>Most of the is just accessing in-game memory objects to get all the information needed to know what game I am currently connected to in matchmaking. I then use that information to connect the bot to the game. Once I have all the info, the code figures out the opponent's seat based off of my own, creates and connects the bot, and as some added spice, immediately makes the bot concede.</p>
<p>Lo and behold, this worked! Even if the opponent had already connected and we are in the middle of a game, which is what you see in the video. As you can also see, I got rewards as if I beat a human opponent, because this was a matchmaking game:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey <a href="https://twitter.com/MTG_Arena?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MTG_Arena</a> I figured out how to make an opponent auto-concede the game. Let me know how you'd like me to report the issue and I will send over the source + an explanation of how it can be mitigated. Thank you! <a href="https://t.co/dWMdkKjOA2">pic.twitter.com/dWMdkKjOA2</a></p>— Daniel Mayer (@dan__mayer) <a href="https://twitter.com/dan__mayer/status/1641669864460009472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 31, 2023</a></blockquote> 
<p>I hope you have a little bit more respect for Sparky now. You can check out the code below if you are interested, but the servers have now been patched to make sure both seats don't have the same account and JWT for matchmaking games.</p>

<p dir="auto">Maelstrom is a workbench for learning distributed systems by writing your own.
It uses the <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/jepsen">Jepsen</a> testing library to
test toy implementations of distributed systems. Maelstrom provides
standardized tests for things like "a commutative set" or "a transactional
key-value store", and lets you learn by writing implementations which those
test suites can exercise. It's used as a part of a distributed systems workshop
by <a href="https://jepsen.io/training" rel="nofollow">Jepsen</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Maelstrom provides a <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/doc/workloads.md">range of tests</a> for different kinds of
distributed systems, built on top of a <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/doc/protocol.md">simple JSON
protocol</a> via STDIN and STDOUT. Users write servers <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/demo">in any
language</a>. Maelstrom runs those servers, sends them requests, routes
messages via a simulated network, and checks that clients observe expected
behavior. You want to write Plumtree in Bash? Byzantine Paxos in Intercal?
Maelstrom is for you.</p>
<p dir="auto">Maelstrom's tooling lets users experiment with <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/doc/03-broadcast/02-performance.md">simulated
latency</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/doc/04-crdts/01-g-set.md#a-simple-g-set">message
loss</a>. Every test includes <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/doc/05-datomic/not-concurrent.png">timeline
visualizations</a> of concurrency structure,
<a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/doc/03-broadcast/02-performance.md#how-many-messages">statistics</a> on messages
exchanged, <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/doc/06-raft/final.png">timeseries graphs</a> to understand how
latency, availability, and throughput respond to changing conditions, and
<a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/doc/05-datomic/missing-value.png">Lamport diagrams</a> so you can understand
exactly how messages flow through your system. Maelstrom's checkers can verify
<a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/elle">sophisticated safety properties</a> up to
strict serializability, and generate <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/doc/05-datomic/g1-realtime.svg">intuitive, minimal
examples</a> of consistency anomalies.</p>
<p dir="auto">Maelstrom can help you model how a system responds to different cluster sizes,
network topologies, latency distributions, and faults like network partitions.
Maelstrom also offers <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/doc/services.md">simulated services</a> that you can use
to build more complex systems.</p>
<p dir="auto">It's built for testing toy systems, but don't let that fool you: Maelstrom is
reasonably fast and can handle simulated clusters of 25+ nodes. On a 48-way
Xeon, it can use 94% of all cores, pushing upwards of 60,000 network
messages/sec.</p>

cases, and difficult to debug across languages. In addition, running a full
cluster of virtual machines connected by a real IP network is tricky for many
users. Maelstrom strips these problems away so you can focus on the algorithmic
essentials: process state, transitions, and messages.</p>
<p dir="auto">The "nodes" in a Maelstrom test are plain old binaries written in any language.
Nodes read "network" messages as JSON from STDIN, write JSON "network" messages
to STDOUT, and do their logging to STDERR. Maelstrom runs those nodes as
processes on your local machine, and connects them via a simulated network.
Maelstrom runs a collection of simulated network clients which make requests to
those nodes, receive responses, and records a history of those operations. At
the end of a test run, Maelstrom analyzes that history to identify safety
violations.</p>
<p dir="auto">This allows learners to write their nodes in whatever language they are most
comfortable with, without having to worry about discovery, network
communication, daemonization, writing their own distributed test harness, and
so on. It also means that Maelstrom can perform sophisticated fault injection
and trace analysis.</p>
<p dir="auto">Maelstrom starts in <code>maelstrom.core</code>, which parses CLI operations and
constructs a test map. It hands that off to Jepsen, which sets up the servers
and Maelstrom services via <code>maelstrom.db</code>. Spawning binaries and handling their
IO is done in <code>maelstrom.process</code>, and Maelstrom's internal services (e.g.
<code>lin-kv</code> are defined in <code>maelstrom.service</code>. Jepsen then spawns clients
depending on the workload (<code>maelstrom.workload.*</code>) and a nemesis
(<code>maelstrom.nemesis</code>) to inject faults.</p>
<p dir="auto">Messages between nodes are routed by <code>maelstrom.net</code>, and logged in
<code>maelstrom.journal</code>. Clients send requests and parse responses via
<code>maelstrom.client</code>, which also defines Maelstrom's RPC protocol.</p>
<p dir="auto">At the end of the test, Jepsen checks the history using a checker built in
<code>maelstrom.core</code>: workload-specific checkers are defined in their respective
workload namespaces. Network statistics are computed in
<code>maelstrom.net.journal</code>, and Lamport diagrams are generated by
<code>maelstrom.net.viz</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>maelstrom.doc</code> helps generate documentation based on <code>maelstrom.client</code>'s
registry of RPC types and workloads.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">CLI Options</h2>
<p dir="auto">A full list of options is available by running <code>java -jar maelstrom.jar test --help</code>. The important ones are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>--workload NAME</code>: What kind of workload should be run?</li>
<li><code>--bin SOME_BINARY</code>: The program you'd like Maelstrom to spawn instances of</li>
<li><code>--node-count NODE-NAME</code>: How many instances of the binary should be spawned?</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">To get more information, use:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>--log-stderr</code>: Show STDERR output from each node in the Maelstrom log</li>
<li><code>--log-net-send</code>: Log messages as they are sent into the network</li>
<li><code>--log-net-recv</code>: Log messages as they are received by nodes</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">To make tests more or less aggressive, use:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>--time-limit SECONDS</code>: How long to run tests for</li>
<li><code>--rate FLOAT</code>: Approximate number of requests per second</li>
<li><code>--concurrency INT</code>: Number of clients to run concurrently. Use <code>4n</code> for 4 times the number of nodes.</li>
<li><code>--latency MILLIS</code>: Approximate simulated network latency, during normal
operations.</li>
<li><code>--latency-dist DIST</code>: What latency distribution should Maelstrom use?</li>
<li><code>--nemesis FAULT_TYPE</code>: A comma-separated list of faults to inject</li>
<li><code>--nemesis-interval SECONDS</code>: How long between nemesis operations, on average</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">For broadcast tests, try</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>--topology TYPE</code>: Controls the shape of the network topology Jepsen offers
to nodes</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">For transactional tests, you can control transaction generation using</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>--max-txn-length INT</code>: The maximum number of operations per transaction</li>
<li><code>--key-count INT</code>: The number of concurrent keys to work with</li>
<li><code>--max-writes-per-key INT</code>: How many unique write operations to generate per key.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">SSH options are unused; Maelstrom runs entirely on the local node.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Running ./maelstrom complains it's missing maelstrom.jar</h3>
<p dir="auto">You probably cloned this repository or downloaded the source and didn't compile
it. Download the compiled release tarball instead; you'll find it on the GitHub
release page.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to run directly from source, you'll need the
<a href="https://leiningen.org/" rel="nofollow">Leiningen</a> build system. Instead of <code>./maelstrom ...</code>, run <code>lein run ...</code>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Raft node processes still alive after maelstrom run</h3>
<p dir="auto">You may find that node processes maelstrom starts are not terminating at the end of a run as expected. To address this, make sure that if the process passed as <code>--bin</code> forks off a new process, it also handles the process' termination.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Example</h4>
<p dir="auto">In <code>bin/raft</code></p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="#!/bin/bash

# Forks a new process.
java -jar target/raft.jar"><pre><span><span>#!</span>/bin/bash</span>

<p>Throughout the history of video games, there have been titles that permanently shifted the industry. These games are generally not hard to spot, as their influence quickly earned them a place in our pop culture. Tetris, Super Mario 64, Halo, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, or The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, each of these games caused massive shifts in their respective genres and gaming as a whole. But for each of these, there are also games whose influence, though significant, is largely forgotten. Did you know that almost every 3rd-person cover shooter mechanic originated in the Nintendo 64 game WinBack? How about that one of the first games to feature modern first-person-shooter controls was Alien Resurrection on the original Playstation? Or how about the fact that every 3D game Nintendo has ever made, can trace its roots back to a Game Boy demo developed by a teenager in the UK?</p>

<p>In 1992 Nintendo published a Game Boy game called X. It was based on a demo called Eclipse that was programmed by a young man named Dylan Cuthbert. It would go on to form the basis of the Super Nintendo game, Star Fox. From there Shigeru Miyamoto would begin experimenting with 3D for Mario and Zelda, leading to Super Mario 64 and the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Despite its limited, Japan exclusive release, X is generally considered to be one of the most important games ever made. And all of that came from a single, mysterious demo that until now, has remained lost to time.<img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://gamehistory.org/eclipse-the-demo-that-sold-3d-to-nintendo/images/image3.jpg"></p>



<p>My name is John Rairdin, I’m the director of NintendoWorldReport.com, and a few months ago I produced a documentary in cooperation with the Video Game History Foundation called A Legacy in 3D: The Story of Star Fox, and had the honor of showing the world Dylan Cuthbert’s Eclipse demo for the first time.</p>

<p>The story of Eclipse begins at Argonaut Software in Edgware, a suburban town in north London. This was a studio run in large part by teenagers and led by a man named Jez San. Argonaut’s specialty was in 3D games for the home computers of the time. Games like Starglider and its sequel wowed players with smooth wireframe, and later fully polygonal, flight combat. Dylan Cuthbert was hired as a programmer at Argonaut at the age of 17.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image7-1024x576.jpg" alt="" title="" srcset="https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image7-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image7-300x169.jpg 300w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image7-740x416.jpg 740w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image7-768x432.jpg 768w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image7-50x28.jpg 50w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image7-1600x900.jpg 1600w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image7-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image7-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image7-1980x1114.jpg 1980w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image7.jpg 1999w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p><em>“It was really just after I started at Argonaut, maybe four months after four or five months after I started at Argonaut… and Jez said, Oh, there’s this thing called Game Boy that’s just been launched in, you know, in the West. And I said, ‘Oh, what’s that?’ And he brought one back.”</em></p>



<p>One of Cuthbert’s particular talents among the Argonaut team was his experience programming for 8-bit machines.</p>



<p><em>“I’d learned to program in Z80 on the ZX81 and the Sinclair Spectrum. And of course the Game Boy was a Z80 variant. And he wanted someone who had actually had experience in that CPU.”</em></p>



<p>This experience made Cuthbert the perfect pick for Jez San’s ambitions for the Game Boy.</p>



<p><em>“At Argonaut, I think Jez especially kind of prided himself on the fact that he could make 3D run on anything. And when he saw the Game Boy, I think he saw the chance of proving that 3D could run on it. Because obviously it was a 2D machine. No one had even thought of doing 3D on it. But we thought, okay let’s try and do it.”</em></p>



<p>And so, one of Cuthberts first projects at Argonaut would be the seemingly impossible task of developing a 3D engine for the 8-bit, monochrome Game Boy. A bit of an imposing job on its own, but 3D wasn’t the only hurdle. Argonaut also didn’t have an official Game Boy dev kit. A dev kit is a special variant of a piece of hardware built to allow developers access to programming for a game system that wouldn’t normally be available on a retail model. Instead they’d need to get creative with a Game Boy from straight off the store shelf.</p>



<p><em>“We didn’t have a Game Boy dev kit and so we were hacking it… I think we took a Tetris or Mario cartridge and we took the top off and then we were wiring the address buses and stuff to go to our Amiga system instead of the actual ROM itself. So then we could just replace the data that was actually in the ROM with our data… We had like a little security camera pointed at the Game Boy screen that was then put on a little TV so we could actually see what we were doing. The screen is pretty small and working on that every day was actually quite tiring on the eyes. So it was a very seat of the pants kind of affair… We started working on it, immediately hacking it and developing a 3D engine for it.”</em></p>



<p>While Cuthbert was able to leverage the knowledge base of Argonaut to hack the Game Boy and open the doors for their new engine, programming it, and coming up with a game would be entirely up to him alone.</p>



<p><em>“So it was basically me, that’s it. [laughs] Just me. And then I got a few 3D, we called them shapes back then, to use to test my system with. And then I did all the 2D art and pretty much everything else in the game as well. And some of the 3D stuff was done by me as well. But the cooler shapes are done by a guy called Danny Emmett, who worked at Argonaut at the time.</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image9-1024x576.jpg" alt="" title="" srcset="https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image9-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image9-740x416.jpg 740w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image9-768x432.jpg 768w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image9-50x28.jpg 50w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image9-1600x900.jpg 1600w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image9-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image9-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image9-1980x1114.jpg 1980w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image9.jpg 1999w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p><em>Initially when I was making the game, I just pulled upon all the games that I liked at the time. And so one of those would have been Ball Blazer. One of them would be Starglider, obviously. And the other one was a bit more of an obscure game for the ZX Spectrum called Micronaut One, which is a game where you fly through tunnels. I’d always been kind of interested in trying to kind of replicate that kind of thing into a game, at least as sort of a sub-part of the game. So I was experimenting with that and trying to get it to work and I got it to work and it was kind of cool. So we included all that into the overall game… The mission structure kind of comes from F18 Interceptor on the Amiga, which is a really cool kind of fighter flight simulator kind of game… it was like the idea of having like this game where you have these very individual missions that are very different to each other, kind of comes from that particular game”</em></p>



<p>It’s here that I think it’s worth taking a moment to look at what Eclipse actually is in comparison to X, the game it would eventually become. At its core Eclipse is a combo of two different primary gameplay loops. One is a first person tank game. Players are dropped into a three dimensional environment and given an objective to destroy a certain number of enemies while hunting down a certain number of crystals. These crystals would then need to be returned to the base. The entire time players would be burning through precious fuel which, along with missiles and shields, could be replenished by selling off one of those valuable crystals. Once the objectives are completed the player moves on to the next stage, though the state of their tank is carried over.</p>



<p>Between stages the player would fly through a 3D tunnel segment, racing against a time limit. The goal is to move as quickly as possible while dodging obstacles that will stop you dead in your tracks. Make it to the end before the time runs out and you move on to the next combat mission, fail and its game over. These tunnel segments could also be played separately from the demo’s main menu.&nbsp;<img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://gamehistory.org/eclipse-the-demo-that-sold-3d-to-nintendo/images/image5.jpg"></p>



<p>The final game maintains this general flow, exploring the surface completing mission objectives, then flying through tunnels on your way to the next level. However, while the final game’s missions are obviously more diverse than those present in this demo, it does somewhat lose the risk reward system of using the very same crystals necessary to complete missions to repair your ship. Rather, in X your objectives and your currency never overlap.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image1-1024x576.jpg" alt="" title="" srcset="https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image1-740x416.jpg 740w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image1-50x28.jpg 50w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image1-1600x900.jpg 1600w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image1-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image1-1980x1114.jpg 1980w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image1.jpg 1999w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Finally the ROM also contains an object viewer, allowing the player to freely rotate and scale the fully 3D objects used by the game. When played in emulation and blown up on a modern display the objects may look somewhat crude in this low resolution window, but on the Gameboy screen, they were like nothing a Nintendo console, let alone handheld, had ever displayed before.</p>



<p>The demo was then sent out by Argonaut founder Jez San to various publishers to see if they’d be interested in developing the demo into a full game. The demo was initially picked up by Mindscape who already had some experience publishing and developing on the Gameboy with titles like Paperboy, Marble Madness, and Gauntlet II. It is at this point, with Mindscape signing on to produce Eclipse, that our story splits off in two directions. While Nintendo would of course eventually wind up producing Eclipse into a full game. Mindscape’s time with the game would see the demo into the hands of a producer named Mark Flitman. And it would be Mark’s daughter Michelle, who would reach out to the Video Game History Foundation thirty years later.</p>



<p>When Michelle emailed the Video Game History Foundation with images of pre-release game cartridges, tapes, and extensive documentation, Frank Cifaldi and Kelsey Lewin wasted no time in getting on a plane.&nbsp;When they arrived at Mark’s home, they found a treasure trove. They set to work scanning physical documents, digitizing tapes, and dumping the contents of the various cartridges. They spent days sorting through the collection, when suddenly a random unmarked Game Boy cartridge caught their attention.&nbsp;It was Kelsey who first checked the mysterious cartridge.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image2.jpg" alt="" title="" srcset="https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image2.jpg 800w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image2-740x555.jpg 740w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://gamehistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image2-50x38.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></figure>



<p><em>“I plug it in and the first thing I see is the little astronaut and it says ‘by Dylan Cuthbert’ and I’m like, I know who that is!”&nbsp;</em>Kelsey said,<em>&nbsp;“I’m like, Oh my God, this is very similar to X, but also it has all of these other kind of tech demo type things in here. So I immediately knew it was interesting.”</em>&nbsp;Kelsey then showed the demo to frank.</p>



<p><em>“We’re playing it and we both know enough to go, oh, this is X.”</em>&nbsp;Frank confirmed,&nbsp;<em>“This is like an early version of X. And so, you know, I think it is a pretty easy assumption to go, okay, this was the demo that was maybe shopped around was my guess.”</em></p>

<p>While Kelsey and Frank may not have known the story of the Eclipse demo at that moment, they knew of Dylan Cuthbert, his Game Boy game X, and the partnership with Nintendo that would eventually lead to the Super Nintendo game, Star Fox. In August of 2021, I produced a documentary on the development of the Nintendo DS game, Star Fox Command.</p>

<p>Shortly after its release Frank invited me to discuss the game’s history with them on their podcast, The Video Game History Hour. During the discussion I casually told the story of the Eclipse demo and its evolution into X. Only to hear Frank wonder aloud if that was in fact&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;demo they had found. I’d not expected to learn that the demo which served as the genesis for X and eventually the entire Star Fox series, had been discovered while recording that episode. It’s on episode 52 if you’re curious to hear my live reaction.</p>



<p>That is how the Eclipse demo came into the hands of the Video Game History Foundation, but it is by no means the end of the story for Eclipse itself. One of the other companies to receive the Eclipse demo was, of course, Nintendo.</p>



<p><em>“Nintendo took a bit longer.”&nbsp;</em>Dylan recalled,<em>&nbsp;“Obviously the Japanese HQ had to see it and stuff like that. Then we were flown over to Japan to show it directly and it’s around that time that Nintendo decided to sign it and basically transfer the rights of it from Mindscape. And I still have no idea how or what Nintendo did to transfer the contract that was with Mindscape or how much they paid or anything like that. I’d really like to know actually… And that’s when I started working with Sakamoto at Nintendo. And he kind of helped guide the sort of usability of the game.”</em></p>

<p>Cuthbert was paired up with Yoshio Sakamoto who would serve as the director on the Eclipse project. Sakamoto is perhaps best known as the producer of the 2D Metroid series including the critically acclaimed Metroid Dread which was released on Nintendo Switch in 2021. Sakamoto’s job would be to shape the incredible ambition and technical knowhow into a finished game, with that signature Nintendo polish.</p>



<p><em>“With the Nintendo touch, it kind of made it easier to play. We have things like guides that help the player know how to dock with buildings and stuff like that. And then added that sort of Nintendo humor to the game as well as some funny little secrets in there and stuff like that. But</em>&nbsp;<em>really the changes were to the missions suite. So kind of gave them a sort of story which has a little bit more of a Japanese feel to it. And so a few things of that sort of came from the Nintendo, or really the Japanese kind of mind. And then all the other stuff brought in from the original kind of British feel of the game, and it’s kind of an interesting blend of both, I think. So really, I mean, we just kind of fleshed out everything with Nintendo.”</em></p>



<p>As Eclipse grew into a full game, there was still one last change to make.</p>



<p><em>“Well, Eclipse was the original game name, it’s like the prototype name. So it’s kind of the thing that I thought up in the very initial stages of the game. It was never intended to be really actually called that, but I think maybe the Mindscape signing was probably for ‘Eclipse’. I don’t think they were interested in changing the name. But for Nintendo, obviously Nintendo put a lot more effort into making sure there aren’t any name clashes and stuff like that. So a whole bunch of names were put forward. I think Lunar Chase was one of the ones I also put forward for them when they were doing their name check and it’s the one that kind of came through that was okay. And so we gave it that title for a long time.”</em></p>

<p>The name Lunar Chase stuck with the project, to the point that the planned english release of the game, which eventually found its way online, still bears that original title. For this reason Lunar Chase is generally, to this day, still thought of as the unofficial western title for the game.</p>



<p><em>“But then about a month or two before release, suddenly Yamauchi&nbsp;</em>(Hiroshi Yamauchi was the President of Nintendo from 1949-2002)<em>&nbsp;after playing the game, he calls up Sakamoto at 8:00 a.m. or 7 a.m. in the morning, kind of woke him up he said, and basically said, ‘okay, this is fine, but you’ve got to call the game X’. And so then Sakamoto came in that morning and came to me, came to my desk and said like, ‘okay, Yamauchi called me directly and said, we’re calling the game X’. Okay, all right. And that was the name from there on.”</em></p>



<p>Despite never officially leaving Japan, X would go on to be regarded as one of the single most important games ever made. It spawned the creation of Star Fox and contributed to Nintendo’s shift in focus to 3D games. It helped launch the career of Dylan Cuthbert who would go on to work with both Nintendo and Sony, before starting his own company, Q-Games, in 2001. In 2010 Q-Games partnered with Nintendo to release X-Scape, a DSiWare sequel to the original X.</p>

<p>X itself has never been re-released or given an official release outside of Japan. With the closure of the 3DS eShop, the last digital shop to host DSiWare titles, X-Scape cannot be legally purchased.</p>



<p><em>“I’d like to see, specifically more people able to play X-Scape or X-Returns, as it’s called in Japan… It’s just a shame that not really enough people played it just because it was hard to access, being on the DSi. I’d like to see that somehow get resurrected somewhere, even if it’s like a remaster or something. There are a lot of very good DsiWare games. I would love for Nintendo to come up with a way to give people access to that catalog. We didn’t just make X-Scape on it. We also made Starship Defender and Reflect Missile (called Trajectile in some regions). And they’re all really good games, but just no one really got to see them because they’re on DSiWare. And so I’m hoping that Nintendo is going to do something about that at some point. And with X itself, I mean, obviously only the Japanese version can be played right now officially if you buy a cartridge and a very old Gameboy.”</em></p>



<p>While thanks to the efforts of Mark and Michelle Flitman along with the Video Game History Foundation, we’re able to gain new insights into the history of these games, the public’s legal access to them is borderline non-existent.</p>



<p>“<em>When we’re going into these houses we never really know what to expect and a lot of that’s because you can’t suss that information out ahead of time.”&nbsp;</em>Frank told me.<em>&nbsp;“People don’t tend to know what’s historically important because they’re not historians. We go into these things going like okay this could be a total bust. Like he might just have a bunch of like final versions of his games and business cards. Or, in cases like this he has like kind of a holy relic of a very important game series. It keeps the job really interesting and honestly it’s more wins than than duds in this line of work. Especially in that era of video games a lot of material was made and scrapped and just kind of left around so there’s still a lot to discover. If you got a basement with this kind of thing you should probably get in touch”</em></p>



<p>As for Dylan he’d love to go back to revisit that world again one day.</p>



<p><em>“I’d love to make a sequel, you know? I mean, it took a long time to make the first sequel. It was like 20 years, I think since the original game came out is when we released the first sequel to the game. But maybe we can do that in a shorter time frame at some point. But it depends. It’s a bit of a niche game, but I think there are still a lot of people who would like that kind of game still. So I’d definitely like to have a shot at it at some point.”</em></p>

<p>Aspirin is an inexpensive and readily available medication that could benefit cancer treatments, preventing metastatic cancer spread and reducing vascular complications, finds new meta-analysis study.</p><p>The Welsh Aspirin Group in Cardiff University has published a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the impacts of the use of aspirin as a treatment for cancer.</p><p>The research looked at the results of 118 observational studies based upon around a million patients with a wide range of cancers, finding that taking a daily low-dose (75 or 81 mg/day) of aspirin was associated with a 20% reduction in deaths from cancer and in deaths from all causes.</p><p>“Aspirin was first shown in 1968 to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer, as it targets a number of key biological mechanisms of cancer, reducing risks of metastatic cancer spread and vascular complications in cancer patients.” said Peter Elwood, Honorary Professor at Cardiff University.</p>

<p>Aspirin is known to increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. The research aimed to evaluate the risks of the use of aspirin in cancer treatments, including the risks associated with gastrointestinal bleeding. The report from the Welsh Aspirin Group examined studies of stomach bleeding associated with aspirin, and shows that such bleeding attributable to aspirin is less serious than gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with stomach ulcers or stomach infection, and there is no valid evidence of any fatal bleeding attributable to aspirin.</p><p>The researchers concluded that, given the relative safety of aspirin, it should be promoted as a treatment for cancer due to the consistent evidence of reduction in metastatic cancer spread and the earlier aspirin is commenced after a diagnosis of cancer has been made, the greater the befit from aspirin.</p><p>“We believe that - given its relative safety and its favourable effects - the use of aspirin as an additional treatment of cancer is fully justified.</p><p>“As aspirin is inexpensive and readily available in almost every country. It’s promotion could have benefits worldwide, and with the present delays in specialist services for patients suspected to have cancer, this reduction could be of enormous possible benefit,” added Professor Elwood.</p><p>The research, <em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41416-023-02506-5#:~:text=These%20explain%20the%20observed%20reductions,mortality%20associated%20with%20aspirin%20use.">Aspirin and cancer treatment: systematic reviews and meta-analyses of evidence: for and against</a></em>, was published in British Journal of Cancer.</p>

<p dir="auto">Zen is an open-source system-wide ad-blocker and privacy guard for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. It works by setting up a proxy that intercepts HTTP requests from all applications, and blocks those serving ads, tracking scripts that monitor your behavior, malware, and other unwanted content. By operating at the system level, Zen can protect against threats that browser extensions cannot, such as trackers embedded in desktop applications and operating system components. Zen comes with many pre-installed filters, but also allows you to easily add hosts files and EasyList-style filters, enabling you to tailor your protection to your specific needs.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>LOS ANGELES</i> – A YouTuber pilot was sentenced today to six months in federal prison for obstructing a federal investigation by deliberately destroying the wreckage of an airplane that he intentionally crashed in Santa Barbara County to gain online views.</p>

<p>Trevor Daniel Jacob, 30, of Lompoc, was sentenced by United States District Judge John F. Walter.</p>

<p>Jacob pleaded guilty on June 30 to one count of destruction and concealment with the intent to obstruct a federal investigation.</p>

<p>Jacob is an experienced pilot, skydiver and former Olympic athlete who had secured a sponsorship from a company that sold various products, including a wallet. Pursuant to the sponsorship deal, Jacob agreed to promote the company’s wallet in a YouTube video that he would post.</p>

<p>On November 24, 2021, Jacob took off in his airplane from Lompoc City Airport on a solo flight purportedly destined for Mammoth Lakes. Jacob did not intend to reach his destination, but instead planned to eject from his aircraft during the flight and video himself parachuting to the ground and his airplane as it descended and crashed.</p>

<p>Prior to taking off, Jacob mounted several video cameras on different parts of the airplane and equipped himself with a parachute, video camera and selfie stick. Approximately 35 minutes after taking off, while flying above the Los Padres National Forest near Santa Maria, Jacob ejected from the airplane and videoed himself parachuting to the ground.</p>

<p>Using the video camera mounted on the selfie stick and the video cameras he mounted on the airplane, Jacob was able to record the airplane as it descended and crashed into a dry brush area in Los Padres National Forest. After parachuting to the ground, Jacob hiked to the location of the wreck and recovered the data containing the video recording of his flight and the crash of the airplane.</p>

<p>On November 26, 2021, Jacob informed the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) about the plane crash. The NTSB, which launched an investigation into the crash on or about that same day, told Jacob that he was responsible for preserving the wreckage so the agency could examine it. Jacob agreed to determine the crash location and provide both the coordinates of the downed plane and videos of the crash to NTSB investigators. Three days later, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) launched its own investigation into the plane crash.</p>

<p>In the weeks following the plane crash, Jacob lied to investigators that he did not know the wreckage’s location. In fact, on December 10, 2021, Jacob and a friend flew by helicopter to the wreckage site. There, Jacob used straps to secure the wreckage, which the helicopter lifted and carried to Rancho Sisquoc in Santa Barbara County, where it was loaded onto a trailer attached to Jacob’s pickup truck.</p>

<p>Jacob drove the wreckage to Lompoc City Airport and unloaded it in a hangar. He then cut up and destroyed the airplane wreckage and, over the course of a few days, deposited the detached parts of the wrecked airplane into trash bins at the airport and elsewhere, which was done with the intent to obstruct federal authorities from investigating the November 24 plane crash.</p>

<p>On December 23, 2021, Jacob uploaded a YouTube video titled, “I Crashed My Airplane,” that contained a promotion of the wallet and depicted him parachuting from the plane and the aircraft’s subsequent crash. Jacob intended to make money through the video.</p>

<p>Jacob lied to federal investigators when he submitted an aircraft accident incident report that falsely indicated that the aircraft experienced a full loss of power approximately 35 minutes after takeoff. Jacob also lied to an FAA aviation safety inspector when he said the airplane’s engine had quit and, because he could not identify any safe landing options, he had parachuted out of the plane.</p>

<p>“It appears that [Jacob] exercised exceptionally poor judgment in committing this offense,” prosecutors argued in a sentencing memorandum. “[Jacob] most likely committed this offense to generate social media and news coverage for himself and to obtain financial gain. Nevertheless, this type of ‘daredevil’ conduct cannot be tolerated.”</p>

<p>The United States Department of Transportation – Office of Inspector General investigated this matter. The NTSB and FAA provided substantial assistance.</p>

<p>Assistant United States Attorneys Dominique Caamano and Dennis Mitchell of the Environmental Crimes and Consumer Protection Section prosecuted this case.</p>

<p>After a spy camera designed to look like a towel hook was purchased on Amazon and illegally used for months to capture photos of a minor in her private bathroom, Amazon was sued.</p>
<p>The plaintiff—a former Brazilian foreign exchange student then living in West Virginia—argued that Amazon had inspected the camera three times and its safety team had failed to prevent allegedly severe, foreseeable harms still affecting her today.</p>
<p>Amazon hoped the court would dismiss the suit, <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/west-virginia/wvsdce/3:2023cv00046/235914/24/">arguing</a> that the platform wasn't responsible for the alleged criminal conduct harming the minor. But after nearly eight months deliberating, a judge recently largely denied the tech giant's motion to dismiss.</p>
<p>Amazon's biggest problem persuading the judge was seemingly the product descriptions that the platform approved. An <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MS-v-Amazon-amended-complaint-3-31-2023.pdf">amended complaint</a> included a photo from Amazon's product listing that showed bathroom towels hanging on hooks that disguised the hidden camera. Text on that product image promoted the spycams, boasting that they "won't attract attention" because each hook appears to be "a very ordinary hook."</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MS-v-Amazon-spycam-ad.png" data-height="1152" data-width="1940" alt="Amazon's listing for the spy cam, included in the amended complaint."><img alt="Amazon's listing for the spy cam, included in the amended complaint." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MS-v-Amazon-spycam-ad-640x380.png" width="640" height="380" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MS-v-Amazon-spycam-ad-1280x760.png 2x"></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MS-v-Amazon-spycam-ad.png" data-height="1152" data-width="1940">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Amazon's listing for the spy cam, included in the amended complaint.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Because "Amazon approved product descriptions suggesting consumers use" the spycam "to record private moments in a bathroom," US district judge Robert Chambers wrote, "Amazon cannot claim shock when a consumer does just that."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>"These allegations raise a reasonable inference Amazon sold a camera knowing it would be used to record a third party in a bathroom without their consent," Chambers wrote.</p>
<p>Perhaps most alarming to the plaintiff, Amazon's Product Safety Team specifically inspected the camera to "ensure" that Amazon wasn't platforming a product being used to “infringe privacy,” “surreptitiously record others for sexual purposes,” or “create and store child sex abuse material.” That review allegedly did not prevent the spy cam from being used to do just that, the lawsuit alleged, putting consumers at risk of alleged harms suffered by the plaintiff, including "chronic tremors, insomnia, headaches, nausea, hypotension with associated blurred vision, dizziness, compulsive overeating, avoidance behavior, and paranoia."</p>
<p>In addition to refusing blame, Amazon unsuccessfully argued that none of those harms could be considered physical injury. To the contrary, Chambers wrote that "if proven," the plaintiff's physical harms are considered "severe" because "emotional trauma inflicted during a child’s 'tender years' has an 'indelible effect' from which 'they may never recover.'"</p>
<p>A lawyer for the plaintiff, Lee Javins, told Ars that he thinks this is an important issue for the court to explore. He commended the court for making the right decision after taking its time "to provide a thorough legal analysis" on legal theories that he said "haven't come up a lot with today's technology."</p>
<h2>A potentially “dangerous ruling” for spycam industry</h2>
<p>The plaintiff hopes a jury will decide that Amazon "had wanton, conscious, reckless, and outrageous indifference to the health, safety, and welfare of children."</p>
<p>She has also alleged that Amazon "conspired" with the spycam seller to "market and distribute a defective product both knew was intended and used for illegal and criminal purposes." Not only did Amazon allegedly "shape" the "marketing and promotion of the camera" by controlling "how products are depicted and the content of product listings and descriptions," but Amazon also "boosted the camera’s sales" with its "specialized algorithms," the lawsuit alleged.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>A loss for Amazon could put the online retailer on the hook for punitive damages. Amazon could also be ordered to stop selling the spycam used to harm the plaintiff and any products considered "identical" to that spycam. Chambers wrote that proving "foreseeability" of harms "is key" to defeating Amazon's defense.</p>
<p>Tech legal expert Eric Goldman <a href="https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2023/12/amazon-may-be-liable-for-merchants-spycam-m-s-v-amazon.htm">wrote</a> that a victory for the plaintiff could be considered "a dangerous ruling for the spy cam industry and for Amazon," because "the court’s analysis could indicate that all surreptitious hook cameras are categorically illegal to sell." That could prevent completely legal uses of cameras designed to look like clothes hooks, Goldman wrote, such as hypothetical in-home surveillance uses.</p>
<p>Now, discovery will proceed as the plaintiff can argue her case at trial. The trial could shed more light on "what Amazon’s Product Safety team thought when it evaluated this item," Goldman wrote.</p>
<p>Currently, Amazon advertises several "clothes hook hidden camera" products when users search for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=%22bathroom+spy+camera%22&amp;crid=WK1AEHNZLNQE&amp;sprefix=bathroom+spy+camera+%2Caps%2C96&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2">"bathroom spy camera,"</a> an Ars search found, but it's unclear if the spy cam at the center of this lawsuit is still available on Amazon.</p>
<p>In his blog, Goldman pointed to an Amazon <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJDK7VLM/?tag=arstech20-20">online listing</a> that appeared to be the spycam in question. However, Javins told Ars that while that particular listing looked like the "same type of camera," it had a different product description from the spycam sold in the case, where "the whole vibe" of the listing "was just kind of creepy."</p>
<p>Ars unsuccessfully attempted to contact Amazon for comment on the judge's order and the online listing Goldman found. Shortly after submitting that request, Amazon appears to have removed the online listing but has not yet offered Ars any explanation.</p>

These vessels contain T cells that, in a mouse model of chronic high blood pressure, become activated and produce conditions that can lead to dementia-like symptoms.</span><span>Image courtesy of the Iadecola lab.</span></p></div><p>A study supported by the National Institutes of Health suggests that the response of immune system cells inside the protective covering surrounding the brain may contribute to the cognitive decline that can occur in a person with chronic high blood pressure. This finding, published in <em>Nature Neuroscience</em>, may shed light on new ways to counteract the effects of high blood pressure on cognition. The study was funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), a part of NIH.</p>

<p>“The role of immune signaling in cognitive decline is critically important to understand,” said Roderick Corriveau, Ph.D., program director, NINDS. “These findings offer insight into how signaling from the immune system could contribute to symptoms of cognitive decline that ultimately result in dementia diagnoses.”</p>

<p>Hypertension affects more than 1 billion people worldwide and can lead to a decline in cognitive function including when a stroke occurs, but also even when a person with high blood pressure does not have a stroke. However, efforts to control cognitive loss in people who do not experience a stroke with treatments that lower blood pressure have shown mixed results. The findings of this mouse study suggest that immune cells around and within the brain become abnormally activated under conditions that mimic a common form of hypertension, and this activation leads to impaired brain function.</p>

<p>Using a mouse model of high blood pressure, the researchers led by Costantino Iadecola, M.D., director and chair of the Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute, New York City, found abnormally increased levels of interleukin-17 (IL-17), a chemical normally released in the body to activate the immune system, in the cerebral spinal fluid and the brain. Previously, Dr. Iadecola’s team <a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/news-events/press-releases/hold-salt-gut-reaction-may-impair-brains-mice">showed that a high salt diet increased IL-17 in the gut</a>, which was followed by cognitive impairment. These new findings add to that story by showing that IL-17 is acting within the brain itself. It’s also notable that these experiments use a different mouse model, called the DOCA salt model, that more closely mimics a common form of hypertension in people.</p>

<p>“This is currently the most realistic model of hypertension that we have,” said Dr. Iadecola. “The DOCA mouse simulates low-renin hypertension, which is a common type of hypertension in people, particularly among Black Americans.”</p>

<p>Further work showed that, once in the brain, IL-17 turned on immune cells responsible for activating inflammation and fighting off infections, known as macrophages. A series of experiments confirmed that these macrophages are important for the observed decline in cognition, as both mice in which the receptor for IL-17 was deleted in brain macrophages and those that had their brain macrophages depleted showed no effects of high blood pressure on cognitive function despite having other symptoms of hypertension.</p>

<p>Researchers still sought the source of the IL-17 acting on the brain macrophages. Based on their previous work, the researchers’ initial hypothesis was that the gut releases IL-17, which then travels to the brain through the blood stream. Once there, it sets off a reaction that damages the ability of brain blood vessels to respond appropriately to increased brain activity. However, blocking the brain blood vessels’ ability to respond to IL-17 only partially rescued cognitive impairment, suggesting that there was another source of IL-17 acting on the brain.</p>

<p>One clue came from other recent studies suggesting that one layer of the protective covering of the brain, known as dura mater, contains immune T cells that can both secrete IL-17 and can affect the behavior of mice. Using special mice where cells light up fluorescent green when they make IL-17, the researchers confirmed that hypertension increases IL-17 in the dura mater which is then released into the tissue. Normally, barriers exist within the protective covering of the brain, called the meninges, to prevent unwanted spillage into the brain. However, this barrier appeared to be disrupted in the mice with experimentally induced hypertension, and this disruption allowed IL-17 to enter the cerebral spinal fluid.</p>

<p>Two additional experiments helped to confirm this hypothesis. First, a drug was used to prevent T cell movement from the lymph nodes into the meninges. Second, an antibody was used to block the activity of T cells in the meninges. In both cases, cognitive function was restored in the mice with hypertension, suggesting that targeting overactive T cells could be a new treatment approach worth exploring.</p>

<p>“Together, our data suggest two different effects are caused by hypertension,” said Dr. Iadecola. “One is IL-17 acting on blood vessels, but this appears to be relatively minor. A more prominent, central effect is caused by cells in the meninges releasing IL-17 that directly affects immune cells in the brain. It is these immune cells, activated by signaling from the meninges, that ultimately affect the brain in a way that causes cognitive impairment.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dr. Iadecola and his team are now looking to connect the dots between the activation of immune cells in the meninges and decreased cognitive function. <a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/news-events/press-releases/pathogenic-tau-and-cognitive-impairment-are-precipitated-high-salt-diet">Previous work by the group</a> suggested a connection between a high salt diet which suppressed the production of the chemical nitric oxide in brain&nbsp;vessels that in turn led to buildup of tau,&nbsp;a toxic protein that forms clumps in neurons affected by Alzheimer’s disease. The present findings also show suppression of nitric oxide production within brain&nbsp;vessels, and whether this also leads to an increase in tau production is currently under investigation.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.mindyourrisks.nih.gov/">NINDS’s Mind Your Risks® campaign</a> serves to highlight the connection between high blood pressure and brain health (including risk of stroke and dementia), particularly among Black men ages 28-45, and offers strategies to prevent and mitigate high blood pressure’s effects on brain health.</p>

<p>A few days ago, we spotted that <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/windows-10-windows-11-hp-smart-app/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the HP Smart App was being installed on people's PCs</a> without their consent. Even worse, the app would reappear if users tried to uninstall it or clean-installed Windows. Now, the cause has finally been identified: a recent Windows 10 and 11 update is renaming everyone's printers to "HP LaserJet M101-M106" regardless of what model it actually is.</p>
<!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":1,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":10,"degradationStartingPoint":2,"actualCount":397} --><!-- Zone: character count repeatable. --><!-- No ads allowed! --><!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":1,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":10,"degradationStartingPoint":2,"actualCount":0} -->

<h2 id="windows-update-39-s-strange-printer-bug"> Windows Update's strange printer bug </h2>
<p>As reported on <em><a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2023/12/04/windows-update-accidentally-renames-all-printers-to-hp-m101-m106-on-windows-11-windows-10/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Windows Latest</a></em>, the latest update for Windows 10 and 11 seems to think that people's printers are an HP LaserJet model, regardless of their actual brand. It's believed that the bug appeared after HP pushed its latest metadata to Windows Update, but something went awry in the code and caused other printers to be labeled as HP LaserJet printers.</p>
<!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. --><!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":1,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":2,"actualCount":368} -->
<p>This explains why the HP Smart App has been sneaking onto people's computers without their consent. A key part of Windows Update is keeping third-party drivers and devices updated, including downloading any apps that the devices depend on. After the printer metadata incorrectly identified everyone's printers as HP LaserJet printers, Windows installed all the software needed for an HP printer to work smoothly, including the HP Smart App.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the bug only affects the metadata for the printer. While the printer may show up with a different name on your system, you should still be able to send print jobs to it. Microsoft has since removed the fault metadata from Windows Update, so anyone performing a clean install from now on should get their original printer's name back and stop the HP Smart App from re-downloading.</p>
<!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":1,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":2,"actualCount":1212} --><!-- Zone: character count repeatable. --><!-- No ads allowed! --><!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":1,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":2,"actualCount":0} -->
<p>If you're not keen on performing a clean install just to reset a printer's name, Microsoft should be releasing an update in the future that corrects this problem. And if all this is too much hassle, you can always grab a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-portable-printers-phones/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">portable printer for phones</a> and skip all the mess.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="59X9fLRi1odLcJNtJAyoes_content"><p>As we have <a title="Why We’re Filing A Lawsuit On The NYC Earnings Standard" href="https://about.doordash.com/en-us/news/nyc-earnings-standard-litigation">repeatedly made clear</a> in recent months, the ill-conceived, extreme minimum pay rate for food delivery workers in New York City will have significant consequences for everyone who uses our platform. Unfortunately, these regulations will significantly increase the costs of facilitating delivery in NYC and force us to make a number of operational changes, which is why we’re providing an update on what local consumers and Dashers will be seeing beginning today.</p><h2>Implementing new minimum pay requirements</h2><p>Dashers who deliver in NYC will now earn at least $29.93 per hour of active time, nearly twice NYC’s $15 minimum wage for other workers. This rate excludes tips and is just a minimum, so Dashers still have the opportunity to earn more than the minimum. Dasher earnings will be reviewed weekly to see if their DoorDash pay meets the earnings minimum, and any Dashers who earn below the required minimum will receive a pay adjustment. </p><h2>Moving tipping to after checkout in preparation for increased fees </h2><p>These new regulations will force us to raise fees for orders in New York City. In order to better balance the impact of these new costs, we’re moving the option to tip in the DoorDash app to <a href="https://help.doordash.com/consumers/s/article/Can-I-adjust-the-tip-I-provide-to-my-Dasher" rel="noopener">after checkout</a>. This change comes as a <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/dca/downloads/pdf/workers/Delivery-Worker-Study-November-2022.pdf" rel="noopener">recommendation</a> by the NYC Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, and has been done to help ensure our platform remains affordable for all New Yorkers. </p><p>However, we know tips are still an important way for consumers to show Dashers their appreciation, so consumers will still be able to tip after checkout and for up to 30 days after they order. As always, 100% of a consumer’s tip goes to the Dasher.</p><h2>Pausing our Dasher Priority Access program</h2><p>With the changes required by NYC and the impact it will have on our system, we are pausing our Priority Access program, which gives Dashers who have high ratings priority on higher-paying offers. Since Dashers will earn a guaranteed minimum rate, the benefits offered by this program will not apply in NYC. The Top Dasher program is still available for qualified NYC Dashers.</p><p>We know that these are significant changes for the way Dashers will use the platform, and we always seek feedback from them on important topics like app functionality, new features, and public policy. We sent early communications to some Dashers making them aware of changes that would be coming to the platform and provided an opportunity to offer feedback so that we could most effectively implement these changes. </p><p>We anticipate needing to make other operational changes in response to these new regulations that will further impact the experience of consumers, Dashers, and merchants on DoorDash in New York City. In the meantime, we will continue to engage with policymakers and focus on what matters most: continuing to serve communities across New York City.</p></article></div>]]></description>

    <h2 id="intro"><a href="#intro">Introduction</a></h2>
    <p>
        HTML, the programming language, is a practical, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">turing-complete</a><a href="#turning-complete">[1]</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-oriented_programming">stack-based</a> programming language based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>,
        the markup language. It uses <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">elements
        defined in HTML</a>, the markup language, in order to do computations.
    </p>
    <p>
        To give you a sense of what HTML, the programming langauge, looks like, below is a sample program that prints
        the values from 1 to 10 to standard out (<code>console.log</code>)
    </p>

    <figure>
        <figcaption>A Sample HTML Program</figcaption>
        <pre>&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;      &lt;!-- push 1 onto the stack --&gt;
&lt;output id="loop"&gt;&lt;/output&gt;  &lt;!-- print the top of the stack --&gt;
&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;      &lt;!-- push 1 onto the stack --&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;                    &lt;!-- add 1 --&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;                    &lt;!-- dup new value --&gt;
&lt;data value="11"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;     &lt;!-- push 11 to compare --&gt;
&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;                  &lt;!-- test new value is smaller than 11 --&gt;
&lt;i&gt;                          &lt;!-- if bigger than zero pushed true --&gt;
    &lt;a href="#loop"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;     &lt;!-- then jump back to the loop --&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
    </pre>
    </figure>

    <p>
        HTML programs are specified in HTML, the markup language. Elements from HTML, the markup language, (informally
        referred to as "tags") are interpreted as <i>commands</i> by the HTML interpreter. Note that HTML programs
        are <em>not</em> required to be legal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">HTML5</a>, the markup
        language, documents.
    </p>
    <p>
        HTML is a <a href="#extending">fully customizable</a> programming language and you may add new
        commands or alter existing commands by mutating the <code>html.meta.commands</code> object.
    </p>

        To install HTML, the programming language, <a href="https://html-lang.org/html.js" download="">download</a> and include the
        <code>html.js</code> file via a script tag:

        You may now begin programming in HTML.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2 id="getting-started"><a href="#getting-started">Getting Started</a></h2>
    <p>
        To get started with HTML, the programming language, you must first understand how a
        <i>stack-oriented</i> programming language works. In a stack-oriented programming language, most operations are
        done with reference to a <i>stack</i> of values.
    </p>
    <p>
        In HTML, this is referred to as <i>the value stack</i> or, informally, as "the stack".  In HTML, the stack is
        maintained in the current <em>execution frame</em> (either the main HTML program or within a function defined in HTML),
        rather than as a global stack, as in
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)">forth-like</a> languages. (In this regard,
        HTML, the programming language, is <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-2.html#jvms-2.6">similar to the JVM</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Stack-oriented programming can seem strange to developers who have not worked with it before, so let's begin
        with a simple "Hello World" program in HTML:
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;main&gt;
  &lt;s&gt;Hello World!&lt;/s&gt;     &lt;!-- push 'Hello World!' onto the stack --&gt;
  &lt;output&gt;&lt;/output&gt;       &lt;!-- print the top of the stack --&gt;
&lt;/main&gt;
 </pre>
    <p>
        The first thing to note is that in HTML a program is defined in a <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tag.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next thing to notice is that the program consists of a series of HTML tags within the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tag.
        For the "Hello World" program, the first command is a <code>&lt;s&gt;</code> tag.  This will <a href="#strings">"push"
        the string value <code>"Hello World!"</code></a> onto the stack.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next command is the <code>&lt;output&gt;</code> tag.  This will <a href="#output">output the top of the
       value stack to standard out</a>, which is <code>console.log</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        (Note that the <code>output</code> tag <b>does not</b> consume the top of the value stack.)
    </p>
    <p>
        A more elaborate example of using the value stack would be adding 2 and 3, like so:
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;main&gt;
  &lt;data value="2"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;     &lt;!-- push 2 onto the stack --&gt;
  &lt;data value="3"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;     &lt;!-- push 3 onto the stack --&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;                   &lt;!-- add the top two values on the stack --&gt;
  &lt;output&gt;&lt;/output&gt;           &lt;!-- print the sum now on the top of the stack --&gt;
&lt;/main&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
        In this HTML program, we push the values 2 and 3 onto the value stack <a href="#numbers">using <code>&lt;data&gt;</code> tags</a>, and
        then invoke the <code>dd</code> command to <a href="#addition">"a(dd)" the top two values on the stack</a> .
        The <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code> command will "pop", or remove, the top two values of the value stack, add
        them together, and then "push" the result onto the top of the value stack. Next, we print the result out
        using the <code>output</code> tag.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a stack-oriented language like HTML, this is how things are done: pushing and popping values on the
        stack in order to do computations.
    </p>
    <p>
        With that brief introduction out of the way, let's go over the entire language so you can add HTML, the
        programming language, to your resume.

    <p>
        HTML uses HTML's normal comment mechanism for comments:
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;!-- This is a comment --&gt;
    </pre>
</section>

<section>
    <h2 id="literals"><a href="#literals">Literal Values</a></h2>
    <p>
        HTML supports many different literals that can be used to push values onto the value stack.
    </p>

    <h3 id="numbers"><a href="#numbers">Numbers</a></h3>
    <p>
        Numbers can be pushed onto  the value stack using the <code>&lt;data&gt;</code> tag:
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;!-- this pushes the numeric value 1 onto the value stack --&gt;
&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="strings"><a href="#strings">Strings</a></h3>
    <p>
        Strings can be pushed onto  the value stack using the <code>&lt;s&gt;</code> tag.  The inner content
        of the tag will be treated as a string.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;!-- this pushes the string "Hello Strings!" onto the value stack --&gt;
&lt;s&gt;Hello Strings!&lt;/s&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="arrays"><a href="#arrays">Arrays</a></h3>
    <p>
        Arrays can be pushed onto  the value stack using the <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> tag, containing <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>
        elements.  The child elements of the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> will be executed and the top value of the stack
        after they are evaluated will be inserted into the array.  If there are excess values on the value stack
        after an <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> has executed its children, they will be removed.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;!-- this pushes the array [1, 2] onto the stack --&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;data value="2"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="objects"><a href="#objects">Objects</a></h3>
    <p>
        Objects can be pushed onto  the value stack using the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> tag, containing <code>&lt;th&gt;</code>
        and <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>elements.  <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> elements will be used as property names, using the
        innerText of the elements.  The child elements of the <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> will be executed and the top value of
        the stack after they are evaluated will be used as the value for the corresponding <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> .  If
        there are excess values on the value stack after a <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> has executed its children, they will be
        removed.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;!-- this pushes the object {foo:"Foo", bar:10} onto the stack --&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;
          foo
        &lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;
          bar
        &lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
          &lt;s&gt;Foo&lt;/s&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;data value="10"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="true"><a href="#true">true, false &amp; null</a></h3>
    <p>
        The values <code>true</code>, <code>false</code> and <code>null</code> can all be accessed with the
        <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> command.  These are defined as <a href="#variables">variables</a> at the start of every
        new activation frame (aka scope).  Note that it is possible to override these variables with different values,
        such as setting <code>null</code> to <code>"lmao"</code>, but that we do not recommend doing so in most cases.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;!-- this pushes true onto the stack --&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;true&lt;/cite&gt;
    </pre>

<section>
    <h2 id="math"><a href="#math">Math</a></h2>
    <p>
        HTML offers support for common mathematical operators, utilizing the value stack.
    </p>

    <h3 id="addition"><a href="#addition">Addition</a></h3>
    <p>
        Addition can be performed with the <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code> (a<b>dd</b>) tag.  This tag will pop the top
        two values off the value stack, add the top value to the second to the top value, and
        then push the result back onto the value stack.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;data value="2"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;!-- this dd tag will add 1 to 2 and push the result onto
        the value stack --&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
        Note that addition can also be used for string concatenation, as in JavaScript.
    </p>

    <h3 id="subtraction"><a href="#subtraction">Subtraction</a></h3>
    <p>
        Subtraction can be performed with the <code>&lt;sub&gt;</code> tag.  This tag will pop the top
        two values off the value stack, subtracting the top value from the second to the top value, and
        then push the result back onto the value stack.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;data value="2"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;!-- this sub tag will subtract 1 from 2 and push the result onto
        the value stack --&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="multiplication"><a href="#multiplication">Multiplication</a></h3>
    <p>
        Multiplication can be performed with the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> (m<b>ul</b>) tag.  This tag will pop the top
        two values off the value stack, multiply the top value by the second to the top value, and
        then push the product back onto the value stack.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;data value="2"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;data value="3"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;!-- this ul tag will multiply 2 to 3 and push the result onto
        the value stack --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="division"><a href="#division">Division</a></h3>
    <p>
        Division can be performed with the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag.  This tag will pop the top
        two values off the value stack, divide the second to the top value by the top value, and
        then push the result back onto the value stack.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;data value="6"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;data value="3"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;!-- this div tag will divide 6 by 3 and push the result onto
        the value stack --&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    </pre>

</section>

<section>
    <h2 id="stack"><a href="#stack">Stack Operations</a></h2>
    <p>
        HTML offers commands for direct manipulation the stack.
    </p>

    <h3 id="duplicate"><a href="#duplicate">Duplicate</a></h3>
    <p>
        You can duplicate the value on the top of the stack using the <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code> (duplicate top) tag.  This
        is useful in cases where you want to use a value more than once for operations that would consume the value, such
        as <a href="#if">an if/else</a> situation.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;!-- this will push a second 1 onto the top of
        the value stack --&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="delete"><a href="#delete">Delete</a></h3>
    <p>
        You can delete/pop the value on the top of the stack using the <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> tag.

    </p>
    <pre>&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;!-- this will remove the 1 on the top of the stack --&gt;
&lt;del&gt;&lt;/del&gt;
    </pre>

</section>

<section>
    <h2 id="comparison"><a href="#comparison">Comparison Operations</a></h2>
    <p>
        In HTML, comparisons such as less than, equal, etc. are done on the value stack.  Comparison
        commands compare two values and leave a boolean on the top of the value stack, which can then
        be used with the <a href="#if">"if" command</a> to do conditional execution.
    </p>

    <h3 id="smaller"><a href="#smaller">Less Than</a></h3>
    <p>
        You can test if a value is smaller than another value by using the <code>&lt;small&gt;</code>
        tag.  This will pop the top two values off the value stack and push true second to top value
        is smaller (&lt;) than the top value, false otherwise.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;data value="2"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;!-- this will push true onto the stack, since 1 is smaller than 2 --&gt;
&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="big"><a href="#big">Greater Than</a></h3>
    <p>
        You can test if a value is smaller than another value by using the <code>&lt;big&gt;</code>
        tag.  This will pop the top two values off the value stack and push true second to top value
        is larger (&gt;) than the top value, false otherwise.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;data value="2"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;!-- this will push false onto the stack, since 1 is not bigger than 2 --&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="eq"><a href="#eq">Equal (Mostly)</a></h3>
    <p>
        You can test if a value is equal (mostly) than another value by using the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>
        tag.  This will pop the top two values off the value stack and push true second to top value
        is equal (==) than the top value, false otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that we say "equal (mostly)" because the equality operator in JavaScript (which HTML, the programming language,
        is implemented in) has
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Equality">interesting</a>
        semantics.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;s&gt;1&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;!-- this will push true onto the stack, since "1" is equal to 1 --&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
    </pre>

</section>

<section>
    <h2 id="logical"><a href="#logical">Logical Operations</a></h2>
    <p>
        As with comparisons in HTML, logical operations such as <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, etc. are done on the value stack.
        Logical operations apply to values on the value stack and will leave a boolean on the top of the value stack.
    </p>
    <p>
        All logical operators start with a "b" for "boolean", to make things easier to remember.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that HTML, the programming language, follows JavaScript, the programming language's (sic)
        semantics regarding <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy"> "truthiness"</a>.
    </p>

    <h3 id="and"><a href="#and">And</a></h3>
    <p>
        You can logically "and" the top two values on the value stack using the <code>&lt;b&gt;</code>
        command.  This will pop the top two values off the stack and push the result of them being "anded"
        together.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;cite&gt;true&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;!-- this will push true onto the stack, since true &amp;&amp; 1 is true --&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="or"><a href="#or">Or</a></h3>
    <p>
        You can logically "or" the top two values on the value stack using the <code>&lt;bdo&gt;</code>
        command.  This will pop the top two values off the stack and push the result of them being "anded"
        together.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;cite&gt;true&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;false&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;!-- this will push true onto the stack, since true || false is true --&gt;
&lt;bdo&gt;&lt;/bdo&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="invert"><a href="#invert">Invert/Not</a></h3>
    <p>
        You can invert the top value on the value stack using the <code>&lt;bdi&gt;</code>
        command.  This will pop the top value off the stack and push the result of it being inverted (<code>true</code>
        becomes <code>false</code>, <code>false</code> becomes <code>true</code>).
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;cite&gt;false&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;!-- this will push true onto the stack, since !false is true --&gt;
&lt;bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
    </pre>

</section>

<section>
    <h2 id="control-flow"><a href="#control-flow">Control Flow</a></h2>
    <p>
        HTML, the programming language, provides three mechanisms for control flow.  While these mechanisms may seem primitive,
        the can be used to implement any sort of arbitrary control flow pattern you would like.
    </p>

    <h3 id="if"><a href="#if">If (Conditional Execution)</a></h3>
    <p>
        Conditional execution can be achieved by using the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> (if) tag/command.
        This command will pop the top value off the value stack, and, if it is "truthy", will execute
        all children commands/tags defined inside of it.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;!-- test if 1 is equal to 1 --&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;!-- Since true is on the stack, the child tags/commands will execute here --&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;s&gt;Yep, 1 == 1&lt;/s&gt;
  &lt;output&gt;&lt;/output&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
        If you wish to achieve and if/else like flow, you can conveniently <a href="#duplicate">duplicate</a> the boolean
        on the top of the stack, use an <code>&lt;i/&gt;</code> to test the first case (which will consume the top boolean)
        and then invert the boolean using <a href="#invert"><code>&lt;bdi&gt;</code> </a> and test again using <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This gives you a clean and easy to use "if/else" style statement:
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;data value="2"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;!-- test if 1 is equal to 1 --&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;!-- duplicate the result (false) --&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;!-- Since false is on the stack, the child tags/commands will not execute here --&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;s&gt;Yep, 1 == 2&lt;/s&gt;
  &lt;output&gt;&lt;.output&gt;
  &lt;!-- remove the string from the top of the stack to be clean --&gt;
  &lt;del&gt;&lt;/del&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;!-- The second copy of false is at the top of the stack, so invert it to true --&gt;
&lt;bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;s&gt;Nope, 1 == 2 isn't true, even in JavaScript&lt;/s&gt;
  &lt;output&gt;&lt;.output&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="return"><a href="#return">Returning</a></h3>
    <p>
        If you wish to return from <a href="#functions">a function</a> (discussed below) or simply terminate the execution of
        a program, you may use the <code>&lt;rt&gt;</code> tag.  This will immediately stop execution in the
        current context and either return from a function or halt the execution of a program.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;s&gt;This will print...&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;output&gt;&lt;/output&gt;
&lt;rt&gt;&lt;/rt&gt;
&lt;s&gt;This will not print...&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;output&gt;&lt;/output&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="branching"><a href="#branching">Branching</a></h3>
    <p>
        To execute arbitrary jumps in an HTML, the programming language, you use the anchor tag: <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>,
        by setting the <code>href</code> attribute to the id of the command you wish to jump to.  This allows you
        to implement things like loops, and can be coupled with conditional execution via the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>
        tag to implement powerful control flow patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is a loop that will print from 1 to 10:
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;      &lt;!-- push 1 onto the stack --&gt;
&lt;output id="loop"&gt;&lt;/output&gt;  &lt;!-- print the top of the stack --&gt;
&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;      &lt;!-- push 1 onto the stack --&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;                    &lt;!-- add 1 to the original value --&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;                    &lt;!-- dup new value --&gt;
&lt;data value="11"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;     &lt;!-- push 11 to compare --&gt;
&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;              &lt;!-- test new value is smaller than 11 --&gt;
&lt;i&gt;                          &lt;!-- if smaller than 11 pushed true --&gt;
    &lt;a href="#loop"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;     &lt;!-- then jump back to the loop --&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
        The crux here is the anchor tag that references the <code>&lt;output&gt;</code> tag with the id
        <code>loop</code>.  When this anchor tag is executed it will send control back to that element
        to continue in the next iteration of the loop.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that this jump back to the beginning of the loop is conditional on the top of the stack being
        less than 11.  Thus you can see that powerful control flow patterns can be created out of these primitive
        branching mechanisms.
    </p>

<section>
    <h2 id="variables"><a href="#variables">Variables</a></h2>
    <p>
        Variables in HTML, the programming language, are always "local" to the current context.  Global variables,
        defined in <code>window</code> can be resolved by name, but cannot be written to.  (You must use a property
        access on the <code>window</code> object to do that).
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that the values <code>true</code>, <code>false</code> and <code>null</code> are defined as variables
        and can be overwritten.  Again, we do not recommend this practice, but we are not judgy about it either.
    </p>

    <h3 id="cite"><a href="#cite">Referencing Variables</a></h3>
    <p>
        You push a variable onto the top of the value stack by using the <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> tag.  This will resolve
        the variable against the local scope first, and then against <code>window</code>, allowing you to load globally
        scoped variables.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;!-- this will push true onto the stack, since
        true is a variable with the value true --&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;true&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;output&gt;&lt;/output&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="var"><a href="#var">Declaring &amp; Setting a Variable</a></h3>
    <p>
        You declare or set (same thing) a variable using the <code>&lt;var&gt;</code>
        tag.  This will pop the top value off the stack and save it into the variable slot with the
        name taken from the <code>title</code> attribute of the variable.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;!-- push 1 onto the value stack --&gt;
&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;!-- this creates a locally scoped variable
        named 'x' with the value 1 in it --&gt;
&lt;var title="x"&gt;&lt;/var&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
        Again, declaring and assigning variables in HTML, the programming language, is the same thing, so you may
        have multiple <code>&lt;var&gt;</code> tags that refer to the same variable name.

    <h2 id="io"><a href="#io">I/O</a></h2>
    <p>
        It's a little late in the game, since we've been using <code>&lt;output&gt;</code> a bunch already, but HTML, the programming language,
        supports simple I/O operations.  Of course, HTML, the programming language, can interact with the DOM using
        <a href="#functions">functions</a> in order to do I/O as well, but simple I/O can be accomplished directly in
        the language itself.
    </p>

    <h3 id="output"><a href="#output">Outputting Values</a></h3>
    <p>
        You can output the top of the stack by using the <code>&lt;output&gt;</code> tag.  This will <em>not</em> consume
        the value.
    </p>
    <p>
        By default the value will be printed to standard out (<code>console.log</code>).  You may change this by
        setting the <code>html.meta.out</code> configuration variable to another value.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;!-- this will print "Hello World!" to standard out --&gt;
&lt;s&gt;Hello World!&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;output&gt;&lt;/output&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="input"><a href="#input">Getting User Input</a></h3>
    <p>
        Of course you can use the DOM to get user input if you would like.  But you can also use the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>
        tag to get user input.
    </p>
    <p>
        This tag will prompt the user for input using the <code>prompt()</code> method in JavaScript.  The message
        shown to the user will be taken from the <code>placeholder</code> attribute.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you wish to ask for a number, rather than a string, from the user, you can set the <code>type</code> attribute
        of the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> to <code>number</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The result of the prompt will be pushed onto the top of the value stack.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;!-- this will ask the user for their name, then say hello in the console --&gt;
&lt;input placeholder="What is your name?"/&gt;
&lt;var title="name"&gt;&lt;/var&gt;
&lt;s&gt;Nice to meet you,&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;name&lt;/cite&gt;

    </p>

    <h3 id="reading-props"><a href="#reading-props">Reading Properties</a></h3>
    <p>
        You can read a property of the value on the top of the stack by using the <code>&lt;rp&gt;</code> (read property)
        tag.  The name of the property read will be the inner text of the tag.  This will consume the element the property is being
        read on, so duplicate the top of the stack if you wish to preserve it.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;!-- load the document onto the stack --&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;document&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;!-- load the body property onto the stack --&gt;
&lt;rp&gt;body&lt;/rp&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="setting-props"><a href="#setting-props">Setting Properties</a></h3>
    <p>
        You can set a property of an object using the <code>&lt;samp&gt;</code> (set am property)
        tag.  The name of the property to set will be the inner text of the tag.  The value to set into the property
        must be on the top of the stack, and the object to set the property of must be second from the top of the stack.
    </p>
    <p>
        Both the value being set into the object and the object will be consumed from the value stack.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;!-- load the document onto the stack --&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;document&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;!-- load the body property onto the stack --&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;body&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;!-- push "Hello World!" onto the stack --&gt;
&lt;s&gt;Hello World!&lt;/s&gt;

    <h2 id="array-access"><a href="#array-access">Working With Arrays</a></h2>

    </p>

    <h3 id="reading-arrays"><a href="#reading-arrays">Reading An Array Value</a></h3>
    <p>
        You can read the value at an index in an array <code>&lt;address&gt;</code>tag.  This command will
        consume the top value of the value stack as the index to read from, and the second value from the
        top of the stack as the array to read the index from.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that this tag can also be used to reflectively access properties, by putting a string on the
        top of the stack rather than an integer.
    </p>

&lt;!-- push the value 0 onto the stack --&gt;
&lt;data value="0"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;!-- consumes the 0 and the array, indexes into the array at position 0,

    <h2 id="functions"><a href="#functions">Functions</a></h2>
    <p>
        HTML, the programming language, supports the declaration and invocation of functions.
    </p>

    <h3 id="defining-functions"><a href="#defining-functions">Defining Functions</a></h3>
    <p>
        You can define functions using the <code>&lt;dfn&gt;</code> tag.  The name of the function will be
        taken from the <code>id</code> property of the <code>&lt;dfn&gt;</code> tag.  The body of the function are the
        commands/tags within the <code>&lt;dfn&gt;</code> tag.
    </p>
    <p>
        Arguments passed to the function will be pushed onto the value stack.  So, if a function is invoked
        with the values (1, 2, 3), the initial value stack will be 3 on top, then 2, then 1.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is common for HTML, the programming language, programmers to save the arguments to a function int variables
        using the <code>&lt;var&gt;</code> command at the beginning of complex functions, in order to make it easier to
        refer to them.  (Note that this must be done in reverse order to the order that the parameters are received.)
    </p>
    <p>
        The return value of a function defined in HTML, the programming language, is the top value
        left on the value stack at the end of the function's execution.  There is no need to explicitly return this value
        with syntax.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that you can terminate a functions execution early by using the <a href="#return"><code>&lt;rt&gt;</code></a> command.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;!-- this defines a simple function that squares the argument --&gt;
&lt;def id="square"&gt;
    &lt;!-- duplicate the argument to the function, implicitly on the top of the stack --&gt;
    &lt;dt&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;!-- multiply it and return (leaving it on the top of the stack --&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/def&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3 id="invoking-functions"><a href="#invoking-functions">Invoking Functions</a></h3>
    <p>
        To invoke functions, HTML, the programming language, reuses the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag.
        If the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>'s <code>href</code> attribute begins with <code>javascript:</code>,
        it will invoke a function rather than jump to an element.
    </p>
    <p>
        The function that will be invoked is resolved by the name after the <code>javascript:</code>, but
        before the first open-parenthesis, <code>(</code>.  Note that arguments to the function defined
        in the <code>href</code> attribute are ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead, arguments are passed by executing <em>child</em> elements within the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>
        tag.  All elements within the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag will be executed and then the <em>new</em> values
        that are pushed onto the value stack by the children will be removed from the stack and used as the arguments to the
        function.
    </p>
    <p>
        When a function is invoked, it's return value (if any), will be pushed onto the stack.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;!-- invoke the square() function defined above, with the argument 12 --&gt;
&lt;a href="javascript:square()"&gt;
  &lt;data value="12"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;!-- output the result (144) --&gt;
&lt;output&gt;&lt;/output&gt;
    </pre>
    <h4 id="invoking-functions-objects"><a href="#invoking-functions-objects">Invoking Functions On Objects</a></h4>
    <p>
        If you wish to invoke a function on an object (rather than on the global <code>window</code> object), you
        can set the <code>target</code> attribute of the anchor tag to <code>_top</code>.  This will make it consume
        the top of the value stack and invoke the method on that object.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;!-- load the document --&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;document&lt;cite&gt;
&lt;!-- load all elements with the class .highlighted onto the stack
        by invoking the querySelectorAll() method on the docuemtn--&gt;
&lt;a href="javascript:querySelectorAll()"
      target="_top"&gt;
  &lt;s&gt;.highlighted&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;!-- output the result --&gt;
&lt;output&gt;&lt;/output&gt;
    </pre>

    <h2 id="js"><a href="#js">JavaScript Integration</a></h2>
    <p>
        HTML, the programming language, integrates cleanly with JavaScript. You can invoke JavaScript
        functions just like normal functions, and JavaScript functions can invoke HTML, The Programming
        Language as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        JavaScript developers should be able to get comfortable with HTML, the programming language,
        very quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also execute HTML, the programming language, "scriptlets" as strings in JavaScript,
        using the <code>html.exec()</code> utility function.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2 id="config"><a href="#config">Configuring/Extending</a></h2>
    <p>
        You can configure the standard out and standard error of HTML, The Programming Langauge bu
        setting the <code>html.meta.out</code> and <code>html.meta.err</code> values to functions
        of your design.
    </p>

    <h3 id="extending"><a href="#extending">Extending</a></h3>
    <p>
        HTML, the programming language, can be extended or modified by adding or modifying the entries
        found in <code>html.meta.commands</code>, which map a tag name to a function that takes an element
        and context, and implements some sort of behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
        As an example, if we wanted to make the <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag print the entire value stack
        we could write something like this in JavaScript:
    </p>
    <pre>html.meta.commands["pre"] = function(elt, env) {
    console.log(env.stack);
}
    </pre>
    <p>
        With this definition you could then write the following code:
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;data value="1"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;data value="2"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;data value="3"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;!-- will print the stack [1, 2, 3] to console.out --&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
        You can also implement arbitrary control flow by returning the next element in the DOM to execute
        from this function.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2 id="debugging"><a href="#debugging">Debugging</a></h2>
    <p>
        HTML, the programming language, includes an integrated debugger, HDB, the HTML Debugger, to assist in debugging
        HTML programs. To access the debugger, insert a function callback into the <code>html.meta.debugger</code> field.
    </p>
    <pre>html.meta.debug = function(hdb, elt, env, cmd)
{
    // you can set a JavaScript breakpoint here
    hdb.break();
}
    </pre>
    <p>
        You can then add a breakpoint to an HTML element by adding the <code>data-hdb-breakpoint</code> attribute to it.
        This will cause the runtime to invoke the HDB debugger <em>before</em> the element is executed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The callback can have up to four parameters:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>hdb</code> - The debugger</li>
        <li><code>elt</code> - The element to be executed</li>
        <li><code>env</code> - The current environment (including vars and the value stack)</li>
        <li><code>cmd</code> - The implementation of the command</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        By setting a JavaScript breakpoint in the callback, you can inspect the current environment and command.  You
        can also invoke one of the following methods on the <code>hdb</code> object:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>step()</code> - Execute the current instruction and stop before the next one.</li>
        <li><code>continue()</code> - Stop debugging and continue until the next breakpoint (or the program finishes)</li>
        <li><code>jumpTo(elt)</code> - Don't execute the current element, instead jump to the given HTML element</li>
    </ul>

		<p>Richard Rosenfeld in the most recent <a href="https://asc41.org/wp-content/uploads/ASC-Criminologist-2023-11.pdf">Criminologist</a> published a piece about forecasting national level crime rates. People complain about the FBI releasing crime stats a year late, academics are worse; Richard provided “forecasts” for 2021 through 2025 for an article published in late 2023.</p>
<p>Even ignoring the stalecasts that Richard provided – these forecasts had/have no chance of being correct. Point forecasts will always be wrong – a more reasonable approach is to provide the prediction intervals for the forecasts. Showing error intervals around the forecasts will show how Richard interpreting minor trends is likely to be misleading.</p>
<p>Here I provide some analysis using ARIMA models (in python), to illustrate what reasonable forecast error looks like in this scenario, <a href="https://github.com/apwheele/Blog_Code/tree/master/Python/UCR_ARIMA">code and data on github</a>.</p>
<p>You can get the dataset on github, but just some upfront with loading the libraries I need and getting the data in the right format:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# via https://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm
ucr = pd.read_csv('UCR_1960_2019.csv')
ucr['VRate'] = (ucr['Violent']/ucr['Population'])*100000
ucr['PRate'] = (ucr['Property']/ucr['Population'])*100000
ucr = ucr[['Year','VRate','PRate']]

# adding in more recent years via https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/docApi
# I should use original from counts/pop, I don't know where to find those though
y = [2020,2021,2022]
v = [398.5,387,380.7]
p = [1958.2,1832.3,1954.4]
ucr_new = pd.DataFrame(zip(y,v,p),columns = list(ucr))
ucr = pd.concat([ucr,ucr_new],axis=0)
ucr.index = pd.period_range(start='1960',end='2022',freq='A')

# Richard fits the model for 1960 through 2015
train = ucr.loc[ucr['Year'] &lt;= 2015,'VRate']</code></pre>
<p>Now we are ready to fit our models. To make it as close to apples-to-apples as Richard’s paper, I just fit an ARIMA(1,1,2) model – I do not do a grid search for the best fitting model (also Richard states he has exogenous factors for inflation in the model, which I do not here). Note Richard says he fits an ARIMA(1,0,2) for the violent crime rates in the paper, but he also says he differenced the data, which is an ARIMA(1,1,2) model:</p>
<pre><code># Not sure if Richard's model had a trend term, here no trend
violent = ARIMA(train,order=(1,1,2),trend='n').fit()
violent.summary()</code></pre>
<p>This produces the output:</p>

<p>So some potential evidence of over-differencing (with the negative AR(1) coefficient). Looking at <code>violent.test_serial_correlation('ljungbox')</code> there is no significant serial auto-correlation in the residuals. One could use some sort of auto-arima approach to pick a “better” model (it clearly needs to be differenced at least once, also maybe should also be modeling the logged rate). But there is not much to squeeze out of this – pretty much all of the ARIMA models will produce very similar forecasts (and error intervals).</p>
<p>So in the statsmodels package, you can append new data and do one step ahead forecasts, so this is comparable to Richard’s out of sample one step ahead forecasts in the paper for 2016 through 2020:</p>
<pre><code># To make it apples to apples, only appending through 2020
av = (ucr['Year'] &gt; 2015) &amp; (ucr['Year'] &lt;= 2020)
violent = violent.append(ucr.loc[av,'VRate'], refit=False)

# Now can show insample predictions and forecasts
forecast = violent.get_prediction('2016','2025').summary_frame(alpha=0.05)</code></pre>
<p>If you <code>print(forecast)</code> below are the results. One of the things I want to note is that if you do one-step-ahead forecasts, here the years 2016 through 2020, the standad error is under 20 (this is well within Richard’s guesstimate to be useful it needs to be under 10% absolute error). When you start forecasting <em>multiple</em> years ahead though, the error compounds over time. So to forecast 2022, you need a forecast of 2021. To forecast 2023, you need to forecast 21,22 and then 23, etc.</p>

<p>The standard error scales pretty much like <code>sqrt(steps*se^2)</code> (it is additive in the variance). Richard’s forecasts do better than mine for some of the point estimates, but they are similar overall:</p>
<pre><code># Richard's estimates
forecast['Rosenfeld'] = [399.0,406.8,388.0,377.0,394.9] + [404.1,409.3,410.2,411.0,412.4]
forecast['Observed'] = ucr['VRate']

forecast['MAPE_Andy'] = 100*(forecast['mean'] - forecast['Observed'])/forecast['Observed']
forecast['MAPE_Rick'] = 100*(forecast['Rosenfeld'] - forecast['Observed'])/forecast['Observed']</code></pre>

<p>So MAPE in the held out sample does worse than Rick’s models for the point estimates, but look at my prediction intervals – the observed values are still totally consistent with the model I have estimated here. Since this is a blog and I don’t need to wait for peer review, I can however update my forecasts given more recent data.</p>
<pre><code># Given updated data until end of series, lets do 23/24/25
violent = violent.append(ucr.loc[ucr['Year'] &gt; 2020,'VRate'], refit=False)
updated_forecast = violent.get_forecast(3).summary_frame(alpha=0.05)</code></pre>
<p>And here are my predictions:</p>
<pre><code>VRate        mean    mean_se  mean_ci_lower  mean_ci_upper
2023   371.977798  19.813228     333.144584     410.811012
2024   380.092102  39.803285     302.079097     458.105106
2025   376.404091  57.846105     263.027810     489.780373</code></pre>
<p>You really need to graph these out to get a sense of the magnitude of the errors:</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apwheele/Blog_Code/master/Python/UCR_ARIMA/ForecastViolent.png"></p>
<p>Note how Richard’s 2021 and 2022 forecasts and general increasing trend have already been proven to be wrong. But it really doesn’t matter – any reasonable model that admitted uncertainty would never let one reasonably interpret minor trends over time in the way Richard did in the criminologist article to begin with (forecasts for ARIMA models are essentially mean-reverting, they will just trend to a mean term in a short number of steps). Richard including exogenous factors actually makes this worse – as you need to forecast inflation and take that forecast error into account for any multiple year out forecast.</p>
<p>Richard has consistently in his career overfit models and subsequently interpreted the tea leaves in various macro level correlations (Rosenfeld, 2018). His current theory of inflation and crime is no different. I agree that forecasting is <em>the</em> way to validate criminological theories – picking up a new pet theory every time you are proven wrong though I don’t believe will result in any substantive progress in criminology. Most of the short term trends criminologists interpret are simply due to normal volatility in the models over time (Yim et al., 2020). David McDowall has a recent article that is much more measured about our cumulative knowledge of macro level crime rate trends – and how they can be potentially related to different criminological theories (McDowall, 2023). Matt Ashby has a paper that compares typical errors for city level forecasts – forecasting several years out tends to product quite inaccurate estimates, quite a bit larger than Richard’s 10% is useful threshold (Ashby, 2023).</p>
<p>Final point that I want to make is that honestly it doesn’t even matter. Richard can continue to keep making dramatic errors in macro level forecasts – it doesn’t matter if he publishes estimates that are two+ years old and already wrong before they go into print. Because unlike what Richard says – national, macro level violent crime forecasts <em>do not</em> help policy response – why would Pittsburgh care about the national level crime forecast? They should not. It does not matter if we fit models that are more accurate than 5% (or 1%, or whatever), they are not helpful to folks on the hill. No one is sitting in the COPS office and is like “hmm, two years from now violent crime rates are going up by 10, lets fund 1342 more officers to help with that”.</p>
<p>Richard can’t have skin the game for his perpetual wrong macro level crime forecasts – there is no skin to have. I am a nerd so I like looking at numbers and fitting models (or here it is more like that XKCD comic of yelling at people on the internet). I don’t need to make up fairy tale hypothetical “policy” applications for the forecasts though.</p>
<p>If you want a real application of crime forecasts, I have estimated for cities that adding an additional home or apartment unit increases the number of calls per service by about 1 per year. So for growing cities that are increasing in size, that is the way I suggest to make longer term allocation plans to increase police staffing to increase demand.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>A decade ago to the day, I published a tweet launching what would surely become yet another pet project that scratched an itch, was kinda useful to a few people but other than that, would shortly fade away into the same obscurity as all the other ones I'd launched over the previous couple of decades:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It's alive! "Have I been pwned?" by <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">@troyhunt</a> is now up and running. Search for your account across multiple breaches <a href="http://t.co/U0QyHZxP6k?ref=troyhunt.com">http://t.co/U0QyHZxP6k</a></p>— Have I Been Pwned (@haveibeenpwned) <a href="https://twitter.com/haveibeenpwned/status/408153032698785792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">December 4, 2013</a></blockquote> 

<p>And then, as they say, things kinda escalated quickly. The very next day <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/working-with-154-million-records-on/" rel="noreferrer">I published a blog post about how I made it so fast to search through 154M records</a> and thus began <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/tag/have-i-been-pwned-3f/" rel="noreferrer">a now 185-post epic</a> where I began detailing the minutiae of how I built this thing, the decisions I made about how to run it and commentary on all sorts of different breaches. And now, a 10th birthday blog post about what really sticks out a decade later. And that's precisely what this 185th blog post tagging HIBP is - the noteworthy things of the years past, including a few things I've never discussed publicly before.</p><h3 id="pwned">Pwned?</h3><p>You know why it's called "Have I Been Pwned"? Try coming up with almost any conceivable <em>normal </em>sounding English name and getting a .com domain for it. <em>Good luck!</em> That was certainly part of it, but another part of the name choice was simply that I honestly didn't expect this thing to go anywhere. It's like I said in the intro of this post where I fully expected this to be another failed project, so why does the name matter?</p><p>But it's weird how "pwned" has stuck and increasingly, become synonymous with HIBP. For many people, the first time they ever hear the word is in the context of "Have I Been..." with an ensuing discussion often explaining the origins of the term as it relates to gaming culture. And if you do go and look for a definition of the term online, you'll come across resources such as <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/pwned-meaning-definition-origins-video-games-internet-hackers?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">How “PWNED” went from hacker slang to the internet’s favourite taunt</a>:</p><blockquote>Then in 2013, when various web services and sites saw an uptick in personal data breaches, security expert Troy Hunt created the website “Have I Been Pwned?” Anyone can type in an email address into the site to check if their personal data has been compromised in a security breach.</blockquote><p>And somehow, this little project is now referenced in the definition of the name it emerged from. Weird.</p><p>But, because it's such an odd name that has so frequently been mispronounced or mistyped, I've ended up with a whole raft of bizarre domain names including <a href="http://haveibeenpaened.com/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">haveibeenpaened.com</a>, <a href="http://haveibeenpwnded.com/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">haveibeenpwnded.com</a>, <a href="http://haveibeenporned.com/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">haveibeenporned.com</a> and my personal favourite, <a href="http://haveibeenprawned.com/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">haveibeenprawned.com</a> (because a journo literally pronounced it that way in a major news segment 🤦‍♂️). Not to mention all the other weird variations including <a href="http://haveibeenburned.com/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">haveibeenburned.com</a>, <a href="http://haveigotpwned.com/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">haveigotpwned.com</a>, <a href="http://haveibeenrekt.com/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">haveibeenrekt.com</a> and after someone made the suggestion following the revelation that PornHub follows me, <a href="http://haveibeenfucked.com/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">haveibeenfucked.com</a> 🤷‍♂️</p><h3 id="press">Press</h3><p>It's difficult to even know where to start here. How does the little site with the weird name end up in the press? Inevitably, "because data breaches", and it's <em>nuts</em> just how much exposure this project has had because of them. These are often mainstream news events and what reporters often want to impart to people is along the lines of "Here's what you should do if you've been impacted", which often boils down to checking HIBP.</p><p>Press is great for raising awareness of the project, but it has also quite literally DDoS'd the service with <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/brief-lessons-on-handling-huge-traffic-spikes/" rel="noreferrer">the Martin Lewis Money Show in the UK knocking it offline in 2016</a>. Cool! No, for real, I learned some really valuable lessons from that experience which, of course, I shared in a blog post. And then ensured could never happen again.</p><p>Back in 2018, Gizmodo reckoned HIBP was <a href="https://gizmodo.com/100-websites-that-shaped-the-internet-as-we-know-it-1829634771?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">one of the top 100 websites that shaped the internet as we knew it</a>, alongside the likes of Wikipedia, Google, Amazon and Goatse (don't Google it). Only the year after it launched, <a href="https://time.com/3054279/50-best-websites-2014/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">TIME magazine reckon'd it was one of the 50 best websites of the year</a>.

"You know they're just trying to get you to DC so they can arrest you for all that stolen data you have, right?! 🤣", the internet quipped. But instead, I had one of the most memorable moments of my career as <a href="https://youtu.be/A0HPTrBiU5g?t=1359&amp;ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">I read my testimony</a> (these are public hearings so it's all recorded and available to watch), responded to questions from congressmen and congresswomen and rounded out the trip staring down at where they inaugurate presidents:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/11/IMG_0313.JPG" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/11/IMG_0313.JPG 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/11/IMG_0313.JPG 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/11/IMG_0313.JPG 1600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w2400/2023/11/IMG_0313.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Today, that photo adorns the wall outside my office and dozens of times a day I look at it and ask the same question - <em>how did it all lead to this?!</em></p><h3 id="svalbard">Svalbard</h3><p>The potential sale of HIBP was a very painful, very expensive chapter of life, announced in <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/project-svalbard-the-future-of-have-i-been-pwned/" rel="noreferrer">a blog post from June 2019</a>. For the most part, I was as transparent and honest as I could be about the reasons behind the decision, including the stress:</p><blockquote>To be completely honest, it's been an enormously stressful year dealing with it all.</blockquote><p>More than one year later, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/sustaining-performance-under-extreme-stress/" rel="noreferrer">I finally wrote about the source of so much of that stress</a>: divorce. Relationship circumstances had put a huge amount of pressure on me and I needed a relief valve which at the time, I thought would be the sale of the project I loved so much but was becoming increasingly demanding. Ultimately, Project Svalbard (the code name for the sale of HIBP), had the opposite effect as years of bitter legal battles with my ex ensued, in part due to the perceived value that would have been realised had it been sold and some big tech company owned my arse for years to come. The project I built out of a passion to do community good was now being used as a tool to extract as much money out of me as possible. There's a wild story to be told there one day but whilst that saga is now well and truly behind me, the scars are still raw.</p><p>There were many times throughout Project Svalbard where I felt like I was living out an episode of Silicon Valley, especially as I hopped between interviews at the who's-who of tech firms in San Francisco to meet potential acquirers. But there was one moment in particular that I knew at the time would form an indelible memory, so I took a photo of it:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/11/IMG_3439.JPG" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/11/IMG_3439.JPG 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/11/IMG_3439.JPG 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/11/IMG_3439.JPG 1600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w2400/2023/11/IMG_3439.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I'm sitting in a rental car in Yosemite whilst driving from the aforementioned meetings in SF and onto Vegas for the annual big cyber-events. I had a scheduled call with a big tech firm who was a potential acquirer and should that deal go through, the guy I was speaking to would be my new boss. I'd done that dozens of times by now and I don't know if it was because I was especially tired or emotional or if there was something in the way he phrased the question, but this triggered something deep inside me:</p><blockquote>So Troy, what would your perfect day in the office look like?</blockquote><p>I didn't say it this directly, but I kid you not this is exactly what popped into my mind:</p><blockquote>I get on my jet ski and I do whatever the fuck I want</blockquote><p>My potential new overlord had somehow managed to find exactly the raw nerve to touch that made me realise how valuable independence had become to me. 6 months later, Project Svalbard was dead after a deal I'd struck fell through. I still can't talk about the precise circumstances due to being NDA'd up to wazoo, but the term we chose to use was "a change of business circumstances on behalf of the purchaser". With the benefit of hindsight, I've never been so happy to have lost so much 😊</p><h3 id="the-fbi">The FBI</h3><p>10 years ago, I certainly didn't see this on the cards:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is so cool, thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/FBI?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">@FBI</a> 😊 <a href="https://t.co/aqMi3as91O?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/aqMi3as91O</a></p>— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1674132801837477888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">June 28, 2023</a></blockquote> 

<p>Nor did I expect them to be <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/open-source-pwned-passwords-with-fbi-feed-and-225m-new-nca-passwords-is-now-live/" rel="noreferrer">actively feeding data into HIBP</a>. Or the UK's NCA to be feeding data in. Or various other law enforcement agencies the world over. And I never envisioned a time where dozens of national governments would be happy to talk about using the service.</p><p>A couple of months ago, the ABC wrote a long piece on how this whole thing is, to use their term, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-23/cybersecurity-troy-hunt-have-i-been-pwned-fighting-data-breaches/102803748?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">a strange sign of the times</a>.</p><blockquote>He’s just “a dude on the web”, but Troy Hunt&nbsp;has ended up playing&nbsp;an oddly central role in&nbsp;global&nbsp;cybersecurity.</blockquote><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/12/99e2645c477b37a47f0639e2c91ca9e6.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1126" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/99e2645c477b37a47f0639e2c91ca9e6.jpg 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/99e2645c477b37a47f0639e2c91ca9e6.jpg 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/12/99e2645c477b37a47f0639e2c91ca9e6.jpg 1600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/12/99e2645c477b37a47f0639e2c91ca9e6.jpg 2150w"></figure><p>It's strange until you look at through the lens of aligned objectives: the whole idea of HIBP was "to do good things after bad things happen" which is well aligned with the mandates of law enforcement agencies. You could call it... common ground:</p>



<p>This is something I suspect a lot of people don't understand - that law enforcement agencies often work in conjunction with private enterprise to further their goals of protecting people just like you and me. It's something I certainly didn't understand 10 years ago, and I still remember the initial surprise when agencies started reaching out. Many years on, these have become really productive relationships with a bunch of top notch people, a number of whom I now count as friends and make an effort to spend time with on my travels.</p><h3 id="passwords">Passwords</h3><p>This was never on the cards originally. In fact, I'd always been adamant that there should never be passwords in HIBP although in my defence, the sentiment was that they should never appear <em>next to the username</em> to which they originally accompanied. But looking at passwords through the lens of how breach data can be used to do good things, a list of known compromised passwords disassociated from any form of PII made a lot of sense. So, in 2017, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/introducing-306-million-freely-downloadable-pwned-passwords/" rel="noreferrer">Pwned Passwords was born</a>. You know what I was saying earlier about things escalating quickly? Yeah:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Setting all new records for Pwned Passwords this week: biggest day ever yesterday at 282M requests and biggest rolling 30 days ever, now passing the 6 *billion* requests mark! <a href="https://t.co/dQiuQim3da?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/dQiuQim3da</a></p>— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1701473422335692997?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">September 12, 2023</a></blockquote> 

<p>As if to make the point, I just checked the latest stats and last week we did 301.6M requests in a single day. 100% of those requests - and that's not a rounded number either, it's 100.0000000000% - were served from Cloudflare's cache 🤯</p><p>There's so much I love about this service. I love that it's free, there's no auth, it's entirely open source (both code and data), the FBI feeds data into it and perhaps most importantly, it has <em>real</em> impact on security. It's such a simple thing, but every time you see a headline such as "Big online website hit with credential stuffing attack", a significant portion of the accounts being taken over have passwords that could easily have been blocked.</p><h3 id="the-paradox-of-handling-data-breaches">The Paradox of Handling Data Breaches</h3><p>On multiple occasions now, I've had conversations that can best be paraphrased as follows:</p><p><strong>Random Internet Person:</strong> I'm going to report you to the FBI for having all that stolen data</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> Maybe you should start by Googling "troy hunt fbi" first...</p><p>But I understand where they're coming from and the paradox I refer to is the perceived conflict between handling what is usually the output of a crime whilst simultaneously trying to perform a community good. It's the same discussion I've often had with people citing privacy laws in their corner of the world (often the EU and GDPR) as the reason why HIBP shouldn't exist: "but you're processing data without informed consent!", they'll claim. The issue of there being other legal bases for processing aside, <em>nobody</em> consents to being in a data breach! The natural progression of that conversation is that being in a data breach is a parallel discussion to HIBP then indexing it and making it searchable, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/the-ethics-of-running-a-data-breach-search-service/" rel="noreferrer">which is something I've devoted many words to addressing in the past</a>.</p><p>But for all the bluster the occasional random internet person can have (and honestly, I could count the number of annual instances of this on one hand), nothing has come of any complaints. And when I say "complaints", it's often nothing more than a polite conversation which may simply conclude with an acknowledgment of opposing views and that's it. There has been <em>one</em> exception in the entire decade of running this service where a complaint did come via a government privacy regulator, I responded to all the questions that were asked and that was the end of it.</p><h3 id="people">People</h3><p>When you have a pet project like HIBP was in the beginning, it's usually just you putting in the hours. That's fine, it's a hobby and you're scratching an itch, so what does it matter that there's nobody else involved? Like many similar passion projects, HIBP consumed a lot of hours from early on, everything from obviously building the service then sourcing data breaches, verifying and disclosing them, writing up descriptions and even editing every single one of those 700+ logos by hand to be just the right dimensions and file size. But in the beginning, if I'd just stopped one day, what would happen? Nothing. But today, a genuinely important part of the internet that a huge number of individuals, corporations and governments have built dependencies on would stop working if I lost interest.</p><p>The dependency on just me was partly behind the possible sale in 2019, but clearly that didn't eventuate. There was always the option to employ people and build it out like most people would a normal company, but every time I gave that consideration it just didn't stack up for a whole bunch of reasons. It was certainly feasible from the perspective of building some sort of valuable commercial entity, but in just the same way as that question about my perfect day in the office sucked the soul from my body, so did the prospect of being responsible for other people. Employment contracts. Salary negotiations. Performance reviews. Sick leave and annual leave and all sorts of other people issues from strangers I'd need to entrust with "my baby". So, bringing in more people was a really unattractive idea, with 2 exceptions:</p><p>In early 2021, my (soon to be at the time) wife Charlotte started working for HIBP.</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/12/CharlotteHunt.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="400" height="284"></figure><p>Charlotte had spent the last 8 years working with people just like me; software nerds. As a project manager for the NDC conferences based out of Norway, she'd dealt with hundreds of speakers (including me on many occasions), and thousands of attendees at the best conference I've ever been a part of. Plus, she spent a great deal of time coordinating sponsors, corporate attendees and all sorts of other folks that live in the tech world HIBP inhabited. For Charlotte, even though she's not a technical person (her qualifications are in PR and entrepreneurial studies), this was very familiar territory.</p><p>So, for the last few years, Charlotte has done absolutely everything that she can to ensure that I can focus on the things that need my attention. She onboards new corporate subscribers, handles masses of tickets for API and domain subscribers and does all the accounting and tax work. And she does this tirelessly every single day at all sorts of hours whether we're at home or travelling. She is... amazing 🤩</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://stebet.net/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">Stefán Jökull Sigurðarson</a> started working for us part time writing code, cleaning up code, migrating code and, well, doing lots of different code things.</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/12/Stef-nJ-kullSigur-arson.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="400" height="276"></figure><p>Just today I asked Stefán&nbsp;what I should write about him, thinking he'd give me some bullet points I'd massage and then incorporate into this blog post. Instead, I reckon what he wrote was so spot on that I'm just going to quote the entire thing here:</p><blockquote>"Just" that having had my eye on the service since it was released and then developing one of the first big integrations with the PwnedPasswords v2 API in EVE, coinciding with us meeting for the first time at NDC Oslo in 2018 shortly after,&nbsp; HIBP has managed to take me on this awesome journey where it has been a part of launching my public speaking career, contributing to OSS with Pwned Passwords, becoming an MVP and helped me meet a bunch of awesome people and allowed me to contribute to a better and hopefully safer internet. I'm very happy and honoured to a be a part of this project which is full of awesome challenges and interesting problems to deal with. Having meeting invites from the FBI in my inbox a few years after doing a few experimental rest calls to the Pwned Passwords API in early 2018 was definitely not something I was expecting 😅</blockquote><p>What really resonated with me in Stefán's message is that for him, this isn't just a job, it's a passion. His journey is my journey in that we freely devoted our time to do something we love and it led to many wonderful things, including MVP roles and speaking at "Charlotte's" conference, NDC. Stefán&nbsp;is based in Iceland, but we've still had many opportunities to share beers together and establish a relationship that transcends merely writing code. I can't think of anyone better to do what he does today.</p><h2 id="breaches">Breaches</h2><p>731 breaches later, here we are. So, what stands out? Just going off the top of my head here:</p><p><strong>Ashley Madison.</strong> Every knows the name so it needs no introduction, but that incident in 2015 had a major impact on HIBP in terms of use of the service, and also a major impact on me in terms of the engagements I had with impacted parties. My blog post on <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/heres-what-ashley-madison-members-have/" rel="noreferrer">Here’s what Ashley Madison members have told me</a> still feels harrowing to read.</p><p><strong>Collection #1.</strong> This is the one that really contributed to my stress levels in early 2019 and had a profound impact on my decision to look at selling the service. <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/the-773-million-record-collection-1-data-reach/" rel="noreferrer">Read about where those 773M records came from</a> (still the largest breach in HIBP to date).</p><p><strong>Rosebutt.</strong> Don't make a joke about it, don't make a joke about it, don't... aw man, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160512105342/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/05/11/embarassing_data_breach/" rel="noreferrer">thanks The Register!</a> (link to an archive.org version as they seem to have thought better of their image choice later on...) The point is that even serious data breaches can have their moments of levity.</p><p><strong>Shit Express.</strong> Sometimes, you just need a bit of hilarity in your data breach. Shit Express is literally a site to send other people pieces of that - <em>anonymously </em>- <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/anonymous-poop-gifting-site-hacked-customers-exposed/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">and they got breached</a>, thus somewhat affecting their anonymity. The more serious point is that as I later wrote, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/safe-secure-anonymous-and-other-misleading-claims/" rel="noreferrer">claims of anonymity are often highly misleading</a>.</p><h2 id="future">Future</h2><p>I often joke about my life being very much about getting up each morning, reading my emails and events from overnight and then just winging it from there. Of course there are the occasional scheduled things not to mention travel commitments, but for the most part it's very much just rolling with whatever is demanding attention on the day. This is also probably a significant part of why I don't really want to see this thing grow into a larger concern with more responsibilities, I just don't want to lose that freedom. Yet...</p><p>We're gradually moving in a direction where things become more formalised. 3 years ago, I did 100% of everything myself. 1 year ago, I did everything technical myself. 6 months ago, we had no ticketing system for support. But these are small, incremental steps forward and that's what I'd like to see continuing. I want HIBP to outlive me, I just don't want it to become a burden I'm beholden to in the process. I'd like to have more people involved but as you can see from above, that's been a very slow process with only those very close to me playing a role.</p><p>The only thing I have real certainty on at the moment is that there will be more breaches. I've commented many times recently that the scourge that is ransomware feels like it's really accelerated lately, I wonder how many of the people in the emails and documents and all sorts of other data that get dumped there ever learn of their exposure? It's a non-trivial exercise to index that (for all sorts of reasons), but it also seems like an increasingly worthy exercise. Who knows, let's see how I feel when I get up tomorrow morning 🙂</p><p>Finally, for this week's regular video, I'm going to make a birthday special and do it live with Charlotte. Please come and join us, I'm not entirely sure what we'll cover (I'll work it out on the morning!) but let's make a virtual 10th birthday party out of it 🎂</p>

<p><strong>Harvard Gutted Initial Team Examining Facebook Files Following $500 Million Donation from Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Whistleblower Aid Client Reveals</strong></p>



<p><em>University’s Former Disinformation Expert Joan Donovan Calls for Investigation</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><strong>WASHINGTON, D.C.</strong> – Harvard University dismantled its prestigious team of online disinformation experts after a foundation run by Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan donated $500 million to the university, a <a href="http://whistlebloweraid.org/joan-donovan-disclosure-harvard-betrayed-academic-freedom-and-the-public-interest-to-protect-meta/">whistleblower disclosure</a> filed by Whistleblower Aid reveals.</p>



<p>Dr. Joan Donovan, one of the world’s leading experts on social media disinformation, says she ran into a wall of institutional resistance and eventual termination after she and her team at Harvard’s Technology and Social Change Research Project (TASC) began analyzing thousands of documents exposing Facebook’s knowledge of how the platform has caused significant public harm..</p>



<p>In her <a href="http://whistlebloweraid.org/joan-donovan-declaration-detailed-account-of-how-harvard-protected-meta-from-research-scrutiny">whistleblower declaration</a>, Donovan lays out in detail how she and her research team at Harvard’s Kennedy School (HKS) came under sudden scrutiny from the school’s dean, Douglas Elmendorf, and other Kennedy School leaders,<strong> </strong>after they started working on Haugen’s Facebook Files – a cache Donovan describes as “the most important documents in the history of the internet.”</p>



<p>TASC rose in size, prominence, and resources under Dr. Donovan’s leadership – and Dr. Donovan was elevated to Research Director of the Shorenstein Center for her success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The importance and prestige of TASC’s work became irrelevant to Dean Elmendorf when in October 2021 Dr. Donovan announced she had lawfully received the Facebook Files at a HKS Dean’s Council meeting, which was attended by a Facebook PR executive who became irate when she discussed it. She intended to create a public archive with a collaborative platform, where participants could publish research and her team would host workshops for researchers and journalists on how to analyze the extensive trove of internal documents. Following the meeting, Dean Elmendorf began a two year campaign to purge Dr. Donovan, silence her voice, decrease her public profile, and stifle her team’s impactful research.</p>



<p>Suddenly her work became a threat to some of HKS’s most treasured donor relationships – just as Harvard was finalizing the largest donation the school had ever received, $500 million from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative in December 2021.</p>



<p>HKS leadership systematically rendered TASC mute with an escalating series of restrictions and bureaucratic hurdles designed to stop their work and the power of Dr. Donovan’s research findings to challenge Meta’s false public narratives. Harvard’s own code of conduct and commitment to academic freedom was trampled in the campaign to silence Dr. Donovan – culminating in the dissolution of TASC and her termination this past summer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meta could not use any of its previously reported tactics to silence other researchers as Dr. Donovan’s research neither relies on access to their data nor would she accept any grants affiliated with any company she researches.</p>



<p>“The mood changed overnight. The work we were doing turned from a source of pride for Harvard into a source of shame,” wrote Dr. Donovan. “Instead of seizing on an extraordinary opportunity to further our knowledge of social media platforms and how they work hidden from public scrutiny, the university subjected my team and our projects to death by a thousand cuts.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In sending the lawful whistleblower disclosure to the President and General Counsel of Harvard University, the U.S. Department of Education, and subsequently to the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office, Dr. Donovan and Whistleblower Aid are calling for an urgent and impartial investigation into inappropriate influence at the Harvard Kennedy School.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is a shocking betrayal of Harvard’s academic integrity and the public interest,” said Libby Liu, CEO of Whistleblower Aid. “We’ve seen in the past how Big Tobacco, Big Energy and Big Pharma have succeeded in influencing, undermining, and co-opting research to protect their lies, their profits and evade accountability. Now Meta, with the complicity of a powerful ally, is following the same playbook. Whether Harvard acted at the company’s direction or took the initiative on their own to protect Meta’s interests, the outcome is the same: corporate interests are undermining research and academic freedom to the detriment of the public.”</p>



<p>Dr. Donovan, now an Assistant Professor at Boston University, was hired by the Kennedy School in 2018 and served as the Director of TASC and was promoted to Research Director of the Shorenstein Center in early 2020. She lectured for several years on media manipulation and disinformation at HKS.</p>



<p>Alongside her team, Dr. Donovan set out to make sure the public, lawmakers, regulators, and academics could all analyze the Facebook Files, opening the doors to unprecedented and transparent public collaboration allowing for public accountability. Her team’s vision of a global research collaborative that openly analyzes the Facebook Files remains, to this day, largely unrealized.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At a time of unprecedented legal scrutiny of Meta by both <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/10/24/meta-lawsuit-facebook-instagram-children-mental-health/">states</a> and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/11/28/ftc-notches-legal-win-privacy-fight-with-meta/">Federal Trade Commission</a>, Meta has benefited tremendously from the curtailing, delaying, and undermining of this research by the Kennedy School leadership.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This case represents a watershed opportunity for lawmakers, regulators, and academia to address the pervasive and detrimental tactics deployed by powerful and wealthy interests like Big Tech to influence vital public interest research. The inadequate safeguards that exist in law, regulation, practice, and academic integrity by universities require meaningful reform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If the most powerful university in the world cannot safeguard the integrity of public interest research in the face of corporate influence-buying, what hope is there for any other research institution?” Libby Liu said. “What hope is there for rank and file academics seeking to pursue the truth and hold power to account?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>###</p>



<p>Whistleblower Aid is a non-profit legal organization in Washington, D.C. supporting individuals who lawfully report government and corporate law breaking. It provides assistance to individuals in the United States and abroad seeking to disclose illegal conduct, including misconduct relating to government officials, securities fraud, sexual violence, and violations of tax, labor or environmental laws. In recent years Whistleblower Aid lawyers have represented Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen and the intelligence community whistleblower whose disclosures led to the first impeachment of President Trump.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I agree. The hon. Gentleman is anticipating my moving on to new clause 20, which talks to some of those issues in great detail, and a very good amendment it is, too. We have talked about whether the fee of £100 is arbitrary, a finger in the wind. But it is a figure that we can put in the Bill to say, “Let’s start here”. It gives Companies House the resource with which it can do work.</p><p>It was pointed out by some of those who gave evidence to the Bill Committee that, if we are seeking to clamp down on those hundreds of companies being set up every day at £12 a pop, we need to replace that money with legitimate money; £100 would go some way to dealing with that gap and that discrepancy. We need to ensure that that money goes to increasing the staff at Companies House, and the capacity, ability and expertise of the people Companies House hires, because much of this is becoming incredibly technical. It is important that it has the resource to do that. All the agencies involved need that money, but Companies House, as the front door to a lot of this stuff, needs to be properly resourced to be able to do that.</p><p>I note that the Minister talked about not wanting to put in legislation the sum of money that that fee would require, but that is not quite how other parts of the system work. I have sat on Statutory Instrument Committees that set the value of passport fees. I understand that the House sets the value of visa fees. Therefore, within the immigration system, the House decides what that fee is and sets that fee. Yet it is not deciding to do so for companies.</p><p>I do not know whether the Minister intends the matter of setting a fee —at £100, or whatever it might be—to come before an SI Committee at some point, but that is not what the Bill says he is going to do. It is important to recognise that, in one area of government, the Government are setting a fee and deciding how much people should pay for things and that other parts of the system should have cost recovery. The visa fee goes way above cost recovery; the passport fee perhaps less so. We are talking about £75.50 for a passport, compared with £12 to register a company and £1,538 for a visa. Those things are not quite the same. The company fee could bear being significantly higher than the £12 it is at the moment, and there is a place in legislation where we could set that because that is what the Government do in other areas of legislation.</p><p>New clause 22 tabled by the Official Opposition—entitled “Person convicted under the Minimum Wage Act not to be appointed as director”—is laudable in its aims because the people flouting the rules should not get to be company directors. Being a company director is a privilege, not a right. For those people who have been convicted of not complying with the legislation, it is perfectly reasonable that they could be disqualified for a serious breach of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998. It is reasonable to disqualify them.</p><p>On the issue of trust and company service providers, there is more that the Bill should and must do. It is unfortunate that the consultation on the Office for Professional Body AML Supervision is still ongoing, I understand, or certainly not concluded, because that should form part of this Bill. It has been widely acknowledged that OPBAS is not effective and is not working as the Government intended, but the Government do not yet know what they are going to do, how they <span id="928" data-column-number="928"></span>will fix OPBAS, whether it will require further legislation in this House, whether it will involve stripping OPBAS of its AML supervision responsibilities and duties and, if it does, where those responsibilities will lie.</p><p>Our suggestion in new clause 35 is to make Companies House the AML supervisor in its own right. I have asked various questions on why the Government do not believe that Companies House should be an anti-money laundering supervisor. It seems to us on the SNP Benches that, if Companies House is the front door for every company registered in the United Kingdom, it should be liable for anti-money laundering regulations. If we are asking banks and other institutions to look at that, why not the Government agency responsible for the registration of every company on these islands?</p><p>That would give Companies House more duties and stop the flow of guff companies, terrible information and people who seek to defraud our constituents at the front door. It seems bizarre to me that the Government would not want to shut the front door firmly in the face of the crooks and the people who want to do that. There is also more that could be done, as mentioned in some of the Labour amendments, on the duty and powers of Companies House. We think Companies House should have powers, and not only powers, but duties—it should have to do those things.</p><p>I do not see why there is ambiguity in this legislation. If the Government are saying Companies House should do it, they should make Companies House do it, rather than leaving it up to interpretation or somebody’s decision further down the line. They should make Companies House do it. We all know that, if we are not forced to do a thing, we might not do a thing. We might not do the dishes, or the laundry, but if we are forced to, we certainly will. There is more that can be done to shut the door and tighten the regulations.</p><p>Through our amendments, we also seek to tighten the integrity of the register. That includes new clause 36 and our amendment 109. They reflect Labour’s amendment 103 and some of the other amendments that speak to the importance of identification numbers and the integrity of the register itself.</p><p>Much of the evidence we heard in the Bill Committee, as well as at various APPG events and other online events, indicates that the register as it stands is full of absolute guff. It has had—<em>[</em><em>Interruption.</em><em>]</em> The Minister waves the legislation, but the difficulty is that he is not intending to fix all that guff. He is allowing that guff to live on the register forever, because there is not enough in the Bill about the retrospective action Companies House has to take, looking through all the hundreds and thousands of companies that, over many years, have been allowed to filter on to the register unheeded.</p><p>Graham Barrow’s Twitter account is full every single day of companies being registered with information that is absolute rubbish. We must have a means of putting a duty and an obligation on Companies House to go back through the register, to clear it out and to say, “There’s no point having that stuff on there, because it is in effect meaningless and it’s gumming up the system for those who want to use the register in legitimate ways.”</p><p>We must be able to keep a check on Companies House: that is why new clause 36 says that it should seek to ensure that registrations contain accurate, up-to-date information and that it comes back to update Parliament <span id="929" data-column-number="929"></span>on its progress updating that register. We cannot expect these things to happen overnight, because it is a big register and there is an awful lot on it, but we must ensure that it is accurate. If it is not, there are very real consequences for our constituents, as Graham Barrow pointed out. People have found themselves being defrauded when their names, their addresses or both have been used inaccurately. Those people have been chased or pursued by criminals and all kinds of things have happened to them because of fraudulent information on the Companies House register.</p><p>Someone may not even find out that their name has been used fraudulently. If they have a name such as James Smith, they may never find out. There are only three Alison Thewlisses on the register, but they are all me. There should be one identification—I should not be on the register as three people—and that is why we seek a unique identifier to track people throughout their lives. If someone’s name has been registered and used without their knowledge, with an address that is not theirs—a mailbox perhaps—they may not find out about it but may end up being liable for the actions of the fraudsters, so a lot more can be done on that.</p><p>We are also seeking through amendment 111 to limit the number of directorships that people can have. People may have multiple directorships, but is the director of 300 companies really able to do that job properly? Probably not. Those are probably not real companies and that person is probably not acting as a proper director. Again, on the Companies House register, many people are registered for hundreds of companies. As a red flag in the system, that should stand out to Companies House, which should be able to ask, “Is this person a real director?” and do more investigation. Our amendment would encourage that.</p><p>I am quite pleased to see that Government amendments 30 and 32 would give Scottish Ministers the power to present a petition to wind up Scottish limited partnerships, which have been comprehensively abused for several years now. That has been a real problem, and giving Scottish Ministers the power to do something about it is important. Although they are called “Scottish limited partnerships”, they have in practice very little to do with the Scottish Government, who can do little about them at the moment, so that is an important power. I am grateful to Michael Clancy of the Law Society of Scotland, who I hope is correct in his belief that that is a practical and useful measure. Will the Minister outline whether he has had any further discussions with Scottish Ministers, and how he thinks the power would work in practice?</p><p>I am prepared to leave my remarks at that—I appreciate that other Members want to get in and discuss other things—but I will leave the Minister with a quote from a Bill Committee evidence session on 25 October. Bill Browder, who has been a great champion of corporate transparency and standing against corruption internationally, told the Committee:</p><p>“You can write as many great laws as you want—there is some good stuff in this law, and good stuff in the previous laws—but if no one is going to enforce it, then you are never going to change the risk-reward and people are going to carry on doing stuff. All this will continue, and I will sit here 10 years from now making the same allegations about how this is a centre of money <span id="930" data-column-number="930"></span>laundering.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report, Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Public Bill Committee, </em>25 October 2022; c. 69, Q144.]</p><p>Nobody wants to be sitting here in 10 years—well, certainly not those of us on the SNP Benches—seeing money laundering going on unabated. We want the Government to take the opportunity that the Bill presents to close loopholes. To get that right, and get it right now, they should take the advice and knowledge that Members from across the House, and external organisations, have brought to the Bill. If the Government make the amendments and fix the Bill, they will have cross-party support for it.</p></div></div>]]></description>

		<p>I trusted a lot today. I trusted my phone to wake me on time. I trusted Uber to arrange a taxi for me, and the driver to get me to the airport safely. I trusted thousands of other drivers on the road not to ram my car on the way. At the airport, I trusted ticket agents and maintenance engineers and everyone else who keeps airlines operating. And the pilot of the plane I flew in. And thousands of other people at the airport and on the plane, any of which could have attacked me. And all the people that prepared and served my breakfast, and the entire food supply chain—any of them could have poisoned me. When I landed here, I trusted thousands more people: at the airport, on the road, in this building, in this room. And that was all before 10:30 this morning.</p>
<p>Trust is essential to society. Humans as a species are trusting. We are all sitting here, mostly strangers, confident that nobody will attack us. If we were a roomful of chimpanzees, this would be impossible. We trust many thousands of times a day. Society can’t function without it. And that we don’t even think about it is a measure of how well it all works.</p>
<p>In this talk, I am going to make several arguments. One, that there are two different kinds of trust—interpersonal trust and social trust—and that we regularly confuse them. Two, that the confusion will increase with artificial intelligence. We will make a fundamental category error. We will think of AIs as friends when they’re really just services. Three, that the corporations controlling AI systems will take advantage of our confusion to take advantage of us. They will not be trustworthy. And four, that it is the role of government to create trust in society. And therefore, it is their role to create an environment for trustworthy AI. And that means regulation. Not regulating AI, but regulating the organizations that control and use AI.</p>
<p>Okay, so let’s back up and take that all a lot slower. Trust is a complicated concept, and the word is overloaded with many meanings. There’s personal and intimate trust. When we say that we trust a friend, it is less about their specific actions and more about them as a person. It’s a general reliance that they will behave in a trustworthy manner. We trust their intentions, and know that those intentions will inform their actions. Let’s call this “interpersonal trust.”</p>
<p>There’s also the less intimate, less personal trust. We might not know someone personally, or know their motivations—but we can trust their behavior. We don’t know whether or not someone wants to steal, but maybe we can trust that they won’t. It’s really more about reliability and predictability. We’ll call this “social trust.” It’s the ability to trust strangers.</p>
<p>Interpersonal trust and social trust are both essential in society today. This is how it works. We have mechanisms that induce people to behave in a trustworthy manner, both interpersonally and socially. This, in turn, allows others to be trusting. Which enables trust in society. And that keeps society functioning. The system isn’t perfect—there are always going to be untrustworthy people—but most of us being trustworthy most of the time is good enough.</p>
<p>I wrote about this in 2012 in a book called <a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/liars-and-outliers/"><em>Liars and Outliers</em></a>. I wrote about four systems for enabling trust: our innate morals, concern about our reputations, the laws we live under, and security technologies that constrain our behavior. I wrote about how the first two are more informal than the last two. And how the last two scale better, and allow for larger and more complex societies. They enable cooperation amongst strangers.</p>
<p>What I didn’t appreciate is how different the first and last two are. Morals and reputation are person to person, based on human connection, mutual vulnerability, respect, integrity, generosity, and a lot of other things besides. These underpin interpersonal trust. Laws and security technologies are systems of trust that force us to act trustworthy. And they’re the basis of social trust.</p>
<p>Taxi driver used to be one of the country’s most dangerous professions. Uber changed that. I don’t know my Uber driver, but the rules and the technology lets us both be confident that neither of us will cheat or attack each other. We are both under constant surveillance and are competing for star rankings.</p>
<p>Lots of people write about the difference between living in a high-trust and a low-trust society. How reliability and predictability make everything easier. And what is lost when society doesn’t have those characteristics. Also, how societies move from high-trust to low-trust and vice versa. This is all about social trust.</p>
<p>That literature is important, but for this talk the critical point is that social trust scales better. You used to need a personal relationship with a banker to get a loan. Now it’s all done algorithmically, and you have many more options to choose from.</p>
<p>Social trust scales better, but embeds all sorts of bias and prejudice. That’s because, in order to scale, social trust has to be structured, system- and rule-oriented, and that’s where the bias gets embedded. And the system has to be mostly blinded to context, which removes flexibility.</p>
<p>But that scale is vital. In today’s society we regularly trust—or not—governments, corporations, brands, organizations, groups. It’s not so much that I trusted the particular pilot that flew my airplane, but instead the airline that puts well-trained and well-rested pilots in cockpits on schedule. I don’t trust the cooks and waitstaff at a restaurant, but the system of health codes they work under. I can’t even describe the banking system I trusted when I used an ATM this morning. Again, this confidence is no more than reliability and predictability.</p>
<p>Think of that restaurant again. Imagine that it’s a fast food restaurant, employing teenagers. The food is almost certainly safe—probably safer than in high-end restaurants—because of the corporate systems or reliability and predictability that is guiding their every behavior.</p>
<p>That’s the difference. You can ask a friend to deliver a package across town. Or you can pay the Post Office to do the same thing. The former is interpersonal trust, based on morals and reputation. You know your friend and how reliable they are. The second is a service, made possible by social trust. And to the extent that is a reliable and predictable service, it’s primarily based on laws and technologies. Both can get your package delivered, but only the second can become the global package delivery systems that is FedEx.</p>
<p>Because of how large and complex society has become, we have replaced many of the rituals and behaviors of interpersonal trust with security mechanisms that enforce reliability and predictability—social trust.</p>
<p>But because we use the same word for both, we regularly confuse them. And when we do that, we are making a category error.</p>
<p>And we do it all the time. With governments. With organizations. With systems of all kinds. And especially with corporations.</p>
<p>We might think of them as friends, when they are actually services. Corporations are not moral; they are precisely as immoral as the law and their reputations let them get away with.</p>
<p>So corporations regularly take advantage of their customers, mistreat their workers, pollute the environment, and lobby for changes in law so they can do even more of these things.</p>
<p>Both language and the laws make this an easy category error to make. We use the same grammar for people and corporations. We imagine that we have personal relationships with brands. We give corporations some of the same rights as people.</p>
<p>Corporations like that we make this category error—see, I just made it myself—because they profit when we think of them as friends. They use mascots and spokesmodels. They have social media accounts with personalities. They refer to themselves like they are people.</p>
<p>But they are not our friends. Corporations are not capable of having that kind of relationship.</p>
<p>We are about to make the same category error with AI. We’re going to think of them as our friends when they’re not.</p>
<p>A lot has been written about AIs as existential risk. The worry is that they will have a goal, and they will work to achieve it even if it harms humans in the process. You may have read about the “<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/artificial-intelligence-oxford_n_5689858">paperclip maximizer</a>“: an AI that has been programmed to make as many paper clips as possible, and ends up destroying the earth to achieve those ends. It’s a weird fear. Science fiction author Ted Chiang writes about it. Instead of solving all of humanity’s problems, or wandering off proving mathematical theorems that no one understands, the AI single-mindedly pursues the goal of maximizing production. Chiang’s point is that this is every corporation’s business plan. And that our fears of AI are basically fears of capitalism. Science fiction writer Charlie Stross takes this one step further, and calls corporations “<a href="https://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2018/01/dude-you-broke-the-future.html">slow AI</a>.” They are profit maximizing machines. And the most successful ones do whatever they can to achieve that singular goal.</p>
<p>And near-term AIs will be controlled by corporations. Which will use them towards that profit-maximizing goal. They won’t be our friends. At best, they’ll be useful services. More likely, they’ll spy on us and try to manipulate us.</p>
<p>This is nothing new. Surveillance is the business model of the Internet. Manipulation is the other business model of the Internet.</p>
<p>Your Google search results lead with URLs that someone paid to show to you. Your Facebook and Instagram feeds are filled with sponsored posts. Amazon searches return pages of products whose sellers paid for placement.</p>
<p>This is how the Internet works. Companies spy on us as we use their products and services. Data brokers buy that surveillance data from the smaller companies, and assemble detailed dossiers on us. Then they sell that information back to those and other companies, who combine it with data they collect in order to manipulate our behavior to serve their interests. At the expense of our own.</p>
<p>We use all of these services as if they are our agents, working on our behalf. In fact, they are double agents, also secretly working for their corporate owners. We trust them, but they are not trustworthy. They’re not friends; they’re services.</p>
<p>It’s going to be no different with AI. And the result will be much worse, for two reasons.</p>
<p>The first is that these AI systems will be more relational. We will be conversing with them, using natural language. As such, we will naturally ascribe human-like characteristics to them.</p>
<p>This relational nature will make it easier for those double agents to do their work. Did your chatbot recommend a particular airline or hotel because it’s truly the best deal, given your particular set of needs? Or because the AI company got a kickback from those providers? When you asked it to explain a political issue, did it bias that explanation towards the company’s position? Or towards the position of whichever political party gave it the most money? The conversational interface will help hide their agenda.</p>
<p>The second reason to be concerned is that these AIs will be more intimate. One of the promises of generative AI is a personal digital assistant. Acting as your advocate with others, and as a butler with you. This requires an intimacy greater than your search engine, email provider, cloud storage system, or phone. You’re going to want it with you 24/7, constantly training on everything you do. You will want it to know everything about you, so it can most effectively work on your behalf.</p>
<p>And it will help you in many ways. It will notice your moods and know what to suggest. It will anticipate your needs and work to satisfy them. It will be your therapist, life coach, and relationship counselor.</p>
<p>You will default to thinking of it as a friend. You will speak to it in natural language, and it will respond in kind. If it is a robot, it will look humanoid—or at least like an animal. It will interact with the whole of your existence, just like another person would.</p>
<p>The natural language interface is critical here. We are primed to think of others who speak our language as people. And we sometimes have trouble thinking of others who speak a different language that way. We make that category error with obvious non-people, like cartoon characters. We will naturally have a “theory of mind” about any AI we talk with.</p>
<p>More specifically, we tend to assume that something’s implementation is the same as its interface. That is, we assume that things are the same on the inside as they are on the surface. Humans are like that: we’re people through and through. A government is systemic and bureaucratic on the inside. You’re not going to mistake it for a person when you interact with it. But this is the category error we make with corporations. We sometimes mistake the organization for its spokesperson. AI has a fully relational interface—it talks like a person—but it has an equally fully systemic implementation. Like a corporation, but much more so. The implementation and interface are more divergent of anything we have encountered to dateby a lot.</p>
<p>And you will want to trust it. It will use your mannerisms and cultural references. It will have a convincing voice, a confident tone, and an authoritative manner. Its personality will be optimized to exactly what you like and respond to.</p>
<p>It will act trustworthy, but it will not be trustworthy. We won’t know how they are trained. We won’t know their secret instructions. We won’t know their biases, either accidental or deliberate.</p>
<p>We do know that they are built at enormous expense, mostly in secret, by profit-maximizing corporations for their own benefit.</p>
<p>It’s no accident that these corporate AIs have a human-like interface. There’s nothing inevitable about that. It’s a design choice. It could be designed to be less personal, less human-like, more obviously a service—like a search engine . The companies behind those AIs want you to make the friend/service category error. It will exploit your mistaking it for a friend. And you might not have any choice but to use it.</p>
<p>There is something we haven’t discussed when it comes to trust: power. Sometimes we have no choice but to trust someone or something because they are powerful. We are forced to trust the local police, because they’re the only law enforcement authority in town. We are forced to trust some corporations, because there aren’t viable alternatives. To be more precise, we have no choice but to entrust ourselves to them. We will be in this same position with AI. We will have no choice but to entrust ourselves to their decision-making.</p>
<p>The friend/service confusion will help mask this power differential. We will forget how powerful the corporation behind the AI is, because we will be fixated on the person we think the AI is.</p>
<p>So far, we have been talking about one particular failure that results from overly trusting AI. We can call it something like “hidden exploitation.” There are others. There’s outright fraud, where the AI is actually trying to steal stuff from you. There’s the more prosaic mistaken expertise, where you think the AI is more knowledgeable than it is because it acts confidently. There’s incompetency, where you believe that the AI can do something it can’t. There’s inconsistency, where you mistakenly expect the AI to be able to repeat its behaviors. And there’s illegality, where you mistakenly trust the AI to obey the law. There are probably more ways trusting an AI can fail.</p>
<p>All of this is a long-winded way of saying that we need trustworthy AI. AI whose behavior, limitations, and training are understood. AI whose biases are understood, and corrected for. AI whose goals are understood. That won’t secretly betray your trust to someone else.</p>
<p>The market will not provide this on its own. Corporations are profit maximizers, at the expense of society. And the incentives of surveillance capitalism are just too much to resist.</p>
<p>It’s government that provides the underlying mechanisms for the social trust essential to society. Think about contract law. Or laws about property, or laws protecting your personal safety. Or any of the health and safety codes that let you board a plane, eat at a restaurant, or buy a pharmaceutical without worry.</p>
<p>The more you can trust that your societal interactions are reliable and predictable, the more you can ignore their details. Places where governments don’t provide these things are not good places to live.</p>
<p>Government can do this with AI. We need AI transparency laws. When it is used. How it is trained. What biases and tendencies it has. We need laws regulating AI—and robotic—safety. When it is permitted to affect the world. We need laws that enforce the trustworthiness of AI. Which means the ability to recognize when those laws are being broken. And penalties sufficiently large to incent trustworthy behavior.</p>
<p>Many countries are contemplating AI safety and security laws—the EU is the furthest along—but I think they are making a critical mistake. They try to regulate the AIs and not the humans behind them.</p>
<p>AIs are not people; they don’t have agency. They are built by, trained by, and controlled by people. Mostly for-profit corporations. Any AI regulations should place restrictions on those people and corporations. Otherwise the regulations are making the same category error I’ve been talking about. At the end of the day, there is always a human responsible for whatever the AI’s behavior is. And it’s the human who needs to be responsible for what they do—and what their companies do. Regardless of whether it was due to humans, or AI, or a combination of both. Maybe that won’t be true forever, but it will be true in the near future. If we want trustworthy AI, we need to require trustworthy AI controllers.</p>
<p>We already have a system for this: fiduciaries. There are areas in society where trustworthiness is of paramount importance, even more than usual. Doctors, lawyers, accountants…these are all trusted agents. They need extraordinary access to our information and ourselves to do their jobs, and so they have additional legal responsibilities to act in our best interests. They have fiduciary responsibility to their clients.</p>
<p>We need the same sort of thing for our data. The idea of a data fiduciary is not new. But it’s even more vital in a world of generative AI assistants.</p>
<p>And we need one final thing: public AI models. These are systems built by academia, or non-profit groups, or government itself, that can be owned and run by individuals.</p>
<p>The term “public model” has been thrown around a lot in the AI world, so it’s worth detailing what this means. It’s not a corporate AI model that the public is free to use. It’s not a corporate AI model that the government has licensed. It’s not even an open-source model that the public is free to examine and modify.</p>
<p>A public model is a model built by the public for the public. It requires political accountability, not just market accountability. This means openness and transparency paired with a responsiveness to public demands. It should also be available for anyone to build on top of. This means universal access. And a foundation for a free market in AI innovations. This would be a counter-balance to corporate-owned AI.</p>
<p>We can never make AI into our friends. But we can make them into trustworthy services—agents and not double agents. But only if government mandates it. We can put limits on surveillance capitalism. But only if government mandates it.</p>
<p>Because the point of government is to create social trust. I started this talk by explaining the importance of trust in society, and how interpersonal trust doesn’t scale to larger groups. That other, impersonal kind of trust—social trust, reliability and predictability—is what governments create.</p>
<p>To the extent a government improves the overall trust in society, it succeeds. And to the extent a government doesn’t, it fails.</p>
<p>But they have to. We need government to constrain the behavior of corporations and the AIs they build, deploy, and control. Government needs to enforce both predictability and reliability.</p>
<p>That’s how we can create the social trust that society needs to thrive.</p>

The tooling you're quoting specifically, wiz.io and ermetic.com do an incredible amount more than just "scan for IAM misconfigurations". In fact, I understand that to be one of their most insignificant features. Yet it sounds, from the numbers being quoted (I saw the "millions" figure being thrown around), that you are equating a company purchasing wiz.io as them purchasing "tooling to scan for IAM misconfigurations" exclusively. How much does the IAM scanning tooling actually cost, and what is the material cost of delayed remediation of over-permissioned entities?</p><p>2. Were a company to introduce Slauth into their stack, are you under the impression that they would then not need to scan their IAM for misconfigurations and would therefore be able to save "millions"? Would it not be fair to say that the presence of Slauth would not remove the need for IAM scanning tools, since IAM deployments could happen out of bounds, which is not something that Slauth removes from a companies threat model?

Because micromanaging permissions is hard, and the application needs to access so much content in S3, spin up/down instances, etc. it has ec2:* and s3:<i>. Unless the organization has created a separate AWS account for this platform specifically, it's probably game over at that point.</i></p><p> An internet-facing MDM solution has a code execution vulnerability. Because the vendor didn't want to document all of the individual permissions it needs, the installation instructions specify that it should run as an account with Domain Admin permissions in AD. That is definitely game over for most organizations, because even systems that don't authenticate against AD are almost always accessed from systems that do.</p><p>Micromanaging permissions is hard in a big organization. I saw it done well, years ago, in Active Directory, but it took several FTEs who were personally interested in the topic to set up and manage, and that was a traditional big business IT environment. In a startup-style free-for-all, good luck. I don't have an opinion either way on Slauth specifically, but something that generates IAM policies procedurally seems like a step in the right direction.

It would be really great to automatically align the security policy for each component with the intent of the component's author. Tightening an overly permissive policy is an awful job. I think that it often has to be done through a long trial-and-error process; remove all the permissions, and add back permissions one by one in response to observed program failures. So it's great to see another way to avoid that tedious chore.<p>A challenge with Slauth will be to organize the generated policies in a way that makes them legible. I would like the IAM policy to help clarify its intent. Allowing each in-use API endpoint is technically required to let the service work. It might be technically following the principal of least privilege. But the endpoint-by-endpoint rules do a poor job of summarizing the purpose of the policy or how it relates to the service. One way that we do this is by having resource providers declare managed policies that allow use of the resource. So the "encabulator" provider also defines a "mutate encabulator" managed policy. Then services that need to invoke "mutate encabulator" can reference the managed policy. They don't need to compute the ARN of every endpoint. The dependent service doesn't end up with an inline policy that has detailed dependencies on the implementation details of each target resource.

Proper IAM also takes dev cycles, and may not be top priority to get a policy correct.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>There is no denying that containers have taken over the mindset of most modern teams. With containers, comes the need to have orchestration to run those containers and currently there is no real alternative to Kubernetes. Love it or hate it, it has become the standard platform we have largely adopted as an industry. If you exceed the size of docker-compose, k8s is the next step in that journey.</p><p>Despite the complexity and some of the hiccups around deploying, most organizations that use k8s that I've worked with seem to have positive feelings about it. It is reliable and the depth and width of the community support means you are never the first to encounter a problem. However Kubernetes is not a slow-moving target by infrastructure standards. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2023/12/image.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="742" height="470" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/image.png 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2023/12/image.png 742w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Kubernetes follows an N-2 support policy (meaning that the 3 most recent minor versions receive security and bug fixes) along with a <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-release/2572-release-cadence">15-week release cycle</a>. This results in a release being supported for 14 months (12 months of support and 2 months of upgrade period). If we compare that to Debian, the OS project a lot of organizations base their support cycles on, we can see the immediate difference. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2023/12/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="751" height="474" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/image-1.png 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2023/12/image-1.png 751w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Red Hat, whose entire existence is based on organizations not being able to upgrade often, shows you at what cadence some orgs can roll out large changes. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2023/12/image-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="736" height="742" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/image-2.png 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2023/12/image-2.png 736w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Now if Kubernetes adopted this cycle across OSS and cloud providers, I would say "there is solid evidence that it can be done and these clusters can be kept up to date". However cloud providers don't hold their customers to these extremely tight time windows. GCP, who has access to many of the Kubernetes maintainers and works extremely closely with the project, doesn't hold customers to anywhere near these timelines. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2023/12/image-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="795" height="358" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/image-3.png 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2023/12/image-3.png 795w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Neither does AWS or Azure. The reality is that nobody expects companies to keep pace with that cadence of releases because the tooling to do so doesn't really exist. Validating that a cluster can be upgraded and that it is safe to do so requires the use of third-party tooling or to have a pretty good understanding of what APIs are getting deprecated when. Add in time for validating in staging environments along with the sheer time involved in babysitting a Kubernetes cluster upgrade and a clear problem emerges. </p><h3 id="what-does-upgrading-a-k8s-cluster-even-look-like">What does upgrading a k8s cluster even look like?</h3><p>For those unaware of what a manual upgrade looks like, this is the rough checklist.</p><ul><li>Check all third-party extensions such as network and storage plugins</li><li>Update etcd (all instances)</li><li>Update kube-apiserver (all control plane hosts)</li><li>Update kube-controller-manager</li><li>Update kube-scheduler</li><li>Update the cloud controller manager, if you use one</li><li>Update kubectl </li><li>Drain every node and either replace the node or upgrade the node and then readd and monitor to ensure it continues to work</li><li>Run <code>kubectl convert</code> as required on manifests</li></ul><p>None of this is rocket science and all of it can be automated, but it still requires someone to effectively be super on top of these releases. Most importantly <strong>it is not substantially easier than making a new cluster. </strong>If upgrading is, at best, slightly easier than making a new cluster and often quite a bit harder, teams can get stuck unsure what is the correct course of action. However given the aggressive pace of releases, spinning up a new cluster for every new version and migrating services over to it can be really logistically challenging. </p><p>Consider that you don't want to be on the .0 of a k8s release, typically .2. You lose a fair amount of your 14 month window waiting for that criteria. Then you spin up the new cluster and start migrating services over to it. For most teams this involves a fair amount of duplication and wasted resources, since you will likely have double the number of nodes running for at least some period in there. CI/CD pipelines need to get modified, docs need to get changed, DNS entries have to get swapped. </p><p>None of this is impossible stuff, or even terribly difficult stuff, but it is critical and even with automation the risk of one of these steps failing silently is high risk enough that few folks I know would fire and forget. Instead clusters seem to be in a state of constant falling behind unless the teams are empowered to make keeping up with upgrades a key value they bring to the org. </p><p>My experience with this has been extremely bad, often joining teams where a cluster has been left to languish for too long and now we're running into concerns over whether it can be safely upgraded at all. Typically my first three months running an old cluster is telling leadership I need to blow our budget out a bit to spin up a new cluster and cut over to it namespace by namespace. It's not the most gentle onboarding process. </p><h3 id="proposed-lts">Proposed LTS</h3><p>I'm not suggesting that the k8s maintainers attempt to keep versions around forever. Their pace of innovation and adding new features is a key reason the platform has thrived. What I'm suggesting is a dead-end LTS with no upgrade path out of it. GKE allowed customers to be on 1.24 for 584 days and 1.26 for 572 days. Azure has a more generous LTS date of 2 years from the GA date and EKS from AWS is sitting at around 800 days that a version is supported from launch to end of LTS. </p><p>These are more in line with the pace of upgrades that organizations can safely plan for. I would propose an LTS release with a 24 months of support from GA and an understanding that the Kubernetes team can't offer an upgrade to the next LTS. The proposed workflow for operations teams would be clusters that live for 24 months and then organizations need to migrate off of them and create a new cluster. </p><p>This workflow makes sense for a lot of reasons. First creating fresh new nodes at regular intervals is best practice, allowing organizations to upgrade the underlying linux OS and hypervisor upgrades. While you should obviously be upgrading more often than every 2 years, this would be a good check-in point. It also means teams take a look at the entire stack, starting with a fresh ETCD, new versions of Ingress controllers, all the critical parts that organizations might be loathe to poke unless absolutely necessary. </p><p>I also suspect that the community would come in and offer a ton of guidance on how to upgrade from LTS to LTS, since this is a good injection point for either a commercial product or an OSS tool to assist with the process. But this wouldn't bind the maintainers to such a project, which I think is critical both for pace of innovation and just complexity. K8s is a complicated collection of software with a lot of moving pieces and testing it as-is already reaches a scale most people won't need to think about in their entire careers. I don't think its fair to put this on that same group of maintainers. </p><h3 id="lts-wg">LTS WG</h3><p>The k8s team is reviving the LTS workgroup, which was disbanded previously. I'm cautiously optimistic that this group will have more success and I hope that they can do something to make a happier middle ground between hosted platform and OSS stack. I haven't seen much from that group yet (the mailing list is empty: <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/wg-lts">https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/wg-lts</a>) and the Slack seems pretty dead as well. However I'll attempt to follow along with them as they discuss the suggestion and update if there is any movement. </p><p>I really hope the team seriously considers something like this. It would be a massive benefit to operators of k8s around the world to not have to be in a state of constantly upgrading existing clusters. It would simplify the third-party ecosystem as well, allowing for easier validation against a known-stable target that will be around for a little while. It also encourages better workflows from cluster operators, pushing them towards the correct answer of getting in the habit of making new clusters at regular intervals vs keeping clusters around forever. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>For some readers, when we talk today about ‘8-bit’ then it probably evokes a certain aesthetic : simple, blocky, colourful design. I think for anyone who was around at the time, though, it also generates a lot of nostalgia.</p><p>A whole generation, including I’m sure many Chip Letter readers, wrote their first programs on 8-bit systems. Those systems of the 1970s and the early 1980s made computing available, for the first time, to almost everyone. It was a formative time for many people who went on to build their careers in computing, and many who would play a key role in the development of modern computing.</p><p>This nostalgia explains a lot of the enduring enthusiasm for ‘8-bit’.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thechipletter.substack.com/p/the-virtues-of-the-8-bit-era-eight?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://thechipletter.substack.com/p/the-virtues-of-the-8-bit-era-eight?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p>On top of simple nostalgia, I think that there are lots of other reasons why there is so much affection for ‘8-bit’. Today’s systems are much, much more powerful and capable, but in adding that power, we’ve also lost something too. From the perspective of someone interested in how their computer worked at a ‘low-level’ and who wanted to program it at that level, then these systems had several attractions.</p><p>With some practice, you could keep the whole of an 8-bit processor’s instruction set in your head. Doing some of the things that we take for granted from hardware today (e.g. floating-point arithmetic) was difficult, but on the whole the low-level operation of these systems was much more approachable.</p><p>One side effect of simplicity, was that documenting every aspect of a computer in a single, readable, document was possible. 8-bit systems often came with great, both thorough and readable, documentation. If you wanted more then there was probably a comprehensive book covering assembly language for your processor of choice, available at your local bookstore.</p><p>Graphics and sound weren’t hidden behind ‘APIs’. There might be a rudimentary operating system but for the best performance, then you probably had to write code that interacted with the hardware directly.</p><p>High level languages were often too slow and commercial software had to be written in assembly language to get the required performance. And the simplicity of the processor design meant that it was usually possible and relatively straightforward to reason about the performance of assembly language code.</p><p>I’ve deliberately put Open Source here in inverted commas. Software of the era wasn’t open source in the modern sense. It was sometimes ‘source available’ though in the sense that software writers published their source code. I still have a copy of the book ‘Sargon : A Computer Chess Program’ which listed a chess program, written in 8080 assembly, in full.</p><p>And if the software writers didn't publish their own source then sometimes it would be disassembled and made widely available.</p><p>Perhaps most of all though, it was an era that saw a flourishing of hardware and software innovation and entrepreneurship : in microprocessors, in other semiconductors, in the computers that used them and the software that ran on those computers.</p><p>Many famous names started or flourished in this era: Intel, Apple, Microsoft, Atari, Commodore, Nintendo and others. Plus numerous less familiar names that nonetheless had a huge impact: Mostek, MOS Technology, Zilog, Acorn, and lots more. Not forgetting innovative software like VisiCalc.</p><p>And 8-bit processors never went away. They became the basis for billions of microcontrollers, hidden away in devices in homes, offices and factories.</p><p>I’m not completely overcome by nostalgia. 8-bit was the era of 64k memory, floppy disks, monochrome screens and so on.
