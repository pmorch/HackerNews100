<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="incArticle"><h2>"Additional violations of this policy may result in loss of access to GPT-4o with Reasoning."</h2><h2>Ban Hammer</h2><p>OpenAI claims that its latest AI model, code-named "Strawberry"&nbsp;and released as o1-preview,&nbsp;is supposed to be capable of "reasoning." But understanding how its <a href="https://futurism.com/openai-strawberry-thought-process-scheming">thought process</a> works, apparently, is something that the ChatGPT maker is serious about keeping off-limits.</p><p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/openai-threatens-bans-for-probing-new-ai-models-reasoning-process/"><i>Ars Technica </i>reports</a>, OpenAI is now threatening to ban users that try to get the large language model to reveal how it thinks — a glaring example of how the company has long since <a href="https://futurism.com/openai-sleazy-company-creating-agi">abandoned its original vision</a> of championing open source AI.</p><p>According to accounts on social media, users are <a href="https://x.com/MarcoFigueroa/status/1834741170024726628">receiving emails</a> from the Microsoft-backed startup informing them that their requests made to <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/chatgpt-voice-mode-scream">ChatGPT</a> have been flagged for "attempting to circumvent safeguards."</p><p>"Additional violations of this policy may result in loss of access to GPT-4o with Reasoning," the emails state.</p><h2>Hush Hush</h2><p>This clampdown is more than a bit ironic given that a lot of the hype around Strawberry was built around its "chain-of-thought" reasoning that allowed the AI to articulate how it arrived at an answer, step by step. OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/openai-o1-strawberry-problem-reasoning/">called this</a> a "new paradigm" for the technology.</p><p>Reports vary on what triggers the violations. As <i>Ars </i>found, some users claim that using the term "<a href="https://x.com/voooooogel/status/1834536216160768377">reasoning trace</a>" is what got them in trouble. Others say that even using the word "<a href="https://x.com/dyushag/status/1834379249731444820">reasoning</a>" on its own was enough to alert OpenAI's systems. Users can still see what is essentially a summary of Strawberry's thought process, but it's cobbled together by a second AI model and is heavily watered-down.</p><p>In a <a href="https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/#hiding-the-chains-of-thought">blog post</a>, OpenAI argues that it needs to hide the chain-of-thought so that it wouldn't need to put a filter on how its AI thinks, in case it says stuff that isn't compliant with safety policies while thinking out loud. That way, developers can safely see its "raw" thought process behind-the-scenes.</p><p>But as the company freely admits, this measure also helps it maintain a "competitive advantage," staving off competitors from trying to ride its coattails.</p><h2>Red Alert</h2><p>The flipside of this approach, however, is that concentrates more responsibility for aligning the language language model into the hands of OpenAI, instead of democratizing it. That poses a problem for red-teamers, or programmers that try to hack AI models to make them safer.</p><p>"I'm not at all happy about this policy decision," AI researcher Simon Willison <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/12/openai-o1/">wrote on his blog</a>, as quoted by <i>Ars</i>. "As someone who develops against LLMs, interpretability and transparency are everything to me — the idea that I can run a complex prompt and have key details of how that prompt was evaluated hidden from me feels like a big step backwards."</p><p>As it stands, it seems that OpenAI is continuing down a path of keeping its AI models an ever more opaque black box.</p><p><strong>More on OpenAI: </strong><em><a href="https://futurism.com/openai-strawberry-thought-process-scheming">OpenAI's Strawberry "Thought Process" Sometimes Shows It Scheming to Trick Users</a></em></p><br></div></div>]]></description>

<p>See Compatibility Notes below to learn about <strong>breaking or potentially breaking changes</strong> in this release.</p>
<h2>Breaking Changes and Compatibility Notes</h2>
<h3>Classic Queues is Now a Non-Replicated Queue Type</h3>
<p>After three years of deprecated, classic queue mirroring was completely removed in this version.<br>
<a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/quorum-queues" rel="nofollow">Quorum queues</a> and <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/streams" rel="nofollow">streams</a> are two mature<br>
replicated data types offered by RabbitMQ 4.x. Classic queues continue being supported without any breaking changes<br>
for client libraries and applications but they are now a non-replicated queue type.</p>
<p>After an upgrade to 4.0, all classic queue mirroring-related parts of policies will have no effect.<br>
Classic queues will continue to work like before but with only one replica.</p>
<p>Clients will be able to connect to any node to publish to and consume from any non-replicated classic queues.<br>
Therefore applications will be able to use the same classic queues as before.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/migrate-mcq-to-qq" rel="nofollow">Mirrored Classic Queues Migration to Quorum Queues</a> for guidance<br>
on how to migrate to quorum queues for the parts of the system that really need to use replication.</p>
<h3>Quorum Queues Now Have a Default Redelivery Limit</h3>
<p>Quorum queues now have a default <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/next/quorum-queues#poison-message-handling" rel="nofollow">redelivery limit</a> set to <code>20</code>.<br>
Messages that are redelivered 20 times or more will be <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/dlx" rel="nofollow">dead-lettered</a> or dropped (removed).</p>
<p>This limit is necessary to protect nodes from consumers that run into infinite fail-requeue-fail-requeue loops. Such<br>
consumers can drive a node out of disk space by making a quorum queue Raft log grow forever without allowing compaction<br>
of older entries to happen.</p>
<p>If 20 deliveries per message is a common scenario for a queue, a dead-lettering target or a higher limit must be configured<br>
for such queues. The recommended way of doing that is via a <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/parameters#policies" rel="nofollow">policy</a>.<br>
See the <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/next/quorum-queues#poison-message-handling" rel="nofollow">Position Messaging Handling</a> section<br>
in the quorum queue documentation guide.</p>
<p>Note that increasing the limit is recommended against: usually the presence of messages that have been redelivered 20 times or more suggests<br>
that a consumer has entered a fail-requeue-fail-requeue loop, in which case even a much higher limit<br>
won't help avoid the dead-lettering.</p>
<p>For specific cases where the RabbitMQ configuration cannot be updated to include a dead letter policy<br>
the delivery limit can be disabled by setting a delivery limit configuration of <code>-1</code>. However, the RabbitMQ team<br>
strongly recommends keeping the delivery limit in place to ensure cluster availability isn't<br>
accidentally sacrificed.</p>
<h3>CQv1 Storage Implementation was Removed</h3>
<p>CQv1, <a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/10656" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/10656/hovercard">the original classic queue storage layer, was removed</a><br>
except for the part that's necessary for upgrades to CQv2 (the 2nd generation).</p>
<p>In case <code>rabbitmq.conf</code> explicitly sets <code>classic_queue.default_version</code> to <code>1</code> like so</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# this configuration value is no longer supported,
# remove this line or set the version to 2
classic_queue.default_version = 1"><pre><span><span>#</span> this configuration value is no longer supported,</span>
<span><span>#</span> remove this line or set the version to 2</span>
<span>classic_queue.default_version</span> = 1</pre></div>
<p>nodes will now fail to start. Removing the line will make the node start and perform<br>
the migration from CQv1 to CQv2.</p>
<h3>Settings <code>cluster_formation.randomized_startup_delay_range.*</code> were Removed</h3>
<p>The following two deprecated <code>rabbitmq.conf</code> settings were <a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12050" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12050/hovercard">removed</a>:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cluster_formation.randomized_startup_delay_range.min
cluster_formation.randomized_startup_delay_range.max"><pre><code>cluster_formation.randomized_startup_delay_range.min
cluster_formation.randomized_startup_delay_range.max
</code></pre></div>
<p>RabbitMQ 4.0 will fail to boot if these settings are configured in <code>rabbitmq.conf</code>.</p>
<h3>Several Disk I/O-Related Metrics were Removed</h3>
<p>Several I/O-related metrics are dropped, they should be <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/monitoring#system-metrics" rel="nofollow">monitored at the infrastructure and kernel layers</a></p>
<h3>Default Maximum Message Size Reduced to 16 MiB</h3>
<p>Default maximum message size is reduced to 16 MiB (from 128 MiB).</p>
<p>The limit can be increased via a <code>rabbitmq.conf</code> setting:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# 32 MiB
max_message_size = 33554432"><pre><span><span>#</span> 32 MiB</span>
<span>max_message_size</span> = 33554432</pre></div>
<p>However, it is recommended that such large multi-MiB messages are put into a blob store, and their<br>
IDs are passed around in messages instead of the entire payload.</p>
<h3>AMQP 1.0</h3>
<p>RabbitMQ 3.13 <code>rabbitmq.conf</code> setting <code>rabbitmq_amqp1_0.default_vhost</code> is unsupported in RabbitMQ 4.0.</p>
<p>Instead <code>default_vhost</code> will be used to determine the default vhost an AMQP 1.0 client connects to(i.e. when the AMQP 1.0 client<br>
does not define the vhost in the <code>hostname</code> field of the <code>open</code> frame).</p>
<p>Starting with RabbitMQ 4.0, RabbitMQ strictly validates that<br>
<a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0-os.html#type-delivery-annotations" rel="nofollow">delivery annotations</a>,<br>
<a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0-os.html#type-message-annotations" rel="nofollow">message annotations</a>, and<br>
<a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0-os.html#type-footer" rel="nofollow">footer</a> contain only<br>
<a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0-os.html#type-annotations" rel="nofollow">non-reserved annotation keys</a>.<br>
As a result, clients can only send symbolic keys that begin with <code>x-</code>.</p>
<h3>MQTT</h3>
<p>RabbitMQ 3.13 <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/configure#config-file" rel="nofollow">rabbitmq.conf</a> settings <code>mqtt.default_user</code>, <code>mqtt.default_password</code>,<br>
and <code>amqp1_0.default_user</code> are unsupported in RabbitMQ 4.0.</p>
<p>Instead, set the new RabbitMQ 4.0 settings <code>anonymous_login_user</code> and <code>anonymous_login_pass</code> (both values default to <code>guest</code>).<br>
For production scenarios, <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/next/production-checklist#anonymous-login" rel="nofollow">disallow anonymous logins</a>.</p>
<h3>TLS Client (LDAP, Shovels, Federation) Defaults</h3>
<p>Starting with Erlang 26, client side <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/ssl#peer-verification" rel="nofollow">TLS peer certificate chain verification</a> settings are enabled by default in most contexts:<br>
from federation links to shovels to TLS-enabled LDAP client connections.</p>
<p>If using TLS peer certificate chain verification is not practical or necessary, it can be disabled.<br>
Please refer to the docs of the feature in question, for example,<br>
this one <a href="http://rabbitmq.com/docs/ldap/#tls" rel="nofollow">on TLS-enabled LDAP client</a> connections,<br>
two others on <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/shovel#tls" rel="nofollow">TLS-enabled dynamic shovels</a> and <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/uri-query-parameters" rel="nofollow">dynamic shovel URI query parameters</a>.</p>
<h3>Shovels</h3>
<p>RabbitMQ Shovels will be able connect to a RabbitMQ 4.0 node via AMQP 1.0 only when the Shovel runs on a RabbitMQ node &gt;= <code>3.13.7</code>.</p>
<p>TLS-enabled Shovels will be affected by the TLS client default changes in Erlang 26 (see above).</p>
<h2>Erlang/OTP Compatibility Notes</h2>
<p>This release <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/which-erlang" rel="nofollow">requires Erlang 26.2</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/which-erlang#erlang-repositories" rel="nofollow">Provisioning Latest Erlang Releases</a> explains<br>
what package repositories and tools can be used to provision latest patch versions of Erlang 26.x.</p>
<h2>Release Artifacts</h2>
<p>RabbitMQ releases are distributed via <a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases">GitHub</a>.<br>
<a href="https://rabbitmq.com/docs/install-debian/" rel="nofollow">Debian</a> and <a href="https://rabbitmq.com/docs/install-rpm/" rel="nofollow">RPM packages</a> are available via<br>
repositories maintained by the RabbitMQ Core Team.</p>
<p><a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq/" rel="nofollow">Community Docker image</a>, <a href="https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/rabbitmq" rel="nofollow">Chocolatey package</a>, and the <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/install-homebrew" rel="nofollow">Homebrew formula</a><br>
are other installation options. They are updated with a delay.</p>
<h2>Upgrading to 4.0</h2>
<h3>Documentation guides on upgrades</h3>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/upgrade" rel="nofollow">Upgrading guide</a> for documentation on upgrades and <a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases">GitHub releases</a><br>
for release notes of individual releases.</p>
<p>This release series only supports upgrades from <code>3.13.x</code>.</p>
<p>This release requires <strong>all feature flags</strong> in the 3.x series (specifically <code>3.13.x</code>) to be enabled before upgrading,<br>
there is no upgrade path from 3.12.14 (or a later patch release) straight to <code>4.0.0</code>.</p>
<h3>Required Feature Flags</h3>
<p>This release <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/feature-flags#graduation" rel="nofollow">graduates</a> all feature flags introduced up to <code>3.13.0</code>.</p>
<p>All users must enable all stable [feature flags] before upgrading to 4.0 from<br>
the latest available 3.13.x patch release.</p>
<h3>Mixed version cluster compatibility</h3>
<p>RabbitMQ 4.0.0 nodes can run alongside <code>3.13.x</code> nodes. <code>4.0.x</code>-specific features can only be made available when all nodes in the cluster<br>
upgrade to 4.0.0 or a later patch release in the new series.</p>
<p>While operating in mixed version mode, some aspects of the system may not behave as expected. The list of known behavior changes will be covered in future updates.<br>
Once all nodes are upgraded to 4.0.0, these irregularities will go away.</p>
<p>Mixed version clusters are a mechanism that allows rolling upgrade and are not meant to be run for extended<br>
periods of time (no more than a few hours).</p>
<h3>Recommended Post-upgrade Procedures</h3>
<h4>Configure Dead Lettering or Increase the Limit for Frequently Redelivered Messages</h4>
<p>In environments where messages can experience 20 redeliveries, the affected queues should have <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/dlx" rel="nofollow">dead lettering</a><br>
configured (usually via a <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/parameters#policies" rel="nofollow">policy</a>) to make sure<br>
that messages that are redelivered 20 times are moved to a separate queue (or stream) instead of<br>
being dropped (removed) by the <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/next/quorum-queues#poison-message-handling" rel="nofollow">crash-requeue-redelivery loop protection mechanism</a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the limit can be <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/next/quorum-queues#poison-message-handling" rel="nofollow">increased</a> using a policy.<br>
This option is recommended against: usually the presence of messages that have been redelivered 20 times or more suggests<br>
that a consumer has entered a fail-requeue-fail-requeue loop, in which case even a much higher limit<br>
won't help avoid the dead-lettering.</p>
<h2>Changes Worth Mentioning</h2>
<p>This section is incomplete and will be expanded as 4.0 approaches its release candidate stage.</p>

<p dir="auto"><a href="https://kyutai.org/Moshi.pdf" rel="nofollow">Moshi</a> is a speech-text foundation model and <strong>full-duplex</strong> spoken dialogue framework.
It uses <a href="https://kyutai.org/Moshi.pdf" rel="nofollow">Mimi</a>, a state-of-the-art streaming neural audio codec. Mimi processes 24 kHz audio, down to a 12.5 Hz representation
with a bandwidth of 1.1 kbps, in a fully streaming manner (latency of 80ms, the frame size),
yet performs better than existing, non-streaming, codec like
<a href="https://github.com/ZhangXInFD/SpeechTokenizer">SpeechTokenizer</a> (50 Hz, 4kbps), or <a href="https://github.com/haoheliu/SemantiCodec-inference">SemantiCodec</a> (50 Hz, 1.3kbps).</p>
<p dir="auto">Moshi models <strong>two streams of audio</strong>: one corresponds to Moshi, and the other one to the user.
At inference, the stream from the user is taken from the audio input,
and the one for Moshi is sampled from the model's output. Along these two audio streams, Moshi predicts text tokens corresponding to its own speech, its <strong>inner monologue</strong>,
which greatly improves the quality of its generation. A small Depth Transformer models inter codebook dependencies for a given time step,
while a large, 7B parameter Temporal Transformer models the temporal dependencies. Moshi achieves a theoretical latency
of 160ms (80ms for the frame size of Mimi + 80ms of acoustic delay), with a practical overall latency as low as 200ms on an L4 GPU.</p>

At inference, the audio stream of the user is taken from the audio input, and the audio stream for Moshi is sampled from the model's output. Along that, Moshi predicts text tokens corresponding to its own speech for improved accuracy. A small Depth Transformer models inter codebook dependencies for a given step." width="650px"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Mimi builds on previous neural audio codecs such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03312" rel="nofollow">SoundStream</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/encodec">EnCodec</a>, adding a Transformer both in the encoder and decoder,
and adapting the strides to match an overall frame rate of 12.5 Hz. This allows Mimi to get closer to the
average frame rate of text tokens (~3-4 Hz), and limit the number of autoregressive steps in Moshi.
Similarly to SpeechTokenizer, Mimi uses a distillation loss so that the first codebook tokens match
a self-supervised representation from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13900" rel="nofollow">WavLM</a>, which allows modeling semantic and acoustic information with a single model. Interestingly, while Mimi is fully causal and streaming, it learns to match sufficiently well the non-causal
representation from WavLM, without introducing any delays. Finally, and similarly to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.14090" rel="nofollow">EBEN</a>,
Mimi uses <strong>only an adversarial training loss</strong>, along with feature matching, showing strong improvements in terms of
subjective quality despite its low bitrate.</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python -m moshi.server [--gradio-tunnel] [--hf-repo kyutai/moshika-pytorch-bf16]"><pre>python -m moshi.server [--gradio-tunnel] [--hf-repo kyutai/moshika-pytorch-bf16]</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">And then access the web UI on <a href="http://localhost:8998/" rel="nofollow">localhost:8998</a>. If your GPU is on a distant machine
with no direct access, <code>--gradio-tunnel</code> will create a tunnel with a URL accessible from anywhere.
Keep in mind that this tunnel goes through the US and can add significant latency (up to 500ms from Europe).
You can use <code>--gradio-tunnel-token</code> to set a fixed secret token and reuse the same address over time.
Alternatively, you might want to use SSH to redirect your connection.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can use <code>--hf-repo</code> to select a different pretrained model, by setting the proper Hugging Face repository.</p>
<p dir="auto">Accessing a server that is not localhost via http may cause issues with using
the microphone in the web UI (in some browsers this is only allowed using
https).</p>
<p dir="auto">A local client is also available, as</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python -m moshi.client [--url URL_TO_GRADIO]"><pre>python -m moshi.client [--url URL_TO_GRADIO]</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">However note that, unlike the web browser, this client is barebone: It does not perform any echo cancellation,
nor does it try to compensate for a growing lag by skipping frames.</p>
<p dir="auto">For more information, in particular on how to use the API directly, please
checkout <a href="https://github.com/kyutai-labs/moshi/blob/main/moshi/README.md">moshi/README.md</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">Once you have installed <code>moshi_mlx</code>, you can run</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python -m moshi_mlx.local -q 4   # weights quantized to 4 bits

<span><span>#</span> be careful to always match the `-q` and `--hf-repo` flag.</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This command line interface is also barebone. It does not perform any echo cancellation,
nor does it try to compensate for a growing lag by skipping frames.</p>
<p dir="auto">Alternatively you can run <code>python -m moshi_mlx.local_web</code> to use
the web UI, the connection is via http and will be at <a href="http://localhost:8998/" rel="nofollow">localhost:8998</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Rust</h2><a id="user-content-rust" aria-label="Permalink: Rust" href="#rust"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In order to run the Rust inference server, use the following command from within
the <code>rust</code> directory:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cargo run --features cuda --bin moshi-backend -r -- --config moshi-backend/config.json standalone"><pre>cargo run --features cuda --bin moshi-backend -r -- --config moshi-backend/config.json standalone</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">When using macOS, you can replace <code>--features cuda</code> with <code>--features metal</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Alternatively you can use <code>config-q8.json</code> rather than <code>config.json</code> to use the
quantized q8 model. You can select a different pretrained model, e.g. Moshika,
by changing the <code>"hf_repo"</code> key in either file.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once the server has printed 'standalone worker listening', you can use the web
UI. By default the Rust server uses https so it will be at
<a href="https://localhost:8998/" rel="nofollow">localhost:8998</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">You will get warnings about the site being unsafe. When using chrome you
can bypass these by selecting "Details" or "Advanced", then "Visit this unsafe
site" or "Proceed to localhost (unsafe)".</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Clients</h2><a id="user-content-clients" aria-label="Permalink: Clients" href="#clients"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We recommend using the web UI as it provides additional echo cancellation that helps
the overall model quality. Note that most command will directly serve this UI
in the provided URL, and there is in general nothing more to do.</p>
<p dir="auto">Alternatively, we provide command line interfaces
for the Rust and Python versions, the protocol is the same as with the web UI so
there is nothing to change on the server side.</p>
<p dir="auto">For reference, here is the list of clients for Moshi.</p>

  <h4>Give Us your Best (Or Worst) Zero-day VulnS.</h4><blockquote><pre><code>The Junkyard is a platform to showcase novel security research and support hobby and career development for security researchers.

We want you to bring your most impactful, creative, or most meme-worthy bugs in end-of-life (EOL) products, and demonstrate them live on stage. 

Winners get 💰 prizes 💰 to further future vulnerability research. First 20 submissions accepted will get additional swag!</code></pre></blockquote><h4>What’s In SCOPE? </h4><blockquote><pre><code>Any product (software or hardware) publicly listed by the vendor as EOL-ed at least one day before submission.
</code></pre><pre><code>In keeping with the conference ethos, we also require that:</code></pre><pre><code>- You commit as the researcher to responsible disclosure of the vulnerability (60-90 day disclosure windows with vendor);&nbsp;</code></pre><pre><code>- You conducted your research in accordance with US law and ethical practices; and</code></pre><pre><code>- You are not under any restrictions or sanctions from the US. </code></pre></blockquote><h4>PRIZES</h4><blockquote><pre><code>Prizes will depend on final sponsorship support, but are expected to range from <span data-text-attribute-id="91e7ca3d-2f2e-4329-86c9-dfc08b4b08f7">$100 to $5,000 USD</span>. These may change in cases of exceptional brilliance or lack thereof. All prizes and acceptance of results to the event are at DistrictCon’s sole discretion.
</code></pre><pre><code><span data-text-attribute-id="73c07bd6-ef0e-43f0-8094-b6baddc50c8d">Prizes will be awarded in the following categories to the top 2 scorers</span> (winner and runner up), so plan accordingly:</code></pre><p>❗ Most Impactful System ❗</p><p>🤡 Best Meme Target 🤡 </p><p>😈 Most Innovative Exploitation Technique 😈</p></blockquote><h4>WHAT SHOULD I EXPECT / How does the contest work?</h4><blockquote><pre><code>1️⃣ <span data-text-attribute-id="8a35ceb8-b046-4c89-b8c0-e1795c9edd31">Submit Your Target to DistrictCon
</span>
- Fill out the form on this page, tell us what target you're exploiting, and how much help you'll need with disclosure. Get proof that the target is EOL.

2️⃣ <span data-text-attribute-id="c3955729-e12f-41b2-bb99-e3384ea686eb">Disclose the Bug to the Vendor 
</span>
- We can help if needed!
 
3️⃣ <span data-text-attribute-id="d76b7490-2b52-4191-bc09-91b5d63d09e5">Create a Cover Name, 5-10 Min Talk + Demo</span>

- Attendees won’t know what your target will be until you reveal it on stage! The cover name is for the agenda.

4️⃣ <span data-text-attribute-id="a82afb1f-af00-494d-8e45-378c3b1ba9f0">Give us your Target Ahead of Time to Prep for Demo</span>

- We'll restore the target to a default configuration (in consultation with you) and prepare to have it on-stage for you to demonstrate against. If this doesn’t work for you, the item is big, etc - we’ll work with you for a video option, or try and source the device locally. 

5️⃣ <span data-text-attribute-id="f3ca0378-ac3b-4e4d-9779-3f4c963cd82a">Compete and Win!</span> 💰

When you come up on stage, you’ll share:</code></pre><pre><code>- Who you are, as much as you want</code></pre><pre><code>- The target, and why it matters</code></pre><pre><code>- Demonstrate the bug, explain how it works and the impact.

- Nothing will be live-streamed or recorded without your permission.</code></pre></blockquote><h4>Frequently asked Questions</h4><blockquote><pre><code><span data-text-attribute-id="ee601f96-5148-4251-b275-aa13197193f7">1) Is an EOL software or product in scope, even if there are components within it that are not EOL?
</span>
A: Yes, but there are caveats: the spirit of this event is to help identify and notify vendors of vulnerabilities in EOL software or products, and all submissions should be in this spirit.
If an EOL item has components that are not EOL within it, that’s fine. However, non-EOL components should not be the focus of the vulnerability or chain - we are not looking for exploits in current systems. If you have questions, please reach out via the submission process and we will work with you to ensure the submission is appropriate for the event.</code></pre><pre><code>
<span data-text-attribute-id="a64773bc-7087-4f7b-8765-1464461c1fb0">2) What should my Junkyard pitch at DistrictCon look like? </span>

For the maximum audience enjoyment and clarity of your awesome work, we prefer you presenting a live demo against the EOL system. We know this won't always be practical, so we will work with you during submission review to find the right way. As part of your demonstrated chain, the judges are (among other things) looking for proof of control and execution. 

Given the broad swath of valid targets, we know this may differ in what that means, but two "traditional" examples are to pop a shell and confirm root privileges, or demonstrate arbitrary code execution.</code></pre><pre><code>
<span data-text-attribute-id="4f60b934-ec85-40cd-99e1-da056f2b6634">3) What is EOL for Open Source, specifically with an archived repository? </span>

If the software you’re attempting to exploit is an archived repository, first ask if (a) the software moved to a new home and (b) is the archived repo a fork and the substantially similar project is still active? 

If the maintainer confirms they are not maintaining the given version or product, you should be good to go. Otherwise feel free to reach out to the DistrictCon Junkyard Team via the submission process, or via outreach@districtcon.org with additional questions.</code></pre></blockquote><h4>I have More questions.</h4><blockquote><pre><code>Additional details such as the responsible disclosure timelines and any assistance from the conference will be published when available. Please contact outreach@districtcon.org for more details.</code></pre><pre><code>In the case of similar bugs, our team will work privately with the submitters to deduplicate appropriately. </code></pre></blockquote>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What is Codon?</h2><a id="user-content-what-is-codon" aria-label="Permalink: What is Codon?" href="#what-is-codon"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Codon is a high-performance Python implementation that compiles to native machine code without
any runtime overhead. Typical speedups over vanilla Python are on the order of 10-100x or more, on
a single thread. Codon's performance is typically on par with (and sometimes better than) that of
C/C++. Unlike Python, Codon supports native multithreading, which can lead to speedups many times
higher still.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Think of Codon as Python reimagined for static, ahead-of-time compilation, built from the ground
up with best possible performance in mind.</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Goals</h3><a id="user-content-goals" aria-label="Permalink: Goals" href="#goals"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>💡 <strong>No learning curve:</strong> Be as close to CPython as possible in terms of syntax, semantics and libraries</li>
<li>🚀 <strong>Top-notch performance:</strong> At <em>least</em> on par with low-level languages like C, C++ or Rust</li>
<li>💻 <strong>Hardware support:</strong> Full, seamless support for multicore programming, multithreading (no GIL!), GPU and more</li>
<li>📈 <strong>Optimizations:</strong> Comprehensive optimization framework that can target high-level Python constructs
and libraries</li>
<li>🔋 <strong>Interoperability:</strong> Full interoperability with Python's ecosystem of packages and libraries</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Non-goals</h3><a id="user-content-non-goals" aria-label="Permalink: Non-goals" href="#non-goals"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">❌ <em>Drop-in replacement for CPython:</em> Codon is not a drop-in replacement for CPython. There are some
aspects of Python that are not suitable for static compilation — we don't support these in Codon.
There are ways to use Codon in larger Python codebases via its <a href="https://docs.exaloop.io/codon/interoperability/decorator" rel="nofollow">JIT decorator</a>
or <a href="https://docs.exaloop.io/codon/interoperability/pyext" rel="nofollow">Python extension backend</a>. Codon also supports
calling any Python module via its <a href="https://docs.exaloop.io/codon/interoperability/python" rel="nofollow">Python interoperability</a>.
See also <a href="https://docs.exaloop.io/codon/general/differences" rel="nofollow"><em>"Differences with Python"</em></a> in the docs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">❌ <em>New syntax and language constructs:</em> We try to avoid adding new syntax, keywords or other language
features as much as possible. While Codon does add some new syntax in a couple places (e.g. to express
parallelism), we try to make it as familiar and intuitive as possible.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr">Inside a bustling unit at St. Michael's Hospital in downtown Toronto, one of Shirley Bell's patients was suffering from a cat&nbsp;bite and a fever, but otherwise appeared fine — until an alert from an AI-based early warning system showed he was sicker than he seemed.</p><p dir="ltr">While the nursing team usually checked blood work around noon, the technology flagged incoming results several hours beforehand. That warning showed&nbsp;the patient's white blood cell count was "really, really high,"&nbsp;recalled Bell, the clinical nurse educator for the hospital's general medicine program.</p><p dir="ltr">The cause turned out to be cellulitis, a bacterial skin infection. Without prompt treatment, it can lead to extensive tissue damage, amputations&nbsp;and even death. Bell said the patient was given antibiotics quickly to avoid those worst-case scenarios, in large part thanks to the team's in-house AI technology, dubbed Chartwatch.</p><p dir="ltr">"There's lots and lots of other scenarios where patients' conditions are flagged earlier, and the nurse is alerted earlier, and interventions are put in earlier," she said. "It's not replacing the nurse at the bedside; it's actually enhancing your nursing care."</p><p dir="ltr">A year-and-a-half-long study on Chartwatch, <a href="https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.240132"><u>published Monday</u></a> in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, found that use of the AI system led to a striking 26 per cent drop in the number of unexpected deaths among hospitalized patients.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're glad to see that we're saving lives," said co-author Dr. Muhammad Mamdani, vice-president of data science and advanced analytics at Unity Health Toronto and director of the University of Toronto Temerty Faculty of Medicine Centre for AI Research and Education in Medicine.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir="ltr">'A promising sign'</h2><p dir="ltr">The research team looked at more than 13,000 admissions to St. Michael's general internal medicine ward — an 84-bed unit caring for some of the hospital's most complex patients — to compare the impact of the tool among that patient population to thousands of admissions into other subspecialty units.&nbsp;</p><div dir="ltr"><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/waive-the-wait-paperwork-doctors-1.7176165" text="This northern Ontario company is using AI to reduce paperwork at doctors' offices" flag="" data-contentid=""><span>This northern Ontario company is using AI to reduce paperwork at doctors' offices</span></a></li></ul></div><p dir="ltr">"At the same time period in the other units in our hospital that were not using Chartwatch, we did not see a change in these unexpected deaths," said lead author Dr. Amol Verma, a clinician-scientist at St. Michael's, one of three Unity Health Toronto hospital network sites, and Temerty professor of AI research and education in medicine at University of Toronto.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">"That was a promising sign."</p><div dir="ltr"><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-artificial-intelligence-1.6994961" text="AI will be critical for the future of rural health care in Canada, experts say" flag="" data-contentid=""><span>AI will be critical for the future of rural health care in Canada, experts say</span></a></li></ul></div><p dir="ltr">The Unity Health AI team started developing Chartwatch back in 2017, based on suggestions from staff that predicting deaths or serious illness could be key areas where machine learning could make a positive difference.</p><p dir="ltr">The technology underwent several years of rigorous development and testing before it was deployed in October&nbsp;2020, Verma said.</p><div dir="ltr"><figure><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Dr. Amol Verma, a clinician-scientist at St. Michael’s Hospital who helped lead the creation and testing of CHARTwatch, stands at a computer." srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.7322732.1726245155!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/dr-amol-verma.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7322732.1726245155!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/dr-amol-verma.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7322732.1726245155!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/dr-amol-verma.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7322732.1726245155!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/dr-amol-verma.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7322732.1726245155!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/dr-amol-verma.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.7322732.1726245155!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/dr-amol-verma.jpg" data-cy="image-img"></p><figcaption>Verma simulates the tool's use inside the downtown Toronto health-care facility.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Evan Mitsui/CBC)</figcaption></figure></div><p dir="ltr">"Chartwatch measures about 100 inputs from [a patient's] medical record that are currently routinely gathered in the process of delivering care," he explained.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/rspeer/wordfreq/blob/master/SUNSET.md">https://github.com/rspeer/wordfreq/blob/master/SUNSET.md</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41578483">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true" aria-labelledby="file-name-id-wide file-name-id-mobile"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why wordfreq will not be updated</h2><a id="user-content-why-wordfreq-will-not-be-updated" aria-label="Permalink: Why wordfreq will not be updated" href="#why-wordfreq-will-not-be-updated"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The wordfreq data is a snapshot of language that could be found in various
online sources up through 2021. There are several reasons why it will not be
updated anymore.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Generative AI has polluted the data</h2><a id="user-content-generative-ai-has-polluted-the-data" aria-label="Permalink: Generative AI has polluted the data" href="#generative-ai-has-polluted-the-data"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I don't think anyone has reliable information about post-2021 language usage by
humans.</p>
<p dir="auto">The open Web (via OSCAR) was one of wordfreq's data sources. Now the Web at
large is full of slop generated by large language models, written by no one to
communicate nothing. Including this slop in the data skews the word
frequencies.</p>
<p dir="auto">Sure, there was spam in the wordfreq data sources, but it was manageable and
often identifiable. Large language models generate text that masquerades as
real language with intention behind it, even though there is none, and their
output crops up everywhere.</p>
<p dir="auto">As one example, <a href="https://pshapira.net/2024/03/31/delving-into-delve/" rel="nofollow">Philip Shapira
reports</a> that ChatGPT
(OpenAI's popular brand of generative language model circa 2024) is obsessed
with the word "delve" in a way that people never have been, and caused its
overall frequency to increase by an order of magnitude.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Information that used to be free became expensive</h2><a id="user-content-information-that-used-to-be-free-became-expensive" aria-label="Permalink: Information that used to be free became expensive" href="#information-that-used-to-be-free-became-expensive"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">wordfreq is not just concerned with formal printed words. It collected more
conversational language usage from two sources in particular: Twitter and
Reddit.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Twitter data was always built on sand. Even when Twitter allowed free
access to a portion of their "firehose", the terms of use did not allow me to
distribute that data outside of the company where I collected it (Luminoso).
wordfreq has the frequencies that were built with that data as input, but the
collected data didn't belong to me and I don't have it anymore.</p>
<p dir="auto">Now Twitter is gone anyway, its public APIs have shut down, and the site has
been replaced with an oligarch's plaything, a spam-infested right-wing cesspool
called X. Even if X made its raw data feed available (which it doesn't), there
would be no valuable information to be found there.</p>
<p dir="auto">Reddit also stopped providing public data archives, and now they sell their
archives at a price that only OpenAI will pay.</p>
<p dir="auto">And given what's happening to the field, I don't blame them.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">I don't want to be part of this scene anymore</h2><a id="user-content-i-dont-want-to-be-part-of-this-scene-anymore" aria-label="Permalink: I don't want to be part of this scene anymore" href="#i-dont-want-to-be-part-of-this-scene-anymore"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">wordfreq used to be at the intersection of my interests. I was doing corpus
linguistics in a way that could also benefit natural language processing tools.</p>
<p dir="auto">The field I know as "natural language processing" is hard to find these days.
It's all being devoured by generative AI. Other techniques still exist but
generative AI sucks up all the air in the room and gets all the money. It's
rare to see NLP research that doesn't have a dependency on closed data
controlled by OpenAI and Google, two companies that I already despise.</p>
<p dir="auto">wordfreq was built by collecting a whole lot of text in a lot of languages.
That used to be a pretty reasonable thing to do, and not the kind of thing
someone would be likely to object to. Now, the text-slurping tools are mostly
used for training generative AI, and people are quite rightly on the defensive.
If someone is collecting all the text from your books, articles, Web site, or
public posts, it's very likely because they are creating a plagiarism machine
that will claim your words as its own.</p>
<p dir="auto">So I don't want to work on anything that could be confused with generative AI,
or that could benefit generative AI.</p>
<p dir="auto">OpenAI and Google can collect their own damn data. I hope they have to pay a
very high price for it, and I hope they're constantly cursing the mess that
they made themselves.</p>

    <p>There was a time when software (and games! Games are just software for fun!) were distributed on DVD. A physical disk that you would insert into your system to load up software and install. This was the 2000's, when computers prided themselves on being personal computation devices. A <a href="https://www.google.com/chromebook/">Chromebook</a> was a curiosity at the time, promising to run most of your software in "someone else's computer"; all you needed was the internet and the interface. The Chromebook was a reckoning. Through the 2010's we slowly moved into the clouds of various giants; it was the easy way to compute. The giants were renting out services - subscriptions started gaining foothold as the second best way to make money online after advertisements - and we were happy to give away the control in exchange for convenience. A minor consequence of this is that an entire generation of computer scientists hasn't had the opportunity to start off as computer enthusiasts - the primordial hacker mindset is slowly waning in prominence.</p>
<p>It is 2024, and I say it is time we revisited some of the fundamental joys of setting up our own systems.</p>
<p>Why? Good question.</p>
<ul>
<li>Philosophically, it is a form of rebellion, carving out a niche in a world dominated by monopolies, resisting the forces that be from having complete control over our digital selves. Showing the world a <em>different</em> way of living. One of the last bastions of online freedom, self-hosters stand alongside open-source-ers, data-hoard-ers, privacy-ers, matrix/activity-pub/decentralized-tech-ers, piracy-ers, de-google-ers and hack-ers.</li>
<li>Practically, it is foolishness, for what you save in money you lose in time and sanity. Seriously, else-hosting is the practical option, let someone else worry about the reliability, concurrency, redundancy and availability of your systems.</li>
<li>Intellectually, it is the digital garage of constant tweaking of systems, a source of zen and arcane knowledge. Where you retire after a day's work to work on your favourite toys.</li>
</ul>
<p>So most importantly, it is supposed to be fun. A hobby.</p>
<p>And like every hobby there are a lot of gatekeepers. People who believe having a personal server that you can <em>touch</em> is a necessity to call yourself a self-hoster. Eh. Don't listen to them. Self-hosting is as much about the software as it is about the hardware. I say we get the enthusiasts by any means necessary; they will eventually grow into full-fledged self-hosting. Or not. It doesn't matter! This is supposed to be fun, why are you stopping people from having fun?</p>
<p>And so, here is a gentle introduction to self-hosting that is not "true self-hosting", but whatever. Sue me. We will operate at the software level only, and laugh at the feeble protestations of the rigidly-defined self-hoster loyalists. We will dispense with the heavy prose after this point.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/knhash/uberspace.png" alt="uberspace"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A shared web hosting service is a web hosting service where many services reside on one web server connected to the Internet. The overall cost of server maintenance is spread over many customers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You need a space to host. I recommend <a href="https://uberspace.de/en/">Uberspace</a>. They are the most heart-warmingly nice people about hosting; they operate on the idea of "here's a screwdriver, try not to burn down the building, but have fun". Excellent.</p>
<p>So, make an account on Uberspace - did I also mention that you pay after the month ends, so technically everyone gets a free month of trial? I mean, can they get more awesome? (pst, they do).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Secure Shell Protocol is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. Its most notable applications are remote login and command-line execution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's the cool part: you now have SSH access to a computer in the cloud with 10GB of storage and 1.5GB of RAM. Go ahead, do it now. Run <code>ls</code> to be greeted by your brand spanking new empty user directory.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-software">The Software</h3><p>What to do, what to install…. I will give you two resources to peruse.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://lab.uberspace.de/">Uberspace Labs</a> - An Uberspace specific installation guide to various software that you can play around with on Uberspace. Highly recommend searching for anything you want here first.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted">Awesome-Selfhosted</a> - A broader listing of self-hostable software. If it is on here, it means there is a decent amount of community behind that software; it should cover 90% of the broadly self-hostable programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>You cannot use Docker in Uberspace. The memory constraints are too low to run a full virtualization suite. Which is a bummer for the larger software and docker-only installations <strong>but</strong> there are workarounds for it. You can install software from source or pull the final run-time from the dockerisation process and use it as a build image (I leave this as an exercise for the intrepid reader :)).</p>
<p><em>But what exactly do I install first??</em>  Alright, alright. Author suggests the following two trackers - one for finance, and one for videos and website updates.</p>
<h3 id="actual-budget">Actual Budget</h3><p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/knhash/actual.png" alt="actual"></p>
<p>Have you always wanted a way to track your finances - expenditures, net worth, spend patterns, etc.? Have also been wary of putting all this sensitive information in the hands of others? What if there was a way to be in control of your data, yet have it accessible across the world via a browser?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://actualbudget.com/"><em>Actual Budget</em></a> is a super fast and privacy-focused app for managing your finances. At its heart is the well proven and much loved Envelope Budgeting methodology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I use this and I have written a guide on how to install this <a href="https://lab.uberspace.de/guide_actual/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Make sure to peek into the reports section - you should be able to slice and dice your finances and gain tons of insight out of it. For instance, turns out what I considered to be minor purchases actually add up over the month, and I spend an inordinate amount of money on commute!</p>
<h3 id="miniflux">Miniflux</h3><p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/knhash/miniflux.png" alt="miniflux"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://miniflux.app/"><em>Miniflux</em></a> is a minimalist and opinionated feed reader.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a way to keep track of your favourite news outlets and magazines, be posted on the latest blog posts of your favourite writers. You could also build a dedicated ad-free feed timeline of your YouTube subscriptions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>RSS</em> (<em>Really Simple Syndication</em>) is a web feed that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format. Subscribing to RSS feeds can allow a user to keep track of many different websites in a single news aggregator, which constantly monitor sites for new content, removing the need for the user to manually check them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Bonus</em>: YouTube has an RSS feed and the embedded YouTube player is ad-free.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Install <em>Miniflux</em> on Uberspace. Add feeds of your favourite YouTube channels. Hop into settings and enable Fever API.</p>
<p>Now any RSS client which is capable of reading from the Fever API should be able to access your RSS aggregator in the cloud. If you are in the Apple ecosystem I highly recommend <a href="https://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/unread/">Unread</a> by Golden Hill Software.</p>
<p>With this I have a dedicated recent first timeline of all the videos as they are released.</p>
<p>I also have separate categories of feed for news and comics - there is a ton of webcomics out there beyond <a href="https://xkcd.com/">xkcd</a>, <a href="https://www.smbc-comics.com/">smbc</a> and <a href="https://theoatmeal.com/">oatmeal</a> - a great way to catch up is via RSS.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="bonus-your-domain">Bonus: Your Domain</h3><p>The coolest part about self-hosting is showing off your stuff. What better way to show off your things than to have a personal domain - a place you can call your own. Head over to a domain name registrar and grab a site on the net-estate. I suggest <a href="https://porkbun.com/">Porkbun</a>.</p>
<p>Now you have a bunch of extraordinary things you can do. With something like <code>awesauce.com</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can point the various services you host on Uberspace to subdomains of your main site. Show off your <code>actual.awesauce.com</code> and <code>miniflux.awesauce.com</code>!</li>
<li>Check with your email provider if they allow you to set up custom domain. You may have to pay for the privilege. Once done you have achieved another freedom - now you can shift the underlying email service provider while keeping the address the same. All mails, for forever, can come to <code>contact@awesauce.com</code>. Woohoo!</li>
<li>Point a subdomain or a URL path to your GitHub repository and host publicly accessible files like your resume: <code>awesauce.com/files/resume.pdf</code></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>This has not been a detailed step by step walkthrough on how to do things, by design. You are meant to go and explore; this is simply a way pointer to invigorate your curiosities.</p>
<p>Here is a final reader's exercise: Figure out a way to send yourself a mobile notification when a particular item comes back in stock or website changes :D</p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/knhash/changedetection.png" alt="changedetection"></p>
<hr>
<p>This made it to the HackerNews front page, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41577156">head over there</a> for some good discussion around the topic.</p>

<p>Bear with me till the end.</p>

<p>I work in the same office as Anna, EY Pune and in the same cluster. </p>

<p>The death of Anna was informed via a centralised mail in which they attached her linkedin picture with some standard short message like RIP. News was put in the grapevine that she was already suffering from a health condition which got worse. </p>

<p>Though I haven't worked directly with her, I've worked with her manager, who is worse than how it's portrayed in the letter. He actually prioritises his convenience (like cricket) and he doesn't really care for anyone's time or effort. He proudly bought IPL final tickets in deadline at exorbitant prices and showed off on insta. He takes all the credit himself, and blames the team for any shortfalls (classic manager behaviour). Boasts all day everyday. When he reviews your work, his focus is not on the correctness of work, he points out as many mistakes as he could, depicting how smart he is, and in other words how dumb you are.</p>

<p>Her assistant manager, she's atrocious. Basically what the asst manager does is distribute work to the team and follow up from each one. Ensure no one is stress free, no one is taking time off. Basically they highlight their potential by getting work done from lesser people (like work of 5/6 resources from 2 resources) in order to get promoted. It is said in common language that you can trust and deal with a drunken man out of his mind, but not an AM. Every AM is the embodiment of this statement.</p>

<p>I have been working in EY for quite some time now, and I have seen people come and go. People who come here (generally) are very hardworking people who have thirst for learning and they are ready to work day and night. Australian timings, European timings, US timings, you name it. Seasoned people exploit these newcomers like anything. And these senior people have power. Good deal of power. They can make your life a living hell if you don't co-operate with them. Try reporting to HR, then you'll get to know he's part of this structure too. They have the audacity to use profane language in reviews. Newly qualified CAs and articles come all the way from their states like Kashmir, Punjab, TN, sacrificing everything just to learn and get good exposure. But it's a bloodbath.  All these people are school toppers of their time. It seems apparent that years of mind numbing toil wasn't enough.They're humiliated to an extent where they lose their respect in their own eyes. Humiliation in the team calls is quite normal here. And these newcomers are from small families who teach them to respect elders and not react to any unreasonable behaviour, not to say NO to any work, give your heart and soul to the work you do. Everyone of us went through this thinking maybe something is wrong with me, if everyone is able to handle this pressure I should handle it too. Female employees may get some leniency but for our male colleagues it's absolutely brutal. Everyone is tortured to hell. No social life, no personal time, no time to attend even phone calls. Most of the newcomers including articles quit, some endure the trouble for some years and then quit, remaining become managers and become trouble for others.</p>

<p>We average 16 hours a day in the busy season, and 12 hours a day in non busy seasons. No weekends or public holidays are off. Annually EY voluntarily announces a day off to rejuvenate their employees. And yes you guessed it right! Even that is not off. We work on that day as well - from Office! Overwork is the only way to get promoted, do and make others do it. </p>

<p>Top level people (Partners) don't care about sh<em>t. You don't even get to interact with partners until you're at least an asst manager. They don't give a f</em>*k about any employee, they just care about getting work done. Even if you go through boiling hell and get the work done, you won't get any acknowledgement from anyone forget about appreciation. One of my colleagues was hospitalized suffering from Dengue, and these people made him make workpapers from his hospital bed. Good for him he quit then and there. When I say these people are inhuman, they literally are.</p>

<p>People leaving EY are usually very happy, and their colleagues congratulate them like they are being released from prison. </p>

<p>It's my request to all my colleagues reading this message - please reevaluate your priorities, see what you're really doing to yourself. And to CAs and articles who dream to work in such an organisation - be very careful of what you wish for.</p>

<p>Anna's death has impacted us all. And such letter from Augustine is a conclusive evidence that "already suffering from health issues" was an deliberately created rumour. Hope the effort behind this letter doesn't go in vain. </p>

<p>Support from all suffering employees of EY.</p>

<p>More power to you Augustine.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
				
				
				
				
<p>Almost every major website you visit today pops up a banner to warn you that it uses “cookies.”   This is not legally required in the U.S. or in most places, and where it is, the vast majority of sites do not comply with legal requirements.  From a policy perspective: cookie pops are just dumb – (virtually) no one reads them.  There are vastly better ways to deal with the issue they present – legally and from a site usability perspective. </p>



<p>First, no current U.S. law requires cookie pop-ups.   <em>Some</em> sites that are available in the European Union are required to post cookie pop ups – sites that use so called “tracking cookies.”  I discuss below a recent EU case that makes this issue even worse than one would have originally thought. </p>



<p>Second, an anecdotal review of websites shows the vast, <em>vast</em> majority of them – all of them in my experience that are “U.S.” sites – utterly fail to comply with the so called EU “cookie law.”  Why?  Because they store the cookie before consent (which is not permitted under the cookie law) and they simply state, “This site uses cookies” and present an “OK” button (and/or an X to close the pop up) with a link to the privacy policy.  See for example <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/">www.abajournal.com</a> which, as of the date of this post, simply provides an OK button – no option to do anything like reject or manage the cookies, and a link to the privacy policy.   Just a useless and legally insufficient user interface distraction.  </p>



<p>Finally, except in very, very limited cases, these cookie pops do not in any way increase user privacy protection.   Why?  If a site does comply with the notice and consent requirements, <em>it is not legally required to provide the service if a user declines tracking cookies.</em>  The site can simply not provide functionality.  So in many cases, its not really a choice – the choice is either not to use the site, or consent to tracking.  This is made worse because many governments and third parties use these sites for information dissemination.  A truly privacy focused law would at least require that the site function if a person elected no tracking.  </p>



<p>The whole cookie problem was started by our friends in Europe when they promulgated the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32002L0058">ePrivacy Directive 2002/58/EC</a>.  However, no U.S. company really started focusing on compliance with the “cookie issue” presented in the ePrivacy Directive until the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union, <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/3e485e15-11bd-11e6-ba9a-01aa75ed71a1/language-en">Regulation (EU) 2016/679</a> of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 came into effect.  The GDPR applies in Europe, not the US, however so many U.S. companies either do business in, or ostensibly could be regulated by, EU members – so they attempt to comply with both U.S.and EU law.  </p>



<p>Many “cookies” –  the ones necessary to actually operate a website, are “exempt” and need not be identified nor are they subject to consent.   However, sites that use tracking cookies and other tracking technology – even anonymized data – are required under EU law to obtain prior consent before even storing the cookie or other technology that allows such tracking.  </p>



<p>In my opinion, this system has been an utter failure in policy and actual impact.   It has not stopped companies from incessant user tracking.  The companies that rely on user tracking have the power to force the choice of “allow tracking” or do not use the service.   The privacy policies remain mostly unintelligible, or at the very least, its is all but impossible to tell what exact tracking a company does, primarily because they either disclose only the types of tracking, or disclose so excessively that the cookie disclosure is indecipherable.  </p>



<p>But the EU is doubling down on the concept . . . </p>



<p>In a recent decision (File number: DOS-2019-0137) of the Dispute Chamber of the Data Protection Authority of Belgium issued 2/2/2022, that regulator held that the European arm of the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB)’s “pop up” framework used by most of its members – intentionally designed to comply with the GDPR, <strong>in fact did not</strong>.   The decision is lengthy (my machine translated version into English is 139 pages long), and undoubtedly will be appealed.   As an overview, IAB created a real time bidding system (RTB) – an automated system of bidding for advertising.  This is their framework in the U.S. and many other countries, but in Europe, they created the “Transparency and Consent Framework” (TCF).   At issue in this case was a subset of the TCF, which the Board described as follows: “Specifically for the TCF, there are also the companies that use so-called “Consent Management Platforms” (CMPs) to offer. Specifically, a CMP takes the form of a pop-up that appears on the first connection to a website appears to request permission from the internet user to collect cookies and other identification data” Para. 40 (Note, all English translations here are machine created by Google’s translation service).  The original decision in Dutch is here (and I can post the English translated version if someone requests it): <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit.be/publications/beslissing-ten-gronde-nr.-21-2022.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit.be/publications/beslissing-ten-gronde-nr.-21-2022.pdf</a>.  </p>



<p>The basic idea is that IAB manages a “consensu” cookie – that indicates if the web user has already consented (or rejected) cookies.  So, a participating site would somehow take information from a user’s initial browser session, send it off to IAB, and IAB would send back a text string indicating if that user had already consented to accept cookies or not.  If not, a “cookie pop up” would be presented to the user.   The Board found that the IAB maintains a database of users and preferences, which can be used “in order to create an advertising profile of data subjects and to show them personalized advertising”  Para. 50.  It therefore concluded the IAB was a data controller (a point the IAB disputed).  From this point forward the Board essentially found nearly every conceivable violation of the GDPR that could be found.  Among them, that “IAB Europe [] failed to observe the principles of due regard for transparency and fairness with regard to data subjects” in part because some of the information that can be sucked up into the preference model includes “special categories of personal data … For example, participating organizations could become acquainted with the websites previously visited by a data subject, including the political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, health data or also trade union memberships of the data subjects be inferred or disclosed.”  Para 51.  It also found the IAB’s privacy policy insufficient because among other reasons it was only available in English, and used unclear vague terms like “services” and “other means.”  Para. 54.  It also did not like that the terms “partners” and “third parties” were not explained sufficiently. </p>



<p>To me this is just evidence that no one really understands the law – or that the regulators think it says one thing and the industry thinks it says another.  Not good either way.  But after that decision, it seems like it would be all but impossible to have a centralized “cookie consent” service – or to comply, the service would be so intrusive as to make the web experience intolerable.</p>



<p>The solution?  In my view, just stop with the cookie pop ups.  They are stupid and ineffective.  Enact a law that requires a service to respect the do not track signal from a browser (currently entirely voluntary), and not store any tracking cookies, clear gifs or other trackers – and require that a site not “discriminate” against users who elect no tracking – basically – provide all functions to users whether they consent or do not consent.  I would also prevent any government organization to use a site that tracks users as a service for information dissemination. </p>

<p>We don’t typically think of dental cavities as a chronic disease—in part because of the separation between medicine and dentistry—but it is. And it doesn’t just affect children: most adults in industrialized countries, where sugary food is commonly available, have to deal with this disease process.</p>

<p>I write the word “cavity,” but the phrase “dental caries” is actually more encompassing. First documented in&nbsp;<u><a href="https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.merriam-webster.com%2Fdictionary%2Fcaries&amp;data=05%7C02%7Chaleh.cohn%40mail.mcgill.ca%7Cf03015f21ece403afee108dc75da1eef%7Ccd31967152e74a68afa9fcf8f89f09ea%7C0%7C0%7C638514826885498770%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=fV6hWm531mY5HNCQA%2BOggVL5LPnX%2Bz3lcHYc0E7KwWY%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="//www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/caries. Click or tap if you trust this link.">1634</a></u>&nbsp;and coming from the Latin meaning “to decay,” caries refers to the process that can eventually lead to a hole in a tooth, an actual cavity.</p>

<p>Few people enjoy going to the dentist and being told to reduce their sugar consumption. So, what if there was a pain-free way of avoiding dental caries forever? There is a product you can buy right now that essentially—through interviews and social media endorsements—promises to do just that. It’s a bacterium that you paint onto your teeth. It superinfects your mouth, taking over for the bacteria responsible for caries. A single application lasts a lifetime.</p>

<p>There is, however, a big problem with this product, called Lumina, and it has to do with what happens when we become so focused on a potential solution, dedicating our life to making it work, that we miss important changes in our understanding of the problem itself.</p>

It looked like some sort of mutated version of a streptococcus, so he named it&nbsp;<i>Streptococcus mutans</i>, or&nbsp;<i>S. mutans&nbsp;</i>for short.</p>

<p>A few decades later,&nbsp;<i>S. mutans&nbsp;</i>had established itself in the minds of the scientific community as the great culprit behind dental caries, what experts call its etiology, meaning its cause. The bacterium was able to stick to the surface of our teeth and, in processing the sugars in our mouth, it would produce large amounts of acid, specifically lactic acid. Normally, our saliva is able to neutralize a lot of this acid, but&nbsp;<i>S. mutans&nbsp;</i>secretes complex sugars that create a sort of film over our teeth called plaque, trapping its acid underneath. Over time, the tooth, eroded by the acid, would cavitate and develop a hole.</p>

<p>In the late 1970s, however, a chance event would promise to change the game.

Could we colonize the human mouth with this naturally mutated&nbsp;<i>S. mutans&nbsp;</i>and thus bid goodbye to cavities?</p>

<p>A good replacement strain, it turns out, needs to meet a number of criteria, not unlike the robots of Isaac Asimov’s fictional universe which had to abide by the Laws of Robotics. The chosen bacterium must not cause disease, obviously. It should not predispose us to other diseases by disrupting the bacterial ecosystem that exists in our mouth. It has to stay in the mouth for a long time and ensure that the bacterium it is replacing doesn’t grow back. And because mutations do arise naturally, it has to be genetically stable: it should not be able to regain the ability to produce massive amounts of acid by picking up the gene from a neighbouring bacterium (which does happen in the wild!). Figuring out that the mutated&nbsp;<i>S. mutans&nbsp;</i>did not fulfill all of these criteria and finding a strain that did led Hillman and colleagues down a very long path.</p>

<p>Caries occur because of a catastrophic shift in the balance of our mouth’s bacterial and fungal ecosystem. It is not due to any one bacterium, and any bacterium capable of releasing acid after ingesting sugars can contribute to this. Even if you could reliably stop&nbsp;<i>S. mutans&nbsp;</i>from producing acid, you could not guarantee the absence of future dental caries. The reason why&nbsp;<i>S. mutans&nbsp;</i>became the Big Bad of the 1970s dentistry world is because researchers were stuck studying the mouth bacteria they could grow in the laboratory, and&nbsp;<i>S. mutans</i>grows well in the conditions scientists were selecting back then. But now, with DNA technology, scientists have been able to detect&nbsp;<u><a href="https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1038%2Fsj.bdj.2018.81&amp;data=05%7C02%7Chaleh.cohn%40mail.mcgill.ca%7Cf03015f21ece403afee108dc75da1eef%7Ccd31967152e74a68afa9fcf8f89f09ea%7C0%7C0%7C638514826885653066%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=oeq755JLwoV%2FJ2idF4TbFM3KKRrT%2BimJMp8hU%2BcOcmQ%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="//doi.org/10.1038/sj.bdj.2018.81.

<p>We are thus left with a product, Lumina, that cannot guarantee the prevention of future caries and whose safety can be summarized by a giant question mark. Is the Mutacin-1140 it releases into the mouth safe in the long term? Can the bacterium be transmitted to a partner via kissing? Is it safe in people with a compromised immune system? Will it upset the oral microbiome in ways that have not been tested for? I wish I had answers.</p>

But in terms of what works to reduce the chances of a dentist announcing you have a cavity, it’s fairly straightforward: reduce your sugar consumption and use a toothpaste that contains fluoride. Our teeth are constantly in the midst of getting demineralized and remineralizing themselves. The acid produced by bacteria in the mouth interferes with remineralization, but the presence of fluoride helps those precious minerals diffuse into the tooth to form new crystals and thus protect the tooth from cavities. That’s why fluoride is so good for our teeth.</p>

<p>Or you could paint your teeth with an experimental bacterium and see what happens.</p>

<p><strong>Take-home message:</strong><br>
	- Lumina is a genetically engineered version of the Streptococcus mutans bacterium that lives in the mouth, and it is supposed to prevent you from developing dental caries because it does not produce acid<br>
	- It has been poorly studied for safety and effectiveness<br>
	- Streptococcus mutans is actually neither necessary nor sufficient for the development of dental caries; the disease actually comes about because of a shift in the equilibrium of bacteria in the mouth which encourages the demineralization of our teeth</p>

                <p>SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Sept.  17, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The independent directors of the Board of 23andMe Holding Co. (Nasdaq: ME), today sent the following letter to Anne Wojcicki, Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder, and Chair of the Board of Directors of 23andMe, in which the independent directors have provided their resignation from the Board, effective immediately:<br></p>  <p>Dear Anne,</p>  <p>We, the independent directors of the 23andMe Board, hereby tender our resignations, effective immediately.</p>  <p>After months of work, we have yet to receive from you a fully financed, fully diligenced, actionable proposal that is in the best interests of the non-affiliated shareholders. We believe the Special Committee and the Board have provided ample time for you to submit such a proposal. That we have not seen any notable progress over the last 5 months leads us to believe no such proposal is forthcoming. The Special Committee is therefore unwilling to consider further extensions, and the Board agrees with the Special Committee’s determination.</p>  <p>While we continue to wholeheartedly support the Company’s mission and believe deeply in the value of the personalized health and wellness offering that you have articulated, it is also clear that we differ on the strategic direction for the Company going forward. Because of that difference and because of your concentrated voting power, we believe that it is in the best interests of the Company’s shareholders that we resign from the Board rather than have a protracted and distracting difference of view with you as to the direction of the Company.</p>  <p>We are proud of what 23andMe has achieved in pioneering direct access to genetic information, and we have been honored to have had the opportunity to be part of those efforts.</p>  <p>Sincerely,</p>  <p>/s/</p>  <p>Roelof Botha, Patrick Chung, Sandra Hernández, M.D., Neal Mohan, Valerie Montgomery Rice M.D., Richard Scheller, Ph.D., Peter J.
