<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In November 2021, former US Representative from Georgia Bob Barr wrote a little-noticed political column claiming that buried inside President Joe Biden’s $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure legislation was a dangerous provision that would go into effect in five years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Marketed to Congress as a benign tool to help prevent drunk driving, the measure will mandate that automobile manufacturers build into every car what amounts to a ‘vehicle kill switch,’”<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2021/11/29/barr-bidens-infrastructure-bill-contains-backdoor-kill-switch-for-cars/">wrote</a><span>&nbsp;</span>Barr, who was the Libertarian Party’s nominee for president in 2008.</p>
<p>Like most Americans, I had never heard of this alleged “kill switch” until a few days ago when Representative Thomas Massie, a libertarian-leaning Republican, proposed to strip the mandate’s funding.</p>
<p>“The right to travel is fundamental, but the government has mandated a kill-switch in new vehicles sold after 2026,” said Massie. “The kill-switch will monitor driver performance and disable cars based on the information gathered.”</p>
<p>Nineteen Republicans joined all but one Democrat in opposing Massie’s amendment, which failed.</p>
<h3><strong>True or False?&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>The claim that the feds would mandate that every new motor vehicle include technology that could disable the vehicle seemed ludicrous. So I started Googling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To my relief, I saw several fact-checkers at legacy institutions had determined the “kill switch” mandate was not true.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Our rating: False,”<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2023/01/19/fact-check-false-claim-bill-mandates-kill-switch-cars-police-drunk-driving/11066287002/">said</a><span>&nbsp;</span><em>USA Today</em>.</p>
<p>“ASSESSMENT: False,”<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-402773429497">said</a><span>&nbsp;</span>the Associated Press.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We rate it Mostly False,”<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/dec/05/instagram-posts/-vehicle-technology-coming-stop-impaired-drivers-i/">concluded</a><span>&nbsp;</span>PolitiFact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Snopes, a reliably left-leaning fact check group, was a little less conclusive, saying the claim was a “<a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/infrastructure-bill-track-drivers/">mixture</a>” of true and false.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my relief evaporated once I looked at<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684/text">the bill itself</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sec. 24220 of the law explicitly states: “[T]o ensure the prevention of alcohol-impaired driving fatalities, advanced drunk and impaired driving prevention technology must be standard equipment in all new passenger motor vehicles.”</p>
<p>The legislation then goes on to define the technology as a computer system that can<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>“passively monitor the performance</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>of a driver</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>of a motor vehicle” and can “<strong>prevent or limit motor vehicle operation</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>if an impairment is detected” (emphasis added).&nbsp;</p>
<p>How the system will make this determination is unclear, as is the government’s potential role in apprehending suspected drunk drivers (more on that later).&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the law’s language could not be more clear: New motor vehicles must have a computer system to “monitor” drivers, and the system must be able to<span>&nbsp;</span><em>prevent<span>&nbsp;</span></em>vehicle operation if it detects impairment.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>

— Jon Miltimore (@miltimore79) <a href="https://twitter.com/miltimore79/status/1725562941833908607?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2023</a></blockquote>
<h3><strong>“No Mention in the Bill of a ‘Kill Switch’”</strong></h3>
<p>How fact-checkers determined the “kill switch” narrative to be false is odd, especially since the articles don’t deny Barr’s central claim: The legislation mandates a computer system that will monitor driving performance and be able to disable motor vehicles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Associated Press conceded the law would “prevent or limit motor vehicle operation” if the system suspects the driver is impaired, even “disable a vehicle from being operated.” So did<span>&nbsp;</span><em>USA Today</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and PolitiFact.</p>
<p>To arrive at their conclusion that this car-killing mechanism is just a fantasy, fact-checkers resorted to sleight of hand. A common tactic was to debunk social media posts that were actually false or unfounded, like the popular claim that the systems would be required to alert law enforcement if the drivers were deemed impaired.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“None of the technologies currently in development would notify law enforcement,” the Associated Press assured readers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an odd bit of uniformity, each of the fact-checkers said spokespeople for groups who support the system, such as MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving), told them they would never support giving law enforcement access to the system.</p>
<p>My personal favorite, however, was PolitiFact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“[We] found no mention in the bill of a ‘kill switch,’” PolitiFact concluded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea that the absence of the words “kill switch” in the bill is evidence that a disabling mechanism doesn’t actually exist in the legislation is nothing short of gaslighting.</p>
<h3><strong>‘Secure in Persons and Effects’?&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>The unpleasant truth is that lawmakers slipped into a massive spending bill a mandate that stands to require all new vehicles to have AI-driven technology that can disable your vehicle if the technology determines you’ve had one beer too many. And fact-checkers are using headlines to make it sound as if the legislation does no such thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s true there is currently no mechanism in the legislation that would require law enforcement to be notified if drivers are suspected of inebriation. But the Associated Press<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-402773429497">notes</a><span>&nbsp;</span>that the law “leaves most of the details up to NHTSA” (the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) to determine at a future date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From my reading of the bill, there is nothing in the legislation that would prevent NHTSA from requesting or receiving this data. Does anyone believe that in 2027, if the NHTSA requested that system manufacturers turn over the information they collect, it would be told no? Don’t bet on it. The Twitter Files show how quick companies comply when the feds come knocking on their door to retrieve their data, and just how little they care about the privacy of Americans.</p>
<p>And that word — privacy — barely appears in any of the three “fact-checks.” (The single instance is when a MADD spokesman assured readers that the organization remains committed to driver privacy, even though it was supporting a computer system that spies on drivers.) The notion that a system that “passively monitors” drivers might infringe the privacy of Americans doesn’t even seem to have crossed their minds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe this shouldn’t be surprising. In a world where traffic cameras, license plate readers, NSA mass surveillance, intelligence-gathering “<a href="https://reason.com/2023/01/06/government-snoops-in-maine-caught-spying-on-peaceful-americans/">fusion centers</a>,” and widespread<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.hopelefeber.com/rise-in-warrantless-searches-at-the-fbi/#:~:text=The%20report%20indicated%20that%20the,the%20same%20kind%20of%20searches.">warrantless searches</a><span>&nbsp;</span>are ubiquitous, privacy might seem like a quaint idea. But it’s one the Framers of the American system took seriously.</p>
<p>“The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated,” the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution reads.</p>
<p>I’m not a constitutional scholar, but it seems to me that the federal government’s requiring automobile manufacturers to install a system that spies on its driver — and disables his car if transgressions are suspected — hardly meets this constitutional standard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also suspect mandating the installation of this technology is something Americans of all political stripes would overwhelmingly oppose on principle — put aside for now the immense<span>&nbsp;</span><em>cost<span>&nbsp;</span></em>on new vehicle purchases it will add — if they knew about it, which is no doubt why the provision was surreptitiously slipped into a $1 trillion spending bill.</p>
<h3><strong>The True Purpose of the Surveillance State</strong></h3>
<p>Then again, maybe Americans wouldn’t care if they knew about federal legislation that mandates tech to disable their cars if it suspects that last glass of wine — which you may or may not have had — put you over the limit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Robert E. Wright<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.aier.org/article/government-surveillance-injures-the-innocent/">has pointed out</a>, once upon a time, Americans considered spying an invasion of privacy, but those days are mostly gone. Increasingly, many take an “I have nothing to hide” approach. Few seem to realize they are almost certainly breaking laws each day unknowingly, and I’m not talking about driving 65 in a 55 mph zone.</p>
<p>In his popular book<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Three-Felonies-Day-Target-Innocent/dp/1594035229"><em>Three Felonies a Day</em></a>, author Harvey A. Silverglate noted that the typical American commits just that: three felonies<span>&nbsp;</span><em>per day</em><span>&nbsp;</span>(four, if you see a felony and don’t report it, which is also a crime).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the last century, the Land of the Free has slowly transformed into a land governed by endless laws, largely by<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://fee.org/articles/vices-are-not-crimes-lysander-spooners-timeless-lesson/?utm_source=aier&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=jon-op-ed&amp;utm_content=kill-switch-vices">cracking down on vices</a><span>&nbsp;</span>instead of actual crimes, creating a society that would render us all criminals if our behavior were constantly observed. Meanwhile, the state has steadily expanded its use of mass surveillance, largely under the pretext of fighting “terror.”</p>
<p>This is a toxic mixture, yet most people seem largely oblivious to the danger it poses. Americans love citing<span>&nbsp;</span><em>1984</em>, but it seems few have actually read it. If they had, they’d realize that the terror of living under a surveillance state was the primary theme of George Orwell’s masterpiece, which was<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://fee.org/articles/3-real-life-inspirations-for-george-orwell-s-1984/?utm_source=aier&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=jon-op-ed&amp;utm_content=kill-switch-orwell">inspired by</a><span>&nbsp;</span>actual totalitarian states.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A simple glimpse into the history books reveals few things are quite as terrifying as a surveillance state. (To experience a taste, I recommend Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck’s fantastic 2006 German film<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://amzn.to/3G2xmsI"><em>The Lives of Others</em></a>.) It’s chilling even to imagine what the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://fee.org/articles/10-terrifying-facts-about-the-east-german-secret-police/">Stasi</a><span>&nbsp;</span>or<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/NKVD">NKVD</a><span>&nbsp;</span>could do with modern surveillance technology.</p>
<p>The United States is not a totalitarian state, but its<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/16/fbi-treated-twitter-as-subsidiary-flagged-tweets-for-misinformation/">growing efforts</a><span>&nbsp;</span>to control information — which have grown more obvious and ambitious — show that it’s not a neutral bystander, either. Those in government have their agendas, and they are not known for playing nice with those who cross them (just ask Edward Snowden and Julian Assange).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which brings us to the raison d’être of mass surveillance.&nbsp;</p>
<div><p>“The asymmetry of the surveillance state belies its true purpose: to protect the government, not the people,” writes Wright.&nbsp;</p><p>Once one understands this, it becomes clear why many see grand potential in a law that requires every single new motor vehicle in the country to be monitored and potentially disabled by a computer — and why<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/invasion-fact-checkers">rent-a-cop fact-checkers</a><span>&nbsp;</span>would go through such contortions to downplay this dystopian mandate.</p></div>

        <div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>The most talented data engineer I know, and my first manager, is a man that loves cooking. I mean, you might <em>think</em> you love cooking, but this guy <em>loves</em> cooking. The most excited text message I received this year was from him, proudly <a href="https://combustion.inc/">sharing the goddamn analytics on the heat distribution of chicken in his oven with his newly imported thermometer</a>. We're talking about a culinary madman, capable of anything. The first book he gave me was not remotely related to any technical stack we ran, but was instead a <a href="https://modernistcuisine.com/">2,438 page <em>manifesto</em></a> on cooking. My current relationship is built on the back of a meal he advised me to prepare on the third date.</p>
<p>Every day, we would step out of the office to get some coffee, and on at least three separate occasions we ended up talking about the difficulty of running a top-tier kitchen. And, most shockingly, on all of those occasions, he professed an admiration for the complexity required for McDonald's to run.</p>
<p>At first, this startled me - McDonald's! I enjoy myself a mediocre burger as much as the next guy fresh out of university, but the man that graphs the cooking of his chicken is impressed by the place that hungover college students go for their nutrition? Well, it turns out that even if you don't hold the quality of the output in particularly high regard, the optimizations and discipline required to ensure that two different acne-ridden teens with wildly varied education levels, separated by oceans, are capable of producing the same burger are <em>non-trivial</em> to say the least.</p>
<p>The man in question catches up on this blog every few weeks, and will be horrified to discover that when you tell a young, impressionable engineer anything, they're going to think about it for three years and then write their own manifesto.</p>
<h2 id="a-brief-glimpse-into-the-c-suite-mindset">A Brief Glimpse Into The C-Suite Mindset</h2>
<p>Many years ago, trying to figure out what the goddamn hell is going on in the tech industry, I ended up reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/17255186">The Phoenix Project</a>. This isn't the main point of bringing the book up, but let's take a brief detour to appreciate how bizarre some parts of it are. Here's the blurb:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bill is an IT manager at Parts Unlimited. It's Tuesday morning and on his drive into the office, Bill gets a call from the CEO.</p>
<p>The company's new IT initiative, code named Phoenix Project, is critical to the future of Parts Unlimited, but the project is massively over budget and very late. The CEO wants Bill to report directly to him and fix the mess in ninety days or else Bill's entire department will be outsourced.</p>
<p>With the help of a prospective board member and his mysterious philosophy of The Three Ways, Bill starts to see that IT work has more in common with manufacturing plant work than he ever imagined. With the clock ticking, Bill must organize work flow streamline interdepartmental communications, and effectively serve the other business functions at Parts Unlimited.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's right, there's a whole genre of corporate fanfiction out there. Was it useful to read? Yes. Does it miss some of the <em>real</em> barriers to organizations improving? Yes, which I should talk about in another article. Was it cringe-inducing at points? <em>Hell yes</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’d use that information to drive our production schedule, so we can manage our supply and demand curves. We’d keep the right products on the right store shelves and keep them stocked. Our revenue per customer would go through the roof. Our average order sizes would go up. We’d finally increase our market share and start beating the competition again.”</p>
<p>As she’s telling us this, she looks animated and excited.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh <em>baby</em>, average order size would go up?  I couldn't <em>be</em> more animated and excited. It should not surprise anyone that it <a href="https://itrevolution.com/author/gene-kim/">required a CTO</a> to unironically write the prose above. It's almost surprising that the next page doesn't talk about how the newfound synergies between the infrastructure team and the developers have made the protagonist positively <em>turgid</em>. But I digress.</p>
<p>The general thrust of the book describes how I.T operations work a lot like a factory floor, and that this has implications for how the flow of work through the organization should be thought about and managed. In fact, the entire book consists of a strange man appearing periodically and giving the protagonist cryptic hints on how to be DevOps-pilled, like if Gandalf knew the only way to defeat Sauron was to help Bilbo fulfill all of his organizational commitments in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Some interesting ideas there, but then I realized that there are a <em>few</em> books that express this kind of sentiment. Quite a few. For one thing, the author has <em>another</em> very popular book out called <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/44333183">The Unicorn Project</a>. Then there's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/60872200">Investments Unlimited</a>. And they're all inspired by another book called <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/113934.The_Goal">The Goal</a>, which is almost the same plot but instead involves a character changing the operations on an actual factory floor, with slightly less cringe-worthy dialogue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Written in a fast-paced thriller style, The Goal is the gripping novel which is transforming management thinking throughout the Western world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ooh, a fast-paced story about improving factory throughput? Fuck yes, I'm getting shivers just thinking about it. These all sound like novels that aliens wrote because they've only been able to decrypt the traffic from LinkedIn.</p>
<p>And then I read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/324750">High Output Management</a> which really <em>was</em> good without having as many caveats around the tepid style. It's straightforward and gives good advice for the effective operation of the soulless corporate machine, and it does not aspire to be anything else. And <em>even that</em> starts with an example of how works flows through a restaurant, complete with a description of how putting eggs on to boil at the wrong time is going to result in cold toast by the time it reaches the customer. A <em>very</em> large component to all this thinking is about economies of scale and the flow of work - these themes come up over and over again.</p>
<h2 id="mcdata">McData</h2>
<p>Many months later, and I was walking around the floor <a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/an-empty-hall-of-smiling-assassins/">of a vendor conference</a> and something began to strike me in the offerings. On this particular day, I happened to be wearing a white shirt with a nice coat, and I suspect many of the salespeople mistook me for management, because they started to pitch me <em>aggressively</em> on their products.</p>
<p>As a rough rule, I knew the products were not particularly good. I've been burned too many times by seeing organizations purchase shitty enterprise software which promises to fix all of the organization's woes. Just buy Salesforce, or Workday, or Informatica, or whatever! Your staff said $CURRENT_SYSTEM is bad, so buy $NEW_SYSTEM. I'd heard it all before, usually in the context of deprecating $NEW_SYSTEM for $NEW_NEW_SYSTEM because $NEW_SYSTEM fucking suuuuucks. I currently believe that there's only one way to buy yourself out of technical issues and bad data models, and that's buying a really talented engineer whose sole focus is fixing the problem.</p>
<p>But what interested me is that they did not spend any time selling me on the technical details of the product. The pitches were <em>entirely</em> focused on something I wouldn't have noticed prior to reading all those books - they were focused on the reproducible delivery of work that was <em>good enough</em> to accomplish business objectives, without having to rely on all those pesky technicians to be good enough to do the job correctly. </p>
<p>For example, one pitch in particular was for a product which promised to remove the need for me to write SQL in exchange for being able to set up all my dependencies from a drag-and-drop editor, with the sales pitch consisting of "You can get rid of thousands of lines of all that SQL you hate!" - no I can't, fucko, because your application is still connecting to Postgres so it's just writing the SQL for me with another layer of licensed abstraction on top of it. Why would I <em>pay</em> to have more abstractions designed for <em>you</em> to sell software to multiple clients, you blue-suited dementor? Eight times out of ten, I want to pay you to <em>remove</em> them from my codebase.</p>
<p>Well, <em>you and I</em> understand that. But I suspect that what an <em>almost</em> savvy executive hears is a little bit closer to this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You know that slow, painful SQL that you keep hearing is causing problems? We've got a drag-and-drop interface, so that you can now hire replaceable cogs to do the dragging-and-dropping at a consistent rate. And there's a consistent interface, and a bunch of specialists in this tool on the market, so you can easily ensure the smooth, consistent delivery of data through the organization! Consistent!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or in another context:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you buy a BurgerMaster 5000, you can just drop any teenager behind this thing with thirty minutes of training, and they're going to be able to turn out a burger that's good enough to sell! It's going to be the same burger every time, wherever you ship it!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They might not be thinking in <em>exactly</em> these terms, because I genuinely have good reason to believe that the median executive has trouble reading anything that isn't printed in a font so large that it feels like the writer is screaming affirmations at them, but I think this is the <em>gist</em> of the sales pitch. It is the promise that you can do away with the pesky implementation details of hiring correctly, or addressing all the bad decisions your predecessors made, or even telling your stakeholders that you've over-promised. Nah, you just buy the increased throughput widget, and now all the story points will be done on time.</p>
<p>Heck, even the way Agile is typically implemented at your average (read: dysfunctional and ineffective) workplace reflects this mindset. You count up how many units (story points) of parts (deliverables) that your machines (engineers) can produce, and then you let 'em rip, only to return next week and wonder why the machines only ever hit 50% of their target.</p>
<h2 id="its-fucking-raw">It's Fucking Raw</h2>
<p>And here's where it all falls apart. All of that sounds great - economies of scale, reproducibility, robustness, blah, blah, blah. McDonald's almost never fails to produce fries of approximately the correct quality, within five minutes, every single time I've asked for them, and some of the absolute sons of bitches that I've worked for have <em>clearly never shipped something that delivered value in their whole careers</em>. They just buy a license for bad software, say that they've successfully implemented it since no one can really check, then leave before the ambient hatred radiating off the people forced to work with the system reaches a level that they can't tolerate.</p>
<p>Let me repeat that again more bluntly - <em>we haven't figured out how to commodify a lot of this work</em>. Despite my adoration and vested financial interested in computing being something companies need to pay me for, it would actually be <em>really nice</em> if we could do this successfully. I would adore it if the doctors and nurses in my life didn't constantly lament the stream of indignities that their single-neuron administrators heap upon them with each new proprietary system, even if it forced me to find a new career. Some of these things are just important, but we <em>can't do it yet</em>. There might be the <em>appearance</em> that many of these things can be neatly commodified, but the majority of these seem to simply be companies that shouldn't exist selling a product that doesn't work to <em>other</em> companies that have oblivious decision-makers.</p>
<p>(And sometimes, an evil decision-maker that has realized you can just man the phone lines from the third world for pennies because it technically means you're legally compliant, and you don't care about customers that are cancelling anyway. Whenever I need to talk to support staff, I try call the <em>sales</em> line first and see if they'll fast-track me, because I will get a local with the authority to <em>do things</em> in 30 seconds.)</p>
<p>Rich Hickey has a delightful talk titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc">Hammock Driven Development</a>, which I highly recommend. On the topic of innovation, Rich Hickey is the creator (or at least, the most prominent creator) of Clojure, so he <em>probably</em> has more innovation points than the lower half of the world's managers <em>combined</em>. My man is out here advocating of a workflow that consists of feeding your subconscious mind research for four hours, then meditating on it for another two, then <em>sleeping</em> and praying that the Gods of Design simply bless you with an answer in the morning - a strange workflow that I experienced when I was writing my Master's thesis, where I solved problems that feel <em>well</em> beyond my ability now, or even in old stories I've heard about the legendary <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/imagination-and-the-imagi_b_8178538">Poincaré</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, <em>all programmers</em> seem to have experienced the strange phenomena where they walk away and the answer comes to them.</p>
<p>There's plenty of work that consists of simply churning out widgets faster, and I'm happy to see that work disappear (so long as we find a way for people to continue living healthily without it), but it must be acknowledged that many of the things we value in society come from an ill-defined, more vital place, and there is an intersection of that spark with the realities of production.</p>
<p>You can pay people to churn out bad self-help all day, but none of those are going to be worth a damn without allowing the human element to flourish. But you still need a factory which can print the things, and as clinical as a mass bookbinding operations sounds, I really believe that you're only going to get a beautiful binding when that factory is run by people who have the connection to the work necessary to exercise taste.</p>
<p>Maybe you can refine the delivery of a beautiful meal at a restaurant, but the meal itself is born from a person's creativity and aesthetic sense, trying to weigh itself against the realities of financial constraints. You can streamline it, and you can deliver the same meal every day, but I've <em>seen</em> the meticulous care of a professional chef running a restaurant in my home country, and successful commodification <em>still requires</em> intense caring.</p>
<p>You can try all you want to reduce the delivery of features to a Jira board and mumbling about Agile, but you're not going to get anything worthwhile out of people if you can't connect with them. You think an engineer good enough to have opinions on the relative elegance of cryptic symbols in an IDE can work without an element of soul, because it would be <em>convenient</em> if he was more like a widget-producing machine? Hah.</p>
<p>Heck, I know someone that designs some of the chips that go into iPhones, and you'd <em>think</em> that would be commodified to hell and back, but at the end of the day it's actually my uncle staying up to 3 AM, calling me from the U.S because he'd like to keep in touch despite the workload - and if that guy gets sick, they're probably <em>actually going to have to delay the next release</em>. There's crazy infrastructure to allow them to test and mass produce those chips, but <em>individual people</em> make that machine run.</p>
<p>There are harsh realities to grapple with, and society runs on commodification, but anyone that thinks that you can run on <em>pure</em> commodification, without any understanding of their specific craft, or the human complexities, needs, and frailties of the people around them, who think that you can just buy more enterprise licenses and that giving someone a salary is enough reason for them to subjugate the entirety of themselves as they turn up to work every day...</p>
<p>Well, you're wrong, and you can fucking bite me.</p>

Moreover, it is understood that non-senescent cells within the elderly tissue still proliferate. However, the reason for the decline in organic function in the elderly as they age remains unclear. Therefore, we hypothesized that there might be a subset of cells in an intermediate stage of the cellular senescence process within the tissue, significantly impacting and ultimately leading to organic dysfunction in the elderly. Here, we propose the existence of intermediate stage cells that are neither youthful nor senescent. We termed these cells as “mid-old cells.” Moreover, these cells would likely accumulate in the stromal region of the tissues for the following reasons. Epithelium, which undergo differentiation rather than self-replication, have shorter lifespans and undergo periodic replacement<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 8" title="Park, J.

However, in our studies, recombinant human SAA1 (rhSAA1) increased expression of MMPs only, especially <i>MMP9</i>, in fibroblasts and muscular mucosa smooth muscle cells (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig3">3b, c</a>) via NFκB signaling (Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">10a</a>). Thus, the expression of MMP9 was considered a characteristic of mid-old and old cells (Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">10b</a>). These findings suggest that SAA1 may contribute to the development of aging-related microenvironments by promoting the degradation of ECM components. Indeed, MMP9 protein expression was robustly increased in elderly tissues that expressed SAA1 (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig3">3d</a>).

The thickness of the muscular mucosa, which exhibited high expression of SAA1 in the colon, was significantly reduced in tissues from elderly subjects (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig3">3f</a>). Although we attempted to assess the thickness of the bronchial smooth muscle layer, irregularities in histological sectioning hindered precise measurements in lung tissue. We then investigated the impact of SAA1 on epithelial cells, specifically their function in ionic exchange and water reabsorption capacity. Interestingly, SAA1 did not alter the expression of genes associated with these functions in colonic epithelial cells (Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">12</a>). These findings suggest that SAA1 directly affected mesenchymal cells, such as fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells, but not epithelial cells.

Maintaining the integrity of the BM is crucial for proper epithelial cell function, and remnants of degraded ECM components, known as ‘Matrikines<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 33" title="Sivaraman, K. &amp; Shanthi, C.

Therefore, we evaluated epithelial cell function based on BM stability. Although the mRNA levels of type IV collagen, a major component of the BM, did not show significant difference between elderly and young-aged tissues (GSE178341<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 34" title="Pelka, K. et al.

Type IV collagen mRNA expression was downregulated only in old fibroblasts, and treating with rhSAA1 did not decrease type IV collagen mRNA levels in young fibroblasts (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig3">3h</a>). Hence, it is considered that the downregulation of type IV collagen in the BM of elderly organs is likely due to its degradation by MMP9 rather than reduced production of type IV collagen. To test this hypothesis in vitro, we cultured young or mid-old fibroblasts in Matrigel containing type IV collagen and found that collagen IV degradation was more pronounced in the presence of mid-old fibroblasts (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig3">3i</a>).

To address this question, we proposed that young cells may prevent the onset of senescence in adjacent mid-old cells. However, if the senescence-driving factors outweigh the inhibitory ability of young cells, a large population of mid-old cells would rapidly enter the senescence program (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig5">5a</a>). This effect is likely mediated by multiple factors released from young cells. Co-culturing old cells with young cells did not elicit a response from the old cells (Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">14a</a>).

However, CXCL12 itself did not affect the expression of inflammatory genes in mid-old fibroblasts (Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">16</a>). In contrast, SLIT2, identified as a representative young cell secretory factor in our in vitro studies, is a known anti-inflammatory protein that progressively decreases as cells become senescent. To assess the impact of young cell driven SLIT2 on mid-old cells, we treated mid-old fibroblasts with recombinant human SLIT2 protein (rhSLIT2). Treatment with rhSLIT2 resulted in decreased expression of inflammatory genes and proteins, including SAA1 and IL1β, through inhibition of Pyk2-NFκB signaling<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="Zhao, H., Anand, A.

Surprisingly, long-term treatment with rhSLIT2 protein restored the morphology of mid-old fibroblasts, causing them to revert to a small and spindle-shaped morphology reminiscent of young cells. To exclude the possibility of proliferation in young cells within the mid-old cell population in response to rhSLIT2, we treated young cells with rhSLIT2 and observed that young cells did not undergo increased proliferation (Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">17a</a>). Additionally, the proliferative capacity of mid-old fibroblasts was recovered, accompanied by decreased levels of p21<sup>Waf1</sup> mRNA and protein in a p53-independent manner (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig6">6d, e</a>).

Treatment with rhSLIT2 in mid-old cells resulted in upregulated expression of <i>SOX2</i> and <i>OCT4</i> (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig6">6f</a>). The expression of known SLIT2 receptors, including <i>ROBO2</i> and <i>ROBO4</i>, was not significantly downregulated in mid-old cells (Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">17b</a>), suggesting that the effect of SLIT2 is not solely due to decreased receptor activity. To further investigate the role of SLIT2, we downregulated SLIT2 expression using shRNA in young fibroblasts. SLIT2 downregulation induced the expression of inflammation-related genes and proteins, including IL1β and SAA1, and decreased the proliferation ability of the cells (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig6">6g, h</a>). These findings suggest that a decrease in SLIT2 itself could promote senescence process. We further confirmed the effect of SLIT2 by adding back rhSLIT2 protein to shRNA-infected young cells, which resulted in the downregulation of the expression of upregulated inflammatory genes (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig6">6i</a>).

In this second experiment, we analyzed additional indices including activity, muscle weight, the number of mid-old cells in tissues, and blood analysis. Activity in the cage and hanging ability were measured before and after rmSLIT2 treatment to reduce animal to animal bias. During the experiment, body weight showed decreasing tendency in the rmSLIT2-treated groups. After 10 rounds of treatment, mouse aging-related characteristics significantly improved. Specifically, activity in the cage and hanging ability increased (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig7">7a, b</a>, and Supplementary Movie&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM8">3</a>).

The accumulation of senescent cells in the organs of the elderly may provide a plausible explanation for this decline. Multiple studies employing various senescence models have consistently demonstrated an increase in p16<sup>INK4A</sup>-positive cells, which are believed to be senescent, in aged mice<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Omori, S. et al.

Omori and colleagues revealed that the proportion of tdTomato (p16<sup>INK4A</sup>)-positive cells increased in aged mice; in the lung, skin, liver and kidney tissues of 12-month-old mice compared to 2-month-old mice using p16<sup>INK4A</sup>-CreERT2-tdTomato mice<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Omori, S. et al.

While senescent cells can exert a significant impact on their surrounding environment through the expression of SASPs, we have conjectured that this phenomenon, which is associated with the accumulation of senescent cells, may not be the sole explanation for the functional decline observed in aged organs. This is because p16<sup>INK4A</sup>-negative cells still make up the majority of the organ’s population according to the abovementioned studies<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Omori, S. et al.

Instead, we put forth a hypothesis that the accumulation of cells in an intermediate stage of the cellular senescence process, referred to as ‘mid-old’ cells in the current study, might be another relevant factor in understanding this decline in organ function. Interestingly, our current data show that a considerable number of mesenchymal cells in aged organs exhibit the intermediate stage of the cellular senescence process rather than epithelial cells. This might be related to the relatively rapid turnover of epithelial cells, which predominately undergo apoptosis or are phagocytized by macrophages prior to induction of the senescence process<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 8" title="Park, J.

The full extent of the effects of senescent and mid-old cells on the functional decline observed in aged organs remains uncertain. However, there is a strong indication that these cells may have a synergistic effect, meaning that their combined presence and activities could play a significant role in contributing to this decline. Further research is needed to better understand the interplay between senescent and mid-old cells and their collective impact on organ function during the aging process, and this interaction will be another interesting future studies.</p><p>Our in vitro transcriptomic studies showed that mid-old cells are functionally impaired compared to young cells; ECM formation, proliferation capacity, and tissue regeneration ability are significantly decreased. Nevertheless, it was observed that mid-old cells undergo a certain degree of functional recovery through the paracrine effect of substances released by young cells. Our study revealed that SLIT2 had a positive impact on the functional capacity of mid-old cells, although it remains uncertain whether it increased their maximum functional limit or enhanced their remaining functional potential. This is consistent with a prior study which demonstrated that <i>Slit2</i>-transgenic mice had improved organ function during aging<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 46" title="Li, G. et al. Overexpression of Slit2 improves function of the paravascular pathway in the aging mouse brain. Int. J. Mol. Med. 42, 1935–1944 (2018)." href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#ref-CR46" id="ref-link-section-d1247026e2274">46</a></sup>. Surprisingly, SLIT2 decreased inflammatory response and improved proliferative capacity only in mid-old, but not in old fibroblasts. Moreover, SAA1 expression was regulated by SLIT2, but SAA1 is not related to cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">22</a>). Therefore, SLIT2 is a potential cell cycle regulator, and this could be attributed to the upregulation of stem cell factors, including SOX2 and OCT4. Previous reports demonstrated that SOX2 and OCT4 regulate the downregulation of p21<sup>Waf1</sup> expression via direct binding to its promoter or DNA methyltransferase<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 47" title="Yamamizu, K., Schlessinger, D. &amp; Ko, M.

Based on our cautious interpretation, we suggest that SLIT2 may enhance cell proliferation by upregulating stem cell factors, particularly SOX2. However, it is important to note that effects of SLIT2 are not universally applicable. Specifically, senescent fibroblasts did not exhibit a response to SLIT2, and mid-old fibroblasts showed diminished effectiveness when DT exceeded 8 days (Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">23</a>). Here, another important question arises: Can SLIT2 extend lifespan? Although our mouse sample size was small (<i>n</i> = 4, each), we administered PBS or rmSLIT2 injections once a week to 23-month-old mice and measured longevity. However, we did not observe evidence that SLIT2 extends lifespan, which is a major drawback of this study. Nonetheless, we believe that further investigation using a larger sample size of aged mice is necessary to draw conclusive results.</p><p>Regarding the changes in colon function with aging, we observed alterations in gene expression related to water absorption and the smooth muscle function involved in bowel movements in the large intestine. Specifically, we observed that the muscular mucosa layer became thinner in elderly colon tissue, and this was associated with increased expression of SAA1. Additionally, the expression of ‘Atrogenes’ was heightened in smooth muscle cells due to the presence of SAA1. Our findings suggest that SAA1 can induce atrophy in smooth muscle cells and may contribute to systematic muscle atrophy as circulating SAA1 levels increase with age. These results imply that targeting the master regulators of SAA1 directly could potentially prevent muscle mass loss in elderly individuals. Furthermore, we noted an increase in the expression of <i>NHE3</i> and <i>SCNN1A</i>, genes related to water absorption, in colon and lung epithelial cells in aged tissues. Notably, this increase in <i>NHE3</i> and <i>SCNN1A</i> expression was not attributed to SAA1 but rather appeared to be induced by the effects of degraded ECM on the stromal microenvironment. These degraded ECM fragments were found to function as ‘Matrikines,’ which upregulated signaling pathways such as Erk1/2, JNK, and NFκB. It is through these pathways that the expression of <i>NHE3</i> and <i>SCNN1A</i> is regulated. Therefore, collagen degradation by MMPs could serve as ‘Matrikines,’ potentially leading to increased expression of <i>NHE3</i> and <i>SCNN1A</i>.</p><p>This study offers new insights into the heterogeneous nature of the senescence ecosystem. The current concept and definition of senescence can be somewhat broad and vague. While the term ‘cellular senescence’ is often used interchangeably with ‘irreversible cell cycle arrest<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 49" title="Gorgoulis, V. et al.

Furthermore, the ‘mid-old cells’ identified in our study could represent an intermediate state of cellular senescence, as they are positive for the conventional markers, such as p21<sup>Waf1</sup> and IL1β. We demonstrated that the reduced or halted proliferation capacity of these mid-old cells can be reversed with appropriate stimulation. However, the borderline of cellular traits and the definition between ‘mid-old’ and ‘early senescence’ is still vague, and the additional study is needed to elucidate this question. Moreover, previously mentioned facts suggest that there could be various subtypes within the cellular senescence which makes us hard to understand the overall senescence ecosystem. Senescence encompasses various stages in cellular development, including early phases where proliferation ability can be restored, as well as later stages where cells take on specialized roles in molecule secretion or play a role in either promoting or inhibiting immune clearance processes. Furthermore, the trait of mid-old cells in pathologic conditions can be different from those in normal tissues, and the role of mid-old cells in pathologic conditions, such as age-related diseases will be another interesting future study.</p><p>Conclusively, our results demonstrated that most fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells in the organs of elderly subjects were in the mid-old status. Furthermore, SLIT2 protein originating from young cells could act as an anti-aging protein for mid-old cells. Collectively, the study proposes a new strategy for anti-aging, including targeting mid-old cells and restoring young cell factors to improve quality of life in elderly persons.</p></div></div><div id="Sec9-section" data-title="Methods"><h2 id="Sec9">Methods</h2><div id="Sec9-content"><h3 id="Sec10">Human tissue experiments</h3><p>This study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Ajou University Hospital (AJIRB-BMR-OBS-20-552, Suwon, Korea), and informed consent was obtained from all patients, parents, or legal guardians as appropriate.

For co-culture, mid-old cells were seeded in a transwell (0.4-µm pore size, 6 well, Corning Inc.) low chamber (1 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells /well) in a six-well plate. Young or mid-old cells were then seeded in the transwell upper chamber (1 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells). The upper chamber was replaced weekly. For CM experiments, mid-old cells were treated with CM of young cells for 30 days. Mid-old cells were seeded onto six-well plates (1 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well) and allowed to adhere for 24 h. Culture medium was then replaced with CM, which was harvested from the culture medium of young or mid-old cells (1 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells) and centrifuged for 3 min at 200 × <i>g</i>. The CM was replaced every 2 days. For SLIT2 experiment, mid-old cells were seeded in a 60-mm dish (5 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells). Medium was then replaced with serum-free medium with or without recombinant SLIT2 protein (150-11, PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) for 24–48 h.</p><h3 id="Sec27">Immunoblotting</h3><p>Cells were scraped off the plates, and lysates were collected in 1× RIPA buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na<sub>2</sub>EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% NP40 and 1% sodium deoxycholate) containing protease inhibitor cocktail (K272, Biovision, Milpitas, CA) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (K282, Biovision). Samples were resolved by electrophoresis an SDS-PAGE gel and PVDF membranes probed with the antibodies indicated; p16<sup>INK4A</sup>, 1:1000 (LS-B1347, LSbio, Seattle, WA); p21<sup>Waf1</sup>, 1:1000 (ab109520, Abcam); p53, 1:1000 (MA5-12557, Invitrogen); p-Erk1/2, 1:1000 (9101, Cell Signaling Technology); Total Erk1/2, 1:1000 (9107, Cell Signaling Technology); MDM2, 1:1000 (ab16895, Abcam); Actin, 1:3000 (Abc-2004, Abclon, Seoul, Korea); p-NFκB, 1:1000 (3033, Cell Signaling Technology); Total NFκB, 1:1000 (8242, Cell Signaling Technology); IκBα, 1:1000 (4814, Cell Signaling Technology); p-Pyk2, 1:1000 (3291, Cell Signaling Technology); Total Pyk2, 1:1000 (3292, Cell Signaling Technology); SOX2, 1:500 (ab92494, Abcam); OCT4, 1:1000 (ab19857, Abcam); MMP9, 1:1000 (GTX100458, Genetex Inc.); Tubulin, 1:1000 (sc-32293, Santa Cruz Biotechnology inc., Dallas, TX); GAPDH, 1:1000 (60004-1-lg, Proteintech, Rosemont, IL).</p><h3 id="Sec28">SA-β-Gal staining</h3><p>Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and incubated with SA-β-Gal (1 mg/ml X-gal, 40 mM citric acid/sodium phosphate pH 5.8, 5 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mM potassium ferricyanide, 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) solution for 12 h at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, SA-β-Gal-positive cells were then analyzed with inverted light microscopy (DMi1, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany).</p><h3 id="Sec29">ELISA analysis</h3><p>Mouse Serum Amyloid A (SAA) Quantikine ELISA Kit (MSAA00, R&amp;D systems) was used for quantitative measurement of circulating SAA levels according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Human SAA1 concentration from plasm obtained from Ajou University Hospital, was measured using a Human Serum Amyloid A1 DuoSet ELISA (DY3019-05, R&amp;D systems). Human SLIT2 (LS-F4840, LSBio), human MMP9 (DMP900, R&amp;D system) and human IL1β (437004, Biolegend, San Diego, CA) concentration were measured from harvested medium of cells.</p><h3 id="Sec30">Long non-coding RNA analysis</h3><p>To isolate exosomes, conditioned medium was harvested, and differential centrifugation was performed using Ultracentrifugation. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 300 × <i>g</i> for 10 min, followed by centrifugation at 2000 × <i>g</i> for 20 min to remove apoptotic bodies. Macrovesicles were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × <i>g</i> for 20 min, while exosomes were pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × <i>g</i> for 70 min. Pelleted exosomes were resuspended in RNA extraction solution (Macherey-Nagel GmbH &amp; Co. KG) for total RNA extraction. cDNA synthesis was performed using an oligo(dT) primer mix and random hexamer primer mix and PCR was performed using primers (see Supplementary Table&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">6</a>). Amplified DNA product was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis.</p><h3 id="Sec31">Single cell tracking</h3><p>Cells, labeled with GFP, were tracked over time and through cell divisions using a Lionheart FX automated microscope (BioTek Instruments). Initially, 1 × 10<sup>2</sup> cells were seeded in a six-well culture plate (30006, SPL Life Sciences Co., Ltd.), and their individual coordinate locations were saved for subsequent tracking.</p><h3 id="Sec32">Microscope image acquisition</h3><p>IHC staining image acquisition was conducting using a Leica Aperio Scanscope CS and Aperio ImageScope software (Leica Microsystems.). Cell images were acquired using a Leica DMi1 Inverted Microscope and Leica Application Suite (LAS) software (Leica Microsystems). IF images were captured on a Zeiss LSM 710 microscope and analyzed with Zeiss Axio Imager software.</p><h3 id="Sec33">Statistical analysis</h3><p>Numerical data are presented as mean ± SD of independent determinations. Statistical differences were examined using the Student’s <i>t</i> test and the Mann–Whitney <i>U</i> test. A two-tailed Student’s <i>t</i> test was conducted for samples following a normal distribution. For samples that did not follow a normal distribution, a one-tailed Mann–Whitney <i>U</i> test was performed. The proportional difference between two groups is calculated by Chi-square test.</p><h3 id="Sec34">Reporting summary</h3><p>Further information on research design is available in the&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM10">Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary</a> linked to this article.</p></div></div>

<article>
    <p>This is a list of things you’re allowed to do that you thought you couldn’t, or didn’t even know you could.</p>
<p>I haven’t tried everything on this list, mainly due to cost.
But you’d be surprised how cheap most of the things on this list are (especially the free ones).</p>
<p><strong>Note that you can replace “hire” or “buy” with “barter for” or “find a DIY guide to” nearly everywhere below.</strong>
E.g. you can clean the bathroom in exchange for your housemate doing a couple hours research for you.</p>
<h3 id="learning-and-decision-making">Learning and decision making</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hire a researcher or expert consultant
<ul>
<li>I hired a researcher (<a href="https://acesounderglass.com/">Elizabeth Van Nostrand</a>, whom you can and should <a href="https://acesounderglass.com/hire-me/">hire</a> too) to help write this very post, which is largely about how to hire people to do things!</li>
<li>They can:
<ul>
<li>Help validate whether a crazy idea is possible</li>
<li>Do <a href="https://acesounderglass.com/tag/epistemicspotcheck/">epistemic spot checks</a> of your work</li>
<li>Map the landscape of opinions on a topic</li>
<li>Write literature surveys</li>
<li>Find people worth talking to about a potential topic and writing briefs about them</li>
<li>Opposition or market research</li>
<li>Find options for big purchases like houses or insurance</li>
<li>Compile datasets</li>
<li>Find un-Googleable things</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To find one:
<ul>
<li>Look for books or scholarly articles on the topic, and email the author
<ul>
<li>Graduate students are especially good, and often know more than the “experts”</li>
<li>If you find someone genuinely interested in what you’re working on, you might be able to collaborate and not pay</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Look for interested individuals in the long tail of blogs
<ul>
<li>E.g. by Google searching with <code>"site: medium.com"</code> and finding the authors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use a matchmaking service (see <a href="#appendix-sources-of-experts">Appendix</a>)</li>
<li>Search through professional organizations directories (e.g. Bar Association, American Academy of Pediatrics)</li>
<li>Google the topic +
<ul>
<li>“blog”</li>
<li>“podcast”</li>
<li>“expert witness”</li>
<li>“book”</li>
<li>“consultant”</li>
<li>“reddit”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What do I pay them?
<ul>
<li>Some post their prices online</li>
<li>If you’re hiring a grad student you can pay them at or above their school’s graduate student stipend, which you can Google.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/evyBmPw9ZnzmoFmP6/experiment-a-good-researcher-is-hard-to-find">Make sure they get something out of the project</a> (and other tips)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://mindingourway.com/obvious-advice/">Ask obvious questions</a></li>
<li>Ask questions online
<ul>
<li>You know those answers you enjoy reading on Stack Exchange, Reddit, Quora, etc.?  Someone had to ask those questions. It can be you.</li>
<li>If you’re embarrassed by the question, it’s easy to be anonymous</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Run surveys
<ul>
<li>Twitter
<ul>
<li>Or ask someone with a larger following to do it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Google Surveys</li>
<li>Amazon Mechanical Turk</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Buy advertisements, <a href="https://www.news10.com/news/national/90-year-old-man-spends-10k-on-ads-to-tell-att-ceo-about-his-slow-internet-service/">especially in legacy media</a></li>
<li>Run <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Nootropics#blinding-yourself">genuine randomized control trials on yourself</a></li>
<li>Buy research or data
<ul>
<li>See <a href="#appendix-sources-of-research">Appendix</a>, <a href="https://blog.alexa.com/sites-for-market-research/">here</a>, or <a href="https://web.jinfo.com/go/blog/73431">here</a></li>
<li>Or find it on <a href="https://twitter.com/Sci_Hub">SciHub</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/libgen_project">Libgen</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hire someone to pentest/doxx you
<ul>
<li>Or put out a bounty for it, like <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Blackmail#pseudonymity-bounty">Gwern used to</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hire a graphic designer to turn your appalling sketches into beautiful diagrams or slides</li>
<li>Host small gatherings or conferences on topics you care about
<ul>
<li>These are much easier to set up than you’d think, especially in the age of Zoom</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hire a tutor
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.italki.com/">Language tutors</a> are surprisingly cheap and better than any app</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wyzant.com/">Wyzant</a> and many other sites exist for general tutoring</li>
<li>For niche tutoring you can try general freelance sites like <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/">Fiverr</a> or <a href="https://www.upwork.com/">Upwork</a></li>
<li>Services like <a href="https://www.sharpestminds.com/">Sharpest Minds</a> exist for professional training</li>

<li>Pick a spot on the map that simply seems strange and just go there.  (HT Michael Nielsen)</li>
<li>Hire someone just as an excuse to make yourself complete a project
<ul>
<li>Sure you could proofread your own document.  But if you hire a proofreader, you have to actually deliver them something at some point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="interpersonal">Interpersonal</h3>
<ul>
<li>Say “I don’t know” or “I don’t have an opinion” when you don’t</li>
<li>Not tell white lies
<ul>
<li>You can be nice and tell the truth at the same time.</li>
<li>Especially to kids when they annoy you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don’t drink (alcohol), even when you’re expected to</li>
<li>Buy goods/services from your friends
<ul>
<li>It’s not weird unless you make it weird</li>
<li>Everyone knows some starving artists and needs to buy holiday gifts</li>
<li>Doesn’t apply to every service obviously: don’t take out loans from your friends</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Travel to friends just to visit them</li>
<li>Move close to friends</li>
<li>Live in multiple places with multiple people
<ul>
<li>Rent spare rooms or couches part-time in multiple homes</li>
<li>Arrange your own timeshare system with friends
<ul>
<li>E.g. a group of nine friends can rent three three-bedroom apartments in three cities</li>
<li>This also gives you flexibility over which jurisdiction you’re taxed in</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

</li>
<li>As mentioned above, buy <a href="#appendix-sources-of-research">research or data</a>, e.g. for compensation</li>
<li>Market-test a mere idea by (1) setting up a landing page with an interest form and (2) buying a cheap social media ad campaign. (HT <a href="https://twitter.com/daytimeskye/status/1608107407678349317">@daytimeskye</a>)</li>
<li>Merge with your competitors, a la PayPal</li>
<li>Work in public
<ul>
<li>Or mostly in public, a la SpaceX who livestreams everything</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sell to unusual markets
<ul>

		<h2>In brief</h2>
		<p>ESA’s new Ariane 6 rocket passed a major full-scale rehearsal today in preparation for its first flight, when teams on the ground went through a complete launch countdown followed by a seven-minute full firing of the core stage’s engine, as it would fire on a launch into space.</p>
	</div>
	<h2>In-depth</h2>
</div>


			
    
						
			<p>For this rehearsal, the boosters were not ignited so Ariane 6 stayed firmly on the launch pad at Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana, as planned.</p>

		<p>The engine-fire trial reenacts how the Ariane 6 core stage will fire during a normal flight into space. Once complete the main engine would shut down and the core stage would separate from the upper stage, which would then take over propulsion and complete its mission.</p><p>The trial, conducted with a test model on the launch pad at Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana, was the longest ‘full-stack' run yet for Ariane 6’s lower liquid propulsion module with a Vulcain 2.1 engine.</p>	</div>	
    
						
			<div>
				<p>“The teams from ArianeGroup, CNES and ESA have now run through every step of the rocket's flight without it leaving Earth,” says ESA’s Director General Josef Aschbacher.</p><p>“This milestone rehearsal comes after years of designing, planning, preparing, building and hard work from some of the finest space engineers in Europe. We are back on track towards resecuring Europe’s autonomous access to space. Well done to all involved!”</p>	</div>

		<p>The Vulcain 2.1 engine burnt through almost 150 tonnes of propellant in the Ariane 6 core stage tanks – liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen, the latter supercooled to temperatures below -250°C. Vulcain 2.1 is an evolution of the Vulcain 2 engine which made Ariane 5 Europe's most successful launch system to date. The upgrade has a simplified and cheaper design, and new technology in the engine nozzle and ignition system has been moved from the engine to the launch pad structure, to make the stage perform better and cost less.</p>	</div>

		<p>It took just over two hours and required teams of people and delicate operations to load the rocket’s central core with fuel. The filling operations were performed during a long countdown that included other qualification tests, similar to the previous rehearsals this year. For fidelity and to guarantee launcher stability, the upper stage tanks were also fueled – even though the upper stage engine only kicks in once in orbit after separation from the main stage and so was not fired during this ground test.</p><p>The launch pad – operated by France’s space agency CNES – used its water deluge system to temper the heat from the engine.</p><p>ESA’s Director of Space Transportation, Toni Tolker-Nielsen, added his vote of confidence in the teams across Europe working to bring Ariane 6 to service: "A huge thanks to all of our dedicated colleagues who are committed and working tirelessly to see this rocket fly.”</p><p>The test <a href="https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Transportation/Ariane/Fuelled-up_dress_rehearsal_for_Ariane_6">followed a shorter burn in September</a> (known as CTLO1) when Ariane 6's tanks were filled and its Vulcain 2.1 engine briefly ignited and switched off, and the filling and <a href="https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Transportation/Ariane/Nighttime_rehearsal_for_Ariane_6_towards_first_flight">draining test executed in October</a> (known as CTLO2.1) to check the launch system functions such as draining fuel in the presence of multiple simulated failures.</p><p>A last hot-fire test of the upper stage is being prepared and planned for December 2023 at the Lampoldshausen test centre from Germany's DLR aerospace agency.</p>	</div>

			<p>A little whimsy, now and then, makes for good balance. Theoretically,
	        you could find this type of humor anywhere. But only
	        a topflight science-fictionist, we thought, could have written this
	        story, in just this way….</p>
		</blockquote>
		
		
	</div>
	<div id="story">
		<p><span>It was</span> quite by accident I discovered this incredible invasion of
		Earth by lifeforms from another planet. As yet, I haven’t done anything
		about it; I can’t think of anything to do. I wrote to the
		Government, and they sent back a pamphlet on the repair and maintenance
		of frame houses. Anyhow, the whole thing is known; I’m not
		the first to discover it. Maybe it’s even under control.</p>

		<p>I was sitting in my easy-chair, idly turning the pages of a paperbacked
		book someone had left on the bus, when I came across the reference that
		first put me on the trail. For a moment I didn’t respond. It took some
		time for the full import to sink in. After I’d comprehended, it seemed
		odd I hadn’t noticed it right away.</p>

		<p>The reference was clearly to a nonhuman species of incredible properties,
		not indigenous to Earth. A species, I hasten to point out, customarily
		masquerading as ordinary human beings. Their disguise, however,
		became transparent in the face of the following observations by the
		author. It was at once obvious the author knew everything. Knew
		everything — and was taking it in his stride. The line (and I tremble
		remembering it even now) read:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… his eyes slowly roved about the room.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Vague chills assailed me. I tried to picture the eyes. Did they roll
		like dimes? The passage indicated not; they seemed to move through
		the air, not over the surface. Rather rapidly, apparently. No one in the
		story was surprised. That’s what tipped me off. No sign of amazement
		at such an outrageous thing. Later the matter was amplified.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… his eyes moved from person to person.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>There it was in a nutshell. The eyes had clearly come apart from
		the rest of him and were on their own. My heart pounded and my
		breath choked in my windpipe. I had stumbled on an accidental mention
		<a id="page129" title="129">&nbsp;</a>of a totally unfamiliar race. Obviously non-Terrestrial. Yet, to the
		characters in the book, it was perfectly natural — which suggested they
		belonged to the same species.</p>

		<p>And the author? A slow suspicion burned in my mind. The author
		was taking it rather <em>too easily</em> in his stride. Evidently, he felt this was
		quite a usual thing. He made absolutely no attempt to conceal this
		knowledge. The story continued:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… presently his eyes fastened on Julia.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Julia, being a lady, had at least the breeding to feel indignant. She
		is described as blushing and knitting her brows angrily. At this, I sighed
		with relief. They weren’t <em>all</em> non-Terrestrials. The narrative continues:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… slowly, calmly, his eyes examined every inch of her.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Great Scott! But here the girl turned and stomped off and the matter
		ended. I lay back in my chair gasping with horror. My wife and family
		regarded me in wonder.</p>

		<p>“What’s wrong, dear?” my wife asked.</p>

		<p>I couldn’t tell her. Knowledge like this was too much for the ordinary
		run-of-the-mill person. I had to keep it to myself. “Nothing,” I gasped.
		I leaped up, snatched the book, and hurried out of the room.</p>

		<hr>

		<p><span>In the</span> garage, I continued reading. There was more. Trembling, I
		read the next revealing passage:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… he put his arm around Julia. Presently she asked him if
	        he would remove his arm. He immediately did so, with a
	        smile.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>It’s not said what was done with the arm after the fellow had removed
		it. Maybe it was left standing upright in the corner. Maybe it
		was thrown away. I don’t care. In any case, the full meaning was there,
		staring me right in the face.</p>

		<p>Here was a race of creatures capable of removing portions of their
		anatomy at will. Eyes, arms — and maybe more. Without batting an eyelash.
		My knowledge of biology came in handy, at this point. Obviously
		they were simple beings, uni-cellular, some sort of primitive single-celled
		things. Beings no more developed than starfish. Starfish can do
		the same thing, you know.</p>

		<p>I read on. And came to this incredible revelation, tossed off coolly by
		the author without the faintest tremor:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… outside the movie theater we split up. Part of us went
			inside, part over to the cafe for dinner.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Binary fission, obviously. Splitting in half and forming two entities.
		<a id="page130" title="130">&nbsp;</a>Probably each lower half went to the cafe, it being farther, and the
		upper halves to the movies. I read on, hands shaking. I had really stumbled
		onto something here. My mind reeled as I made out this passage:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… I’m afraid there’s no doubt about it. Poor Bibney has lost
			his head again.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Which was followed by:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… and Bob says he has utterly no guts.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Yet Bibney got around as well as the next person. The next person,
		however, was just as strange. He was soon described as:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… totally lacking in brains.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<hr>

		<p><span>There</span> was no doubt of the thing in the next passage. Julia, whom I
		had thought to be the one normal person, reveals herself as also
		being an alien life form, similar to the rest:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… quite deliberately, Julia had given her heart to the young
			man.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>It didn’t relate what the final disposition of the organ was, but I didn’t
		really care. It was evident Julia had gone right on living in her usual
		manner, like all the others in the book. Without heart, arms, eyes, brains,
		viscera, dividing up in two when the occasion demanded. Without a
		qualm.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… thereupon she gave him her hand.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>I sickened. The rascal now had her hand, as well as her heart. I shudder
		to think what he’s done with them, by this time.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… he took her arm.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Not content to wait, he had to start dismantling her on his own. Flushing
		crimson, I slammed the book shut and leaped to my feet. But not
		in time to escape one last reference to those carefree bits of anatomy
		whose travels had originally thrown me on the track:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… her eyes followed him all the way down the road and
			across the meadow.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>I rushed from the garage and back inside the warm house, as if the
		accursed things were following me. My wife and children were playing
		Monopoly in the kitchen. I joined them and played with frantic fervor,
		brow feverish, teeth chattering.</p>

		<p>I had had enough of the thing. I want to hear no more about it. Let
		them come on. Let them invade Earth. I don’t want to get mixed up
		in it.</p>

		<p>I have absolutely no stomach for it.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

Some wireless headphone users note low sound quality and lack of high frequencies when using the standard Bluetooth SBC codec, which is supported by all headphones and other Bluetooth audio devices. A common recommendation to get better sound quality is to buy devices and headphones with aptX or LDAC codecs support. These codecs require licensing fees, that's why devices with them are more expensive.</p><p>

It turns out that the low quality of SBC is caused by artificial limitations of all current Bluetooth stacks and headphones' configuration, and this limitation can be circumvented on any existing device with software modification only.<a name="habracut"></a></p><h2>SBC codec</h2><p>SBC has lots of different parameters that are negotiated during the connection setup phase:</p><ul>
<li>Audio channel type and number: Joint Stereo, Stereo, Dual Channel, Mono;</li>
<li>Number of frequency bands: 4 or 8;</li>
<li>Number of audio blocks in one packet: 4, 8, 12, 16;</li>
<li>Quantization bit allocation algorithm: Loudness, SNR;</li>
<li>Maximum and minimum bit pool used in quantization process: usually 2-53.</li>
</ul><p>

The decoder is required to support any combination of these parameters. Encoder may implement only a part of them.<br>
Existing Bluetooth stacks usually negotiate the following set of options which I call «profile»: Joint Stereo, 8 bands, 16 blocks, Loudness, bitpool 2..53. This profile encodes 44.1 kHz stereo audio with 328 kbps bitrate.<br>
Bitpool is a parameter that changes encoding bitrate: the higher it is, the higher the bitrate, and hence the quality. But exact bitpool value corresponds to exact bitrate only within exact profile.<br>
The bitrate is also significantly affected by other parameters: audio channel type, number of frequency bands, number of audio blocks. You can increase the bitrate indirectly by negotiating non-standard profiles, without changing the bitpool.</p><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/formulas/359/ca0/835/359ca08359d109bf3c7633f9adae5744.svg" alt="$ bitrate = \frac{8 \times frame\_length \times sample\_rate}{subbands \times blocks} $" data-tex="display"></p>
<p><i><span color="#666666">Bitrate calculation formula</span></i></p><p>


For example, Dual Channel mode encodes channels separately, using individual bitpool for each channel, unlike Stereo or Joint Stereo, which use bitpool for both channels. Forcing the device to use Dual Channel instead of Joint Stereo will get us almost doubled bitrate of 617 kbps, with the same bitpool value of 53.<br>
To me it feels that bitpool should be an internal variable. I assume that it is an A2DP specification design fault that bitpool value is not bound to other codec parameters and only defined as an independent negotiated variable.</p><p>

Fixed bitpool and bitrate values originated from recommended profile for high quality audio. But the recommendation should not be the reason to set the limit on these parameters.</p><p>

<img src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/getpro/habr/post_images/cc5/5bf/c7d/cc55bfc7d4e0a7e9ca4aee331f6c9992.png" alt="Bluetooth SBC profiles table" data-src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cc5/5bf/c7d/cc55bfc7d4e0a7e9ca4aee331f6c9992.png"></p><p>

A2DP specification v1.2, which was active from 2007 to 2015, requires all decoders to work correctly with bitrates up to 512 kbps:</p><blockquote>The decoder of the SNK shall support all possible bitpool values that do not result in excess of the maximum bit rate. This profile limits the available maximum bit rate to 320kb/s for mono, and 512kb/s for two-channel modes.</blockquote><p>

No bitrate limit stated in the new version of the specification. It is assumed that modern headphones with EDR support released after 2015 can support bitrates up to 730 kbps.</p><p>

For some reason, all currently tested Bluetooth stacks (Linux (PulseAudio), Android, Blackberry and macOS) have artificial restrictions of maximum bitpool parameter, which directly affects the maximum bitrate. But this is not the biggest problem, almost all headphones also limit the maximum bitpool value to 53.<br>
As I've already seen in my tests, most devices work fine on a modified Bluetooth stack with a bitrate of 551 kbps, without interrupts and crackling. But such a bitrate will never be negotiated under normal conditions, with stock Bluetooth stacks.</p><h2>Bluetooth stack modification</h2><p>Every A2DP-compatible Bluetooth stack should support Dual Channel mode, but there's no way to force usage of this mode.</p><p>

Let's add a switch to the user interface! I made patches for Android 8.1 and Android 9, which add full support for Dual Channel into the stack and into developer menu, and handle Dual Channel mode as an additional «HD Audio» codec like aptX, AAC or LDAC by adding a tick to the Bluetooth device settings Here's what it looks like:</p><p>

<img src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/webt/xd/k_/nn/xdk_nnwukcz446jxexaes4pdscw.png" alt="image" data-src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xd/k_/nn/xdk_nnwukcz446jxexaes4pdscw.png"></p><p>

<a href="https://review.lineageos.org/q/topic:bt-sbc-hd-dualchannel-pie+(status:open%20OR%20status:merged)">Android 9 patch</a><br>
<a href="https://review.lineageos.org/q/topic:bt-sbc-hd-dualchannel+(status:open%20OR%20status:merged)">Android 8.1 patch</a></p><p>

This checkbox toggles Dual Channel mode which is configured to use <b>551 kbps</b> for EDR 3 Mb/s devices and <b>452 kbps</b> for EDR 2 Mb/s devices.</p><p>

This patchset has been merged into the following alternative firmwares:</p><ul>
<li><b>LineageOS 15.1</b> (since 31 March, 2019) and <b>16.0</b> (since May 13, 2019)</li>
<li><b>Resurrection Remix</b> (since May 14, 2019)</li>
<li><b>crDroid</b> (since May 13, 2019)</li>
</ul><h2>Where did 551 and 452 kbps come from?</h2><p>Bluetooth time division technology is designed to efficiently transmit large fixed-size packets. Data transfer occurs in slots, the largest number of slots sent in one transmission is 5. There are also transfer modes using 1 or 3 slots, but not 2 or 4. You can transfer up to 679 bytes in 5 slots, at a connection speed of 2 Mbps, and up to 1021 bytes at a speed of 3 Mbps. In 3 slots maximum amount of data is 367 and 552 bytes, respectively.</p><p>

<img src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/getpro/habr/post_images/b86/6c9/653/b866c9653eeb255db44e7fd94a409a90.png" alt="image" data-src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b86/6c9/653/b866c9653eeb255db44e7fd94a409a90.png"></p><p>

If we want to transfer less data than 679 or 1021 bytes but more than 367 or 552 bytes, the transfer will still take 5 slots, and the transmission will take the same amount of time, which reduces the transmission efficiency.</p><p>

<img src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/webt/u_/9e/at/u_9eati7dqlaegfvhdkpmwxsnxq.png" alt="image" data-src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u_/9e/at/u_9eati7dqlaegfvhdkpmwxsnxq.png"></p><p>

44100 Hz audio encoded using SBC in Dual Channel mode with bitpool = 38, 16 blocks in a frame, 8 frequency bands, produces audio frame of 164 bytes, with 452 kb/s bitrate.<br>
Audio payload should be encapsulated into L2CAP and AVDTP transmission protocols, which deduct 16 bytes of overhead from the audio payload.</p><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/formulas/b5d/9b7/6de/b5d9b76de49674bf1b01dc6a373de765.svg" alt="$\begin{align*} framelength &amp;= 4 + \frac{subbands \times channels}{2} + \\ &amp; \begin{cases} \frac{blocks \times channels \times bitpool}{8} &amp; \text{if mono or dual channel mode} \\ \frac{subbands+blocks \times bitpool}{8} &amp; \text{if joint stereo mode} \\ \frac{blocks \times bitpool}{8} &amp; \text{if stereo mode} \\ \end{cases} \end{align*}$" data-tex="display"></p><p>



One 5-slot audio transmission can contain up to 4 audio frames:</p><pre><code>679 (EDR 2 mbit/s DH5) - 4 (L2CAP) - 12 (AVDTP/RTP) - 1 (SBC header) - (164*4) = 6</code></pre><p>
A single packet transmits up to 11.7 ms of audio data, which will be transmitted in 3.75 ms, and we have 6 unused bytes left in the packet.<br>
If you slightly raise the bitpool, 4 audio frames can no longer be packed into a single transmission. You'll have to send 3 frames at a time, which reduces transmission efficiency, reduces the amount of audio transmitted in one packet, and will increase chance for audio stutter under poor radio conditions.</p><p>

551 kbps bitrate for EDR 3 Mbps was selected using the same principle: with Bitpool 47, 16 blocks per frame, 8 frequency bands, the frame size is 200 bytes, with a bit rate of 551 kbps. Single transmission can bundle up to 5 frames or 14.6 ms of music.</p><p>

The algorithm for calculating all the SBC parameters is quite complicated, you can easily make a mistake if you try to calculate all of them manually, so I made an interactive calculator to help those who interested:<br>
<a href="https://btcodecs.valdikss.org.ru/sbc-bitrate-calculator/">btcodecs.valdikss.org.ru/sbc-bitrate-calculator</a></p><h2>What is that all for?</h2><p>Contrary to popular belief of aptX sound quality, in some cases it can produce worse audio quality than SBC with a standard 328k bitrate.</p><p>

SBC dynamically allocates quantization bits for frequency bands, acting on a «bottom-to-top» basis. If the whole bitrate was used for the lower and middle frequencies, the upper frequencies are «cut off» (silenced).<br>
aptX quantizes frequency bands with the same number of bits constantly, which makes it a constant bitrate codec: 352 kbps for 44.1 kHz, 384 kbps for 48 kHz. It can't «transfer bits» to frequencies that need them most. Unlike SBC, aptX will not «cut» frequencies, but will add quantization noise to them, reducing the dynamic range of audio, and sometimes introducing crackles. SBC, on the contrary, «eats the details» — discards the quietest areas.<br>
On average, compared to SBC 328k, aptX makes less distortion in music with a wide frequency range, but on music with a narrow frequency range and a wide dynamic range SBC 328k sometimes wins.</p><p>

Let us consider a special case, a piano recording. Here's a spectrogram:<br>
<a href="https://habrastorage.org/webt/er/nq/rc/ernqrcwa0ic5mqwopjg5zbu_fxm.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w780q1/webt/i9/uh/z1/i9uhz1ewchvoprxywldrtfknlom.jpeg" alt="image" data-src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i9/uh/z1/i9uhz1ewchvoprxywldrtfknlom.jpeg" data-blurred="true"></a></p><p>

Most energy locates in the 0-4 kHz frequencies, and lasts up to 10 kHz.<br>
The spectrogram of the file aptX file looks like this:<br>
<a href="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dl/bl/do/dlbldoq_rdrjykephl2ostfbafk.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w780q1/webt/sx/3i/lw/sx3ilwm6riwrjelw-ofmljdd54m.jpeg" alt="image" data-src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sx/3i/lw/sx3ilwm6riwrjelw-ofmljdd54m.jpeg" data-blurred="true"></a></p><p>

Here is SBC 328k:<br>
<a href="https://habrastorage.org/webt/us/3m/ke/us3mke0av1s_1ezkyk6ycq1g2vo.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w780q1/webt/ah/ob/br/ahobbramaxjmsr0htxagkiflomk.jpeg" alt="image" data-src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ah/ob/br/ahobbramaxjmsr0htxagkiflomk.jpeg" data-blurred="true"></a></p><p>

It can be seen that the SBC 328k periodically completely cut off the range above 16 kHz, and used all available bitrates for the frequency ranges below this value. However, aptX introduced more distortions into the frequency spectrum audible by the human ear, which can be seen on the subtracted original audio spectrogram from the aptX spectrogram (the brighter, the more distortion):<br>
<a href="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ug/-i/5z/ug-i5zpihrfnvumf9no_glecqna.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w780q1/webt/_e/vj/gv/_evjgvlrkbymm5ptv5ymkn2orya.jpeg" alt="image" data-src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_e/vj/gv/_evjgvlrkbymm5ptv5ymkn2orya.jpeg" data-blurred="true"></a></p><p>

SBC 328k has introduced less distortion to the signal in the range from 0 to 10 kHz, and the rest frequences had been сut:<br>
<a href="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tf/x8/7z/tfx87z8hpenx51spblrfvkc-ihe.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w780q1/webt/-a/m6/23/-am623wsmq09jfcr80kmkjubp0u.jpeg" alt="image" data-src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-a/m6/23/-am623wsmq09jfcr80kmkjubp0u.jpeg" data-blurred="true"></a></p><p>

485k bitrate was enough for SBC to save the entire frequency range, without cutting off the bands.<br>
<a href="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_c/mc/xy/_cmcxyxwlf7u4tv-rbplwk5bmtu.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w780q1/webt/xx/a0/pa/xxa0patcvltugsfjwxzmh_na_rm.jpeg" alt="image" data-src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xx/a0/pa/xxa0patcvltugsfjwxzmh_na_rm.jpeg" data-blurred="true"></a></p><p>

SBC 485k produces much better results in the range of 0-15 kHz on this sample than aptX, and a smaller but still noticeable difference at 15-22 kHz (the darker, the less distortion):<br>
<a href="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e-/qz/h8/e-qzh8azmingcbhvuwxj8iptuau.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w780q1/webt/yv/mi/7v/yvmi7vfj5-ot3ztrfv-gvx43yxy.jpeg" alt="image" data-src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yv/mi/7v/yvmi7vfj5-ot3ztrfv-gvx43yxy.jpeg" data-blurred="true"></a></p><p>

By switching to a high-bitrate SBC you will get sound which is superior to aptX most of the time, on any headphones. On headphones with EDR 3 Mb/s support, 551 kb/s SBC produces sound that is very close to aptX HD.</p><h2>Can we go even further?</h2><p>Android patchset has an additional option to increase bitrate for EDR 2 mbps devices even further. You can bump the bitrate from 452 kbps to 595 kbps, at the cost of reducing the stability of the transmission in case of congested radio conditions.<br>
Just set the persist.bluetooth.sbc_hd_higher_bitrate variable to 1:</p><pre><code># setprop persist.bluetooth.sbc_hd_higher_bitrate 1</code></pre><p>
Extreme bit rate patch is currently merged only in LineageOS 15.1, but not in 16.0.</p><h2>Compatibility with the devices</h2><p>SBC Dual Channel is supported by almost all headphones, speakers and car head units. This is no wonder — the standard mandates its support in any decoding devices. There are a small number of devices on which this mode causes problems, but these are very rare cases.<br>
More details on compatible devices can be found at <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php?showtopic=914135">4pda</a> and <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/software-hacking/improve-bluetooth-audio-quality-t3832615">xda-developers</a>.</p><h2>Sound difference comparison</h2><p>I made a web service that encodes audio to SBC (as well as to aptX and aptX HD) in real time, right in the browser. You can compare the sound of different SBC profiles and other codecs without actually transmitting audio via Bluetooth using this service, on any wired headphones, speakers, and on your favorite music. You can also change the encoding parameters directly during audio playback.<br>
<a href="https://btcodecs.valdikss.org.ru/sbc-encoder/">btcodecs.valdikss.org.ru/sbc-encoder</a></p><h2>Contacting Android developers</h2><p>I tried to contact many Bluetooth stack developers from Google, asking them to consider including my patches to the main Android branch—AOSP, but did not receive a single answer. My patches in <a href="https://android-review.googlesource.com/q/topic:bt-sbc-hd-dualchannel+(status:open%20OR%20status:merged)">Gerrit code review system for Android</a> have not received any comments from anyone involved in the development as well.<br>
I would be glad if anyone could tell Google developers about this implementation of SBC HD for Android. The gerrit patchset is already out of date (this is one of the earliest revisions), but I will update it if developers are interested in my changes (it's not easy for me to update it, I don't have Android Q compatible devices).</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Users of LineageOS, Resurrection Remix and crDroid firmwares can enhance Bluetooth audio quality by ticking a checkbox in Bluetooth device settings. Linux users can also get a higher SBC bitrate by installing <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/pulseaudio-discuss/2019-June/031168.html"> the patch from Pali Rohár</a>, which among other things, adds support for the aptX, aptX HD and FastStream codecs.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Indeed, we now know that despite its supposedly bullet-proof organizational structure and its stated mission of responsible AI development, OpenAI was never going to be allowed to actually put ethics before money.</p><p>To be clear, AI safety is a really important field, and, were it to be actually practiced by corporate America, that would be one thing.<strong> </strong>That said, the version of it that  existed at OpenAI—arguably one of the companies that has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/02/17/844721/ai-openai-moonshot-elon-musk-sam-altman-greg-brockman-messy-secretive-reality/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/02/17/844721/ai-openai-moonshot-elon-musk-sam-altman-greg-brockman-messy-secretive-reality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">done the most</a></span> to pursue a “safety” oriented model—doesn’t seem to have been much of a match for the realpolitik machinations of the tech industry. In even more frank terms, the  folks who were supposed to be defending us from runaway AI (i.e., the board members)—the ones who were ordained with responsible stewardship over this powerful technology—don’t seem to have known what they were doing. They don’t seem to  have understood that Sam had all the industry  connections, the friends in high places, was well-liked, and that moving against him in a world where that kind of social capital is everything amounted to career suicide. If you come at the king, you best not miss.</p><p>In short: If the point of corporate AI safety is to protect humanity from runaway AI, then, as an effective strategy for doing that, it has effectively just flunked its first big test. That’s because it’s sorta hard to put your faith in a group of people who weren’t even capable of predicting the very predictable outcome that would occur when they fired their boss. How, exactly, can such a group be trusted with overseeing a supposedly “super-intelligent,” world-shattering technology? If you can’t outfox a gaggle of outraged investors, then you probably can’t outfox the Skynet-type entity you claim to be building. That said, I would argue we also can’t trust the craven, money-obsessed C-suite that has now reasserted its dominance. Imo, they’re <em>obviously</em> not going to do the right thing. So, effectively, humanity is stuck between a rock and a hard place.</p><p>As the conflict from the OpenAI dustup settles, it seems like the company is well positioned to get back to business as usual.

Companies realize that the technologies they are selling can be disconcerting and disruptive; they want to reassure the public that they’re doing their best to protect consumers and society. At the end of the day, though, we now know there’s no reason  to believe that those efforts will ever make a difference if the company’s “ethics” end up conflicting with its money.

Rust has been a prominent topic at the Kernel Maintainers Summit for the
last couple of years, and the 2023 meeting continued that tradition.  As
Rust-for-Linux developer Miguel Ojeda noted at the beginning of the session
dedicated to the topic, the level of interest in using Rust for kernel
development has increased significantly over the last year.  But Rust was
explicitly added to Linux as an experiment; is the kernel community now
ready to say that the experiment has succeeded?
</p><p>
The Rust-for-Linux project has added a full-time engineer in the last year,
Ojeda said, and a student developer as well.  Various companies have joined
in to support this work.  There is also work underway to get the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/698724/">Coccinelle</a> tool working with Rust code.  A
priority at the moment is bringing in more reviewers for the code that is
being posted.
</p><p>
On the toolchain front, work on <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs">gccrs</a>, the GCC-based Rust
compiler, has slowed significantly.  The <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc">GCC code generator
for <tt>rustc</tt></a> is showing better progress; it can compile kernel
code now and has been merged into the compiler.  This GCC-based backend
will enable the expansion of Rust support to architectures that are not
supported by the LLVM-based <tt>rustc</tt>.  Meanwhile, the Rust project
itself is increasing its involvement in this work; this is good, since the
kernel has some unique requirements and will need guarantees that language
changes won't break kernel code in the future.
</p><p>
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/952032/"><img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2023/lpc/MiguelOjeda-sm.png" alt="[Miguel Ojeda]" title="Miguel Ojeda"></a>

Within the kernel, work is proceeding in a number of subsystems.  The Rust
implementation of Android's binder is working well and its performance is
on a par with the C implementation.  The amount of unsafe code that was
needed to get there was pleasingly small.  Filesystem bindings are the
subject of work by Wedson Almeida Filho, who is targeting read-only support
for now.  The object there is to make it possible to implement a filesystem
in 100% safe Rust.
</p><p>
In general, he is finding an increasing number of maintainers who are open
to the idea of using Rust.  That leads to an issue the Rust developers have
run up against, though.  It would be good to have some reference drivers in
the kernel as an example of how drivers can be written and to make it
possible to compare Rust and C drivers.  The best way to do that often
seems to be to merge a Rust driver that duplicates the functionality of an
existing C driver — but that sort of duplicate functionality is not
welcomed by maintainers.  Perhaps, he said, it would be good to allow a few
duplicate drivers that are not meant for actual use, but only as examples
for other developers to use.
</p><p>
There are some other challenges; upstreaming the block-layer abstractions
has run into some resistance.  Virtual filesystem layer maintainer
Christian Brauner said that he is not opposed to merging those
abstractions, but he would rather not do that and see filesystems built on
it right away.  He would prefer to see an implementation of something
relatively simple, along the lines of the binder driver, to show that
things work as expected.
</p><h4>A driver soon?</h4>
<p>
Dave Airlie, the maintainer of the DRM (graphics) subsystem, said that, if
he has his way, there will be a Rust DRM driver merged within the next
couple of releases.  Christoph Hellwig shot back that Airlie was willing to
"make everybody's life hell" so that he could play with his favorite toy.
Merging Rust, Hellwig said, would force others to deal with a second language,
new toolchains, and "wrappers with weird semantics".  Dan Williams said
that the current situation "is what success looks like", and that the
kernel community was already committed to Rust.
</p><p>
Airlie continued that a lot of the Rust work is currently blocked in a sort
of chicken-and-egg problem.  Abstractions cannot be merged until there is a
user for them, but the code needing those abstractions is blocked waiting
for code to land in multiple subsystems.  As a result, developers working
on Rust are dragging around large stacks of patches that they need to get
their code to work.  Breaking that roadblock will require letting in some
abstractions without immediate users.  Ojeda agreed that this problem has
been slowing progress, but said he has tried not to put pressure on
maintainers to merge code quickly.  In the case of networking, ironically,
the Rust developers <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/949270/">had to ask the networking
maintainers to slow down</a> merging Rust code.
</p><p>
The conversation took several directions from there.  Greg Kroah-Hartman
said that merging the binder driver would be a good next step; it is
self-contained, has a single user that is committed to its maintenance, and
doesn't touch the rest of the kernel.  Kees Cook disputed the description
of Rust as a "toy", saying that there is a lot of pressure to not use C for
new code; Hellwig responded that the developers would have to rewrite
everything in Rust, otherwise the resulting dual-language code base would
be worse than what exists now.
</p><p>
Dave Chinner worried that maintainers lack the expertise to properly review
the abstractions that are being merged.  Airlie replied that maintainers
merge a lot of C APIs now without really understanding how they work.  A
lot of mistakes have been made in the process, but "we're still here".
When things turn out to be broken, they can be fixed, and that will happen
more quickly if the code goes upstream.
</p><p>
Ted Ts'o expressed concern about the burden that adding Rust code will
place on maintainers.  The Rust developers are setting higher standards
than have been set in the past, he said.  Getting good abstractions merged
is one thing, but who is responsible for reviewing drivers, and how will
tree-wide changes be handled?  The Rust effort, he said, is getting to a
point where it is impacting a growing part of the community.
</p><p>
Williams pointed out that <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/951846/">the previous
session</a> had discussed how hard it is to get kernel subsystems to move
to new APIs; now, he said, there is talk of moving to a whole new language.
Hellwig said that the real problem is that the Rust bindings tend to work
differently than the C APIs they provide abstractions for; the new APIs may
well be better, but they are still completely new APIs.  What should be done,
he said, is to first fix the C APIs so that they are directly usable by
Rust code.  He proposed that, for each subsystem that is considering
bringing in Rust code, a year or two should first be spent on cleaning up
its APIs along those lines.  Ojeda said that this kind of API improvement
has already happened in some subsystems.
</p><p>
Linus Torvalds said that he was seeing a divide between the filesystem and
driver maintainers.  Developers on the filesystem side tend to be more
conservative, while the driver world "is the wild west".  Driver authors
tend not to understand concurrency, he said, and a lot of the code there is
broken and unfixable.  So it is unsurprising that there is interest in
bringing in a language that better supports the writing of correct and safe
code.
</p><p>
Brauner said that Rust can help with a lot of problems, since the compiler
can keep a lot of bugs from making it into the kernel.  But he worried
about whether there would be maintainer and development support for it a
few years from now.  Airlie again mentioned developers with out-of-tree
code needed by Rust code; Cook answered that the people shepherding that
code <i>are</i> maintainers, and that bringing it in would bring the
maintainers with it.  Airlie added that those maintainers are the sort of
younger developers that the kernel community would like to attract.
</p><p>
Chinner said that he would like to see a reimplementation of the ext2
filesystem in Rust.  It is a complete filesystem that makes wide use of the
kernel's APIs, but it is still small enough to read and understand.  If the
Rust APIs can support an ext2 implementation, they will be enough to
implement others as well.  Meanwhile, the ext2 implementation would be good
reference for maintainers, who could compare it to the C version.
</p><h4>Confidence</h4>
<p>
Ts'o asked when the community would feel enough confidence that it could
have modules where the only implementation is in Rust.  Binder could be a
good start, he said, perhaps followed by a driver that sees wider use.
Airlie said that he is considering a virtual graphics driver that
reimplements an existing C driver.  There is also the driver for Apple M1
GPUs.  He is feeling a fair amount of pressure to get it upstream and
is wondering if there is any reason why he should keep it out.  After that,
he would love to see a rewrite of the Nouveau driver for NVIDIA GPUs.
</p><p>
Arnd Bergmann said those drivers could be OK, but that it will be quite a
bit longer before something like a keyboard driver could be merged; the
toolchain just isn't ready, he said, for a driver what would be widely
used.  That led to a question about the frequent version upgrades being
seen in the kernel, which moved to Rust 1.73.0 for 6.7.  That upgrade
process will eventually stop and a minimum Rust version will be set once
the important features that the kernel depends on have stabilized.  He said
that he has been working to get the kernel code into the Rust
continuous-integration tests to help ensure that it continues working as
the compiler and language evolve.
</p><p>
Bergmann said that he didn't plan to look seriously at the language until
it could be compiled with GCC.  Torvalds answered that, while he used to
find problems in the LLVM Clang compiler, now he's more likely to find
problems with GCC instead; he now builds with Clang.  Ojeda said that he is
working on finding developer resources for gccrs; the project is currently
sitting on over 800 out-of-tree patches and still has a lot of work to do
on top of that.  GCC support will be a while, he said.
</p><p>
Ts'o complained that the language still isn't entirely stable.  This could
be a particular problem for the confidential-computing community; they are
concerned about security and, as a consequence, about backports to
long-term-support kernels.  But if those kernels are on different Rust
versions, those backports will be problematic.  Ojeda said that, while it
is a "crazy idea", backporting the version upgrades could be considered.
He doesn't think that the change rate will be high enough to be a problem,
though.
</p><p>
At the conclusion, Torvalds pointed out that there have been problems over
the years with GCC changes breaking the kernel; the same will surely happen
with Rust, but it will be the same thing in the end.  The session, well
over time, was brought to a halt at this point.  Whether the kernel
community has truly concluded that it is committed to Rust remains to be
seen; there will almost certainly be pull requests adding significant Rust
code in the near future.<br clear="all"></p><table>

By mass, there’s more titanium in the earth’s crust than carbon by a factor of nearly 30, and more titanium than copper by a factor of nearly 100.</span></p><p><span>But despite its abundance, it's only recently that civilization has been able to use titanium as a metal (titanium dioxide has been in use somewhat longer as a paint pigment). Because titanium so readily bonds with oxygen and other elements, it doesn’t occur at all in metallic form in nature. </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/DTIC_AD0801280/page/n71/mode/1up?q=%22difficult+to+machine%22" rel="">One engineer</a><span> described titanium as a “streetwalker," because it will pick up anything and everything. While copper has been used by civilization since 7000 BC, and iron since around 3000 BC, titanium wasn’t discovered until the late 1700s, and wasn’t produced in metallic form until the late 19th century. As late as 1945, there was no commercial production of titanium, and the metal only existed in tiny amounts in labs. But less than 10 years later, thousands of tons of it were being made a year. And 10 years after that, it formed the literal backbone of the most advanced aerospace technology on the planet.</span></p><p><span>As a report to the </span><a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/1712/chapter/4#14" rel="">National Research Council notes</a><span>, “the birth of a tonnage structural metal industry is an unusual event. Only three such births have occurred in the past 100 years [now closer to 150] – aluminum, magnesium, and titanium – and no new one is in prospect.” How did titanium go from totally unused to a critical aerospace technology? What does it tell us about technological development? Let’s take a look.</span></p><p>Titanium was first discovered in 1790 by William Gregor, an English clergyman and chemist who realized he couldn’t identify a metal contained in a white oxide mixed in with the black sands of Cornwall. In 1795, Martin Klaproth, a Prussian chemist, was able to extract titanium from the mineral rutile. Because of the strong bond it formed with oxygen, Klaproth named the metal “titanium” after the Greek Titans.</p><p>Because titanium bonds so readily with other elements and contaminates so easily, it's extremely difficult to obtain in a pure state, and for the next hundred years titanium was mostly regarded as a laboratory curiosity. In the 1880s, two Swedish scientists successfully produced 94% pure titanium metal, and in 1910 Matthew Hunter, a scientist at General Electric, developed a variant of their process to produce metallic titanium while searching for a material for improved lightbulb filaments.</p><p>But a commercially viable process for producing titanium wasn’t developed until the 1930s. In 1930 William Kroll, a scientist from Luxembourg, began experimenting with titanium in his home lab, and developed a process to produce titanium by reacting titanium chloride (TiCl4) with magnesium under a vacuum. By 1938, he had successfully produced 50 pounds of titanium metal, and successfully formed it into wires, rods, sheets, and plating. Kroll came to the US in 1938 to attempt to sell his process, but was unsuccessful.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f78383e-815c-442f-b206-3a135861b996_724x561.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f78383e-815c-442f-b206-3a135861b996_724x561.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f78383e-815c-442f-b206-3a135861b996_724x561.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f78383e-815c-442f-b206-3a135861b996_724x561.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f78383e-815c-442f-b206-3a135861b996_724x561.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f78383e-815c-442f-b206-3a135861b996_724x561.png" width="724" height="561" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9f78383e-815c-442f-b206-3a135861b996_724x561.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:561,&quot;width&quot;:724,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f78383e-815c-442f-b206-3a135861b996_724x561.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f78383e-815c-442f-b206-3a135861b996_724x561.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f78383e-815c-442f-b206-3a135861b996_724x561.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f78383e-815c-442f-b206-3a135861b996_724x561.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Kroll’s samples of titanium metal in 1938, via Kroll 1955</figcaption></figure></div><p>That same year, the US Bureau of Mines began to investigate titanium, in response to promising studies of its properties performed by the Philips Corporation (which had developed its own process for producing titanium). The Bureau of Mines concluded the Kroll process had the most potential as a commercial process and began to develop it. Its work was delayed by the war, but as early as 1944 the Bureau of Mines was making 15-pound batches of titanium in a plant that could make 100 pounds of titanium a week.</p><p>After the war, the Bureau’s work on titanium accelerated. By 1947 it had successfully scaled up Kroll’s process, and had produced two tons of titanium “sponge,” a porous, spongy metal created by the process, which is melted down to produce bars, sheets, wires, etc. A 1948 report on titanium’s properties commissioned by the Bureau concluded that titanium and its alloys had great potential engineering applications. Titanium was nearly as strong as stainless steel, but weighed 40% less. It was also incredibly corrosion-resistant, and maintained much more strength at elevated temperatures compared to aluminum. This made it potentially very useful for aerospace applications, where weight was at a premium and materials were often exposed to high temperatures.</p><p>The military had followed the progress of the Bureau’s development work, and interest in the metal was high after samples began to be investigated by Army, Navy, and Air Force labs. Titanium began to be called a “wonder metal”:</p><blockquote><p><em>The metal gained numerous advocates within the military and industry. Early promoters visualized the use of titanium in naval vessels, armor plate, tanks, trucks, landing craft, aircraft structures, and airborne equipment. It was thought that it could possibly replace both aluminum and steel in the design of many defense applications. - Simcoe 2018</em></p></blockquote><p>In 1948, titanium first began to be produced commercially, at a small DuPont plant that could produce 100 pounds of titanium a day. The first batches of titanium went to experimental use on military jets, such as the F-84 and the F-86. To try to kickstart the industry, the Air Force encouraged manufacturers to substitute steel with titanium, and the Army Ordnance Corporation placed an order for $1 million worth of titanium metal.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa24e7ebd-a9b3-4ecf-abc5-a2d34c0b14ff_839x639.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa24e7ebd-a9b3-4ecf-abc5-a2d34c0b14ff_839x639.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa24e7ebd-a9b3-4ecf-abc5-a2d34c0b14ff_839x639.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa24e7ebd-a9b3-4ecf-abc5-a2d34c0b14ff_839x639.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa24e7ebd-a9b3-4ecf-abc5-a2d34c0b14ff_839x639.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa24e7ebd-a9b3-4ecf-abc5-a2d34c0b14ff_839x639.png" width="839" height="639" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a24e7ebd-a9b3-4ecf-abc5-a2d34c0b14ff_839x639.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:639,&quot;width&quot;:839,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa24e7ebd-a9b3-4ecf-abc5-a2d34c0b14ff_839x639.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa24e7ebd-a9b3-4ecf-abc5-a2d34c0b14ff_839x639.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa24e7ebd-a9b3-4ecf-abc5-a2d34c0b14ff_839x639.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa24e7ebd-a9b3-4ecf-abc5-a2d34c0b14ff_839x639.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>F-84, via wikipedia</figcaption></figure></div><p>In the press, titanium began to be called “the wonder metal," “the miracle metal," and the “Cinderella metal” (because it had been overlooked for so long). An executive for a company producing titanium noted that “Sensational magazine articles predicted that titanium would become the miracle metal-for spacecraft, ‘atomic furnaces,’ airplanes of all kinds, submarines, railroad tracks, truck bodies, portable bridges” (Rowley 1972). Between 1950 and 1952, more than two dozen companies announced plans to produce titanium.</p><p>But the nascent titanium industry struggled. In 1951, the materials advisory board projected the need for 30,000 tons of titanium products, but actual shipments were just 75 tons, barely enough for research applications. Producers had assumed that the same equipment for melting, rolling, and shaping stainless steel could be used for titanium, but this turned out to be very difficult: titanium didn’t behave like steel, or like any other metal. Titanium was found “not to forge like any other material,” (DTIC 1952) and stamping it in presses damaged the stamping dies. A company that studied grinding titanium noted that “titanium grinds unlike steel. Anything you have learned concerning the effective grinding of steel does not apply in the case of titanium”. The first attempts to use titanium on commercial aircraft resulted in a sheet of metal so brittle it could be torn in half like a sheet of paper. Mills found that they often “produced more scrap than useful metal" (Simcoe 2018).</p><p>To support the budding industry, the US government stepped in. It funded the construction of several titanium sponge plants, and agreed to purchase any surplus titanium sponge production for the national stockpile. It offered rapid amortization of titanium production equipment for tax purposes, and demonstrated production techniques at the Bureau of Mines’ pilot plant. The Army funded projects to develop better alloys, including one of 6% aluminum and 4% vanadium (Ti-6Al-4V) that remains the most popular alloy of titanium today, and is credited with saving the titanium industry. When it was found that rolling titanium into sheets consistently was difficult, in 1956 the Department of Defense initiated a program to develop sheet rolling of titanium, “one of the most comprehensive technical programs ever undertaken in metallurgy” (Simcoe 2018). Production problems were overcome, and titanium was increasingly used for aerospace applications. By 1958, Pratt and Whitney had produced 5000 jet engines with titanium components, and the US industry was producing thousands of tons of titanium products a year.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8667efda-5f6d-480a-bc16-24037b636815_1600x1188.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8667efda-5f6d-480a-bc16-24037b636815_1600x1188.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8667efda-5f6d-480a-bc16-24037b636815_1600x1188.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8667efda-5f6d-480a-bc16-24037b636815_1600x1188.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8667efda-5f6d-480a-bc16-24037b636815_1600x1188.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8667efda-5f6d-480a-bc16-24037b636815_1600x1188.png" width="1456" height="1081" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8667efda-5f6d-480a-bc16-24037b636815_1600x1188.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1081,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8667efda-5f6d-480a-bc16-24037b636815_1600x1188.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8667efda-5f6d-480a-bc16-24037b636815_1600x1188.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8667efda-5f6d-480a-bc16-24037b636815_1600x1188.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8667efda-5f6d-480a-bc16-24037b636815_1600x1188.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>A-12, via Wikipedia</figcaption></figure></div><p>In the late 1950s, Lockheed won a contract to develop a high-speed, high altitude reconnaissance plane for the CIA. Because it was the 12th iteration of a design codenamed “Archangel," it became known as the A-12. To meet the unprecedented performance requirements (a cruising speed of Mach 3 and a cruising altitude of nearly 90,000 feet), Lockheed needed a metal that would retain its strength at the hundreds of degrees the exterior of the plane would reach. This ruled out aluminum, leaving either stainless steel or titanium. Ultimately, titanium alloy was selected for the A-12, as it would cut the gross weight of the plane nearly in half.</p><p><span>Titanium had never been used to such an extent on an aircraft, or anywhere else. Lockheed had worked with titanium on a small scale since 1949 but prior to the A-12 titanium had mostly been used for small components on jet engines. For several years, for instance, 50% of all titanium was used in the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_%26_Whitney_J57" rel="">J-57 jet engine</a><span>. But on the A-12, titanium would be used for nearly every part of the airplane – 93% of the gross weight of the A-12’s structure was titanium.</span></p><p>Building a plane out of titanium proved difficult. Initially Lockheed “had no idea how to extrude it, push it through into various shapes, or weld or rivet or drill it” (Rich 1994), and every production problem solved seemed to reveal two or three more. Titanium was found to be “totally incompatible” with chemicals like chlorine, fluorine, and cadmium. In one case, an engineer who marked a sheet of titanium using a pen with chlorine-based ink was shocked to see the ink etch away the metal like acid. Titanium bolts that were heated had their heads pop off, a problem that was eventually traced to cadmium-coated wrenches used to tighten them. Titanium welds made in the summer unexpectedly failed, due to (it was eventually realized) chlorine that the local utility added to the water during the summer to prevent algae growth.</p><p>When Lockheed tried to fabricate a portion of the forward fuselage, which had to be made from a novel “beta” titanium alloy, it found that the titanium was so brittle after heat treating that it would shatter if dropped on the floor. This was eventually resolved by replacing an acid-pickling process with one identical to that of Lockheed’s supplier, but not before scrapping thousands of titanium components. Of the first 6000 pieces fabricated from the beta titanium alloy, 95% were lost.</p><p>But over time, Lockheed overcame its production problems. In machining, for instance, drill bits initially needed to be replaced every ten holes, ten times as often as when drilling aluminum. In other machining operations, the rate of metal removal was just 5% of the rate when machining aluminum. To improve its machining, Lockheed developed new drill bits, cutting fluids, and cutting machinery, and learned the proper “feeds and speeds” for machining titanium (it was found, for instance, that small changes in cutting speed had a large effect on tool life). Over the course of the program, the rate of metal removal in machining was increased to “3 to 10 times the industry average” (Johnson 1970), and drill life was increased by more than a factor of 10.</p><p>The A-12 “practically spawned its own industrial base” (CIA 2012), and over the course of the program thousands of machinists, mechanics, fabricators, and other personnel were trained in how to work with titanium efficiently. As Lockheed gained production experience with titanium, it issued reports to the Air Force and to its vendors on production methods, and “set up training classes for machinists, a complete research facility for developing tools and procedures, and issued research contracts to competent outside vendors to develop improved equipment" (Johnson 1970).</p><p>The A-12 first flew in 1962. 14 years later, its successor, the better-known SR-71, set an airspeed record of nearly 2200 miles per hour, which remains unbroken today.</p><p>While titanium manufacturing for aerospace was ramping up, a very different use of the metal was being discovered. In 1952, Swedish medical researcher Per-Ingvar Brånemark was studying blood flow in healing bones. In one experiment studying the bone marrow of rabbits, Brånemark’s team implanted a tiny camera into rabbits legs, to watch the wound heal from the inside. When they later went to remove the camera, they found that the titanium camera casing had bonded with the bone.</p><p>At the time, it was thought that the body would eventually reject any foreign object implanted in it. Dr. Brånemark’s discovery that bone would bond directly with titanium (which he dubbed “osseointegration”) was radical, and had huge potential implications for medical implants. Brånemark quickly pivoted his research to study osseointegration, eventually receiving a grant from the US National Institutes of Health. Research on his own students (where he implanted a small piece of titanium in their arms) showed that titanium could be safely implanted in the body with no ill-effects.</p><p>Interestingly, during the course of this research, it was noticed that bone could conduct sound – a deaf patient was able to “hear” the ultrasonic vibrations used to check that the titanium had been implanted correctly. One of Brånemark’s students followed up on this discovery, and developed the first bone conduction implants to restore hearing in deaf people.</p><p><span>Brånemark’s team went on to develop titanium dental implants (which were often made from </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=EhnsCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=Titanium+world+war+2&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;source=gb_mobile_search&amp;ovdme=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi4uIr5zen_AhWukWoFHQT1Av0Q6AF6BAgDEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Titanium%20world%20war%202&amp;f=false" rel="">surplus aircraft-grade titanium</a><span>) that lasted much longer than implants of other metals. Today, the Brånemark system of dental implants is still sold, and titanium is the most popular material for dental implants, as well as being used for other medical implants such as </span><a href="https://www.addmoretolives.com/titanium-vs-ceramic-which-type-of-hip-replacement-implant-is-better-for-you/" rel="">artificial hips</a><span>.</span></p><p>You can get a sense of the development of the titanium industry by reading reports on industrial symposiums held in the 1940s, 50s, and 60s.</p><p><span>The </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/DTIC_ADA382831/page/n3/mode/2up?q=subsidy" rel="">first symposium on titanium</a><span> was held in 1948, and was organized by the Navy to provide “a comprehensive review of the titanium research effort”. Several military organizations discussed their research programs, but most of the presentations were on topics such as physical properties of titanium and its various alloys, the crystal structure that resulted from different methods of fabrication, and methods of melting titanium sponge. The pages are full of pictures of laboratory setups, graphs of data on stress-strain relationships, phase diagrams, and magnified pictures of titanium microstructure. Nearly all the presentations are from either research labs or from companies trying to produce raw titanium “sponge” from ore.</span></p><p><span>In 1952, </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/DTIC_AD0635553/page/n30/mode/1up?q=subsidy" rel="">another titanium symposium</a><span> was held, this one sponsored by the Army’s Watertown Arsenal. By then, titanium was being manufactured in large quantities, and while the prior symposium had been focused on laboratory studies of titanium’s physical and chemical properties, the 1952 symposium was a “practical discussion of the properties, processing, machinability, and similar characteristics of titanium". While physical characteristics of titanium still took center stage, there was a practical slant to the discussions – how wide a sheet of titanium can be produced, how large an ingot of it can be made, how can it be forged, or pressed, or welded, and so on. Presentations were by titanium fabricators, but also by metalworking companies that had been experimenting with the metal.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Though by 1952 many of these companies had been working with titanium for years, there’s an air of uncertainty in many of the presentations, a distinct sense of “this is what we’ve learned so far, but there’s still much we don’t know.” A company that studied the effects of different working fluids when grinding titanium admitted that not enough was known about the chemistry at work to understand why different fluids had different effects. A company that studied surface treatments and polishing methods noted that “materials and methods for polishing titanium have not been definitively established," and that while “the most commonly used abrasives are not completely satisfactory," manufacturers were working on the problem, and “more efficient methods will no doubt be developed”. A company that studied cold-forming of titanium sheets described its own methods as “crude and undeveloped”.</p><p><span>In 1966, </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/DTIC_AD0801280/page/n71/mode/1up?q=%22difficult+to+machine%22" rel="">another titanium symposium was held</a><span>, this one sponsored by the Northrup Corporation. By this time, titanium had been used successfully for many years, and the purpose of this symposium was to “provide technical personnel of diversified disciplines with a working knowledge of titanium technology.” This time, the lion’s share of the presentations are by aerospace companies experienced in working with the metal, and the uncertain air that existed in the 1952 symposium is gone. A presenter on titanium’s corrosion resistance noted that “the corrosion resistance of titanium, unlike that of most metals, can be defined within rather simple limits." A presentation on forging noted that “titanium alloys are quite forgeable…The evidence which substantiates this statement is the large number of jet engine and missile components plus the growing lists of structural parts that have been produced in the last 10 years.” And a presentation on machining noted that “Fifteen years ago, titanium was considered to be very difficult to machine. Subsequent research and experience, however, have progressively improved this situation," the result of “gradual refinements in tool materials, machine tools, tool geometries, and cutting fluids”.</span></p><p>Thus, by the mid-1960s, titanium had become a mature engineering material. While there was still much to learn about titanium, the practical aspects of working with it and using it to solve engineering problems were well-understood, and it increasingly found use in aerospace and other industry applications. Following the A-12, for instance, military aircraft began to make extensive use of titanium in their structural frames. From military aircraft, titanium made its way into commercial aircraft. By 1971, 46% of titanium was going towards commercial aircraft, compared to 37% to government aerospace projects.</p><p>What can we learn from the story of titanium?</p><p>For one, titanium is a government research success story. Titanium metal was essentially willed into existence by the US government, which searched for a promising production process, successfully scaled it up when it found one, and performed much of the initial research on titanium’s material properties, potential alloys, and manufacturing methods. Nearly all early demand for titanium was for government aerospace projects, and when the nascent industry struggled, the government stepped in to subsidize production. As a result, titanium achieved a level of production in 10 years that took aluminum and magnesium nearly 30.</p><p>The government’s support of the early industry was successful: shortly after the program was initiated in 1951, the cost of titanium began to decline more steeply. Since then, titanium costs have fallen at an impressive 23% learning rate (ie: costs fall 23% every time cumulative production doubles), similar to the learning rate in solar PV production. When government subsidies were removed in the late 1950s, the industry struggled, but cost declines continued. And from the initial government projects in military aerospace, titanium has spread into commercial aircraft, medical implants, industrial equipment, and other uses. Titanium is thus a successful case of the government jumpstarting an industry.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb915cb8-1ca7-40ba-83b8-d7dbcdfadb15_681x471.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb915cb8-1ca7-40ba-83b8-d7dbcdfadb15_681x471.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb915cb8-1ca7-40ba-83b8-d7dbcdfadb15_681x471.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb915cb8-1ca7-40ba-83b8-d7dbcdfadb15_681x471.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb915cb8-1ca7-40ba-83b8-d7dbcdfadb15_681x471.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb915cb8-1ca7-40ba-83b8-d7dbcdfadb15_681x471.png" width="681" height="471" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fb915cb8-1ca7-40ba-83b8-d7dbcdfadb15_681x471.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:471,&quot;width&quot;:681,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb915cb8-1ca7-40ba-83b8-d7dbcdfadb15_681x471.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb915cb8-1ca7-40ba-83b8-d7dbcdfadb15_681x471.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb915cb8-1ca7-40ba-83b8-d7dbcdfadb15_681x471.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb915cb8-1ca7-40ba-83b8-d7dbcdfadb15_681x471.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Via USGS data</figcaption></figure></div><p>But titanium is also a story about the limits of this sort of jumpstarting. Despite its impressive learning rate, titanium remains an expensive, niche material. A 2006 report noted that titanium is five times as expensive as aluminum to refine and ten times as expensive as aluminum to turn into finished products. Despite initial expectations, titanium hasn’t widely displaced either aluminum or stainless steel, and is only used where its unique properties make its high cost worth it. The aerospace industry remains the largest user of titanium.</p><p>It's interesting to compare progress in titanium production with progress in solar photovoltaics. In both cases, the basic phenomenon (metallic titanium and producing electricity from sunlight) had been explored in the late 1800s, but it wasn’t until mid-20th century technology breakthroughs (the Kroll process and the silicon PV cell) that they became practical. In both cases, the US government funded much of the initial development, and acted as the first customer (government satellites and government aerospace projects). Both have similar learning curve slopes, and both technologies gradually expanded outside of their initial markets as knowledge was gained and the costs of the technology fell. And in both cases, there were sky-high expectations for the “potentially world-changing technology” that neither initially lived up to.</p><p>But whereas titanium remains a relatively niche, expensive technology, solar PV is increasingly widely deployed, and seems poised to become the primary method of electric power production. In learning curve terms, while both titanium and solar PV have similar learning rates, the solar PV curve has stretched much farther. Between 1975 and today, cumulative titanium production has increased by perhaps a factor of 5-10 (cumulative US consumption of titanium sponge was about 250,000 tons in 1975, and about 1.3 million tons in 2019). Cumulative solar PV production, on the other hand, has increased by a factor of more than 300,000. Though they have the same learning rate, solar PV has had many more doublings in production volume, and its costs have thus fallen much further.</p><p>I can see at least two potential factors here. One is that solar PV production has seen a much greater level of government support than titanium production has. In addition to early government support in the 1950s, solar PV also saw US and Japanese government investment in the 1970s, and German government support in the 1990s (via a generous feed-in tariff). Today, governments around the world support solar PV via feed in tariffs, tax credits, and renewable portfolio standards. Continued government subsidies have incentivized increased production, which has resulted in the costs of solar PV continuing to fall. Without that government support, the level of production of solar PV would have been much lower, and its march down the learning curve would have happened much more slowly.</p><p>Titanium, on the other hand, has seen much less government support. After subsidies were withdrawn in the late 1950s, the titanium industry has been dependent on large government or commercial aerospace projects. If those fail to materialize (such as when Cold War strategy pivoted from bombers to missiles, or when supersonic commercial aircraft development was canceled), the industry has struggled. If government support of the industry had continued, perhaps it would be farther along on its learning curve.</p><p>The other potential factor is technical: while there are many potential process improvements to solar PV manufacturing, there may be substantially fewer potential improvements in titanium production. In the 1950s, it was hoped/assumed that a better process for producing titanium sponge would come along to replace the Kroll process, which is a laborious and energy-intensive batch process that must be done in an inert atmosphere. But such a process has never materialized, and the Kroll process remains the primary method of refining titanium ore. Likewise, turning titanium sponge into metal is an energy and capital-intensive process, often requiring multiple rounds of melting the metal to achieve sufficient purity. This process has also changed little since the 1950s.</p><p><span>Beyond the lack of process improvements, titanium is just fundamentally difficult and expensive to deal with. Turning titanium ingots into bars and sheets is a challenge due to titanium’s reactivity: it readily absorbs impurities, requiring “frequent surface removal and trimming to eliminate surface defects” which are “costly and involve significant yield loss.” Machining titanium is likewise fundamentally expensive. </span><a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/MG789.html" rel="">As one report notes</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>The hardness that makes titanium so desirable also makes it more difficult to machine than traditional aluminum. This presents a challenge akin to that of machining high-strength steel. However, the process is complicated by titanium’s high reactivity and low thermal conductivity. It is highly reactive and tends to wear tools very quickly, especially at higher temperatures. The low thermal conductivity means that high temperatures can be generated easily in the course of machining. Consequently, titanium must be machined at lower tool speeds, slowing production.</em></p></blockquote><p>If there are simply fewer potential process improvements in titanium production compared to solar PV, due to the lack of better refining processes and the various physical constraints dictated by its chemistry, there’s less room for costs to fall. With less room for costs to fall, titanium remains an expensive, niche material, which in turn keeps production volumes low.</p><p>Titanium is also a story about the importance of serendipity in scientific discovery and technology advancement. Titanium’s biocompatibility, and its usefulness for medical implants, was discovered purely by chance. Studying biocompatibility led to another chance discovery, that of bone conduction of sound. Both of these discoveries led to the development of important medical technology, implants and hearing aids.</p><p>Finally, titanium is also a story about the critical role that manufacturing plays in technology development. The knowledge required to turn titanium into a practical technology came from the research lab, but it also came from the factory floor. Using titanium meant understanding its chemical properties, but it also meant figuring out how to forge it, weld it, press it, turn it into fasteners, design parts effectively with it, designing tools to machine it, and a million other shop floor discoveries that came from actually building things with the metal. As one producer noted, “you cannot ship a customer a carload full of tensile properties, nor a box full of Charpy tests. You have to make something out of the material in order to use these marvelous characteristics.” (DTIC 1952). It's only after the enormous effort to build the all-titanium A-12, and the training of thousands of machinists, fabricators, engineers, and other workers to work with titanium, that we begin to see titanium being used in large amounts in military and commercial aircraft. This sort of practical knowledge – the learning that comes from actual production – is critical for technological progress. Technology consists of materials and machines and ideas, but they’re all stitched together by a collection of people that know how to do things. It’s by way of those people doing those things, and understanding them better and better, that new and better technology becomes possible.</p><ul><li><p>Report of Symposium on Titanium, 1948</p></li><li><p>Proceedings of the titanium symposium at Watertown Arsenal, 1952</p></li><li><p>Titanium 1966: Lectures given at Norair symposium</p></li><li><p>Johnson 1970 - Some Development Aspects of the YF-12A Interceptor</p></li><li><p>Johnson 1981 - Development of the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird</p></li><li><p>Rich 1994 - Skunk Works: A personal memoir of my years at Lockheed</p></li><li><p>Donachie 1988 - Titanium: A technical guide</p></li><li><p>Titanium: Past, Present, and Future (1983)</p></li><li><p>Tylecote 1976 - History of metallurgy</p></li><li><p>Simcoe 2018 - The history of metals in America</p></li><li><p>Robarge 2012 - Archangel: CIA’s supersonic A-12 reconnaissance aircraft</p></li><li><p>Seong 2009 - Titanium: industrial base, price trends, and technology initiatives</p></li><li><p>Abkowitz - The emergence of the titanium industry</p></li><li><p>Kroll 1955 - How commercial titanium and zirconium were born</p></li><li><p>Titanium in aerospace applications (1961)</p></li></ul></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Google has <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/resuming-the-transition-to-mv3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a> it will shut down Manifest V2 in June 2024 and move on to Manifest V3, the latest version of its Chrome extension specification that has faced criticism for putting limits on ad blockers. Roughly said, Manifest V2 and V3 are the rules that browser extension developers have to follow if they want their extensions to get accepted into the Google Play Store.</p>



<p>Manifest V2 is the old model. The Chrome Web Store no longer accepts <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Manifest V2 extensions</a>, but browsers can still use them. For now. Manifest V3 is supported generally in Chrome 88 or later and will be the standard after the transition planned to take place in June 2024.</p>



<p>A popular type of browser extensions are ad blockers. Almost all these ad blockers work with block lists, which are long lists of domains, subdomains, and IP addresses that they filter out of your web traffic. These lists are commonly referred to as rulesets. One part of the transition will <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/improvements-to-content-filtering-in-manifest-v3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">“improve” content filtering</a>. And to be fair, Google has made some compromises when it comes to the version as it’s now in the planning, compared to what it originally planned to do. </p>



<ul>
<li>Originally, each extension could offer users a choice of 50 static rulesets, and 10 of these rulesets could be enabled simultaneously. This changes to 50 extensions simultaneously and 100 in total.</li>



<li>Extensions could add up to 5,000 rules dynamically which encouraged using this functionality sparingly and made it easier for Google to detect abuse. Extensions can add rules dynamically to support more frequent updates and user-defined rules. But it comes with the risks of phishing or data theft because these “updates” are not checked during the Chrome Web Store review. For example, a redirect rule could be abused to inject affiliate links without consent. But Google has decided that <code>block</code> and <code>allow</code> are not that easily abused so it will allow up to 30,000 rules to be added dynamically.</li>
</ul>



<p>However, this is still far from enough to fully reach the potential of the best ad blockers we have now. And it’s not just the hard limits on filtering rulesets, there are a lot of other new limits on filtering. Items can’t be filtered based on the response headers or according to the URL in the address bar. Also, extension developers are limited in what regular expressions they can use, along with other technical limitations.</p>



<p>Even if this is not targeted at ad blockers specifically, it’s still a major change that makes blocking requests less flexible. But the bottom line result is that it limits the API that many ad blockers use, and replace it with a less capable one.</p>



<p>Google’s will tell you that by limiting extensions, the browser can be lighter on resources, and Google can protect your privacy from extension developers and calls it “a step in the direction of privacy, security, and performance.” The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) however calls Manifest V3 <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/chrome-users-beware-manifest-v3-deceitful-and-threatening" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">deceitful and threatening</a>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Manifest V3 is another example of the inherent conflict of interest that comes from Google controlling both the dominant web browser and one of the largest internet advertising networks.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Under the new specifications, browser extensions that monitor and filter the web traffic between the browser and the website will have greatly reduced capabilities. This includes ad blockers and privacy-protective tracker blockers. No real surprise, considering Google has trackers installed on <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/biggest-tracker-networks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">75% of the top one million websites</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpDFS-GUytg&amp;t=416s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According</a> to Firefox’s Add-on Operations Manager, most malicious extension that manage to get through the security review process, are usually interested in simply observing the conversation between your browser and whatever websites you visit. The malicious activity happens elsewhere, after the data has already been read. So in their mind, what would really help security is a more thorough review process, but that’s not something Google says it has plans for.</p>



<p>After looking at the arguments Google used to justify this transition, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/google-chrome-will-limit-ad-blockers-starting-june-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ArsTechnica</a> came to the conclusion that there’s no justification for arbitrarily limiting the list of filter rules. It says once Manifest V3 happens, Chrome users will be limited to light ad blocker functionality while users will need to switch to Firefox or some other non-limited browser to get the full extension.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Firefox said it will adopt Manifest V3 in the interest of cross-browser compatibility. And Chrome’s market share will certainly have influenced that decision as well.</p>



<p>Google Chrome Enterprise users with the “ExtensionManifestV2Availability” policy turned on will get an extra year of Manifest V2 compatibility. </p>

          <h3>Introduction to CSS Grid</h3>
      </summary>
  

<p>CSS Grid Layout (aka “Grid” or “CSS Grid”), is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system that, compared to any web layout system of the past, completely changes the way we design user interfaces. CSS has always been used to layout our web pages, but it’s never done a very good job of it. First, we used tables, then floats, positioning and inline-block, but all of these methods were essentially hacks and left out a lot of important functionality (vertical centering, for instance). <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">Flexbox</a> is also a very great layout tool, but its one-directional flow has <a href="https://css-tricks.com/quick-whats-the-difference-between-flexbox-and-grid/">different use cases</a> — and they actually <a href="https://css-tricks.com/css-grid-replace-flexbox/">work together</a> quite well! Grid is the very first CSS module created specifically to solve the layout problems we’ve all been hacking our way around for as long as we’ve been making websites.</p>



<p>The intention of this guide is to present the Grid concepts as they exist in the latest version of the specification. So I won’t be covering the out-of-date Internet Explorer syntax (even though you can absolutely <a href="https://css-tricks.com/css-grid-in-ie-debunking-common-ie-grid-misconceptions/">use Grid in IE 11</a>) or other historical hacks. </p>

          <h3>CSS Grid basics</h3>
      </summary>
  

<p>As of March 2017, most browsers shipped native, unprefixed support for CSS Grid: Chrome (including on Android), Firefox, Safari (including on iOS), and Opera. Internet Explorer 10 and 11 on the other hand support it, but it’s an old implementation with an outdated syntax. The time to build with grid is now!</p>



<p>To get started you have to define a container element as a grid with&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-display">display: grid</a></code>, set the column and row sizes with&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-columns-rows">grid-template-columns</a></code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-columns-rows">grid-template-rows</a></code>, and then place its child elements into the grid with&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-column-row">grid-column</a></code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-column-row">grid-row</a></code>. Similarly to flexbox, the source order of the grid items doesn’t matter. Your CSS can place them in any order, which makes it super easy to rearrange your grid with media queries. Imagine defining the layout of your entire page, and then completely rearranging it to accommodate a different screen width all with only a couple lines of CSS. Grid is one of the most powerful CSS modules ever introduced.</p>

          <h3>Important CSS Grid terminology</h3>
      </summary>
  

<p>Before diving into the concepts of Grid it’s important to understand the terminology. Since the terms involved here are all kinda conceptually similar, it’s easy to confuse them with one another if you don’t first memorize their meanings defined by the Grid specification. But don’t worry, there aren’t many of them.</p>



<div>
<div><h4 id="grid-container">Grid Container</h4>


<p>The element on which&nbsp;<code>display: grid</code>&nbsp;is applied. It’s the direct parent of all the grid items. In this example&nbsp;<code>container</code>&nbsp;is the grid container.</p>



<pre rel="HTML" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="item item-1"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="item item-2"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="item item-3"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>


<h4 id="grid-line"><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#grid-line"></a>Grid Line</h4>


<p>The dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid. They can be either vertical (“column grid lines”) or horizontal (“row grid lines”) and reside on either side of a row or column. Here the yellow line is an example of a column grid line.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/terms-grid-line.svg" alt="" width="318" height="216"></figure>


<h4 id="grid-track"><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#grid-track"></a>Grid Track</h4>


<p>The space between two adjacent grid lines. You can think of them as the columns or rows of the grid. Here’s the grid track between the second and third-row grid lines.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/terms-grid-track.svg" alt="" width="319" height="216"></figure>


<h4 id="grid-area">Grid Area</h4>


<p>The total space surrounded by four grid lines. A grid area may be composed of any number of grid cells. Here’s the grid area between row grid lines 1 and 3, and column grid lines 1 and 3.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/terms-grid-area.svg" alt="" width="324" height="220"></figure>
</div>



<div><h4 id="grid-item">Grid Item</h4>


<p>The children (i.e.&nbsp;<em>direct</em>&nbsp;descendants) of the grid container. Here the&nbsp;<code>item</code>&nbsp;elements are grid items, but&nbsp;<code>sub-item</code>&nbsp;isn’t.</p>



<pre rel="HTML" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="item"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="item"&gt;
    &lt;p class="sub-item"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="item"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>


<h4 id="grid-cell"><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#grid-cell"></a>Grid Cell</h4>


<p>The space between two adjacent row and two adjacent column grid lines. It’s a single “unit” of the grid. Here’s the grid cell between row grid lines 1 and 2, and column grid lines 2 and 3.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/terms-grid-cell.svg" alt="" width="326" height="221"></figure>

<li><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid"><code>grid</code></a></li>
</ul>


</details>


<div><h4 id="prop-display">display</h4>


<p>Defines the element as a grid container and establishes a new grid formatting context for its contents.</p>



<p>Values:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><code>grid</code></strong>&nbsp;– generates a block-level grid</li>



<li><strong><code>inline-grid</code></strong>&nbsp;– generates an inline-level grid</li>
</ul>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  display: grid | inline-grid;
}</code></pre>



<p>The ability to pass grid parameters down through nested elements (aka subgrids) has been moved to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-2/#subgrids" rel="noopener">level 2 of the CSS Grid specification.</a>&nbsp;Here’s&nbsp;<a href="https://css-tricks.com/grid-level-2-and-subgrid/">a quick explanation</a>.</p>
</div>



<div><h4 id="prop-grid-template-columns-rows">grid-template-columns<br>grid-template-rows</h4>


<p>Defines the columns and rows of the grid with a space-separated list of values. The values represent the track size, and the space between them represents the grid line.</p>



<p>Values:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><code>&lt;track-size&gt;</code></strong>&nbsp;– can be a length, a percentage, or a fraction of the free space in the grid using the&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/introduction-fr-css-unit/">fr</a></code>&nbsp;unit (<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-css-grid-layout-fr-unit?utm_medium=content_acq&amp;utm_source=css-tricks&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_content=awareness_bestsellers" rel="noopener">more on this unit</a> over at DigitalOcean)</li>



<li><strong><code>&lt;line-name&gt;</code></strong>&nbsp;– an arbitrary name of your choosing</li>
</ul>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-template-columns: ...  ...;
  /* e.g. 
      1fr 1fr
      minmax(10px, 1fr) 3fr
      repeat(5, 1fr)
      50px auto 100px 1fr
  */
  grid-template-rows: ... ...;
  /* e.g. 
      min-content 1fr min-content
      100px 1fr max-content
  */
}</code></pre>



<p>Grid lines are automatically assigned positive numbers from these assignments (-1 being an alternate for the very last row).</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/template-columns-rows-01.svg" alt="" width="337" height="293"></figure>



<p>But you can choose to explicitly name the lines. Note the bracket syntax for the line names:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-template-columns: [first] 40px [line2] 50px [line3] auto [col4-start] 50px [five] 40px [end];
  grid-template-rows: [row1-start] 25% [row1-end] 100px [third-line] auto [last-line];
}</code></pre>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/template-column-rows-02.svg" alt="Grid with user named lines" width="348" height="292"></figure>



<p>Note that a line can have more than one name. For example, here the second line will have two names: row1-end and row2-start:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-template-rows: [row1-start] 25% [row1-end row2-start] 25% [row2-end];
}</code></pre>



<p>If your definition contains repeating parts, you can use the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-css-grid-layout-repeat-notation?utm_medium=content_acq&amp;utm_source=css-tricks&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_content=awareness_bestsellers" rel="noopener"><code>repeat()</code>&nbsp;notation</a> to streamline things:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 20px [col-start]);
}</code></pre>



<p>Which is equivalent to this:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-template-columns: 20px [col-start] 20px [col-start] 20px [col-start];
}</code></pre>



<p>If multiple lines share the same name, they can be referenced by their line name and count.</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.item {
  grid-column-start: col-start 2;
}</code></pre>



<p id="fr-unit">The&nbsp;<code>fr</code>&nbsp;unit allows you to set the size of a track as a fraction of the free space of the grid container. For example, this will set each item to one third the width of the grid container:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
}</code></pre>



<p>The free space is calculated&nbsp;<em>after</em>&nbsp;any non-flexible items. In this example the total amount of free space available to the&nbsp;<code>fr</code>&nbsp;units doesn’t include the 50px:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 50px 1fr 1fr;
}</code></pre>




</div>



<div><h4 id="prop-grid-template-areas">grid-template-areas</h4>


<p>Defines a grid template by referencing the names of the grid areas which are specified with the&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-area">grid-area</a></code>&nbsp;property. Repeating the name of a grid area causes the content to span those cells. A period signifies an empty cell. The syntax itself provides a visualization of the structure of the grid.</p>



<p>Values:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><code>&lt;grid-area-name&gt;</code></strong>&nbsp;– the name of a grid area specified with&nbsp;<a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-area"><code>grid-area</code></a></li>



<li><strong><code>.</code></strong>&nbsp;– a period signifies an empty grid cell</li>



<li><strong><code>none</code></strong>&nbsp;– no grid areas are defined</li>
</ul>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-template-areas: 
    "&lt;grid-area-name&gt; | . | none | ..."
    "...";
}</code></pre>



<p>Example:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.item-a {
  grid-area: header;
}
.item-b {
  grid-area: main;
}
.item-c {
  grid-area: sidebar;
}
.item-d {
  grid-area: footer;
}

.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 50px 50px 50px 50px;
  grid-template-rows: auto;
  grid-template-areas: 
    "header header header header"
    "main main . sidebar"
    "footer footer footer footer";
}</code></pre>



<p>That’ll create a grid that’s four columns wide by three rows tall. The entire top row will be composed of the&nbsp;<strong>header</strong>&nbsp;area. The middle row will be composed of two&nbsp;<strong>main</strong>&nbsp;areas, one empty cell, and one&nbsp;<strong>sidebar</strong>&nbsp;area. The last row is all&nbsp;<strong>footer</strong>.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dddgrid-template-areas.svg" alt="Example of grid-template-areas" width="347" height="268"></figure>



<p>Each row in your declaration needs to have the same number of cells.</p>



<p>You can use any number of adjacent periods to declare a single empty cell. As long as the periods have no spaces between them they represent a single cell.</p>



<p>Notice that you’re not naming lines with this syntax, just areas. When you use this syntax the lines on either end of the areas are actually getting named automatically. If the name of your grid area is&nbsp;<strong><em>foo</em></strong>, the name of the area’s starting row line and starting column line will be&nbsp;<strong><em>foo</em>-start</strong>, and the name of its last row line and last column line will be&nbsp;<strong><em>foo</em>-end</strong>. This means that some lines might have multiple names, such as the far left line in the above example, which will have three names: header-start, main-start, and footer-start.</p>
</div>



<div><h4 id="prop-grid-template">grid-template</h4>


<p>A shorthand for setting&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-columns-rows">grid-template-rows</a></code>,&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-columns-rows">grid-template-columns</a></code>, and&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-areas">grid-template-areas</a></code>&nbsp;in a single declaration.</p>



<p>Values:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><code>none</code></strong>&nbsp;– sets all three properties to their initial values</li>



<li><strong><code>&lt;grid-template-rows&gt;</code>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<code>&lt;grid-template-columns</code>&gt;</strong>&nbsp;– sets&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-columns-rows">grid-template-columns</a></code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-columns-rows">grid-template-rows</a></code>&nbsp;to the specified values, respectively, and sets&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-areas">grid-template-areas</a></code>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<code>none</code></li>
</ul>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-template: none | &lt;grid-template-rows&gt; / &lt;grid-template-columns&gt;;
}</code></pre>



<p>It also accepts a more complex but quite handy syntax for specifying all three. Here’s an example:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-template:
    [row1-start] "header header header" 25px [row1-end]
    [row2-start] "footer footer footer" 25px [row2-end]
    / auto 50px auto;
}</code></pre>



<p>That’s equivalent to this:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-template-rows: [row1-start] 25px [row1-end row2-start] 25px [row2-end];
  grid-template-columns: auto 50px auto;
  grid-template-areas: 
    "header header header" 
    "footer footer footer";
}</code></pre>



<p>Since&nbsp;<code>grid-template</code>&nbsp;doesn’t reset the&nbsp;<em>implicit</em>&nbsp;grid properties (<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-auto-columns-rows">grid-auto-columns</a></code>,&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-auto-columns-rows">grid-auto-rows</a></code>, and&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-auto-flow">grid-auto-flow</a></code>), which is probably what you want to do in most cases, it’s recommended to use the&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid">grid</a></code>&nbsp;property instead of&nbsp;<code>grid-template</code>.</p>
</div>



<div><h4 id="prop-grid-column-row-gap">column-gap<br>row-gap<br>grid-column-gap<br>grid-row-gap</h4>


<p>Specifies the size of the grid lines. You can think of it like setting the width of the gutters between the columns/rows.</p>



<p>Values:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><code>&lt;line-size&gt;</code></strong>&nbsp;– a length value</li>
</ul>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  /* standard */
  column-gap: &lt;line-size&gt;;
  row-gap: &lt;line-size&gt;;

  /* old */
  grid-column-gap: &lt;line-size&gt;;
  grid-row-gap: &lt;line-size&gt;;
}</code></pre>



<p>Example:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-template-columns: 100px 50px 100px;
  grid-template-rows: 80px auto 80px; 
  column-gap: 10px;
  row-gap: 15px;
}</code></pre>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dddgrid-gap.svg" alt="Example of grid-column-gap and grid-row-gap" width="348" height="312"></figure>



<p>The gutters are only created&nbsp;<em>between</em>&nbsp;the columns/rows, not on the outer edges.</p>



<p>Note: The&nbsp;<code>grid-</code>&nbsp;prefix will be removed and&nbsp;<code>grid-column-gap</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>grid-row-gap</code>&nbsp;renamed to&nbsp;<code>column-gap</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>row-gap</code>. The unprefixed properties are already supported in Chrome 68+, Safari 11.2 Release 50+, and Opera 54+.</p>
</div>



<div><h4 id="prop-grid-gap">gap<br>grid-gap</h4>


<p>A shorthand for&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-column-row-gap">row-gap</a></code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-column-row-gap">column-gap</a></code></p>



<p>Values:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><code>&lt;grid-row-gap&gt;</code>&nbsp;<code>&lt;grid-column-gap&gt;</code></strong>&nbsp;– length values</li>
</ul>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  /* standard */
  gap: &lt;grid-row-gap&gt; &lt;grid-column-gap&gt;;

  /* old */
  grid-gap: &lt;grid-row-gap&gt; &lt;grid-column-gap&gt;;
}</code></pre>



<p>Example:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-template-columns: 100px 50px 100px;
  grid-template-rows: 80px auto 80px; 
  gap: 15px 10px;
}</code></pre>



<p>If no&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-column-row-gap">row-gap</a></code>&nbsp;is specified, it’s set to the same value as&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-column-row-gap">column-gap</a></code></p>



<p><strong>Note</strong>: The&nbsp;<code>grid-</code>&nbsp;prefix is deprecated (but who knows, may never actually be removed from browsers). Essentially&nbsp;<code>grid-gap</code>&nbsp;renamed to&nbsp;<code>gap</code>. The unprefixed property is already supported in Chrome 68+, Safari 11.2 Release 50+, and Opera 54+.</p>

<p>This behavior can also be set on individual grid items via the&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-align-self">align-self</a></code>&nbsp;property.</p>



<p>There are also modifier keywords <code>safe</code> and <code>unsafe</code> (usage is like <code>align-items: safe end</code>). The <code>safe</code> keyword means “try to align like this, but not if it means aligning an item such that it moves into inaccessible overflow area”, while <code>unsafe</code> will allow moving content into inaccessible areas (“data loss”).</p>
</div>



<div><h4 id="prop-place-items">place-items</h4>


<p><code>place-items</code>&nbsp;sets both the&nbsp;<code>align-items</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>justify-items</code>&nbsp;properties in a single declaration.</p>



<p>Values:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><code>&lt;align-items&gt;</code>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<code>&lt;justify-items&gt;</code></strong>&nbsp;– The first value sets&nbsp;<code>align-items</code>, the second value&nbsp;<code>justify-items</code>. If the second value is omitted, the first value is assigned to both properties.</li>
</ul>



<p>For more details, see&nbsp;<a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-align-items"><code>align-items</code></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-justify-items"><code>justify-items</code></a>.</p>



<p>This can be very useful for super quick multi-directional centering:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.center {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}</code></pre>
</div>











<div><h4 id="prop-place-content">place-content</h4>


<p><code>place-content</code>&nbsp;sets both the&nbsp;<code>align-content</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>justify-content</code>&nbsp;properties in a single declaration.</p>



<p>Values:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><code>&lt;align-content&gt;</code>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<code>&lt;justify-content&gt;</code></strong>&nbsp;– The first value sets&nbsp;<code>align-content</code>, the second value&nbsp;<code>justify-content</code>. If the second value is omitted, the first value is assigned to both properties.</li>
</ul>



<p>All major browsers except Edge support the&nbsp;<code>place-content</code>&nbsp;shorthand property.</p>



<p>For more details, see&nbsp;<a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-align-content"><code>align-content</code></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-justify-content"><code>justify-content</code></a>.</p>
</div>



<div><h4 id="prop-grid-auto-columns-rows">grid-auto-columns<br>grid-auto-rows</h4>


<p>Specifies the size of any auto-generated grid tracks (aka&nbsp;<em>implicit grid tracks</em>). Implicit tracks get created when there are more grid items than cells in the grid or when a grid item is placed outside of the explicit grid. (see&nbsp;<a href="https://css-tricks.com/difference-explicit-implicit-grids/">The Difference Between Explicit and Implicit Grids</a>)</p>



<p>Values:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><code>&lt;track-size&gt;</code></strong>&nbsp;– can be a length, a percentage, or a fraction of the free space in the grid (using the&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#fr-unit">fr</a></code>&nbsp;unit)</li>
</ul>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-auto-columns: &lt;track-size&gt; ...;
  grid-auto-rows: &lt;track-size&gt; ...;
}</code></pre>



<p>To illustrate how implicit grid tracks get created, think about this:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-template-columns: 60px 60px;
  grid-template-rows: 90px 90px;
}</code></pre>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/grid-auto-columns-rows-01.svg" alt="Example of 2x2 grid" width="401" height="427"></figure>



<p>This creates a 2 x 2 grid.</p>



<p>But now imagine you use&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-column-row">grid-column</a></code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-column-row">grid-row</a></code>&nbsp;to position your grid items like this:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.item-a {
  grid-column: 1 / 2;
  grid-row: 2 / 3;
}
.item-b {
  grid-column: 5 / 6;
  grid-row: 2 / 3;
}</code></pre>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/grid-auto-columns-rows-02.svg" alt="Example of implicit tracks" width="405" height="326"></figure>



<p>We told .item-b to start on column line 5 and end at column line 6,&nbsp;<em>but we never defined a column line 5 or 6</em>. Because we referenced lines that don’t exist, implicit tracks with widths of 0 are created to fill in the gaps. We can use&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-auto-columns-rows">grid-auto-columns</a></code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-auto-columns-rows">grid-auto-rows</a></code>&nbsp;to specify the widths of these implicit tracks:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-auto-columns: 60px;
}</code></pre>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/grid-auto-columns-rows-03.svg" alt="grid-auto-columns-rows" width="406" height="273"></figure>
</div>



<div><h4 id="prop-grid-auto-flow">grid-auto-flow</h4>


<p>If you have grid items that you don’t explicitly place on the grid, the&nbsp;<em>auto-placement algorithm</em>&nbsp;kicks in to automatically place the items. This property controls how the auto-placement algorithm works.</p>



<p>Values:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><code>row</code></strong>&nbsp;– tells the auto-placement algorithm to fill in each row in turn, adding new rows as necessary (default)</li>



<li><strong><code>column</code></strong>&nbsp;– tells the auto-placement algorithm to fill in each column in turn, adding new columns as necessary</li>



<li><strong><code>dense</code></strong>&nbsp;– tells the auto-placement algorithm to attempt to fill in holes earlier in the grid if smaller items come up later</li>
</ul>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-auto-flow: row | column | row dense | column dense;
}</code></pre>



<p>Note that&nbsp;<strong>dense</strong>&nbsp;only changes the visual order of your items and might cause them to appear out of order, which is bad for accessibility.</p>



<p>Examples:</p>



<p>Consider this HTML:</p>



<pre rel="HTML" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;section class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="item-a"&gt;item-a&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="item-b"&gt;item-b&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="item-c"&gt;item-c&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="item-d"&gt;item-d&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="item-e"&gt;item-e&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;</code></pre>



<p>You define a grid with five columns and two rows, and set&nbsp;<code>grid-auto-flow</code>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<code>row</code>&nbsp;(which is also the default):</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 60px 60px 60px 60px 60px;
  grid-template-rows: 30px 30px;
  grid-auto-flow: row;
}</code></pre>



<p>When placing the items on the grid, you only specify spots for two of them:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.item-a {
  grid-column: 1;
  grid-row: 1 / 3;
}
.item-e {
  grid-column: 5;
  grid-row: 1 / 3;
}</code></pre>



<p>Because we set&nbsp;<code>grid-auto-flow</code>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<code>row</code>, our grid will look like this. Notice how the three items we didn’t place (<strong>item-b</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>item-c</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>item-d</strong>) flow across the available rows:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/grid-auto-flow-01.svg" alt="Example of grid-auto-flow set to row" width="404" height="159"></figure>



<p>If we instead set&nbsp;<code>grid-auto-flow</code>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<code>column</code>,&nbsp;<strong>item-b</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>item-c</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>item-d</strong>&nbsp;flow down the columns:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 60px 60px 60px 60px 60px;
  grid-template-rows: 30px 30px;
  grid-auto-flow: column;
}</code></pre>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/grid-auto-flow-02.svg" alt="Example of grid-auto-flow set to column" width="405" height="159"></figure>

<div><h4 id="prop-grid">grid</h4>


<p>A shorthand for setting all of the following properties in a single declaration:&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-columns-rows">grid-template-rows</a></code>,&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-columns-rows">grid-template-columns</a></code>,&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-areas">grid-template-areas</a></code>,&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-auto-columns-rows">grid-auto-rows</a></code>,&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-auto-columns-rows">grid-auto-columns</a></code>, and&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-auto-flow">grid-auto-flow</a></code>&nbsp;(Note: You can only specify the explicit or the implicit grid properties in a single grid declaration).</p>



<p>Values:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><code>none</code></strong>&nbsp;– sets all sub-properties to their initial values.</li>



<li><strong><code>&lt;grid-template&gt;</code></strong>&nbsp;– works the same as the&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template">grid-template</a></code>&nbsp;shorthand.</li>



<li><strong><code>&lt;grid-template-rows&gt; / [ auto-flow &amp;&amp; dense? ] &lt;grid-auto-columns&gt;?</code></strong>&nbsp;– sets&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-columns-rows">grid-template-rows</a></code>&nbsp;to the specified value. If the&nbsp;<code>auto-flow</code>&nbsp;keyword is to the right of the slash, it sets&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-auto-flow">grid-auto-flow</a></code>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<code>column</code>. If the&nbsp;<code>dense</code>&nbsp;keyword is specified additionally, the auto-placement algorithm uses a “dense” packing algorithm. If&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-auto-columns-rows">grid-auto-columns</a></code>&nbsp;is omitted, it is set to&nbsp;<code>auto</code>.</li>



<li><strong><code>[ auto-flow &amp;&amp; dense? ] &lt;grid-auto-rows&gt;? / &lt;grid-template-columns&gt;</code></strong>&nbsp;– sets&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-columns-rows">grid-template-columns</a></code>&nbsp;to the specified value. If the&nbsp;<code>auto-flow</code>&nbsp;keyword is to the left of the slash, it sets&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-auto-flow">grid-auto-flow</a></code>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<code>row</code>. If the&nbsp;<code>dense</code>&nbsp;keyword is specified additionally, the auto-placement algorithm uses a “dense” packing algorithm. If&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-auto-columns-rows">grid-auto-rows</a></code>&nbsp;is omitted, it is set to&nbsp;<code>auto</code>.</li>
</ul>



<p>Examples:</p>



<p>The following two code blocks are equivalent:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid: 100px 300px / 3fr 1fr;
}

.container {
  grid-template-rows: 100px 300px;
  grid-template-columns: 3fr 1fr;
}</code></pre>



<p>The following two code blocks are equivalent:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid: auto-flow / 200px 1fr;
}

.container {
  grid-auto-flow: row;
  grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr;
}</code></pre>



<p>The following two code blocks are equivalent:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid: auto-flow dense 100px / 1fr 2fr;
}

.container {
  grid-auto-flow: row dense;
  grid-auto-rows: 100px;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
}</code></pre>



<p>And the following two code blocks are equivalent:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid: 100px 300px / auto-flow 200px;
}

.container {
  grid-template-rows: 100px 300px;
  grid-auto-flow: column;
  grid-auto-columns: 200px;
}</code></pre>



<p>It also accepts a more complex but quite handy syntax for setting everything at once. You specify&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-areas">grid-template-areas</a></code>,&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-columns-rows">grid-template-rows</a></code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-columns-rows">grid-template-columns</a></code>, and all the other sub-properties are set to their initial values. What you’re doing is specifying the line names and track sizes inline with their respective grid areas. This is easiest to describe with an example:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid: [row1-start] "header header header" 1fr [row1-end]
        [row2-start] "footer footer footer" 25px [row2-end]
        / auto 50px auto;
}</code></pre>



<p>That’s equivalent to this:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-template-areas: 
    "header header header"
    "footer footer footer";
  grid-template-rows: [row1-start] 1fr [row1-end row2-start] 25px [row2-end];
  grid-template-columns: auto 50px auto;    
}</code></pre>

<p>Values:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><code>&lt;line&gt;</code></strong>&nbsp;– can be a number to refer to a numbered grid line, or a name to refer to a named grid line</li>



<li><strong><code>span &lt;number&gt;</code></strong> – the item will span across the provided number of grid tracks</li>



<li><strong><code>span &lt;name&gt;</code></strong> – the item will span across until it hits the next line with the provided name</li>

</div>


<h2 id="Special-Units-&amp;-Functions">Special Units &amp; Functions</h2>


<div><h4 id="fr-units">fr units </h4>


<p id="h-">You’ll likely end up using a lot of <a href="https://css-tricks.com/introduction-fr-css-unit/">fractional units</a> in CSS Grid, like <code>1fr</code>. They essentially mean “portion of the remaining space”. So a declaration like:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">grid-template-columns: 1fr 3fr;</code></pre>



<p>Means, loosely, <code>25% 75%</code>. Except that those percentage values are much more firm than fractional units are. For example, if you added padding to those percentage-based columns, now you’ve broken 100% width (assuming a <code>content-box</code> box model). Fractional units also much more friendly in combination with other units, as you can imagine:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">grid-template-columns: 50px min-content 1fr;</code></pre>
</div>



<div><h4 id="h-sizing-keywords">Sizing Keywords</h4>


<p>When sizing rows and columns, you can use all the&nbsp;<a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-lengths-of-css/">lengths</a>&nbsp;you are used to, like&nbsp;<code>px</code>, rem, %, etc, but you also have keywords:</p>



<ul>
<li><code>min-content</code>: the minimum size of the content. Imagine a line of text like “E pluribus unum”, the min-content is likely the width of the word “pluribus”.</li>



<li><code>max-content</code>: the maximum size of the content. Imagine the sentence above, the <code>max-content</code> is the length of the whole sentence.</li>



<li><code>auto</code>: this keyword is a lot like <code>fr</code> units, except that they “lose” the fight in sizing against <code>fr</code> units when allocating the remaining space.</li>



<li>Fractional units: see above</li>
</ul>
</div>



<div><h4 id="h-sizing-functions">Sizing Functions</h4>


<ul>
<li>The <code>fit-content()</code> function uses the space available, but never less than <code>min-content</code> and never more than <code>max-content</code>.</li>



<li>The <code>minmax()</code> function does exactly what it seems like: it sets a minimum and maximum value for what the length is able to be. This is useful for in combination with relative units. Like you may want a column to be only able to shrink so far. This is <a href="https://css-tricks.com/you-want-minmax10px-1fr-not-1fr/">extremely useful and probably what you want</a>:</li>
</ul>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">grid-template-columns: minmax(100px, 1fr) 3fr;</code></pre>



<ul>
<li>The <code>min()</code> function.</li>



<li>The <code>max()</code> function.</li>
</ul>
</div>



<div><h4 id="h-the-repeat-function-and-keywords">The repeat() Function and Keywords</h4>


<p>The&nbsp;<code>repeat()</code>&nbsp;function can save some typing:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">grid-template-columns:
  1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;

/* easier: */
grid-template-columns:
  repeat(8, 1fr);

/* especially when: */
grid-template-columns:
  repeat(8, minmax(10px, 1fr));</code></pre>



<p>But <code>repeat()</code> can get extra fancy when combined with keywords:</p>



<ul>
<li><code>auto-fill</code>: Fit as many possible columns as possible on a row, even if they are empty.</li>



<li><code>auto-fit:</code> Fit whatever columns there are into the space. Prefer expanding columns to fill space rather than empty columns.</li>
</ul>



<p>This bears the most famous snippet in all of CSS Grid and one of the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/books/greatest-css-tricks/flexible-grids/">all-time great CSS tricks</a>:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">grid-template-columns: 
  repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));</code></pre>



<p>The difference between the keywords is <a href="https://css-tricks.com/auto-sizing-columns-css-grid-auto-fill-vs-auto-fit/">spelled out in detail here</a>.</p>
</div>



<div><h4 id="h-masonry">Masonry</h4>


<p>An experimental feature of CSS grid is masonry layout. Note that there are <a href="https://css-tricks.com/piecing-together-approaches-for-a-css-masonry-layout/">lots of approaches to CSS masonry</a>, but mostly of them are trickery and either have major downsides or aren’t what you quite expect. </p>



<p><a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid-3/#masonry-layout" rel="noopener">The spec has an official way</a> now, and this is behind a flag in Firefox:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: masonry;
}</code></pre>



<p><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/native-css-masonry-layout-css-grid/" rel="noopener">See Rachel’s article</a> for a deep dive.</p>
</div>



<div><h4 id="h-subgrid">Subgrid</h4>


<p>Subgrid is an extremely useful feature of grids that allows grid items to have a grid of their own that inherits grid lines from the parent grid.</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.parent-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(9, 1fr);
}
.grid-item {
  grid-column: 2 / 7;

  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: subgrid;
}
.child-of-grid-item {
  /* gets to participate on parent grid! */
  grid-column: 3 / 6;
}</code></pre>



<p>This is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Subgrid#browser_compatibility" rel="noopener">only supported in Firefox</a> right now, but it really <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2016/01/15/subgrids-considered-essential/" rel="noopener">needs</a> to get everywhere.</p>



<p>It’s also useful to know about <code>display: contents;</code>. This is <em>not</em> the same as subgrid, but it can be a useful tool sometimes in a similar fashion.</p>



<pre rel="HTML" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;div class="grid-parent"&gt;

  &lt;div class="grid-item"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="grid-item"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;ul style="display: contents;"&gt;
    &lt;!-- These grid-items get to participate on 
         the same grid!--&gt;
    &lt;li class="grid-item"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="grid-item"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

            <pubDate>Thu, 23 Nov 2023 16:18:45 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/guinea-worm-path-eradication">https://ourworldindata.org/guinea-worm-path-eradication</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38394383">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><p>In the late 1980s, there were near a million new cases of guinea worm disease recorded worldwide. In 2021, there were only 15. How was this achieved?</p><p><time>July 07, 2022</time></p></div><div>
<p>Guinea worm disease is a painful and debilitating disease that used to be common in Asia, the Middle East, and many countries in Africa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s now close to being eradicated worldwide. This success is thanks to an eradication program that has focused on water treatment and filtration, public education, and providing safe sources of drinking water to reduce its spread.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-guinea-worm-disease">What is guinea worm disease?<a href="#what-is-guinea-worm-disease"></a></h4>
</div><div>
<p>The disease is caused by a parasite called guinea worm (<em>Dracunculus medinensis</em>). The worm’s larvae are carried by water fleas found in stagnant water in ponds, open wells, and freshwater lakes.</p>
<p>When someone drinks contaminated water, the larvae can invade their stomach and intestines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over time, they mature into adult worms – with female worms growing up to around a meter in length – and crawl through people’s connective tissue, joints, and bones. This growth leads to arthritic conditions, which can debilitate people for months. Around one in two hundred infected people develop a permanent disability from the disease.<a id="ref-1" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Around a year after the infection, the worm begins to emerge from the skin through a painful blister. This process also increases the risks of other infections.</p>
<p>People often try to find relief from the infection by putting their blisters in open water. This might bring some temporary relief for them, but makes it harder to eliminate the disease. In the water, the worm can release its own larvae and if the water contains water fleas, this restarts the life cycle of the guinea worm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The disease can be treated with pain medication and antibiotics, and by carefully removing the worm when it emerges.<a id="ref-2" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</div><div>
<p>
<h4 id="guinea-worm-disease-used-to-be-common">Guinea worm disease used to be common<a href="#guinea-worm-disease-used-to-be-common"></a></h4>
</p>

</div><div>
<p>This parasite has troubled humans for a long time. There are records of guinea worm disease dating back thousands of years.<a id="ref-3" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>It was endemic in Asia, the Middle East, and many countries in Africa in the early twentieth century.<a id="ref-4" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>It was common in poor remote villages without <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/water-access">access to clean drinking water</a>. This was because sources of stagnant water – such as large open wells and ponds – could be contaminated by water fleas that contained guinea worm larvae.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, people do not develop immunity to the disease if they have been infected, which means it was common for people to be reinfected several times. For example, in the 1960s, in some villages in South India, more than 70% of adults infected once had been reinfected later on, and 10% had been infected at least 10 times.<a id="ref-5" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>By the 1980s, guinea worm disease was known to be endemic in 20 countries in South Asia and parts of Africa. We see this in the map, which shows the number of reported cases by country in 1989.</p>
<p>In 1986, around 35,000 cases were reported to the World Health Organization (WHO). As surveillance improved, the number of detected cases increased to 890,000 in 1989.</p>
</div><div>
<p>
<h4 id="how-can-guinea-worm-disease-be-prevented">How can guinea worm disease be prevented?<a href="#how-can-guinea-worm-disease-be-prevented"></a></h4>
</p>

</div><div>
<p>Unfortunately, there are no vaccines against guinea worm disease.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the disease has several features that make it easy to prevent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, humans are the main ‘host’ of the disease, with only a few exceptions.<a id="ref-6" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a> The worm larvae are unable to survive for more than a few weeks in water fleas.<a id="ref-7" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a> This means the worms can easily die out if they are prevented from infecting humans.</p>
<p>That brings us to our second point: we know how to stop it from infecting people. When people avoid drinking contaminated water that contains water fleas and guinea worm larvae, they are prevented from being infected.</p>
<p>Third, the disease is seasonal. People infected in one season tend to release worms a year later, which restarts the seasonal cycle. In the past, when villages halted the spread of worms in a single season, the disease stopped entirely unless it was reintroduced from somewhere else.<a id="ref-8" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
</div><div>
<p>
<h4 id="the-world-has-made-huge-progress-against-the-disease">The world has made huge progress against the disease<a href="#the-world-has-made-huge-progress-against-the-disease"></a></h4>
</p>

</div><div>
<p>The world has made tremendous progress in reducing the burden of this disease with the knowledge of how to prevent it from spreading.</p>
<p>The campaign to eradicate guinea worm disease began in the 1980s. It was led by a number of organizations including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States (US CDC), the Carter Center, the WHO, and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).<a id="ref-9" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Village volunteers have played a major role in the eradication program. They provide people with water filters and larvicides, educate them about where to drink clean water, record cases, help treat patients who are suffering from the disease, and prevent them from releasing worms into the water.<a id="ref-10" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Another key driver of progress is access to improved drinking water sources, which has become more common in many countries.</p>
<p>You can see the change since the start of the eradication campaign in the chart. Cases of guinea worm disease declined rapidly across many countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over 890,000 cases were recorded worldwide in 1989. By 2021, there were just 15.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Almost all of the 15 cases were recorded in Chad.</p>
</div><div>
<p>
<h4 id="which-countries-have-eliminated-guinea-worm-disease">Which countries have eliminated guinea worm disease?<a href="#which-countries-have-eliminated-guinea-worm-disease"></a></h4>
</p>

</div><div>
<p>In many countries, guinea worm disease has been completely eliminated.</p>
<p>Countries are certified as free of guinea worm disease if they have reported zero indigenous cases for at least three consecutive years while having active surveillance.<a id="ref-11" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>On the map, you can see which countries are certified as being free of guinea worm disease. They are shown in blue. Using the timeline at the bottom of the chart you can see how each country’s status changed over time.</p>
<p>In 1996, 16 countries were known to be endemic for guinea worm disease. By 2021, only five countries remained endemic – Mali, Chad, South Sudan, Ethiopia, and Angola.</p>
</div><div>
<p>
<h4 id="we-are-close-to-eradicating-guinea-worm-disease-but-challenges-remain">We are close to eradicating guinea worm disease, but challenges remain<a href="#we-are-close-to-eradicating-guinea-worm-disease-but-challenges-remain"></a></h4>
</p>

</div><div>
<p>To eradicate guinea worm disease globally, there are several challenges we need to overcome.</p>
<p>A general challenge is that it takes around a year after infection for the worm to emerge from a person’s body. This is why countries need to monitor for new cases for several years after they have reported zero cases, in order to achieve certification.</p>
<p>Another problem is that a few countries, such as Chad and Ethiopia, have recently had outbreaks linked to dogs infected with the worms, which had not been seen before. That means extra efforts have been needed in recent years to prevent infections in dogs in those regions.<a id="ref-12" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Finally, it has been difficult to eliminate guinea worm disease in countries with violence and conflict, where healthcare workers are less able to treat and prevent infections.<a id="ref-13" href="#note-13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite these challenges, there has been a massive decline in guinea worm cases over time. Only 13 cases were reported globally in 2022. The world is so close to the goal and with dedicated effort, we may soon achieve it. After thousands of years, the entire world may soon be free of this debilitating disease.</p>

Its spores have been implicated in the prevalence of <span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1601/nm.28959" rel="namesforlife-name" target="xrefwindow" title="C. difficile - Click to open Names for Life widget">C. difficile</a>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</span> infection due to their resistance and transmission ability between surfaces. Currently, disinfectants such as chlorine-releasing agents (CRAs) and hydrogen peroxide are used to decontaminate and reduce the incidence of infections in clinical environments. Our previous research demonstrated the ability of <span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1601/nm.28959" rel="namesforlife-name" target="xrefwindow" title="C. difficile - Click to open Names for Life widget">C. difficile</a>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</span> spores to survive exposure to recommended concentrations of sodium dichloroisocyanurate in liquid form and within personal protective fabrics such as surgical gowns; however, the present study examined the spore response to clinical in-use concentrations of sodium hypochlorite. Spores were exposed to a 10 min contact time of 1000, 5000 and 10 000 p.p.m. sodium hypochlorite, and spore recovery was determined. To understand whether biocide-exposed spores transmitted across clinical surfaces <span>in vitro</span>, biocide-exposed spores were spiked onto surgical scrubs and patient gowns and recovery was determined by a plate transfer assay. Scanning electron microscopy was used to establish if there were any morphological changes to the outer spore coat. The results revealed that viable biocide-exposed <span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1601/nm.28959" rel="namesforlife-name" target="xrefwindow" title="C. difficile - Click to open Names for Life widget">C. difficile</a>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</span> spores can be recovered from surgical scrubs and patient gowns, with no observable changes to spore morphology, highlighting the potential of these fabrics as vectors of spore transmission. This study demonstrates that alternative strategies should be urgently sought to disinfect <span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1601/nm.28959" rel="namesforlife-name" target="xrefwindow" title="C. difficile - Click to open Names for Life widget">C. difficile</a>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</span> spores to break the chain of transmission in clinical environments.</p>
