            Apple has been getting hammered in tech and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/apple-ai-siri-development-behind-9ea65ee8" target="_blank">financial media</a> for its uncharacteristically messy foray into artificial intelligence. After <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/10/business/apple-iphone-ai-nightcap/index.html">a June event</a> heralding a new AI-powered Siri, the company has delayed its release indefinitely. The AI features Apple has rolled out, including text message summaries, are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24289939/apple-intelligence-ai-notification-summaries-awkward-funny-bad" target="_blank">comically unhelpful.</a>

            The critique of Apple’s halting rollout is not entirely unfair. Though it is, at times, missing the point.

            Apple, like every other big player in tech, is scrambling to find ways to inject AI into its products. Why? <em>Well, it’s the</em> <em>future!</em> What problems is it solving? <em>Well, so far that’s not clear! </em>Are customers demanding it? <em>LOL, no. </em>In fact, last year the backlash against one of Apple’s early ads for its AI <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/10/business/ai-dystopia-silicon-valley-nightcap/index.html">was so hostile</a> the company had to pull the commercial.

            The real reason companies are doing this is because <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/02/tech/wall-street-asks-big-tech-will-ai-ever-make-money/index.html">Wall Street wants them</a> to. Investors have been salivating for an Apple “super cycle” — a tech upgrade so enticing that consumers will rush to get their hands on the new model.
    </p>

            In a rush to please shareholders, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/19/tech/apple-iphone-siri-delay/index.html">Apple made a rare stumble</a>. The company is owning its error, it seems, and has said the delayed features would roll out “in the coming year.”
    </p>

            Of course, the cryptic delay has only given oxygen to the narrative that Apple has become a laggard in the Most Important Tech Advancement in decades.
    </p>

            And that is where the Apple-AI narrative goes off the rails.

            There’s a popular adage in policy circles: “The party can never fail, it can only be failed.” It is meant as a critique of the ideological gatekeepers who may, for example, blame voters for their party’s failings rather than the party itself.
    </p>

            That same fallacy is taking root among AI’s biggest backers. AI can never fail, it can only be failed. Failed by you and me, the smooth-brained Luddites who just don’t<em> get </em>it. (To be sure, even AI proponents will acknowledge available models’ shortcomings — no one would argue that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/tech/facebook-spam-ai-meta/index.html">the AI slop clogging Facebook</a> is anything but, well, slop — but there is a dominant narrative within tech that AI is both inevitable and revolutionary.)

            Tech columnists such as the New York Times’ Kevin Roose have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/podcasts/hardfork-siri-starlink.html" target="_blank">suggested recently</a> that Apple has failed AI, rather than the other way around.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qa3az0000a3b6m4rgos4q9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            “Apple is not meeting the moment in AI,” Roose said on his podcast, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/podcasts/hardfork-siri-starlink.html" target="_blank">Hard Fork</a>, earlier this month. “I just think that when you’re building products with generative AI built into it, you do just need to be more comfortable with error, with mistakes, with things that are a little rough around the edges.”
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qa3az0000b3b6mvgb984ue@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            To which I would counter, respectfully: Absolutely not.

            Roose is right that Apple is, to put it mildly, a fastidious creator of consumer products. It is, after all, the $3-trillion empire built by the notoriously detail-obsessed Steve Jobs.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qa3az0000d3b6mh49730hy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The Apple brand is perhaps the most meticulously controlled corporate identity on the planet. Its “walled garden” of iOS — despised by developers and fair game for accusations of monopolistic behavior, to be sure — is also part of the reason one billion people have learned to trust Apple with their sensitive personal data.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qasy7j000v3b6mhqnxkij0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Apple’s obsession with privacy and security is the reason most of us don’t think twice to scan our faces, store bank account information or share our real-time location via our phones.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qa3az0000e3b6mr3i4kljx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            And not only do we trust Apple to keep our data safe, we trust it to design things that are accessible out of the box. You can buy a new iPhone, AirPods or Apple Watch and trust that the moment you turn it on, a user-friendly system will hold your hand through the setup and seamlessly sync it<strong> </strong>with your other devices. You will almost never need a user manual filled with tiny print. Even your Boomer parents will be able to navigate FaceTime calls with minimal effort.

            Roose contends, at one point in the episode, that “there are people who use AI systems who know that they are not perfect<s>,</s>” and that those regular users understand there’s a right way and a wrong way to query a chatbot.

            This is where we, the people, are apparently failing AI. Because in addition to being humans with jobs and social lives and laundry to fold and art to make and kids to raise, we should also learn how to tiptoe around the limitations of large language models that may or <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/14/business/wikipedia-meta-x-fact-check-nightcap/index.html">may not return accurate information</a> to us.

            Apple, Roose says, should keep pushing AI into its products and just get used to the idea that those features may be unpolished and a little too advanced for the average user.
    </p>

            And again, respectfully, I would ask: To what end?

            As Hard Fork co-host Casey Newton notes in the same episode, it’s not as if Google or Amazon has figured out some incredible use case that’s making users rush to buy a new Pixel phone or an Echo speaker.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qa3az0000k3b6m9zjd4hmv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            “AI is still so much more of a science and research story than it is a product story,” Newton notes.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qa3az0000l3b6mxvkckit0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            In other words: Large language models are fascinating science. They are an academic wonder with huge potential and some early commercial successes, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude. But a bot that’s 80% accurate — a figure Newton made up, but we’ll go with it — isn’t a very useful consumer product.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qa3az0000m3b6mjlxs78d3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Back in June, Apple floated a compelling scenario for its newfangled Siri. Imagine yourself, frazzled and running late for work, simply saying into your phone: Hey Siri, what time does my mom’s flight land? And is it at JFK or LaGuardia? In theory, Siri could scan your email and texts with your mom and give you an answer. That saves you several annoying steps of opening your email to find the flight number, copying it, then pasting it into Google to find the flight’s status.
    </p>

            If it’s 100% accurate, it’s a fantastic time saver. If it is anything less than 100% accurate, it’s useless. Because even if there’s a 2% chance it’s wrong, there’s a 2% chance you’re stranding mom at the airport, and mom will be, rightly, very disappointed. Our moms deserve better!

            Bottom line: Apple is not the laggard in AI. AI is the laggard in AI.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span>A</span>t international academic conferences recently, one sees an interesting trend. Some American participants are travelling with <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/712588/what-is-a-burner-phone-and-when-should-you-use-one/" data-link-name="in body link">“burner” phones</a> or have minimalist laptops running browsers and not much else. In other words, they are equipped with the same kind of kit that security-conscious people used to bring 15 years ago when travelling to China.</p><p>So what’s up? Well, these academics have a finger on the pulse of Trump’s America, and are concerned about what might happen when they return home. They’ve read on <a href="https://robertreich.substack.com/p/if-trump-can-disappear-them-he-can" data-link-name="in body link">Robert Reich’s Substack</a> about the French scientist who was prevented from entering the country because US Border Patrol agents had found messages from him in which he had expressed his “personal opinion” to colleagues and friends about Trump’s science policies.</p><p>Or they’ve heard about Dr <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/17/brown-university-rasha-alawieh-deported-lebanon" data-link-name="in body link">Rasha Alawieh</a>, a kidney transplant specialist and professor at Brown University who was trying to return to the US after visiting relatives in Lebanon. She was deported, reports Reich, “despite having a valid visa and a court order” blocking her removal. “Federal authorities alleged that they found ‘sympathetic photos and videos of prominent Hezbollah figures’ in her phone and that she attended the funeral for the leader of Hezbollah in February.”</p><p>And they also know about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/19/mahmoud-khalil-statement" data-link-name="in body link">Mahmoud Khalil</a>, a Columbia University graduate, whom – though he is a legal permanent resident of the US and has not been charged with a crime – the government is trying to deport because he had participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations at Columbia.</p><p>Those pro-Gaza demonstrations so irked the Trump regime that it demanded the return of $400m of federal research funding. When Columbia sought a meeting to discuss the matter, it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/14/nyregion/columbia-letter.html" data-link-name="in body link">received a letter</a> setting out the conditions that it would have to accept before the government would deign to talk. These included a stipulation that Columbia must “begin the process of placing the Middle East, South Asian, and African Studies Department under academic receivership for a minimum of five years”.</p><p>The bullying of Columbia is the canary in the coalmine which reveals the Trump-Musk junta has it in for American universities. There are two reasons for their hostility. The first is that, as elite institutions devoted to freedom of inquiry and the telling of uncomfortable truths, they are anathema to the new autocrats in Washington. The second is that some of them (the so-called Ivy League) are fabulously wealthy, being for the most part hedge funds with nice universities attached. And if there’s one thing that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Donald Trump</a> cannot abide, it is large pots of money that he and his ghastly tribe can smell but not touch. So if the aloof trustees of Harvard, Princeton, Yale et al think that their august institutions lie beyond his reach, perhaps they should understand that Trump looks on them much as Henry VIII looked on the rich monasteries of his heyday.</p><p>Many teachers and researchers in US universities are now fearful of what lies ahead. No line of inquiry is safe from the raging firestorm of Maga intolerance. Many of the most vulnerable areas of inquiry lie in the health sector – LGBTQ+ medicine, epidemiology, infectious diseases, immunology, and so on. But there’s also endangered research on environmental issues and the climate crisis, socioeconomic inequality, plus the humanities, social science and astrophysics.</p><p>The looming crisis in the US is beginning to remind people in Europe of the 1930s, when the UK and the US began to realise that Jewish scientists needed to be rescued from the Nazis. About 2,000 scientists and academics fled the fascist countries between 1933 and 1941, fearing for themselves or Jewish family members. Then, universities in the US and the UK made space for and welcomed a whole generation of geniuses – Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, Leo Szilard, Hans Bethe, Max Born, Rudolf Peierls, Francis Simon, to name just a few. Likewise, members of the Frankfurt School were rescued and installed in New York, where they became <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/09/marxist-critique-capitalism-frankfurt-school-cultural-apocalypse" data-link-name="in body link">mightily critical of American capitalism</a> but at least lived to tell their particular tale. As did Thomas Mann.</p><p>Now, in a different age, there are stirrings in Europe to provide safe places for American researchers. In France, Aix-Marseille University is <a href="https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20250315-french-university-opens-doors-to-us-scientists-fleeing-trump-s-research-cuts" data-link-name="in body link">welcoming American scientists</a> whose work has become untenable after the Trump administration’s cuts in certain academic sectors. The Free University of Brussels (VUB) is opening 12 postdoctoral positions for international researchers, which are <a href="https://www.ddw-online.com/european-universities-offer-scientific-refuge-to-us-researchers-34143-202503/" data-link-name="in body link">open to American researchers</a> working in socially relevant fields. The fellowships come with substantial funding (€2.5m) as part of the European Marie Skłodowska-Curie programme. It’s also aiming to attract American professors looking to relocate. VUB, with its Francophone sister university ULB, is providing 18 apartments for international researchers seeking temporary residence at the Brussels Institute for Advanced Studies.</p><p>This is the beginning of something hopeful. But it also raises the question of what UK institutions are doing to meet the coming challenge. The answer, at the moment, seems to be nothing much. Perhaps that’s because most of British academia still can’t get its head around the idea that the US is now an enemy, not an ally, and that the “special relationship” is yesterday’s story.</p><h2 id="what-ive-been-reading">What I’ve been reading</h2><p><strong>How I accidentally got sent Trump’s Yemen texts<br></strong>Jeffrey Goldberg’s <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/" data-link-name="in body link">astonishing story</a> about the White House security leak in the <em>Atlantic</em>.</p><p><strong>Philosophy and fatherhood<br></strong><a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2025/03/17/a-curious-tendency-among-western-philosophers/" data-link-name="in body link">A curious tendency among western philosophers</a> explored in an intriguing post by Doug Muir.</p><p><strong>AI has learned to reason … <br></strong>… or has it?

        <h3>Paged Out! Institute Blog</h3>

        <br>

        <h4><a href="#entry-2025-03-29">Paged Out! #6 is out!</a></h4>
        <p>Download Issue #6 on the <a href="https://pagedout.institute/?page=issues.php">Issues page</a>. As always, we have cover-art wallpapers too—this time made by the amazing <a href="https://cara.app/ninjajoart" target="_blank">Ninja Jo (Katerina Belikova)</a>!</p>

        <p>We meet yet again! Writing this blog post is the last thing I do before a new Issue is pushed out. So when I write these words all the work has been done, all the problems have been solved (or put on the "do this when we have time" TODO list), and most of our Institute is already relaxing (i.e. busy with other stuff) and eagerly awaiting the publication. It's also when all the stress related to trying to finalize the Issue goes away and the happiness related to publishing a new issue sets in. So what I'm saying, is that I feel really happy right now to be able to pass Issue #6 into your hands, and really grateful to our team for what they accomplished with this Issue.</p>

        <p>And this Issue is objectively the best Issue up to date! It's a total of 80 pages, with A LOT of absolutely amazing articles and art. Actually one of the delaying factors was that our Menu (Table of Content) script broke again and had to be fixed before pushing the Issue out. It's a good problem to have.</p>

        <p>We still don't have the print files / option to buy a printed edition for you – blame the stupid flu/cold season for this (<i>please insert some swear words you like here</i>). We're close, but I still want to order some test prints myself before we start offering these. </p>

        <p>Another thing which I personally want to develop more in Paged Out!, is sourcing articles from the following genres: technical explanations of game glitches (think: speedrunning or movement techniques), technical demoscene tricks, and technical radio/HAM/etc. If you have any solid leads or contact in these communities, please hit me up at <a href="mailto:gynvael@pagedout.institute">gynvael@pagedout.institute</a>.</p>

        <p>And now, go and enjoy Issue #6! And as usual, the <b>call for articles for Issue #7 is open!</b></p>

        <p><small><i>29 March 2025 / Gynvael</i></small></p><br>


        <!-- ----------------------- -->

        <h4><a href="#entry-2024-11-19">Paged Out! #5 is out!</a></h4>
        <p>Download Issue #5 on the <a href="https://pagedout.institute/?page=issues.php">Issues page</a>. As always, we have cover-art wallpapers too—this time made by the amazing <a href="https://www.markgrahamartist.com/" target="_blank">Mark Graham Artist</a>!</p>

        <p>You know what's the best birthday present a Paged Out! lead can get? A new issue of Paged Out!—hell yeah! And a non-beta build at that. There are countless improvements over #4, including a better menu, <i>a lot</i> of alignment fixes literally everywhere, better support for long titles, and so on. This said, if you spot any problems, please let us know—there are less of them now and, as such, they are harder to find.</p>

        <p>You'll also notice there are a few more Sponsorship Ads this time around. As you might remember, originally we had a policy of having only one ad page per ten content pages. Then the policy changed to round that number up—so for 51 pages, there would be 6 pages of ads. Even with that change, however, we were still in the red with regard to costs. And, as you might also remember, another goal of Paged Out! is to make it self-sustainable (i.e., make it pay its own bills). As such, I made the call to change the ad policy once again and remove the limit altogether. This doesn't mean PO! will be flooded with ads now—I will always try to include the minimum number of ads necessary to ensure PO! isn't in the red (or isn't so much in the red that it becomes a problem). But yes, there are a couple more ads in this issue (9 pages instead of 6 under the old policy).</p>

        <p>The next steps for us are (in somewhat random order): rebuilding previous issues with the new engine (to non-beta ones), getting print-ready PDFs in your hands (we are really close to this), and launching the ability to buy Paged Out! from print-on-demand websites (we’re pretty excited about this one, and some test issues have already been printed).</p>

        <p>And now, go and enjoy Issue #5! And as usual, the <b>call for articles for Issue #6 is open!</b> (and we have actually already received the first submission yestarday – that was fast).</p>

        <p><small><i>19 November 2024 / Gynvael</i></small></p><br>

        <!-- ----------------------- -->

        <h4><a href="#entry-2024-06-01">Paged Out! #4 is out!</a></h4>
        <p>Download Issue #4 on the <a href="https://pagedout.institute/?page=issues.php">Issues page</a>. As always, we have cover-art wallpapers too – this time made by our returning artist from Issue #1 – <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/refiend">ReFiend</a>!</p>

        <p>One thing we're supper happy with is the expansion to new topics – or rather topics we always wanted to have but never got article submissions for. So with Issue #4 we welcome the "Art" category with amazing pixel and digital art, as well as "Demoscene", which is something I was always excited about!</p>

        <p>As usual, this is a Beta1 build, meaning there are some known issues, which we'll slowly work to fix. For example, we know that some links work in some PDFs viewers, but not in other PDF viewers (e.g. KDE Okular seems to have some issues). Our DTP programmer – foxtrot_charlie – mentioned he'll write something about all the headaches of dealing with PDFs, and there are a lot of these. As you know we had a few-day slipup with publication date due to this – sorry about that! Amusingly we had to re-work the cover in the last moment to change as "May" changed into "June" ;).</p>

        <p>Enough said – go and enjoy Issue #4! And... <b>call for articles for Issue #5 is open!</b></p>

        <h4><a href="#entry-2023-12-18">Paged Out! #3 is out!</a></h4>
        <p>Download Issue #3 on the <a href="https://pagedout.institute/?page=issues.php">Issues page</a>. We have cover-art wallpapers too!</p>

        <p>Unbelievable, isn't it? After 4 years of constant delays, issues, problems, pandemics, etc, Paged Out! got successfully resurrected and is on track once again. The majority of credit for this goes to Aga, our editor-in-chief, who made sure things are happening, processes are working, people are pinged, and has done literally all language-layer reviews! Speaking of reviews, kudos to our review team for going through 50+ articles – shout out to: KrzaQ, disconnect3d, Xusheng Li, Hussein Muhaisen, Max, CVS, and honorary_bot! As Paged Out! is an experimental magazine with an abnormal DTP process, I would especially like to thank our DTP team: foxtrot_charlie (who – I'm sure – at this point thinks in LaTeX and PDF processing), tusiak_charlie, and our advisor wiechu. And last but not least, shout out to Dejan "hebi" who has done a lot of tool programming for PO! over the last years! At the same time multiple other people helped with Issue #3 or Paged Out! in general. As such I would like to thank our previous reviewers and programmers – Mateusz "j00ru" Jurczyk and kele – as well as my executive assistant Arashi Coldwind.</p>

        <p>One of the sure things I can say about Paged Out! is that we have wonderful cover artwork. The awesome pixelart in Issue #3 was done by the amazing Ricardo Juchem – checkout his <a href="https://ricardojuchem.com/">website</a> or follow him on <a href="https://twitter.com/RicardoJuchem">Twitter/X</a>. Also, note that next to the Issue there are two version of the cover-art based wallpaper done by Ricardo – time for a new desktop background perhaps? :)</p>

        <p>As you know one of the goals with Paged Out! is to make the zine financially self sufficient. This is where our <a href="https://pagedout.institute/?page=ads.php">sponsors</a> and <a href="https://pagedout.institute/?page=helpout.php">donors</a> come in! As such, special thanks to our amazing sponsors <a href="https://securitum.com/">Securitum</a>, <a href="https://canary.tools/">Thinkst Canary</a>, and <a href="https://guidedhacking.com/">Guided Hacking</a>! And a huge shout out to our donors: celephais, jask, wasp0r, gkelly, madwizard, MrEuds, H Lascelles, and others!</p>

        <p>Anyway, we'll let you enjoy Issue #3 now. Note that what we published today is – as usual – a beta build, so expect the PDF to be replaced from time to time with more and more polished versions (we have a bug list to go through). It will take a few more issues for us to polish our PDF processing enough for this to not be necessary, but we're not there yet. We'll write something more about this in a future blog post :).</p>

        <p>So, enjoy Issue #3 and let your friends know :)</p>

        <p>P.S. Call for articles for Issue #4 is already open! (and we even got some submissions already!)</p>

        <p><small><i>18 December 2023 / Gynvael</i></small></p><br>

        <!-- ----------------------- -->

        <h4><a href="#entry-2023-31-08">It's late 2023. Time to do something about Paged Out!, isn't?</a></h4>
        <p>Almost exactly three years have passed since the last update, and nearly four since the last issue being published. So, what happened? And is this blog entry a glimpse of hope for Issue #3 ever appearing? Or is this just a final entry to sum up the project and officially shut it down?</p>

        <p>Let's start with what happened, as you are owed an explanation.</p>

        <p>After two initial Issues, I (Gynvael) had the idea to make a "Review Center" app, which would make the whole review process easier and more consistent. As expected, it was months of work and the app was turning out pretty good actually. And then the pandemic started and I was affected pretty badly. Long story short, I had to put aside all projects I had (including Paged Out!), step down as the tech lead / manager at work, and focus on my health. This took a while and afterwards I had some catching up to do.</p>

        <p>Fast forward to earlier this year. I left my old job at Google to rest a bit and create my own IT security company. This unlocked some extra time, and this allowed to look in the direction of restarting Paged Out! again. And, given that I had 3 years to think about the project and how to go forward with it, do it right this time.</p>

        <p>Let me start by addressing the biggest change, i.e. <b>Paged Out! is now being managed and operated by HexArcana Cybersecurity GmbH</b> – a company fully owned by me. Note that the keywords here are "managed" and "operated by", i.e. the actual ownership of Paged Out! doesn't actually change. This also does not affect the original goal of Paged Out! being a non-profit self-sustaining magazine, nor the important role volunteers will play in its life. So, for the time being, HexArcana will handle accounting, paperwork, and provide management and publishing services for Paged Out!, which should have a positive impact on the magazine's longevity and overall success. That being said, this is only a temporary measure – eventually, in the next few years and once it achieves self-sustainability, I'll move Paged Out! to its own non-profit organization.</p>

        <p>The second biggest change stems from two simple facts, which took me a bit to realize: I can only do so many things in a day and also I should never be the single point of failure for a project. Thankfully, there's a simple solution for this.</p>

        <p>Without further ado, <b>I would like to officially welcome Aga to the Paged Out! Institute. Aga agreed to help Paged Out! as the Editor-in-Chief</b>, meaning that she'll take over a lot of project management, coordination and editorial work that I have been doing in the past. At the same time, I'm not going anywhere and I will stay with Paged Out! as the overall project lead, publisher, and lead technical editor.</p>

        <p>Continuing on the Institute side, you'll notice a lot of changes on the <a href="https://pagedout.institute/?page=about.php">team page</a> – after a 3-year downtime, this is obviously expected. As such, we would like to thank kele, j00ru, and Arashi for all their help with Paged Out! in the past, and wish them all the best in their continued endeavors! At the same time, foxtrot_charlie, tusiak_charlie, hebi, KrzaQ, and disconnect3d are staying with us in similar roles as before.</p>

        <p>So, what's going to happen next?</p>

        <p>In the next few days, Aga will start contacting folks who expressed interest in helping out with reviewing articles, as well as potential authors. And that's because the <b>call for papers for Issue #3 has been officially re-opened and Paged Out! is considered an active project again!</b></p>

        <p>We would like to thank you for your patience – this has been a long wait for Issue #3, but it will soon be over. For now, consider <a href="https://pagedout.institute/?page=cfp.php">submitting an article</a>, subscribe to us <a href="https://twitter.com/pagedout_zine?lang=en">on Twitter/X</a>, <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/pagedout-notifications">subscribe to our newsletter</a>, or join <a href="https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/discord">Gynvael's Discord</a> for updates on our progress!</p>

        <p>Let's go!</p>

        <p><small><i>31 August 2023 / Gynvael</i></small></p><br>

        <!-- ----------------------- -->

        <h4><a href="#entry-2020_08_08">No, seriously, where is Issue #3?</a></h4>
        <p>There is good news and bad news. Good news is that Issue #3 is under no danger - it will eventually be published, same as Issue #4, #5 and so on. Bad news is that we've run into delays due to stuff related to paged out, and it's had to make predictions on the exact publishing date apart from "this year" - sorry!</p>
        <p>We're basically still finishing the Review Center tool/webapp - this will make work distribution way easier for future issues, so we hope that there will be no such huge delays in the future thanks to this.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, here's a new Review Center related wallpaper by <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/refiend">ReFiend</a>:</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://tedium.co/2025/03/29/severance-apple-remote-editing-weirdness/">https://tedium.co/2025/03/29/severance-apple-remote-editing-weirdness/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43517301">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When it comes to Apple’s TV ambitions, it couldn't buy better marketing than the buzz around <em>Severance</em>. (Certainly beats talking about <a href="https://tedium.co/2025/03/08/apple-amazon-businesses-unfocused/">Apple Intelligence</a>.)</p><p>It is both Apple’s most ambitious and (apologies to <em>Ted Lasso</em>) successful production, expanding the Apple brand by highlighting just how smart it is. At a time when HBO seems to want to be HBO less and less, Apple TV+ has certainly taken up the mantle and then some.</p><p>But it of course raises the question: Do they <em>make</em> Apple‘s shows on Macs? As the second season of <em>Severance</em> ended in dramatic fashion, Apple decided to answer that question, and the answer was … surprisingly confusing.</p>


<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXNQ01Sy6Xw">In the video Apple released</a>, which highlights the Mac-driven editing process that Ben Stiller's team is using, something stood out to me: Wait, the video is super-jittery—this makes the Mac Mini look rough. What's going on?</p><p>Then, after about 10 minutes of watching, I saw it: The show’s lead editor, Geoffrey Richman, was working on a remote Mac through <a href="https://www.jumpdesktop.com/">Jump Desktop</a>, a screen sharing tool known for its high-speed “fluid remote desktop” feature. I’ve used this tool. Though I’m not really rocking a Mac these days, I’m a fan.</p><p>Here’s the exact moment it hit me, carefully cropped to avoid spoilers:</p><p><img src="https://proxy.tedium.co/nV46Sg1IWq6107qNjwnrTNwMw4s=/740x555/filters:quality(80)/uploads/Severance-Jump-Desktop.jpg" width="740" height="555" loading="lazy" alt="Severance Jump Desktop"></p><p>In other words, little of the horsepower being used in this editing process is actually coming from the Mac Mini on this guy’s desk. Instead, it’s being driven by another Mac on the other side of a speedy internet connection. Given that the Jump Desktop app window was hidden away in an earlier part of the clip, I’m not entirely sure we were supposed to see that, but there it is. Oops.</p><p>(To be fair, the promotional materials <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/how-the-mind-splitting-world-of-severance-comes-together-on-mac/">do not hide that this is a remote process</a>, but they do not mention the use of Jump Desktop, which seems like a missed opportunity to promote a small-scale Mac developer. C’mon Apple, do better.)</p><p>So here's a challenge about video production that is unique to the film and television mediums: There is a genuine risk of stuff getting pirated before it's ready. Beyond tethering everyone to NDAs, some of this can be avoided by having the editors work in a centralized place, avoiding networked access to the video files. After all, if an editor goes rogue, you can just take away their key card. There are even standards, <a href="https://www.cdsaonline.org/2019/02/07/cdsa-releases-first-film-and-television-production-security-guidelines">produced by the Content Delivery and Security Association</a>, on how film studios can protect their works mid-edit.</p><p>One problem: COVID-19 made the prior strategy of localizing the editors in the same place untenable.</p></div><div><p>This means that a new normal in the video production realm is the rise of “remote editing,” in which editors use remote access software to do the editing on a virtual machine or office workstation. High speed connections are necessary to make this work on both ends—meaning Starbucks is off the table—but it's more than possible. Jump Desktop is a good option for this, but <a href="https://parsec.app/">Parsec</a> is arguably an even better one.</p><p>This also has other benefits. For one thing, high-end video production is quite storage-intensive, which is why your favorite YouTuber constantly talks about their editing rigs and network-attached storage. By putting this stuff offsite, they can put all this data on a real server.</p><p>To me, though, it highlights a huge issue with Apple’s current professional offerings. They are built to work on a single machine. At least for high-end use cases, the remote workflow threatens to cut them out of the equation entirely, as cloud devices with access to nearly unlimited resources gradually outpace individual machines. In fact, there is a version of the editor he was using, Avid Media Composer, <a href="https://www.avid.com/products/avid-edit-on-demand">that is cloud-based</a> and built specifically for this very use case.</p><p>The astounding part of this editing process, which Apple wanted to highlight so much that they shot an entire film about it, is that the Macs are honestly the least important part of the workflow. If Jump Desktop made a Chromebook version of its app, the Mac on Richman’s desk wouldn't even be necessary. Not that he would want to, but he could do this on a Chromebook.</p><p>Put another way, if Stiller's team was building this for Amazon or Netflix, would that be a Mac Mini on Richman’s desk, or an HP or Lenovo box? Why even use a Mac in this editing process at all, when other companies offer access to better GPUs anyway?</p><p>See, one issue with the way Apple sells its machines at the enterprise level is that they basically have no traditional server offerings, despite that being the norm elsewhere. If you want to run a Mac in the cloud, it has to be a full machine in most cases. Worse, it can’t be split up into a bunch of virtual machines, thanks to requirements in its EULA that seem designed to protect its hardware business above all else.</p><p>At the enterprise or cloud level, where VMs are quite common, this is hugely inefficient. Often large companies will buy the most powerful servers they can and parse them out into smaller pieces. <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/macOSSequoia.pdf">Apple’s end-user license agreement for MacOS Sequoia</a> specifically limits the upside of such an approach:</p><blockquote><p>Virtualization. For each copy of the Apple Software subject to a lease under this Section 3, either a Lessor or a Lessee (but not both) may install, use and run additional copies or instances of the Apple Software within virtual operating system environments in accordance with Section 2B (iii), provided that a Lessor may only virtualize a single instance or copy of the Apple Software as a provisioning tool for the purpose of providing a Lessee with access to and use of the Apple Software pursuant to this Section 3.</p></blockquote><p>Apple used to serve this market <a href="https://www.macstories.net/mac/a-history-of-the-xserve-apples-one-rack-wonder/">with a device called Xserve</a>, but it essentially gave it up about 15 years ago. Almost unwittingly, this video highlights the folly of that decision, which became more obvious thanks to COVID-19 and the rise of remote work.</p><figure><img src="https://proxy.tedium.co/8QuF9QyuoKI8huma-Aze6jLghvk=/1000x536/filters:quality(80)/uploads/Severance-Mac-Mini.jpg" width="1000" height="536" loading="lazy" alt="Severance Mac Mini"><figcaption>It’s not quite accurate to say that the Mac Mini is just for show, but it’s less necessary for making this setup work than it appears at first glance.</figcaption></figure><p>These editors aren't working on Macs, per se. They're working <em>around</em> them. Sure, there's an Apple logo in the top-left corner (two, actually), but it feels superfluous, knowing that the software isn’t directly on the machine and it just as easily be running on a Windows or Linux box a thousand miles away. There are way more efficient ways to do this, and Apple doesn't offer them. Instead it relies on cloud providers like <a href="https://www.macstadium.com/">MacStadium</a>, or localized IT teams, to work around their convoluted rules around VMs. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s emphasis on VMs, as highlighted by its <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-365/windows-365-enterprise#Solutions">Windows 365 offering</a>, tee them up for a future of scaleable remote editing.</p><p>Hence why this editor is using a remote access tool by a tiny company to help produce Apple’s most important TV show. If I were Apple, I would ask my software team why they've saddled their most significant and influential high-end users with such a weird-ass setup.</p><p>Then I would figure out how to fix it.</p></div><div><h5>Unsevered Links</h5><p><strong>Speaking of Apple,</strong> I agree with <a href="https://reviews.ofb.biz/safari/article/1300.html">this guy</a>.</p><p><strong>It’s hard to find a modern vehicle without a giant infotainment screen</strong> inside of it, but it turns out that the screens are <a href="https://gizmodo.com/are-vehicle-infotainment-screens-headed-for-the-scrap-heap-2000580600">surprisingly unpopular with drivers</a>, per <em>Gizmodo</em>.</p><p><strong>Jesse Welles made his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaNdMAGEsqk">national television debut</a> the other night,</strong> playing for Jimmy Kimmel’s audience.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>It happened again last week. I was at an architecture review meeting when a fellow architect eagerly started another debate about *microservices*. Within minutes, eyes glazed over and we were knee-deep in an absurd discussion about something that should have been a means to an end, but had morphed into the end itself. At that moment, I realized: I’m done. I’ve finally sworn off talking to architects about microservices. Why? Because these conversations usually go nowhere productive.</p>
<!--more--><p>I’ve boiled my frustration down to three problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>No one agrees on what "microservice" means.</li>
<li>Microservices conversations are abstract, with little tie-in to real business goals</li>
<li>Adopting microservices without changing your organisation is pointless.</li>
</ol>
<h2><span>Problem One: No One Knows What a Microservice Is</span></h2>
<p>This is the most obvious problem. There’s no formal definition of what a microservice is, so when people talk about them, they often end up talking at cross purposes.</p>
<p>Here are some definitions out there:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">A service with a low number of lines of code:
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">'They are very, very small. I mean 100 lines of code is probably a big service these days.' Fred George, Barcelona Ruby Conference</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">The<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/executive-insights/content/amazon-two-pizza-team/%C2%A0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> ‘two-pizza’</a> team
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">Technically not a definition of microservices, but often used as a rule of thumb for the prescribed size of team required for it, and implies that a microservice requires its own team.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">Requires only one programmer to build and maintain:
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">'If its more than one programmer to develop &amp; design and maintain it, it’s not a microservice' Fred George, GOTO 2016</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.co.uk/cyberpedia/what-are-microservices#:~:text=Each%20service%20is%20autonomous%20and%20self%2Dcontained%20and%20runs%20a%20unique%20process" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Autonomous, self-contained and unique processes</a>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">'Each service is autonomous and self-contained and runs a unique process.'&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">A container/pod
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><a href="https://thinkmicroservices.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">'Each microservice is packaged as a Docker container to enable deployment to a Kubernetes cluster for application orchestration.'</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">A service with its own data store
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">This was my personal rule of thumb for a long time, and is also implied <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.co.uk/cyberpedia/what-are-microservices#:~:text=began%20adopting%20this-,architecture,-" rel="noopener">here</a><br><a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.co.uk/cyberpedia/what-are-microservices#:~:text=began%20adopting%20this-,architecture,-"><span></span></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">‘Independently replaceable and upgradeable’
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2AQ9eTZ3-0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ian Cooper</a>, after Yourdon, Edward; Constantine, Larry <em>Structured Design</em>, 1975</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="2"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tastapod_the-idea-of-microservices-having-or-wanting-activity-7304921317139464192-NOLu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">A 'little computer' that operates on *a model of* the business concepts that are relevant to its operation.</a>&nbsp; Daniel Terhorst-North</li>
</ul>
<p>While some of these overlap significantly with one another, the differences of emphasis combined with the loose way we discuss them, we end up with the <a href="https://www.peacecorps.gov/educators-and-students/educators/resources/blind-men-and-elephant/story-blind-men-and-elephant/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">"blind men and the elephant"</a> scenario: everyone’s correctly describing something slightly differently, so no-one is ‘wrong’, but we’re certainly not aligned.</p>
<p>(I discussed this confusion about what a microservice is <a href="https://blog.container-solutions.com/reflections-on-amazon-prime-videos-monolith-move#:~:text=isn%E2%80%99t%20a%20monolith%E2%80%99.-,The%20Semantics,-At%20this%20point" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a> when talking about Amazon Video’s so-called microservices to monolith move.)</p>
<p>After enough of these debates, I’ve found it simpler to ban the term “microservices” altogether. If a term causes this much confusion, maybe it’s outlived its usefulness.</p>
<p>Instead of arguing about what to call our architecture, we could be talking about concrete challenges, or specific trade-offs: how to deploy new features faster, how to reduce coupling, how to scale parts of the system. In other words, microservices (whatever you decide they are) <em>are not an end in themselves, but a by-product of achieving some other goal</em>.</p>
<h3><span>Problem One (b): The Lack of Discipline in Software Terminology</span></h3>
<p>This isn’t just a microservices issue: it’s a broader problem in our industry. We throw around big words that sound impressive but mean wildly different things to different people. Consider these terms, and their histories:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">DevOps
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">Originally a rejection of the standard separation of development and operation teams, it became perfectly normal to talk about separate and centralised ‘DevOps teams’ centred around deployment tooling</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">Agile
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">Originally a rejection of software methodologies and behaviours popularly associated with waterfall software development and an embracement of dynamic and context-specific methodologies and behaviours, the term became associated with heavily bureaucratised and ritualised behaviours</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">SRE
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">Originally a discipline introduced by Google to bring software engineering practices to operations, emphasising reliability, automation, and service-level objectives (SLOs), it morphed into a rebranded operations function, usually without the cultural shift towards automation and shared ownership that it originally advocated</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">Observability
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">Originally a concept from control theory applied to software systems, focusing on the ability to understand internal states from external outputs, it was embraced by modern infrastructure teams to move beyond traditional monitoring. However, as vendors pushed commercial observability solutions, it became increasingly synonymous with expensive dashboards, metrics overload, and tool sprawl, often obscuring rather than clarifying system health</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each started with a well-defined intent, but over time they’ve been stretched and contorted to mean whatever the speaker wants to advocate or criticise. With such sloppy definitions, is it any wonder our conversations go in circles?</p>
<p>(As an aside, I’d like to give props to GitOps. This term has been relatively stably used, thanks mainly to a clear original definition (now, sadly, gone from the internet along with the term’s creators, Weaveworks) that was not easily perverted for commercial purposes.)</p>
<h2><span>Problem Two: Microservices Conversations Are Abstract and Unrelated from Business Goals</span></h2>
<p>Closely related to the first problem, discussions about microservices are often detached from any tangible business goals. If you ask "What business problem are we actually solving?" you’re often met with vague responses like:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Microservices improve scalability. (Scalability of what? Where is the current bottleneck?)</li>
<li aria-level="1">Microservices make teams more agile. (How? Are deployments slow because of the architecture, or are they slow because of process constraints?)</li>
<li aria-level="1">Microservices allow independent deployments. (Is that actually a requirement for your team, or just a nice-to-have?)</li>
<li aria-level="1">Microservices reduce cognitive load. (For whom? Do they really, or are we just moving complexity around?)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you listen closely, many of these conversations about microservices are not actually about architecture, but about wanting to work for a different company, where technology is cutting-edge and problems are theoretically interesting, rather than legacy-ridden and constrained by real-world trade-offs.</p>
<p>The sad reality is that many teams embarking on a microservices migration would be better off staying with a well-structured monolith until their scaling needs genuinely demand a different approach. Sam Newman, author of Building Microservices, frequently warns that most organizations should not start with microservices unless they have a compelling reason.</p>
<p>Again, it would be far better to stop talking about microservices. Start talking about reducing cycle time, improving reliability, and solving concrete business bottlenecks. If breaking up a system into smaller services is the best way to achieve those outcomes, fine, but angels on a pinhead discussions among architects about microservices are not the way to get there.</p>
<h2><span>Problem Three: Microservices Without Organizational Change Is Pointless</span></h2>
<p>Another critical consequence of engineers discussing microservices in isolation from the business context is that they more often than not ignore the organisational changes required to make microservices work.</p>
<p>Microservices don’t work in a vacuum. They require teams to be structured in a way that supports them. That means:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Cross-functional, autonomous teams that own services end-to-end. If teams still depend on centralised bottlenecks (e.g., a single DBA team), microservices won’t deliver the promised benefits</li>
<li aria-level="1">Decentralized decision-making to avoid coordination overhead. If releases still require lengthy approval processes, the independence of services is an illusion</li>
<li aria-level="1">A mature DevOps culture with CI/CD, monitoring, and incident management practices that can handle the complexity of distributed systems</li>
</ul>
<p>If your organisation isn’t willing to make these changes, microservices will only make things worse. Adding technical complexity while keeping all the old organizational inefficiencies. In short, tech should follow business needs, not the other way around.</p>
<p>Most people that discuss microservices either don’t appreciate this, or don’t appreciate how hard this is. Changing your organisational structure is <em>far</em> harder than changing your software architecture when your business is over a trivial size. This is why small startups can ‘pivot’, and change their software architecture so quickly: their organisation structure can be changed as soon as everyone agrees on the architectural changes.</p>
<h2><span>The Next Time Someone Mentions Microservices…</span></h2>
<p>I’m well aware of the irony here: I’ve talked about how I’m not talking about microservices anymore. And with that, I'll shut up, and never speak of it again.</p>
</span>

<p dir="auto">Chess is boring. I'm boring too so I enjoy it anyways, but I can't help but think "I could design it better." Normally in chess players move sequentially in turns, but this introduces a huge latency bug that the developers of chess forgot to patch: you spend literally half the time waiting for your opponent!</p>
<p dir="auto">The obvious solution is just get rid of the concept of turns in chess altogether and let players move whenever they want. Real time strategy games like StarCraft and Age of Empires are much more fun and spectator friendly than chess, so this should be a pretty uncontroversial minor rules update that can be implemented before the next world championship. To prevent things from getting too chaotic over the board each piece has an individual cooldown, so once it's been moved it can't move for a fixed period afterwards.</p>
<p dir="auto">However there's an unfortunate roadblock to the widespread adoption of real time chess: as the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/26/sport/hans-niemann-denies-sex-toys-cheating-chess-spt-intl/index.html" rel="nofollow">Niemann controversy</a> has made all too clear, chess is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNuu8KTUEwU" rel="nofollow">not immune</a> from accusations of cheating through spectator <strong>ass</strong>istance or outside <strong>anal</strong>isys tools. Trying to have players self enforce these piece cooldowns is impossible. However where the intrinsic goodness of the human psyche fails, engineering is always ready to step in. This project is a physical chess board that keeps track and displays the cooldown remaining for each piece, and even physically holds them in place so no accidental cheating can occur.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>Power distribution: Traces on the pcbs are way undersized given there are many amps running through them, so there are large voltage drops when many pieces are on cooldown simultaneously. To solve this these traces should be much wider</li>
<li>Tolerances: The pcbs have extremely tight tolerances which makes assmbling the board extremely annoying. The edges and holes should probably have more room</li>
<li>Pin heights: The height of the pins for the banana connectors are taller than the mechanical design allows for, these are fairly easy to shorten using a dremel but probably something that should be fixed</li>
<li>Corner screws: Given the order of assembly, it's impossible to insert/fasten the 4 corner screws</li>

<p dir="auto">This is the repository for an ESP32 based pomodoro timer. It uses an ePaper display and a rotary dial for input.
The code in this repository will not be ready-to-use, as some assets and fonts have been removed. However, if you really want to you should be able to adapt the code to your needs.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Project Origin</h2><a id="user-content-project-origin" aria-label="Permalink: Project Origin" href="#project-origin"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I love trying out different productivity techniques - some say that the quest to optimize your productivity is the ultimate procrastination method, so maybe that is what drove me to this project. I also have a habit of committing time (around a month of work outside my normal job) once a year to a project that benefits someone else. Last year, I bought a 3D printer (BambuLab X1C) and wanted to put it to good use. I have previously finished an apprenticeship as an electronics
engineer before pivoting to software engineering, so I also wanted to come back to my roots and build something physical.
My friend struggles with time management throughout the day sometimes - lots of different tasks to organize, and little focus. So I thought to myself: Why not make them a pomodoro timer? So, I set out with a few goals:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>It should be a physical device</li>
<li>It should be <em>fun</em></li>
<li>It should be intuitive to use</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">There are some cool projects out there (arguably much cooler than this, for example the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZa-Vqu-_fU" rel="nofollow">Focus Dial by Salim Benbouziyane</a>), but I wanted to build something from scratch. I also
never built something with an ePaper display and thought it might be a good fit for something that is mostly idling and doesn't require a backlight.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why these parts?</h3><a id="user-content-why-these-parts" aria-label="Permalink: Why these parts?" href="#why-these-parts"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This was my second dive back into building things with microcontrollers in a long time. I knew ESP32 well enough to feel comfortable diving back in, so that was the main choice here. I did some research before to see what kinds of displays would be supported.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">ePaper Display</h4><a id="user-content-epaper-display" aria-label="Permalink: ePaper Display" href="#epaper-display"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I needed some sort of display, or at least I <em>wanted</em> some sort of display. One of the main motivations for this project was that it should be out of your way - until it is time to finish your current focus and move on. For me, this meant that I wanted a display without any backlight.</p>
<p dir="auto">The display should also be large enough that you can put the whole device somewhere on your desk and still be able to read it. After ordering and playing around with a few WaveShare ePaper displays, I settled on the 4.26" variant for multiple reasons:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Great resolution (which seems to be really hard to find for "hobbyist" displays)</li>
<li>The size felt right</li>
<li>The display supports partial refreshes (0.3s, no distracting "black and white flashes" while refreshing)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Initially, I really wanted to use a black/white/red display and found one that I liked, but the refresh time
was a whopping 16 seconds with no support for partial refreshes which was a dealbreaker for me.</p>
<p dir="auto">The final bonus feature: it won't work at night. If your desk is not bright enough, you won't be able to read the display. This is a feature, not a bug. Too dark outside? Stop working already!</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Rotary Encoder</h4><a id="user-content-rotary-encoder" aria-label="Permalink: Rotary Encoder" href="#rotary-encoder"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">From the start, I knew that I wanted some sort of dial as an input - it made the most sense to me. This came at the cost of some complexity when designing the menus, and you really need to make sure that you debounce the input correctly. I also added .1uF capacitors to the CLK and DT pins to help with smoothing out the signal.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">LED</h4><a id="user-content-led" aria-label="Permalink: LED" href="#led"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In the first few iterations, there was no plan for an LED. My genius plan of having a display without backlight came at a cost: it could be <em>too</em> subtle when your current focus time ended. I experimented with a few different ideas:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>A buzzer: this would just make you jump. A truly horrible experience</li>
<li>Speakers: I don't know why, but speakers felt <em>hard</em>. So much noise and whining with the setup I tried, but I will blame this on a skill issue</li>
<li>LED: I had some WS2812 LEDs lying around and thought they might be a good fit. You can animate them with the NeoPixel library, and they are really easy to use. The additional benefit of not needing to commit many more output pins was also a big plus</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Rukenshia/pomodoro/blob/main/docs/led_shroud.png"><img src="https://github.com/Rukenshia/pomodoro/raw/main/docs/led_shroud.png" alt="LED shroud screenshot of the CAD model"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The LED ended up working great, allowing me to display different states. It might be subtle, but I also added a little shroud to the case and added a diffusion layer in front of the LED to make it look nicer.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building the Case</h3><a id="user-content-building-the-case" aria-label="Permalink: Building the Case" href="#building-the-case"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The case comes in two parts: the base and a lid. One unfortunate design choice I made is that the display frame is printed as one piece as part of the base, so the top edge tends to warp a little bit during printing. Since CAD (or product design) isn't my strongest suit, there will certainly be better choices to design this for a better final look.</p>
<p dir="auto">One thing that I wished I learned earlier is that it might not have been the best idea to put the dial in the front: because the print and electronics are so lightweight, pressing the switch on the dial will tend to just slide the whole device back. Luckily, I could solve this by adding some rubber feet and weights (the ones usually used to balance tires) to the bottom of the case. This worked out great, and I am happy with how it turned out.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Software</h3><a id="user-content-software" aria-label="Permalink: Software" href="#software"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The software is written in C++ and uses the Arduino framework. I used PlatformIO to manage the project (at least that is what seemed to be a popular choice, but I am not so sure about that anymore). This project relies heavily
on the GxEPD2 library for the display. I won't lie, the code in this repository is a bit of a mess - I had to get things done in time, which led to quite a bit of copy and pasting and not revisiting earlier parts of the code.
Some parts were generated by AI (Claude, for the most part) to help me finish the project in the deadline I set myself.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Rukenshia/pomodoro/blob/main/docs/timer_running.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/Rukenshia/pomodoro/raw/main/docs/timer_running.jpg" alt="a random fact displayed on the screen"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Since this was a project for my friend, I also wanted to include some easter eggs and fun. You would think that adding some random facts <em>while you are supposed to be focused</em> would be a bad idea, but I think it is a fun little addition.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Using the Device</h2><a id="user-content-using-the-device" aria-label="Permalink: Using the Device" href="#using-the-device"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When the device starts up, you can either change some settings or go into preset selection mode. From there, you can choose one of three presets:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Rukenshia/pomodoro/blob/main/docs/select_preset.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/Rukenshia/pomodoro/raw/main/docs/select_preset.jpg" alt="preset selection"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The timer will then start and let you know once the time is up (by flashing the LED and displaying a message on the screen). You can keep working (not recommended, but necessary if you want to finish something) and then start the break.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Rukenshia/pomodoro/blob/main/docs/timer_running.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/Rukenshia/pomodoro/raw/main/docs/timer_running.jpg" alt="timer running"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">During the pause, you can view some statistics. Every few iterations (4 by default), your pause will be longer to give you some time to recover.</p>

<p>For a few months now I’ve received sporadic reports that my website was broken. They said the layout was askew and things were sized strangely. They had screenshots to prove it. This was embarrassing for a professional website builder.</p><p>Thankfully my audience is tech-savvy and the <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/browser" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Grammarly browser extension</a> was identified as a prime suspect. When this extension was installed it broke my website, simple as that. My initial response was: <em>“Sorry, their bug, not mine”</em>. But after one report too many, I was forced to sign-up and install Grammarly myself (praise the burner email).</p><h2 id="discovery">Discovery</h2><p>After accepting the Grammarly Firefox (<a href="https://dbushell.com/2025/03/01/never-have-never-will/">Mullvad browser</a>) extension kitchen sink permissions:</p><ul><li>Access your data for all websites</li><li>Display notifications to you</li><li>Access browser tabs</li></ul><p>I soon found the evidence. Grammarly injects a stylesheet into web pages (<a href="https://gist.github.com/dbushell/d65efab2cc2f009a37d5e6b706cf0c66" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here’s a GitHub Gist</a>). This stylesheet is loaded from the local extension assets. It cannot be found by the web page itself using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/StyleSheetList" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">StyleSheetList</a>. It even bypasses <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Content Security Policy</a>. It is effectively a stealth stylesheet undetectable by the website itself. In Firefox at least, I didn’t care to install Grammarly in other browsers.</p><p>The Grammarly extension also appends a custom <code>&lt;grammarly-desktop-integration&gt;</code> element to the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> document. This is done on every website regardless of whether you interact with the extension or not (I’ve no idea what it’s used for).</p><h2 id="why-me">Why me?</h2><p>At the end of <a href="https://gist.github.com/dbushell/d65efab2cc2f009a37d5e6b706cf0c66" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Grammarly’s stylesheet</a> you’ll find the following CSS:</p><pre data-lang="css" tabindex="0" id="pre-5340eb92"><code><span><span>:</span><span>host</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>:</span><span>root</span><span> </span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span> </span><span> </span><span>--rem</span><span>:</span><span>16</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>Aside from the obvious crime of omitting a semicolon, this is seemingly innocuous. You probably know the magic number 16. By default 1rem = 16px in CSS units (kinda, it’s complicated). Further up Grammarly are doing a form of dynamic font sizing:</p><pre data-lang="css" tabindex="0" id="pre-ec1d077b"><code><span><span>.kE2Bj</span><span> </span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span> </span><span> </span><span>font-size</span><span>:</span><span>calc</span><span>(</span><span>0.86</span><span>px*</span><span>(</span><span>var</span><span>(--rem)</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>));</span></span>
<span><span> </span><span> </span><span>line-height</span><span>:</span><span>calc</span><span>(</span><span>1.2868</span><span>px*</span><span>(</span><span>var</span><span>(--rem)</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>));</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>This code is auto-generated so it’s not entirely clear what’s going on. I thought they might be dynamically setting the <code>--rem</code> value using the browser’s base font size — good for accessibility — but from testing that isn’t the case. Maybe the extension has its own setting?</p><p>As an aside note, Grammarly are also loading twenty variations of the <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Inter font</a> — <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/four-naan-jeremy-thats-insane" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Four Naan, Jeremy? That’s Insane!</em></a> — Inter is available as a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_fonts/Variable_fonts_guide" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">variable font</a>. You don’t need twenty individual <code>@font-face</code> rules, <del>Jeremy</del> Grammarly.</p><p>Anyway, as it happens I was also using the <code>--rem</code> custom property name. I’m doing my own experimental flavour of <a href="https://clagnut.com/blog/2441/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fluid typography</a>:</p><pre data-lang="css" tabindex="0" id="pre-451b88a5"><code><span><span>@layer</span><span> </span><span>base</span><span> </span><span>{</span></span>

<span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span><span>--font-size-h1</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>clamp</span><span>(</span></span>

<span><span> </span><span> </span><span>}</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>How this works is a topic for another blog post.</p><p>What’s important is that I was using <code>--rem</code> and it’s defined inside a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Cascade_layers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cascade layer</a>. Styles outside of a layer take precedent over those within a layer, regardless of CSS specificity (a topic for an entire book). Source order also matters, so Grammarly’s <code>--rem</code> probably would have won anyway.</p><p><abbr title="too long; didn't read">TL;DR</abbr>: Grammarly broke my calculations and thus they broke my website.</p><h2 id="the-fix">The Fix 🤡</h2><p>Initially <a href="https://dbushell.com/notes/2025-03-28T17:54Z/">I used a mutation observer</a> to detect the appended web component and add extra <code>!important</code> styles to reclaim my territory. Once I understood the exact problem I changed my custom property to <code>--🤡</code> which is <a href="https://argyle.ink/css-emoji-convention" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">perfectly valid</a>.</p><p>Basically the name <code>--rem</code> is now “considered harmful” because Grammarly are bad web citizens. They are generating random class names, why specifically hijack <code>--rem</code>? Why apply it globally to <code>:root</code>? They could also, you know, not inject their code into <strong>every web page ever</strong>, unless the extension is actually used?</p><p>I’ve reached out to Grammarly support. They’ve been quick to respond, but I’ve yet to reach a technical person who understands my issue. I’m hoping we can swap names. Grammarly can have <code>--🤡</code> for their sins, the rest of use can use <code>--rem</code>. Any of you nerds work for Grammarly? Let’s make this happen.</p>

<p dir="auto">This project provides a toolchain for Postgres development, built on Postgres' own parser <code>libpg_query</code> to ensure 100% syntax compatibility. It is built on a Server-Client architecture with a transport-agnostic design. This means all features can be accessed not only through the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/" rel="nofollow">Language Server Protocol</a>, but also through other interfaces like a CLI, HTTP APIs, or a WebAssembly module. The goal is to make all the great Postgres tooling out there as accessible as possible, and to build anything that is missing ourselves.</p>
<p dir="auto">The following features are implemented:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Autocompletion</li>
<li>Syntax Error Highlighting</li>
<li>Type-checking (via <code>EXPLAIN</code> error insights)</li>
<li>Linter, inspired by <a href="https://squawkhq.com/" rel="nofollow">Squawk</a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Our current focus is on refining and enhancing these core features while building a robust and easily accessible infrastructure. For future plans and opportunities to contribute, please check out the issues and discussions. Any contributions are welcome!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>A colleague and I would like to write an academic paper on the potential impact of US funding cuts to global health programmes. Our ideal co-author is an international expert newly based in the US, and they would like to do it. But we are all worried that doing so will expose them to the risk of having their academic visa cancelled, being detained and eventually deported - no matter how solid the science and how academic and dry our language. We are especially fearful because they are brown. </p><p>My colleagues who have been writing about the new administration, or the situation in Gaza, in academic journals, on substack or on social media are cancelling work trips to the US. I too would not feel safe to go now, given how openly I have criticised the administration. Even a 1% chance of being denied entry or shipped to a detention centre is too high. </p><p>When I said these words out loud to my husband today I had to stop for a moment to let it sink in. Foreign scientists in the US are scared to publish anything perceived as critical for fear of being bundled off the street to a detention centre. Foreign scientists abroad are scared to go to the US because they have voiced criticism of the state. The US is actively cracking down on perceived dissenters and foreigners are the most vulnerable to arbitrary detention and lack of due legal process. The vaunted first amendment guaranteeing free speech has become a bitter and twisted joke. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8eff6593-7fbf-427a-aedb-9d3b8dd64313_5348x3301.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8eff6593-7fbf-427a-aedb-9d3b8dd64313_5348x3301.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8eff6593-7fbf-427a-aedb-9d3b8dd64313_5348x3301.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8eff6593-7fbf-427a-aedb-9d3b8dd64313_5348x3301.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8eff6593-7fbf-427a-aedb-9d3b8dd64313_5348x3301.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8eff6593-7fbf-427a-aedb-9d3b8dd64313_5348x3301.png" width="1456" height="899" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8eff6593-7fbf-427a-aedb-9d3b8dd64313_5348x3301.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:899,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:4506318,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://christinapagel.substack.com/i/160080456?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8eff6593-7fbf-427a-aedb-9d3b8dd64313_5348x3301.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8eff6593-7fbf-427a-aedb-9d3b8dd64313_5348x3301.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8eff6593-7fbf-427a-aedb-9d3b8dd64313_5348x3301.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8eff6593-7fbf-427a-aedb-9d3b8dd64313_5348x3301.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8eff6593-7fbf-427a-aedb-9d3b8dd64313_5348x3301.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>I </span><a href="https://christinapagel.substack.com/p/censor-purge-defund-how-trump-following" rel="">already wrote three weeks ago</a><span> about how the Trump administration’s attacks on science were following the authoritarian playbook - and things have only got worse since. I am sure your first reaction is to think that I am overreacting. It sounds ridiculous to say such things. It sounds unbelievable even to me. But it is where we are and the sooner we accept it, the sooner we can organise to change it. Simply consider what we have seen over the last few weeks.</span></p><p><span>A student on a green card at Columbia University in New York who organised protests last summer against Israel’s attacks on Gaza was </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/14/mahmoud-khalil-columbia-arrest" rel="">taken from his house</a><span> and is still being detained in Louisiana. He has not been accused of breaking any law. </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/university-protests-palestinian-immigration-2d7bd689b013b8bb6300fd6ab54de933" rel="">Another student on a green card</a><span> at Columbia managed to preempt attempts to detain her with a lawsuit, but the administration is nonetheless trying to revoke her green card because she attended protests.</span></p><p><span>A student at Tufts University in Boston who wrote an article last summer for a student newspaper criticising Israel’s attacks on Gaza </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/tufts-student-detained-massachusetts-immigration-6c3978da98a8d0f39ab311e092ffd892" rel="">was taken off the street </a><span>and is now being detained in Louisiana. The only crime she is accused of is not having a valid visa - because the administration suddenly revoked it before detaining her. </span></p><p><span>An Indian student of Georgetown University in Virginia </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/georgetown-trump-deportation-immigration-homeland-security-21fc205cebbbbba2ed260050df04702a" rel="">was arrested outside his home</a><span> for ‘spreading Hamas propaganda’ for social media posts supporting Gaza, but has not been accused of any crime. He is being detained in Louisiana.</span></p><p><span>A Fulbright scholar at Columbia </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/nyregion/columbia-student-kristi-noem-video.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare" rel="">fled to Canada </a><span>after learning her visa had been revoked and after evading immigration agents searching for her over two nights. She doesn’t know why her visa was revoked - homeland security accused her, without presenting any evidence, of terrorist sympathies. Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, crowed about her ‘self-deportation’ on social media.</span></p><p><span>The Trump administration is trumpeting its detentions. Marco Rubio, Secretary of State, </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/28/g-s1-56780/trump-administration-advances-immigration-crackdown-on-foreign-student-protesters" rel="">said yesterday that over 300 student visas had been revoked</a><span> and promised many more to come. He was explicit that it was not criminal activity triggering the revocation but suspicion of ‘</span><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/rubio-warns-visas-revoked-all-foreign-student-activists-amid-tufts-arrest" rel="">causing a ruckus</a><span>’. Rubio is also </span><a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/exclusive-trump-admin-spies-on-social" rel="">mandating </a><span>a social media review for all visas of new and returning foreign students or academics, looking for “conduct that bears a hostile attitude toward U.S. citizens or U.S. culture (including government, institutions, or founding principles).”</span></p><p><span>Facing the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars of federal funding, universities in the US are </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/20/universities-cave-conservatives-trump-00241765?ueid=8ce7e99e1265480c563fabb659bdf7cd&amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=The%20Logoff%203/21&amp;utm_term=The%20Logoff" rel="">not fighting back</a><span>. </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/21/columbia-university-funding-trump-demands" rel="">Columbia University has agreed to all the administration’s conditions</a><span> for just starting discussion on the restoriation of its federal funding. These include greater controls on protests, greater ability to arrest students, greater external oversight over its faculty (including hiring decisions) and courses. Michigan University has officially </span><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/27/us/university-of-michigan-eliminates-dei-program/index.html" rel="">cancelled all its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes</a><span>, along with </span><a href="https://archive.md/QE7pJ#selection-4809.0-4800.6" rel="">dozens of other universities</a><span>. NYU </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ryoa.bsky.social/post/3llf7d3aiik24" rel="">cancelled </a><span>a talk by a former president of Medicins Sans Frontiere because her talk mentioned humanitarian workers killed in Gaza and Trump’s Oval Office meeting with Zelenskyy. </span></p><p><span>Those entering the country are also facing ideological tests. </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/19/trump-musk-french-scientist-detained" rel="">A French scientist travelling to a conference was denied entry </a><span>after immigration officials found messages on his phone criticising the administration’s treatment of scientists. A </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/27/russian-scientist-harvard-medical-school-ice-detention" rel="">Russian scientist</a><span> working at Harvard university was detained on re-entering the US after officials revoked her visa, threatening to deport her to Russia. As an outspoken critic of Putin, she said she feared for her life if they did so and she is currently in detention in Louisiana. </span></p><p><span>The administration continues to cancel dozens of awarded grants every day, each one meaning that important science does not get done and that</span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/13/johns-hopkins-job-cuts-usaid" rel=""> people lose jobs</a><span> and possibly careers. The cancellations are based on ideology. The full list of cancelled grants (so far 439) is being tracked on this </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rXukuHRF_WEz7bdv1sOu0ZY1A2PS2jEnojT1ll3okhQ/edit?usp=sharing" rel="">incredible google spreadsheet</a><span>. The list of cancelled grants maintained by the US department of Health and Human Services (HHS) </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/maxkozlov.bsky.social/post/3llhnxzibdc2n" rel="">more than doubled</a><span> today. Here is a taste of what research has been cancelled:</span></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/lgbtq-research-grants-terminated-trump-5b2810312de1420ca3df875314b0a1e9" rel="">68 grants</a><span> all about improving the health of LGBT+ populations</span></p></li><li><p>Grants to understand the impact of deprivation or demographics on depression, or drug use or alcohol use.</p></li><li><p>Grants examining the safety of drinking water and how it affects different communities</p></li><li><p>Grants to understand patterns of chronic disease through generations of families, with a focus on the impact of deprivation</p></li><li><p>Grants to understand (and improve) the problem of late diagnosis of autism in girls</p></li><li><p>Grants to improve vaccine uptake in marginalised populations</p></li><li><p>Grants examining how the risks of Covid-19 differ for different populations, including HIV and Cancer.</p></li></ul><p><span>The impacts are being felt abroad as well. Researchers with US grant funding in the UK, EU, Canada and Australia</span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00850-5" rel=""> are receiving surveys</a><span> asking whether their research complies with US government idology - specifically whether they are working in a DEI or climate change related area. </span></p><p>If you are a foreign scientist working in the US, or even seeking to enter the US for a conference or temporary collaboration, it is simply dangerous to have criticised, or to now criticise, the regime. </p><p><span>Scientists who are US citizens have more protections and many are now coming together to fight back - especially in the absence of any meanginful action by their institutions. </span><a href="https://www.aaup.org/" rel="">The American Association of University Professors</a><span> this week </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/academic-groups-sue-trump-administration-arresting-students-faculty-li-rcna198139" rel="">sued the Trump administration</a><span> for unconstitutional detention of foreign students and academics. We must support such efforts. </span></p><p>Meanwhile, those of us who can avoid travel to the US must continue the science others cannot and speak up where others are silenced. </p></div></div>]]></description>

<pre>  Hi,
  
   starting a [VOTE] to get approval allowing me to begin the development of OpenWrt "Two".
  
  "Two" will have all of the features that "One" has with the following upgrades.
  
  * MT7988
  * 10G SFP
  * 5G copper
  * 4 port 2.5G copper
  * 1-2 port 1G copper
  * Tri-band Wi-Fi 7
  
  "Two" will be produced by GL.iNet and we are exploring options for US/EU based distribution.
  
  "Two" will (hopefully) be in the 250$ region with yet again a portion of that being donated to the project.
  
   expected availability is late '25.
  
          John</pre>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>A concert on Monday night at New York’s Radio City Music Hall was a special occasion for Frank Miller: his parents’ wedding anniversary. He didn’t end up seeing the show — and before he could even get past security, he was informed that he was in fact banned for life from the venue and all other properties owned by Madison Square Garden (MSG).</p><p>After scanning his ticket and promptly being pulled aside by security, Miller was told by staff that he was barred from the MSG properties for an incident at the Garden in 2021. But Miller says he hasn’t been to the venue in nearly two decades.</p><p>“They hand me a piece of paper letting me know that I’ve been added to a ban list,” Miller says. “There’s a trespass notice if I ever show up on any MSG property ever again,” which includes venues like Radio City, the Beacon Theatre, the Sphere, and the Chicago Theatre.</p><p>He was baffled at first. Then it dawned on him: this was probably about a T-shirt he designed years ago. MSG Entertainment won’t say what happened with Miller or how he was picked out of the crowd, but he suspects he was identified via controversial facial recognition systems that the company deploys at its venues.</p><p>In 2017, 1990s New York Knicks star Charles Oakley was forcibly removed from his seat near Knicks owner and Madison Square Garden CEO James Dolan. The high-profile incident later spiraled into <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/40121460/oakley-stands-firm-nixing-invite-msg-gets-dolan-apology">an ongoing legal battle</a>. For Miller, Oakley was an “integral” part of the ’90s Knicks, he says. With his background in graphic design, he made <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CMyU_jxrA4c/">a shirt in the style of the old team logo</a> that read, “Ban Dolan” — a reference to the infamous scuffle.</p><p>A few years later, in 2021, a friend of Miller’s wore a Ban Dolan shirt to a Knicks game and was kicked out and banned from future events. That incident spawned <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qgJdgcFAyQ">ESPN segments</a> and <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/03/24/knicks-fan-kicked-out-of-madison-square-garden-over-ban-dolan-shirt/">news articles</a> and validated what many fans saw as a pettiness on Dolan and MSG’s part for going after individual fans who criticized team ownership.</p><p>But this week, Miller wasn’t wearing a Ban Dolan shirt; he wasn’t even at a Knicks game. His friend who was kicked out for the shirt tagged him in social media posts as the designer when it happened, but Miller, who lives in Seattle, hadn’t attended an event in New York in years.</p><div><p><a href="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,3.125,100,93.75" data-pswp-height="1912.5" data-pswp-width="1530" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img alt="A photo of a sign about facial recognition at Madison Square Garden." data-chromatic="ignore" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) 50vw, 700px" srcset="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C3.125%2C100%2C93.75&amp;w=256 256w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C3.125%2C100%2C93.75&amp;w=376 376w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C3.125%2C100%2C93.75&amp;w=384 384w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C3.125%2C100%2C93.75&amp;w=415 415w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C3.125%2C100%2C93.75&amp;w=480 480w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C3.125%2C100%2C93.75&amp;w=540 540w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C3.125%2C100%2C93.75&amp;w=640 640w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C3.125%2C100%2C93.75&amp;w=750 750w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C3.125%2C100%2C93.75&amp;w=828 828w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C3.125%2C100%2C93.75&amp;w=1080 1080w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C3.125%2C100%2C93.75&amp;w=1200 1200w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C3.125%2C100%2C93.75&amp;w=1440 1440w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C3.125%2C100%2C93.75&amp;w=1920 1920w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C3.125%2C100%2C93.75&amp;w=2048 2048w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C3.125%2C100%2C93.75&amp;w=2400 2400w" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C3.125%2C100%2C93.75&amp;w=2400"></a></p></div><p>Miller says that after he scanned his digital ticket, but before he went through security, a person working at Radio City stopped the line, pulled him aside, and asked him for his ID to verify who he was. They then walked him to another entrance of the building, where five or more staff members stood with him as he was told he was not allowed to return.</p><p>He’s not sure how exactly MSG connected him to the shirt or a 2021 incident during an event he wasn’t at. Miller told <em>The Verge </em>that until the concert, he had never actually purchased tickets to MSG events — they were either gifts from other people, or he got them through work.</p><p>“I’ve been reading articles about this facial recognition stuff that Dolan [and] MSG properties use, but I hadn’t been in or around the Garden outside of Penn Station to take New Jersey Transit [to] Newark Airport in almost 20 years now,” Miller says. A friend who was present made sure his parents enjoyed the show while Miller hung out at a bar nearby. He did not get a refund for his ticket, he says.</p><p>“I just found it comical, until I was told that my mom was crying [in the lobby],” Miller says of the experience. “I was like, ‘Oh man, I ruined their anniversary with my shit talk on the internet. Memes are powerful, and so is the surveillance state.” Miller and his parents also had tickets to a Knicks game the following night; his parents went without him, with a family friend in his place. Miller dropped his parents off from across the street.</p><p>MSG Entertainment did not respond to <em>The Verge</em>’s questions about whether facial recognition was used to identify Miller.</p><p>“Frank Miller Jr. made threats against an MSG executive on social media and produced and sold merchandise that was offensive in nature,” Mikyl Cordova, executive vice president of communications and marketing for the company, said in an emailed statement. “His behavior was disrespectful and disruptive and in violation of our code of conduct.”</p><p>Keeping close watch on patrons is nothing new for MSG. In 2022, a New Jersey attorney was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/21/23520990/rockettes-msg-facial-recognition-ban-privacy-ai">denied entry to Radio City Music Hall</a> during a Girl Scout troop trip. Her infraction <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/22/nyregion/madison-square-garden-facial-recognition.html">was being on an “attorney exclusion list”</a> full of people who work at firms that are suing MSG. The attorney was identified using facial recognition technology at the venue.</p><p>Miller says he was told at Radio City that he could appeal the ban if he wanted to but said it’s not a priority for him. He hopes his experience can help others who find themselves in a similar situation, where they’re unexpectedly denied entry at an expensive event based on data about them that has been collected by the company.</p><p>“It’s something that we all have to be aware of — the panopticon,” Miller says. “We’re [being] surveilled at all times, and it’s always framed as a safety thing, when rarely is that the case. It’s more of a deterrent and a fear tactic to try to keep people in line.”</p><p><em><strong>Update March 28th:</strong></em> <em>Added comment from MSG Entertainment spokesperson Mikyl Cordova. Clarified to reflect that Frank Miller said he had not been to an event at MSG venues in nearly 20 years.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

In its latest Windows 11 Insider Preview, the company says <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/03/28/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26200-5516-dev-channel/#:~:text=We%E2%80%99re%20removing%20the%20bypassnro.cmd%20script">it will take out a well-known bypass script</a> that let end users skip the requirement of connecting to the internet and logging in with a Microsoft account to get through the initialization process of a new PC.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/microsoft-will-force-windows-11-installs-to-use-a-microsoft-account-confirms-removal-of-popular-setup-bypass"><em>Windows Central</em></a>, Microsoft already requires users to connect to the internet, but there’s a way to bypass it: the bypassnro command. For those setting up computers for businesses or secondary users, or simply, on principle refuse to link their computer to a Microsoft account, the command is super simple to activate during the Windows setup process.</p><p>Microsoft cites security as one reason it’s making this change:</p><div><blockquote><p>We’re removing the bypassnro.cmd script from the build to enhance security and user experience of Windows 11. This change ensures that all users exit setup with internet connectivity and a Microsoft Account.</p></blockquote></div><p>Since the bypassnro command is disabled in the latest beta build, it will likely be pushed to production versions within weeks. All hope is not yet lost, as of right now the script can be reactivated with a registry edit by opening a command prompt during the initial setup (Press Shift + F10) and running the command:</p><div><blockquote><p>reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\OOBE /v BypassNRO /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f shutdown /r /t 0”</p></blockquote></div><p>However, there’s no guarantee Microsoft will allow this additional workaround for long. There are other workarounds as well, such as using the unattended.xml automation that lets you skip the initial setup “out-of-box experience.” It’s not straightforward, though, but it makes more sense for IT departments setting up multiple computers.</p><p>As of late, Microsoft has been making it harder for people to upgrade to Windows 11 while also nudging them to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336586/microsoft-windows-10-upgrade-year-of-the-windows-11-pc-refresh-ces-2025">move on from Windows 10</a>, which will lose support in October. The company is cracking down on the ability to install Windows 11 on older PCs <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24312928/microsoft-windows-11-older-hardware-tpm-support">that don’t support TPM 2.0</a>, and hounding you with full-screen ads to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301768/microsoft-windows-10-upgrade-prompt-copilot-plus-pcs">buy a new PC</a>. Microsoft even removed the ability to install Windows 11 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/11/23913107/microsoft-windows-11-block-windows-7-8-keys-upgrade-activation">with old product keys</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>
