<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>There is no reasonable expectation of privacy in one’s Google location data. It’s willingly shared with Google. <a href="https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinions/224489.P.pdf">United States v. Chatrie</a>, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 16692 (4th Cir. July 9, 2024) (2-1):</p><div>
<p>Location History is turned off by default, so a user must take several affirmative steps before Google begins tracking and storing his Location History data. First, he must enable location sharing on his mobile device. Second, he must opt in to the Location History setting on his Google account, either through an internet browser, a Google application (such as Google Maps), or his device settings (for Android devices). Before he can activate the setting, however, Google always presents him language that explains the basics of the service. Third, he must enable the “Location Reporting” feature on his mobile device. And fourth, he must sign in to his Google account on that device. Only when a user follows these steps will Google begin tracking and storing his Location History data. Roughly one-third of active Google users have enabled Location History.</p>



<p>Even after a user opts in, he maintains some control over his location data. He can review, edit, or delete any information that Google has already obtained. So, for instance, he could decide he only wants to keep data for certain dates and to delete the rest. Or he could decide to delete everything. Google also allows him to pause (i.e., disable) the collection of future Location History data. Whatever his choice, Google will honor it. From start to finish, then, the user controls how much Google tracks and stores his Location History data.</p>



<p>Once a user enables Location History, Google constantly monitors his location through GPS, even when he isn’t using his phone. And if he has an Android phone, he can turn on another setting—”Google Location Accuracy”—that enables Google to determine his location using more inputs than just GPS, such as Wi-Fi access points and mobile networks. As a result, Location History can be more precise than other location-tracking mechanisms, including cell-site location information. But whether Google Location Accuracy is activated or not, Location History’s power should not be exaggerated. In the end, it is only an estimate of a device’s location. So when Google records a set of location coordinates, it includes a value (measured in meters) called a “confidence interval,” which represents Google’s confidence in the accuracy of the estimate. Google represents that for any given location point, there is a 68% chance that a user is somewhere within the confidence interval.</p>



<p>Google stores all Location History data in a repository called the “Sensorvault.” The Sensorvault assigns each device a unique identification number and maintains all Location History data associated with that device. Google then uses this data to build aggregate models to assist applications like Google Maps.</p>



<p>In 2016, Google began receiving “geofence warrants” from law enforcement seeking to access location information. A geofence warrant requires Google to produce Location History data for all users who were within a geographic area (called a geofence) during a particular time period. Since 2016, geofence requests have skyrocketed in number: Google claims it saw a 1,500% increase in requests from 2017 to 2018 and a 500% increase from 2018 to 2019. Concerned with the potential threat to user privacy, Google consulted internal counsel and law enforcement agencies in 2018 and developed its own three-step procedure for responding to geofence requests. Since then, Google has objected to any geofence request that disregards this procedure.</p>



<p>Google’s procedure works as follows: At Step One, law enforcement obtains a warrant [*8] that compels Google to disclose an anonymous list of users whose Location History shows they were within the geofence during a specified timeframe. But Google does not keep any lists like this on-hand. So it must first comb through its entire Location History repository to identify users who were present in the geofence. Google then gives law enforcement a list that includes for each user an anonymized device number, the latitude and longitude coordinates and timestamp of each location point, a confidence interval, and the source of the stored Location History (such as GPS or Wi-Fi). Before disclosing this information, Google reviews the request and objects if Google deems it overly broad.</p>



<p>At Step Two, law enforcement reviews the information it receives from Google. If it determines that it needs more, then law enforcement can ask Google to produce additional location coordinates. This time, the original geographical and temporal limits no longer apply; for any user identified at Step One, law enforcement can request information about his movements inside and outside the geofence over a broader period. Yet Google generally requires law enforcement to narrow its request for this more expansive location data to only a subset of the users pinpointed in Step One.</p>



<p>Finally, at Step Three, law enforcement determines which individuals are relevant to the investigation and then compels Google to provide their account-identifying information (usually their names and email addresses). Here, too, Google typically requires law enforcement to taper its request from the previous step, so law enforcement can’t merely request the identity of every user identified in Step Two.</p>
</div><p>Bloomberg: <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/geofence-warrant-decision-exposes-hole-in-fourth-amendment-law">Geofence Warrant Decision Exposes Hole in Fourth Amendment Law</a> by Cassandre Coyer &amp; Tonya Riley (“A split appeals court opinion clearing the government’s acquisition of users’ mobile-device location data from Google of constitutional scrutiny will likely spark more friction between emerging technologies and the scope of law enforcement searches, attorneys warned. [¶] The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit’s ruling in US v. Chatrie concluded, over a dissent, that the use of such geofencing doesn’t constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment.”)</p></div>]]></description>

<h2>NVIDIA Warp Documentation<a href="#nvidia-warp-documentation" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Warp is a Python framework for writing high-performance simulation and graphics code. Warp takes
regular Python functions and JIT compiles them to efficient kernel code that can run on the CPU or GPU.</p>
<p>Warp is designed for spatial computing and comes with a rich set of primitives that make it easy to write
programs for physics simulation, perception, robotics, and geometry processing. In addition, Warp kernels
are differentiable and can be used as part of machine-learning pipelines with frameworks such as PyTorch and JAX.</p>
<p>Below are some examples of simulations implemented using Warp:</p>

<section id="quickstart">
<h2>Quickstart<a href="#quickstart" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The easiest way to install Warp is from <a href="https://pypi.org/project/warp-lang">PyPI</a>:</p>

<p>The binaries hosted on PyPI are currently built with the CUDA 11.8 runtime.
Users requiring a newer CUDA runtime in Warp can build Warp from source or
install wheels hosted on GitHub as described in <a href="https://nvidia.github.io/warp/installation.html#github-installation"><span>Installing from GitHub Releases</span></a>.</p>

<h2>Additional Examples<a href="#additional-examples" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/warp/tree/main/warp/examples">warp/examples</a> directory in
the Github repository contains a number of scripts categorized under different subdirectories
that show how to implement different simulation methods using the Warp API. Most examples
will generate USD files containing time-sampled animations in the
same directory as the example.
Before running examples, users should ensure that the <code><span>usd-core</span></code>, <code><span>matplotlib</span></code>, and <code><span>pyglet</span></code> packages are installed using:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>pip</span> <span>install</span> <span>usd</span><span>-</span><span>core</span> <span>matplotlib</span> <span>pyglet</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Examples can be run from the command-line as follows:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>python</span> <span>-</span><span>m</span> <span>warp</span><span>.</span><span>examples</span><span>.&lt;</span><span>example_subdir</span><span>&gt;.&lt;</span><span>example</span><span>&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Most examples can be run on either the CPU or a CUDA-capable device, but a handful require a CUDA-capable device. These are marked at the top of the example script.</p>
<p>USD files can be viewed or rendered inside NVIDIA
<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/omniverse">Omniverse</a>,
Pixar’s UsdView, and Blender. Note that Preview in macOS is not
recommended as it has limited support for time-sampled animations.</p>
<p>Built-in unit tests can be run from the command-line as follows:</p>

<h2>Omniverse<a href="#id1" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Omniverse extensions for Warp are available in the extension registry inside
Omniverse Kit or USD Composer.
The <code><span>omni.warp.core</span></code> extension installs Warp into the Omniverse Application’s
Python environment, which allows users to import the module in their scripts and nodes.
The <code><span>omni.warp</span></code> extension provides a collection of OmniGraph nodes and sample
scenes demonstrating uses of Warp in OmniGraph.
Enabling the <code><span>omni.warp</span></code> extension automatically enables the <code><span>omni.warp.core</span></code> extension.</p>

<p>Versions take the format X.Y.Z, similar to <a href="https://devguide.python.org/developer-workflow/development-cycle/#devcycle">Python itself</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Increments in X are reserved for major reworks of the project causing disruptive incompatibility (or reaching the 1.0 milestone).</p></li>
<li><p>Increments in Y are for regular releases with a new set of features.</p></li>
<li><p>Increments in Z are for bug fixes. In principle there are no new features. Can be omitted if 0 or not relevant.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is similar to <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a> but less strict around backward compatibility.
Like with Python, some breaking changes can be present between minor versions if well documented and gradually introduced.</p>

(AP) — <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></span> was the target of an apparent assassination attempt Saturday at a Pennsylvania rally and said afterward that he was shot in the ear. The barrage of gunfire set off panic among thousands of attendees and a dramatic scene in which a bloodied Trump was surrounded by Secret Service and then escorted to his SUV as he pumped his first in a show of defiance. </p><p>Trump’s campaign said the presumptive GOP nominee was doing “fine” after the shooting, which he said pierced the upper part of his right ear.</p><p>“I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place,” he wrote on his social media site.</p><p>Rallygoers screamed in panic. Shouts of “Get down!” rang through the crowd. At least one attendee was dead and two spectators were critically injured, authorities said. The Secret Service said it killed the suspected shooter — who it said attacked from an elevated position outside the rally venue, a farm show in Butler, Pennsylvania — and that Trump was safe.</p><p>The attack was the most serious attempt to assassinate a president or presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981. It came in a deeply polarized political atmosphere, just four months from the presidential elections and days before Trump is to be officially named the Republican nominee at <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/republican-national-convention">his party’s convention</a></span> — which his campaign said would proceed as planned. </p>
    


<p>“There’s no place in America for this type of violence,” President Joe Biden, who is running against Trump as the presumptive Democratic nominee, said in remarks. “It’s sick. It’s sick.”</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

            </div><p>Two officials spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation. They said the shooter was not an attendee at the rally and was killed by U.S. Secret Service agents. </p><p>The officials said the shooter was engaged by members of the U.S. Secret Service counterassault team. The heavily armed tactical team travels everywhere with the president and major party nominees and is meant to confront any active threats while other agents focus on safeguarding and evacuating the person at the center of protection.</p><p>Law enforcement recovered an AR-style rifle at the scene, according to a third person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation.</p><p>Many Republicans quickly blamed the violence on Biden and his allies, arguing that sustained attacks on Trump as a threat to democracy have created a toxic environment. They pointed in particular to a comment Biden made to donors on July 8, saying “it’s time to put Trump in the bullseye.”</p><p>There was no immediate information on the shooter or their motivations.</p>
    

    

    

<h2>A rally disrupted by gunfire</h2><p>Trump was showing off a chart of border crossing numbers when the apparent shots began just after 6:10 p.m. It took two minutes from the moment of the first shot for Trump to be placed in a waiting SUV.</p><p>As Trump was talking, a popping sound was heard, and the former president put his right hand up to his right ear, as people in the stands behind him appeared to be shocked.</p>



<p>As the first pop rang out, Trump said, “Oh,” and grabbed his ear as two more pops could be heard and he crouched down. More shots were heard then.</p><p>Someone could be heard saying near the microphone at Trump’s lectern, “Get down, get down, get down, get down!” as agents tackled the former president. They piled atop him to shield him with their bodies, as is their training protocol, as other agents took up positions on stage to search for the threat.</p><div data-align-center="">

Video showed Trump turning back to the crowd and raising a fist right before he was put into a vehicle. </p><h2>Witnesses heard multiple gunshots and ducked for cover</h2><p>“Everybody went to their knees or their prone position, because we all knew, everyone becoming aware of the fact this was gunfire,” said Dave McCormick, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, who was sitting to Trump’s right on stage. </p><p>As he saw Trump raise his fist, McCormick said, he looked over his shoulder and noticed someone had been hit while sitting in the bleachers behind the stage. </p><p>Eventually, first responders were able to carry the injured person out of a large crowd so he could get medical care, McCormick said. </p><p>Reporters covering the rally heard five or six shots ring out and many ducked for cover, hiding under tables. After the first two or three bangs, people in the crowd looked startled, but not panicked. An AP reporter at the scene reported the noise sounded like firecrackers at first or perhaps a car backfiring.</p><p>When it was clear the situation had been contained and that Trump would not be returning to speak, attendees started filing out of the venue. One man in an electric wheelchair got stuck on the field when his chair’s battery died. Others tried to help him move.</p><div data-override-title="true" data-hide-title="false" data-align-center="" data-carousel-enhancement="">

        </div><p>Police soon told the people remaining to leave the venue and Secret Service agents told reporters to get “out now. This is a live crime scene.”</p><p>Two firefighters from nearby Steubenville, Ohio, who were at the rally told the AP that they helped people who appeared injured and heard bullets hitting broadcast speakers.</p><p>“The bullets rattled around the grandstand, one hit the speaker tower and then chaos broke. We hit the ground and then the police converged into the grandstands, said Chris Takach.</p><p>“The first thing I heard is a couple of cracks,” Dave Sullivan said.</p><p>Sullivan said he saw one of the speakers get hit and bullets rattling and, “we hit the deck.”</p><p>He said once Secret Service and other authorities converged on Trump, he and Takach assisted two people who may have been shot in the grandstand and cleared a path to get them out of the way.</p><p>“Just a sad day for America,” Sullivan said.</p><p>“After we heard the shots got fired, then the hydraulic line was spraying all around, you could see the hydraulic fluid coming out of it. And then the speaker tower started to fall down,” Sullivan said. “Then we heard another shot that, you could hear, you knew something was, it was bullets. It wasn’t firecrackers.”</p><h2>Political violence again shakes America</h2><p>The perils of campaigning took on a new urgency after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy in California in 1968, and again in 1972 when Arthur Bremer shot and seriously hurt George Wallace, who was running as an independent on a campaign platform that has sometimes been compared to Trump’s. That led to increased protection of candidates, even as the threats persisted, notably against Jesse Jackson in 1988 and Barack Obama in 2008.</p><p>Presidents, particularly after the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963, have even greater layers of security. Trump is a rarity as both a former president and a current candidate.</p><p>Biden was briefed on the incident, the White House said. He received an updated briefing from Kimberly Cheatle, the director of the Secret Service, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and White House homeland security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall.</p><p>He told reporters after 8 p.m. that he hadn’t been able to reach Trump yet but was briefed that the former president was “doing well.”</p><p>“I hope I get to speak to him tonight,” he said. </p><p>Mayorkas, whose department oversees the Secret Service, said officials were engaged with the Biden and Trump campaigns and “taking every possible measure to ensure their safety and security.”</p><p>Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., posted a photo on X of Trump, his fist raised and his face bloody in front of an American flag, with the words: “He’ll never stop fighting to Save America.”</p><p>North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the three men on Trump’s shortlist for vice president, all quickly sent out statements expressing concern for the former president, with Rubio sharing an image taken as Trump was escorted off stage with his fist in the air and a streak of blood on his face along with the words “God protected President Trump.”</p><p>Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, said in a statement on X that he had been briefed on the situation and Pennsylvania state police were on hand at the rally site.</p><p>“Violence targeted at any political party or political leader is absolutely unacceptable. It has no place in Pennsylvania or the United States,” he said.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Colvin, Balsamo and Price reported from New York. Long reported from Washington.

<p>The incident unfolded as Trump was giving a speech at the rally in Pennsylvania. Suddenly, he appeared to fall to the ground clutching his ear.</p><p>He was quickly surrounded by armed security and stayed down for around a minute. Screams from the audience rang out as the scene unfolded.</p><p>Trump then rose to his feet, pumped his fist in the air, and shouted "fight", before being whisked off stage and into a vehicle.</p><p>He was quickly driven away from the scene. Video appeared to show blood coming from his ear as he left the stage.</p><p>The US Secret Service said Trump was now "safe" and that it had implemented protective measures around him.</p>     <div data-component-name="sdc-article-strapline">

        <h2>This is a motherfucking website.</h2>
        
    </header>
        
        <h2>Seriously, what the fuck else do you want?</h2>
        
        <p>You probably build websites and think your shit is special. You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you some fucking Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a boner because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong, motherfucker. Let me describe your perfect-ass website:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Shit's lightweight and loads fast</li>
            <li>Fits on all your shitty screens</li>
            <li>Looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
            <li>The motherfucker's accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
            <li>Shit's legible and gets your fucking point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Well guess what, motherfucker:</h3>
        
        <p>You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this shit. It's a motherfucking website. Why the fuck do you need to animate a fucking trendy-ass banner flag when I hover over that useless piece of shit? You spent hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to your fucking site, and some motherfucker jabbing at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers will never see that shit. Not to mention blind people will never see that shit, but they don't see any of your shitty shit.</p>
        
        <p>You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why.</p>
        
        <h2>It's fucking lightweight</h2>
        
        <p>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo on your fucking Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate the fucking background color of a div? You loaded all 7 fontfaces of a shitty webfont just so you could say "Hi." at 100px height at the beginning of your site? You piece of shit.</p>
        
        <h2>It's responsive</h2>
        
        <p>You dumbass. You thought you needed media queries to be responsive, but no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever motherfucking screensize it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if you're on an iMac or a motherfucking Tamagotchi.</p>
        
        <h2>It fucking works</h2>
        
        <p>Look at this shit. You can read it ... that is, if you can read, motherfucker. It makes sense. It has motherfucking hierarchy. It's using HTML5 tags so you and your bitch-ass browser know what the fuck's in this fucking site. That's semantics, motherfucker.</p>
        
        <p>It has content on the fucking screen. Your site has three bylines and link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.</p>
        
        <p>Cross-browser compatibility? Load this motherfucker in IE6. I fucking dare you.</p>
        
        <h2>This is a website. Look at it.  You've never seen one before.</h2>
        
        <p>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no fucking idea what a website is. All you have ever seen are shitty skeuomorphic bastardizations of what should be text communicating a fucking message. This is a real, naked website. Look at it. It's fucking beautiful.</p>
        
        <h3>Yes, this is fucking satire, you fuck</h3>
        
        <p>I'm not actually saying your shitty site should look like this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are <strong>ones we create ourselves</strong>. Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break them. You son-of-a-bitch.</p>

        - 13th July 2024
        </p><p>
        
TL;DR: I created a patch called EmperorLauncher, which modifies Emperor: Battle for Dune to run well on modern systems, with:
</p><ul>
    <li>High resolution support</li>
    <li>Working online multiplayer with direct ip connection</li>
    <li>Coop Campaign mode</li>
</ul>

<p>You can download the patch <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/releases/download/v1.0/EmperorLauncher.v1.0.zip">here</a>, and the source code is available <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher">on github</a>.</p>

<p>Me and a friend playing Coop Campaign in 4K</p>
<p>The rest of this blog post is a fairly technical explanation of how and why I made this thing.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="table_of_contents">Table of Contents</h2>
<h3 id="what_is_emperor">What is Emperor: Battle for Dune?</h3>
<p>Emperor: Battle for Dune is a 2001 realtime strategy game made by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westwood_Studios">Westwood Studios</a>, arguably the inventors of the RTS genre. It is a sequel to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_2000">Dune 2000</a>, itself a remake of sorts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_II">Dune II</a>, considered by many to be the original RTS. The Dune RTSes hold a special place in my heart, with Dune 2000 being the first PC game I ever bought, and my introduction to the Dune universe. Emperor followed up on Dune 2000, bringing 3D graphics, vastly improved UX, and an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOxuQBe_cL8&amp;list=PL4E8A872850C1B3AB&amp;index=29">absolutely bangin' soundtrack</a>. All that said, it isn't that well known these days. I suspect this is because it was outshone by Westwood's other RTS series, the juggernaut <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_%26_Conquer">Command &amp; Conquer</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/cnc_vs_dune.jpg" title="RA2 came out in 2000, a year before before Emperor. Google trends doesn't go back further than 2004."></p><p>Google trends, 2004-2010</p>
<h3 id="whats_wrong">What's wrong with it?</h3><p>
A lot. The years have not been kind to Emperor:
</p><ul>
    <li>The game can't run at higher resolutions afforded by modern screens</li>
    <li>Game simulation speed is uncapped in multiplayer, rendering it unplayably fast</li>
    <li>Westwood Online (WOL) doesn't work anymore, so you can't play multiplayer except through LAN</li>
    <li>You can't play the campaign in coop mode at all, because that was an online-only feature not supported over LAN</li>
    <li>The installer included on the disk is broken</li>
    <li>And finally, many visual effects are broken by the high framerates of modern PCs</li>
</ul>
<br>

<p>Main menu in seizure mode</p>
<p>I love coop games, and I always wished more RTSes in particular had a coop mode. When I found out all these years later that Emperor had a coop mode that I'd never known about, and it was no longer playable - I knew in that moment, deep in my heart, that this was a cosmic injustice that must be put to rights. I also just had a hankerin' to do some reverse engineering, so...</p>
<h3 id="how_do_we_fix_it">How do we fix this mess?</h3>
<p>I started off with a modest initial goal. The "main" exe of the game is a misdirection: Emperor.exe is a thin wrapper that runs the real game executable, Game.exe. But if we run Game.exe directly, nothing happens. So my initial goal was to make a replacement for Emperor.exe, so I could control the launch of Game.exe. Later on, once I have this control, I can use it to inject a DLL containing my patches. More details on that later.</p>
<p>At this point I hopped into IDA to see what else Emperor.exe was doing other than calling CreateProcess.</p>
<details id="what_is_ida">
    <summary>What is IDA?</summary>
    <div>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Disassembler">IDA</a> is the industry standard reverse engineering tool. It is an incredibly powerful tool that operates on a database of knowledge about your executable. At its core it is a disassembler (IDA - Interactive DisAssembler), which turns machine code into slightly more readable textual assembly language.</p>
            <p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/ida_runCommand_asm.jpg"></p><p>Part of a disassembled function from Emperor.exe</p>
            <p>It is also able to go one step further than that, and decompile the assembly into mostly-compilable C code. It will need some help from you, though. At the beginning, it will not know the types of anything. All the datastructures and typedefs are completely gone, everything is just an integer or int*, functions have been inlined, or optimised out entirely, and everything has names like sub_402E80 or a2.</p>
            <p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/ida_runCommand.jpg"></p><p>The same code, decompiled into C</p>
            <p>As you browse through the code, you annotate things that you know. For example, in the function above I was able to look at the pointer that was being passed in, and see which offsets were being used. Since CreateProcessA is a known, documented Windows API function I was able to infer what was contained in some of those offsets. Using that knowledge, I was able to create a custom structure definition (ProcessRunData) with some fields filled in. Now I have a type for the parameter, so I can search for callers and annotate the type of the variable being passed to runCommand. And oh look, I'm using some of the fields in ProcessRunData with some other functions and variables, so now I know their type too. In this fashion, you could slowly flood-fill information through the whole binary until you had a full understanding of the whole program if you wanted to. That would of course be incredibly laborious for a game this size.</p>
        </div>
</details>
<p>This is probably a good time to mention that I am not a skilled reverse engineer. I'm definitely not a professional, and this is my first real foray into reverse engineering a binary like this. Cosmic justice aside, the main reason for this project was learning about reverse engineering for fun. So all that said, I spent the next couple of evenings reverse engineering a curious set of string manipulation functions that turned out to just be std::ostringstream.</p>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/ida_badnames.webp"></p><p>Behold, function names</p>
<p>Eventually I dug myself out of that rabbit-hole, and found out what Emperor.exe was doing that was so special. Before running Game.exe, it <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorLauncher/EmperorLauncher.cpp#L40">creates a mutex, and an anonymous file mapping handle</a> - essentially just a chunk of allocated memory with a handle associated to it. It doesn't do much with the mutex, as far as I can tell just using it to make sure there is only one instance of the game running, but it does something odd with the file mapping. It launches Game.exe with bInheritHandles set to 1. This means the child process "inherits" our handles - it is able to use the same numeric value of the open file mapping handle, as though it had opened it itself. Emperor.exe then loads some data from the file Emperor.dat in the install directory, and does a bunch of manipulation to that data, presumably some sort of decryption. It then maps the mapping handle, and copies the decrypted data into the mapping.</p>
<p>So now we have some decrypted data in a mapping. The mapping handle is valid in both processes, so the child process can use the handle to retrieve the data that the launcher stored. But the child process doesn't know what the handle's value is. So the parent needs to send it somehow. Windows has an IPC message passing system where threads have <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winmsg/about-messages-and-message-queues">Message Queues</a>. This is used as the basis of window functionality - windows (HWNDs, actual window objects) use this queue to send and receive the messages that make them work.</p>
<p>The parent process tells the child the handle value by sending a message to the main thread of the child, using <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorLauncher/EmperorLauncher.cpp#L124">0xBEEF</a> as the custom message ID, because why not. This works because CreateProcessA will actually tell the parent process the thread ID of the main thread of the newly created child process. I didn't really want to reverse engineer the decryption code, so I created a <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/tree/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/CommsDataDumper">dumping tool</a> that I could sub in in place of Game.exe, which reads the data sent to it and dumps it to disk.</p>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/dumptruck.jpg"></p><p>Not that kind of dumping tool</p>
<p>Turns out the data was "UIDATA,3DDATA,MAPS", three strings that get passed to a bunch of asset loading code, making sure the game cannot work without them. From that point it was simple enough to write some code to perform the sequence myself, and I was able to start Game.exe successfully.</p>
<h3 id="patch_injection">Patch injection</h3>
<p>Now we get to the real meat and potatoes of this project - injecting our custom patches into Game.exe. We can force a process to load and run our code by using the ol' CreateRemoteThread &amp; LoadLibrary trick.</p>
<details id="createremote_loadlibrary">
    <summary>Excuse me, what trick is that?</summary>
    <div>
            <p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createremotethread">CreateRemoteThread</a> is a Windows API function that takes a "ThreadProc" function pointer, argument pointer, and process handle as arguments. The process handle is normally a handle representing the calling process, but not this time. When CreateRemoteThread is called, it creates a thread in the target process, which runs the passed function with the passed argument. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya">LoadLibrary</a> is a Windows API function that takes a string path, and loads the DLL located at that path into the process. DLLs on windows can have a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dllmain">dllmain</a> function which will be called when the DLL is loaded.</p>
            <p>A function suitable to be passed to CreateRemoteThread must take a single pointer argument. LoadLibrary is a function that takes a single pointer argument. Do you see where this horror show is going?</p>
            <p>So the only remaining problem is that we need to get the path to our DLL into the memory space of our target process. Not a problem, we can use our friends <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualallocex">VirtualAllocEx</a> (which takes a process handle parameter), and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-writeprocessmemory">WriteProcessMemory</a> to allocate a buffer in the target process' memory, and copy our DLL path into it. We then grab the address of LoadLibrary and pass it, along with our newly created DLL path buffer, to CreateRemoteThread. A new thread gets created in the target process, and loads our DLL. The dllmain function present in that DLL runs, and boom! We have code execution, from here we are free to do whatever nefarious things we like.</p>
            <p>Wait a minute, how do we know the address of CreateRemoteThread in the target process? Windows does have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization">ASLR</a>, so DLLs are loaded at random addresses for security reasons. You would think this would make it impossible for us to know where CreateRemoteThread is located in another process. Well, bizarrely, we can just use the address of CreateRemoteThread in the current process. Windows does randomise DLL base addresses, but it will randomise on first load, then <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/?p=93301">try to use the same address in every process after that</a>. Documentation on this is hard to find (if you do find something concrete, please let me know), and Raymond does only say the kernel will "try" to use the same address, but in practice there seems to be a special rule for some basic DLLs, like Kernel32.dll (which contains LoadLibrary), so they are always loaded at the same address on a given boot, to enable procedures like this one. Even if it isn't documented, this is a well known technique, which is used in <em>all sorts of things</em> out in the wild, including, I'm sure, some Microsoft products - so by now it's not something they could afford to break.</p>
        </div>
</details>
<p>So, if we start the process in a suspended state, then inject a dll, we get code execution in the target process before main is run. But what we really need is to modify existing functions in the Game.exe binary. How do we do that? In short, we use the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Detours">detours</a> library<a href="#foot-1">[1]</a>.</p>
<details id="what_is_detours">
    <summary>What is detours?</summary>
    <div>
            <p>Detours is the real black magic of this world. It is the arcane invocation that dispenses with arbitrary social constructs, and cuts straight to the fundamental truth of the machine. Types are an illusion. Data structures don't exist. There is only functions. And detours patches functions.</p>
            <p>Let's say we want to wrap a function from the standard library with some logging, in this example we'll use <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsock/nf-winsock-sendto">sendto</a>. We want to replace all calls to sendo with our modified function, which does some logging, and then calls the real sendto function. Something like this:</p>
            <p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/sendto_wrap.webp"></p><p>We can grab a pointer to the original sendto function pretty easily:</p>
            <p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/sendto_load.webp"></p><p>Then comes the real magic. We can just edit the bytes of the original function, replacing the first instruction with the opcode for an unconditional jump to our patched function. It's a little bit more involved than just <code>memcpy(&amp;sendto, &amp;jumpCode, sizeof(jumpCode));</code> though. Memory pages containing functions are not writable for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%5EX">security reasons</a>, so we need to set it writable with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualprotect">VirtualProtect</a>, edit the function, then set it back. We then need to call <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-flushinstructioncache">FlushInstructionCache</a>, because otherwise we could end up with different instructions in cache vs memory which could cause a multitude of problems. And of course, we need to be sure that while we're doing all this, there isn't some other thread executing the code we're modifying. In our case we're executing our hooks before main runs, so we know there are no other threads to worry about.</p>
            <p>Ok, so now we've redirected the original function to our replacement, but there's one thing missing. If we want to wrap the original function, not just replace it, then we need a pointer we can call to run the original, unpatched code. But we've just stomped all over it by replacing random instructions with an unconditional jump. This is where the real genius of detours comes in. The library will take note of the instructions it ruined, copy them to a newly allocated chunk of memory somewhere, and set up a little wrapper function. That function contains the copied instructions, followed by a jump instruction that jumps back into the original code, just after the last broken instruction. As you can imagine, there is <em>a lot</em> of subtlety here, especially when dealing with an instruction set like x86, where not all opcodes are the same length. The end result is you can do something like this:</p>
            <p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/sendto_detour.webp"></p><p>sendto_orig now points at the magic generated chunk, so it behaves exactly like the original function, while the original sendto address is now set up to jump straight into our wrapper, leaving us free to call the original function from inside our wrapper.</p>
        </div>
</details>
<p>Now I can take the addresses of functions that I found and figured out in IDA, and wrap / replace them with detours. During my miscellaneous poking around in IDA, I noticed several calls that looked like some sort of debug logging function. When I looked at the function being called though, it was empty, just a return instruction. I hooked up a detour which forwarded the log message on to vprintf, but no luck, the process just crashes - a segfault inside vprintf.</p>
<p>The problem with this function is that it's not one function, it's many functions. My guess is that in the original source code, there were a bunch of debugging functions that were behind #ifdef DEBUG, and in release builds they were replaced with empty functions. This, combined with things like empty virtual functions to satisfy inheritance, means the final binaries end up with a lot of empty functions. They all compile to nothing but a single ret (return) instruction, and then the linker says "oh look, I have duplicated functions" and merges them into one location. Unfortunately, one of these empty functions is the debug logger.</p>
<p>My first attempt at solving this was to <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/commit/89df0a4378d62601681a389af5df703f1fb1ac29#diff-e404d91cbd33aed1d33216c0a473ac607f04d32ac4db75389a84131cb7a68396R23">use a heuristic</a> to detect if the parameters I've got look like a log string. The heuristic is pretty simple: if we interpret the first argument as a pointer to char, then we iterate a few bytes and check if those bytes are ASCII printable characters. If so - great, we have a log call, we can forward our parameters to vprintf. If not, then do nothing. There's also the obvious problem here that we can get all sorts of random values passed in here as a first parameter, and they're not all valid pointers at all, let alone pointers to null terminated strings. So, there's a pretty high chance we're going to segfault. But that's ok. Windows handles segfaults by throwing an <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/structured-exception-handling-c-cpp?view=msvc-170">SEH exception</a>. We can catch and ignore the exception, then presume the call is not a logging call. Surprisingly, this actually worked pretty well.</p>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/debug_log.webp" title="Digital Archaeology"></p><p>I wonder how long it's been since someone last read these log lines</p>
<p>That was cool, but not really enough. There were still false positives and false negatives, and false positives could still cause the game to crash. If I wanted to fix this for real, then I'd need to get in there and annotate every.&nbsp; single.&nbsp; call. I could give myself a bit of a head start though. I tightened up my heuristic to give no false positives (at the expense of some false negatives), and logged call sites by using the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/intrinsics/addressofreturnaddress?view=msvc-170">AddressOfReturnAddress</a> intrinsic inside my detour.</p>
<p>What I really wanted was to separate the logging calls into a different function from the other empty function calls. Actually, two functions, because there were two variants of the logging function. IDA has a patching mode that allows you to make binary changes to the executable under analysis, without applying them to the real file on disk. It then uses those patches during disassembly and decompilation, so you get a virtualised view of how your patches will affect the binary. You can also dump the patches to a file, or apply them to the original binary.</p>
<p>The original empty function had a bunch of zeroed out padding bytes immediately following it, so I could patch in a few empty functions in that padding space by inserting ret instructions. Then I patch the actual logging calls to call one of the new empty functions, and later on I can detour that function to reenable logging. With an incomplete list of addresses from my heuristic dumper, I could use IDAs built in python scripting to patch known good call sites.</p>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/ida_patch_calls.png"></p><p>IDApython script to patch call sites with an offset</p>
<p>My heuristic worked pretty well for most of the call sites, but it was not all of them by a long shot. I wrote another python script to find unpatched call sites and apply some more heuristics, like looking for patterns of pushing a string constant before the call instruction. These got me another bunch of calls, but in the end I still had several hundred call sites that I just had to manually annotate. It took a few excruciatingly boring hours, but I got it done. I then exported the patch data, reformatted it as a C++ array, and <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorHooks/PatchDebugLog.cpp">applied the patch at runtime</a>.</p>
<p>The reason I spent so long making sure the debug log was working so well, was that I had an intuition that it would end up being enormously helpful during the rest of the project. Actually, that's a lie, it was just a fun technical challenge and made me feel like a digital archaeologist. But hey - I had you fooled with that excuse right? Jokes aside, it really did help to have the original logs. For example, when I was working on getting multiplayer over WOL (Westwood Online) working, the client was hanging some time after receiving the game start command. By looking at the debug log, I could see a failed assert message: "MyId == INVALID_ID". I then searched IDA's strings view, jumped into the function where the assert was failing, and realised that it was the function which handles receipt of an SC_MESSAGE_YOUR_DETAILS message. A few lines above I saw that we had logged successfully receiving an SC_MESSAGE_YOUR_DETAILS message already. This tipped me off to look at my wireshark dumps, and I noticed that I was incorrectly sending a GAMEOPT command containing an SC_MESSAGE_YOUR_DETAILS message to all connected players instead of just the target. Without the debug log prompting me, I have no idea how long I would have taken to notice.</p>
<h3 id="patching_graphics">Patching graphics</h3>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/dx_overview.jpg"></p><p>Contemporary graphic design from the D3D7 era</p>
<p>Emperor was built with the then-current graphics API Direct3D 7. Broadly speaking, DirectX 8/9 is around when graphics APIs started to vaguely approximate the kind of feature set we expect today, moving away from a fixed-function pipeline and towards a modern shader-based world. DirectX 9 in particular, was still occasionally used up until quite recently, with some still-popular games still using it (for example CS:GO, which was only retired in 2023). I won't get into the weeds on graphics APIs here, but suffice it to say that Direct3D 7 support in modern windows is... patchy at best.</p>
<h4 id="window_management">High resolution windows</h4>
<p>One of the major issues is the resolution limit. From what I can tell, Direct3D7 on modern systems is implemented as some sort of wrapper layer that redirects to a more modern version of DirectX, like 9 or 11. Somewhere in that wrapper layer, the maximum texture size is being limited to 2048. Luckily, I was able to pull in some code from UCyborg's <a href="https://github.com/UCyborg/LegacyD3DResolutionHack/blob/master/d3dim.c">LegacyD3DResolutionHack</a> patch, which solved that problem for me<a href="#foot-2">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>There was also another problem. The game cannot handle running at anything but a 4:3 ratio. Rendering works, but the UI is completely broken, like it's zoomed in way too far. Also the in-game mouse rendering has a broken offset, which varies depending on your distance from the centre of the screen<a href="#foot-3">[3]</a>.</p>
<video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/mouse_offset.mp4"></video>
<p>Mouse offset. The system cursor is where clicks really register.</p>
<p>So, we need some 4:3 letterboxing. This was actually surprisingly difficult. I tried just telling the game to render fullscreen at 2160x2880 (a 4:3 slice out of 4k), but it didn't like using arbitrary resolutions in fullscreen mode like that. The game does have a windowed mode though, accessible by passing -w in the command line args, and arbitrary resolutions are not a problem when windowed. But then we get an ugly floating window with a border, that doesn't cover up the taskbar. I tried <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/commit/fc5538e8fa0c89208c112a4a6c0a4d1df37318f7#diff-e404d91cbd33aed1d33216c0a473ac607f04d32ac4db75389a84131cb7a68396R229">a bunch</a> of <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/commit/abed24c94af91b28e8f42ce4c444a3c8c6ba34db#diff-e404d91cbd33aed1d33216c0a473ac607f04d32ac4db75389a84131cb7a68396R252">bad ideas</a>, but what worked in the end was a patch to <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorHooks/PatchWindowManagement.cpp#L48">remove the border style, and reparent the game window</a> on top of a fullscreen black window. I also added <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorHooks/PatchWindowManagement.cpp#L155">mouse capture</a>, so edge scrolling isn't broken if you have multiple monitors, or want to play in windowed mode.</p>
<h4 id="patch_framerate_limit">Limiting framerate</h4>
<p>Next I <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorHooks/HookD3D7.cpp#L23">patched the IDirect3DDevice7::EndScene</a> method, to limit the FPS to 60.</p>
<video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/menu_calm.mp4"></video>
<p>Soooo much better</p>
<p>To limit the framerate to 60 FPS, we need to detect the current framerate, calculate the amount we need to delay, and then sleep the thread for that amount of time. To do that, we need to patch a function that is called once per frame, preferably at the very end of the frame. IDirect3DDevice7::EndScene fits the bill perfectly. But this was a little tricky, because IDirect3DDevice7::EndScene is not exported directly - it's a member function of a "lightweight COM" object created through a chain of COM method calls.</p>
<details id="what_is_lightweight_com">
    <summary>What is lightweight COM?</summary>
    <div>
            <p>COM is many things, but among other things it is a method of representing objects that allows us to have ABI stability. Lightweight COM (also known as nano COM) is a subset of COM concepts that focuses on that representation and ignores the rest.</p>
            <details id="what_is_abi_stability">
                <summary>What is ABI stability?</summary>
                <div>
                        <p>To understand ABI stability, let's take a step back and discuss API stability. API stability means that you provide a source-code level API that does not change, so consumers of that API can upgrade to new versions without having to change their code. ABI stability is taking this concept one step further for native code, and providing guarantees that consumers can upgrade your library <em>without recompiling</em>.</p>
                        <p>For example, if I add a new field to a struct that is part of my public interface, the API has not changed. Any code written against the old version can be successfully recompiled against the new version, and all is well. But an old <em>binary</em>, compiled against the old version will not work anymore. The compiler used information about the size of the struct, and the offsets of its members during compilation, and that information is now wrong. This binary interface is known as the ABI (Application Binary Interface). ABI stability is the practice of crafting updates to native code libraries without causing this kind of breakage.</p>
                    </div>
            </details>
            <p>Microsoft doesn't want to force everyone to recompile their DirectX apps every time they add a field to a class, so the COM object representation takes care of that. In essence, a COM object is a struct that contains, as its first member, a pointer to a table of functions (known as a vtable). Something like this:</p>
            <p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/com_lite.png"></p><p>When you're actually implementing a COM object in C++, Microsoft's MSVC compiler gives you a bit of help, but under the hood this is what you get. You could also implement a COM object in plain C, and in that case you would need to handle your layout manually. Under COM, you never access the members of a class directly, the consumer of your class only ever sees your vtable and a pointer to your class. This way, consumers never depend on the exact size or layout of the underlying struct, so you're free to change it.</p>
            <p>COM allows a single object to provide multiple interfaces, think of this like normal class inheritance, but with some extra possibilities. Each interface has its own base pointer, with its own vtable. You switch interface not by a simple cast, but by using a special QueryInterface function. There is also some reference counting going on, but that's not important to this discussion.</p>
        </div>
</details>
<p>To get a pointer to the IDirect3DDevice7::EndScene function, the application has to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Call DirectDrawCreateEx to get an IDirect3D7*</li>
    <li>Call IDirect3D7::CreateDevice to get an IDirect3DDevice7* </li>
    <li>Grab the function pointer from the vtable on the IDirect3DDevice7</li>
</ul>

<p>So I'm confronted with a dilemma. I want to get the function pointer, but in order to do so I need to call a bunch of Direct3D functions that would create complicated objects, potentially interfering with the application. But maybe...</p>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/we_could_let_her_do_it.webp"></p><p>... maybe we could let the game create the objects</p>
<p>So in the end, what we do is the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Patch DirectDrawCreateEx on app start</li>
    <li>When DirectDrawCreateEx is called for the first time, before returning we use the IDirect3DDevice7 we just created to grab a pointer to IDirect3D7::CreateDevice, and patch that</li>
    <li>When IDirect3D7::CreateDevice is called for the first time, before returning we use the IDirect3DDevice7 we just created to grab a pointer to IDirect3DDevice7::EndScene and patch it to insert a frame rate limit.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="patching_networking">Patching networking</h3>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/WOL.png"></p><p>It's got a 28.8 BPS modem</p>
<p>The next job is to get multiplayer working. What we want is a very basic version - no fancy lobbies, hosted servers or clan systems. Just forward ports and then copy/paste your friends IP to connect. Classic style, and most importantly requires no infrastructure so it won't break if I lose interest in maintaining it.</p>
<p>There's two roads we can go down here, patching LAN mode, or WOL (Westwood Online - the game's defunct online service). LAN mode is actually working, however it is not ideal for modern players. It depends on sending UDP <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting_(networking)">broadcast</a> packets to announce servers, a commonly used trick in old LAN games. The idea is, when you host a game, you broadcast a special packet to all hosts on your LAN subnet, essentially announcing "I am running a game server". That lets the game show a list of lobbies in the LAN menu, so players can connect without having to open a cmd window and call out their IP address to eachother.</p>
<p>The downside is that, for obvious reasons, broadcast does not work online. And as the game has no way to specify an ip to connect to manually, there is no way to play with a friend online using this mode. I did initially work on allowing online play through LAN mode by <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/commit/75618a09cc91cd2c9737e65b4b5b02e219f7105b">patching the LAN chat</a> to allow you to specify an IP to connect to, but once I realised there was a WOL-exclusive coop campaign mode I abandoned that approach.</p>
<p>There's two components to getting WOL working. We need to stand up a fake WOL master server so the game can figure out where to connect and what kind of game to start, and then we need to do some proxying of the game packets to make it work over a direct IP connection. Surprisingly enough, there is an master server running at <a href="https://xwis.net/">xwis.net</a>. From what I can tell, it's fan run, and at time of writing they have access to the original DNS entries used by the game (servserv.westwood.com). Emperor is not really working out of the box on xwis though, so despite them mentioning Emperor on their homepage, I think it's really only used for other Westwood games in the Command &amp; Conquer series. Still, it's enough to make and join a lobby so we'll start with the packet proxying and come back to the master server issue later. </p>
<h4 id="packets_must_flow">The packets must flow</h4>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/packets_must_flow.webp"></p><p>You're probably wondering "why the hell is he talking about proxying packets, I thought he wanted a direct connection". Well, I do. But there's a problem. Emperor uses a peer-to-peer networking model. Pairs (every pair? not sure) of players open direct connections to eachother. Critically, they open two connections for each pair one from A-&gt;B and one from B-&gt;A. This means every client in the game needs to have open ports so they can accept connections. Worse still, the game randomly chooses which ports to listen on. That's really not gonna fly, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Originally, the WOL master server was accompanied by a "mangler" server. "Mangler" here seems to refer to mangling packets for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_punching_(networking)">NAT punching</a>, a technique for allowing connections between two clients, both of whom are behind a NAT so direct connections are not normally available. This is unreliable at best, but more to the point, it needs an accessible server to coordinate the connection and the original is long gone. The game connection was just hanging at this stage, waiting forever for the mangler server to respond, so I <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorHooks/PatchWol.cpp#L75">patched out</a> the mangler call entirely.</p>
<p>Now we come to the real problem: the server will assign port ranges to each of the clients, send the ips and port ranges of each client to all the other clients, and they will attempt to open connections to one another. The meta communication about client list and port ranges takes place over IRC (yes, actual IRC, more on that later) hosted on the master server.</p>
<p>I solved this by completely co-opting all of winsock (winsock is the windows implementation of network sockets). I <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorHooks/PatchWol.cpp#L145">intercept</a> all the required functions, and tunnel all connections through a single client-&gt;server network connection. So when a client wants to <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorHooks/WolProxyClient.cpp#L87">send a message</a> to the server, or even to another client, it is intercepted, wrapped in a header and pushed through the single network connection. There is a thread running on the server dedicated to <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorHooks/WolProxyServer.cpp#L45">receiving messages</a>, and dispatching them to the appropriate destination. There are some subtleties around determining the appropriate destination based on port range, faking the correct sender ip, etc, but in the end it works quite well. The game still believes it's operating in a peer to peer fashion, but we get the benefit of being able to direct connect with only the server host needing to worry about their network config.</p>
<p>With all of that setup, I was able to start and join probably the first Coop Campaign game in over a decade.</p>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/first_coop.jpg"></p><p>Atreides tutorial mission, immediately followed by a victory dance around my apartment</p>
<h4 id="irc_server">The part where I write an IRC server for some reason</h4>
<p>As mentioned before, the WOL master server is really just a glorified IRC server. There is some customisation though, so luckily the xwis server that's still running served as a great example to work from. There is even an <a href="https://github.com/pvpgn/pvpgn-server/blob/fcdf00fedfd79a041e1a7b2f20c8d15995b0a762/src/bnetd/handle_wol.cpp">open source WOL server implementation</a> for reference as well.</p>
<p>But wait a second, why write a server at all if there's one available online already? Well, because it won't be forever. My goal with this project is partly about just being able to play coop with my friend, yes, but it's also about cultural preservation. I want to craft a collection of bytes that ensures anyone who wants to play this game can do so, forever. If I rely on some server being up, I can't do that. As for why I didn't just use the pvpgn open source code - that project has very different goals to me. I want to provide the bare minimum needed to get a multiplayer game running, not run a competitive play community.</p>
<p>WOL is a weird mix of standard IRC stuff and custom bits. Game lobbies are special channels, they use standard IRC topics for game lobby info, but then use PAGE instead of PRIVMSG for sending messages in lobby chat, and synchronise game settings with GAMEINFO messages whose content isn't even ASCII. In the end, implementing a basic WOL server <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorHooks/WolIrcServer.cpp">wasn't too complicated</a>. It took some trial and error, and it definitely isn't robust if you wander off the happy path, but it works.</p>

<h4 id="installer">Replacing the installer</h4>
<p>As I mentioned at the beginning of this post, the original installer for Emperor is broken. Westwood did release a workaround installer that you can use by copying the contents of the install CD to your hard drive and overwriting the setup exe, but honestly that's a mess. I'd prefer to provide a nice simple tool that can handle it for the user, and also deal with patching the game up to v1.09, the last official patch.</p>
<p>The basic install is pretty straightforward, just <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorLauncher/Installer.cpp#L415">copying some files off the CD</a>, and extracting some others from a .cab file on the CD. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(file_format)">cab files</a> are just a basic archive format, like zip, and there is <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fdi/">an interface</a> built into windows for extracting them.</p>
<p>The hard part was patching to v1.09. I was hoping I could just grab a copy of the patch file, EM109EN.EXE, right click -&gt; extract with 7zip and be presented with some shiny new up to date binaries, but alas no. The next thing I tried was checking for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_(Windows)">windows resources</a>. Windows resources are a standard method of embedding binary data into an executable file on windows, supported by the compiler and build system. Here, I actually got a hit. I didn't have any filenames, so I couldn't tell their types, but there were a few, mostly tiny files on the order of a few hundred bytes. One of the files was a few hundred kilobytes though. I opened it up in a hex editor and saw something I didn't expect.</p>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/dosmode.png"></p><p>This program cannot be run in DOS mode</p>
<p>That's a windows executable file header!<a href="#foot-4">[4]</a> So we have an executable file embedded in the patch exe. I tried to start analysing the new binary, but none of my tools worked. "file", the unix magic number file identification tool couldn't tell what it was either. Clearly something wasn't right about this file. If I'd paid more attention and done some research on the windows PE format, I would have seen that that "MZ" bytes that should be at the very beginning of a PE file were offset by one word, and that was all that was wrong. But for now I decided to go back to the original patch binary and see if I could figure out what it was doing with the executable.</p>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/rtpatch.png"></p><p>Loading &amp; running the DLL</p>
<p>I went searching for uses of LoadResource, a standard windows API that a program can use to get a pointer to a resource it has embedded, and I found this code. It is extracting the binary resource we found to a temporary file, then loading the temp file as a .DLL and running a function from inside it. We can also see here why we weren't able to load the executable before - the first four bytes of the resource are storing the size of the file, then the rest is the file itself. I'm not quite sure why they did this, as they could have just used the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-sizeofresource">SizeofResource</a> function instead.</p>
<p>I also noticed when running the patch program in a debugger, that all the actual file changes in the install directory were happening in the function pulled out of the embedded DLL. I had a look at the functions exported by the DLL to check out their names - the function that EM109EN.EXE calls is named "RTPatch32@12". RTPatch sounded like it might be some kind of patching tool, so I went searching and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231022172410/https://www.pocketsoft.com/rtpatch_binary_diff.html">sure enough</a>, it is.</p>
<p>I then went searching for any third party tools for working with RTpatch, and found the <a href="http://aluigi.altervista.org/mytoolz.htm#myrtp">myRTP</a> tool by Luigi Auriemma. Checking his source code, he straight up just loads and runs the DLL, with some arguments to tell it where to find the game. I tried the same, but noticed that it was just ignoring the directory I was passing in and fetching the Emperor install directory straight from the registry. I was able to <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorLauncher/Installer.cpp#L101">fake the registry</a> keys that it expected, pass in the same command string that EM109EN.EXE did, and that actually worked. This is kind of funny, as the embedded DLL is 168 KiB, while EM109EN.EXE is 5.5 MiB, meaning the actual patch data is about 3% of the file size. If they were willing to accept that kind of overhead, it makes me wonder if it was worth all the effort of using a binary diffing tool rather than just shipping the changed files whole.</p>
<h4 id="internet_components">Westwood Online Shared Internet Components</h4>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/Loading_ani.gif"></p><p>Loading the shared components was tricker than it seemed</p>
<p>I knew we would get back to COM eventually. When you use the original installer, there are two components - Emperor, and something called the "Westwood Online Shared Internet Components". Without this optional component installed, WOL doesn't work. Of course, I want to package this into my installer so the user doesn't need to worry about getting it set up.</p>
<p>The problem is that this component seems to live up to its name - it really is shared. I suppose the same installation of the shared internet components could be used by multiple Westwood games with WOL support. It's not installed in the Emperor directory, but in its own folder somewhere, and at first I didn't know how Emperor was finding it. I thought it might be through something saved in the registry? Well, it turns out that I was correct, but not in the way I expected.</p>
<p>The main thing installed is WOLAPI.DLL, and it is a COM class library. Emperor loads code from the library by using CoCreateClass to instantiate the various COM objects contained in WOLAPI.DLL, which were registered at install time.</p>

            <p>If you didn't read the previous section "<a href="#what_is_lightweight_com">What is lightweight COM?</a>", I suggest you go back and read it now.</p>
            <p>Again, I'm not going to give you a full explanation of all the subtleties of COM, mostly because I'm certain I'm not qualified to do so. But I can explain the process of registering a COM class library DLL.</p>
            <p>Let's say we have a chunk of functionality implemented as COM objects, and we want to make that code available as a library to be used by other processes. How do they find our DLL? How do they identify the objects they want to create? COM registration is a method for solving this problem.</p>
            <p>In COM, in addition to its human readable name, each class is identified by a unique identifier known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">GUID</a> (or more specifically, a class ID or CLSID). There is a standard COM function, CoCreateInstance, which is used to create instances of classes. You identify the class you want to create by passing in the CLSID of the class, and it gives you back a pointer to a new instance of that class. But where does it store the list of available classes?</p>
            <p>In the windows registry, under the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\<wbr>SOFTWARE\<wbr>Classes\<wbr>CLSID. So COM registration is essentially taking a DLL full of COM classes, and saving the CLSIDs of those classes, along with a path to the DLL implementing them into the windows registry at a system wide level.</p>
            <p>I've glossed over a lot of complexity here - for example COM has "out of process" servers, where the class is provided by an implementation that lives in a separate process, with automatic marshalling across process boundaries. But the part that matters here is just about telling CoCreateInstance where to find the WOL interfaces.</p>
        </div>
</details>
<p>Ok, so can we just copy WOLAPI.DLL into the install folder and do normal COM registration? Well, we could but it's not ideal. COM registration writes to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE key, which requires admin access. Also, if at all possible I would like to keep things scoped to just affect our game process. Registering COM objects system wide seems unnecessarily messy.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, it's not possible to register a class library for just one process<a href="#foot-5">[5]</a>, but it is possible to register a class for just one user by <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorHooks/PatchWol.cpp#L102">redirecting the registry</a>, and then using the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/oleauto/nf-oleauto-oaenableperusertlibregistration">OaEnablePerUserTLibRegistration</a> function, so that's what I did.</p>
<h4 id="launcher_ui">Launcher UI</h4>
<p>The last thing left to do was to make a basic launcher UI where players could type an ip to connect to, and tweak some basic settings.</p>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/launcher.png"></p><p>UI design is my passion</p>
<p>In keeping with the very microsofty and quite retro theme of all the tech presented so far, I decided to use <a href="https://github.com/wheybags/EmperorLauncher/blob/77817363ebf0f5f82545b508a9f731c22e2c0254/EmperorLauncher/EmperorLauncher.cpp#L408">plain old win32</a>. It was my first time making a UI with raw win32 controls, and I gotta say - it's kinda rough. I can see why people generally don't use it anymore. But for something so simple and static like this, it was fine.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>So with that, my goals were pretty much achieved. This blog post is getting long so I won't got into details about the last few bits of polish. If you made it this far, thanks for listening to my ramblings, and if you try playing it, I hope you enjoy the game.</p>

<p>•••</p>

<p id="foot-1">1: Detours actually takes care of the CreateRemoteThread &amp; LoadLibrary trick for us also.</p>
<p id="foot-2">2: It's actually a bit of a crazy hack, and probably not very resilient to change. What they're doing is searching for the bytes of a comparison to 2048, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://wheybags.com/assets/blog_pics/emperor/SetRenderTarget.webp"></p><p>Example from DIRECT3DDEVICEI::SetRenderTarget</p>
<p>They just search the whole binary for the pattern B8 00 08 00 00 39, and replace the 00 08 00 00 part (little endian / 2048 in decimal) with FF FF FF FF which makes the check an unconditional pass. B8 at the start is the mov opcode, and the 39 at the end is the start of the cmp opcode that follows. I had a scan through d3dim700.dll on my system, and it seemed like there weren't any false positives. Still though, this is not a super nice solution, and could be broken if Microsoft does ever decide to ship an update to Direct3D 7 for some reason. I would actually like to use a complete reimplementation of the D3D7 API on top of a more modern D3D, like <a href="https://github.com/elishacloud/dxwrapper">dxwrapper</a>, but I tried a few, and none of them really worked well with Emperor.</p>
<p id="foot-3">3: Actually, it seems like the offset is always there, and always a little broken, even at 4:3. It's just small enough that it doesn't really matter.</p>
<p id="foot-4">4: Every windows executable actually starts with a DOS executable. Normally, this is just a small program that prints the message "This program cannot be run in DOS mode". This was a backwards compatability thing in the early days of windows. If a user tried to run a windows EXE from DOS, they would get a nice error explaining to them that they needed to use windows to run this file. Source <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2002/february/inside-windows-win32-portable-executable-file-format-in-detail#the-ms-dos-header">here</a>.</p>
<p id="foot-5">5: I did try using the DllGetClassObject function directly from the DLL, but it didn't work.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I’m an AWS Serverless Hero, principal engineer at an AWS centric logistics company, and I build and maintain <a href="https://aws-news.com/" rel="nofollow">https://aws-news.com</a>. It’s fair to say that I am very interested in everything AWS does. But I fear AWS is no longer interested in what I do.</p>



<p>This post is about AWS’ obsession with Generative AI (GenAI) and how it pushes away everything that makes AWS, well, AWS. Of course it started with OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT, on November 30, 2022. Coincidentally, this date fell exactly in the middle of Re:Invent – Amazon’s yearly developer conference in Vegas. I was there and it was great. Werner Vogels had a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfvL_423a-I">keynote</a> about event driven architectures and there were many sessions in areas like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/top-analytics-announcements-of-aws-reinvent-2022/">analytics</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/amazon-relational-database-reinvent-2022-recap/">relational databases</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/reinvent-2022-devops-and-developer-productivity-playlist/">devops</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/three-key-security-themes-from-aws-reinvent-2022/">security</a>, and very importantly, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/architecting-for-sustainability-at-aws-reinvent-2022/">sustainability</a>.</p>



<p>Fast forward one year, and the world couldn’t look more different. GenAI dominated Re:Invent 2023. Every topic was either about the infrastructure for GenAI, the integrations with GenAI, the data for GenAI, and how GenAI would make everything better, from customer interactions to content creation, from refactoring to operations. It was weird, but I dismissed it as peak hype cycle. And to be honest I too was pretty excited about all the opportunities GenAI would bring.</p>



<p>Then 2024 came around, and somehow AWS’ focus on GenAI took on hysterical proportions. It started with the global AWS summits, where at least 80% of the talks was about GenAI. Then there was AWS re:Inforce – the annual security conference – which was themed “Security in the era of generative AI”.</p>

<p>After re:Inforce came the flagship NYC summit. Corey Quinn wrote a great piece about the conference titled <a href="https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/amazon-genai-services/">Amazon GenAI Services</a>. A quote from his post:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>However, the badge lanyards were GenAI branded, the keynote opening slide simply said “Generative AI,” and every single offering discussed during the ~98 minute keynote was centered around Generative AI. Nearly every expo hall booth was dripping with GenAI; Elastic even went so far as to rebrand itself as “The Search AI company.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I wasn’t at the NYC summit so I can’t speak for the in-person experience. But I did monitor the releases they announced during the event. I summarized my thoughts in this <a href="https://x.com/donkersgood/status/1811153913632149660">tweet</a>:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="908" data-permalink="https://lucvandonkersgoed.com/2024/07/13/dear-aws-please-let-me-be-a-cloud-engineer-again/image-17/" data-orig-file="https://lucvandonkersgoed.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-2.png" data-orig-size="1224,420" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://lucvandonkersgoed.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-2.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://lucvandonkersgoed.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-2.png?w=1024" tabindex="0" role="button" width="1024" height="351" src="https://lucvandonkersgoed.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-2.png?w=1024" alt=""></figure>



<p>And this is the crux: AWS is now focused so strongly on GenAI that they seem not to care about anything else anymore – including everything that made developers love them and made them the leading cloud provider on almost every metric.</p>



<h2>You need a business to benefit from GenAI</h2>



<p>Now don’t get me wrong. I like GenAI. I use it extensively at work and for the AWS News Feed. I use ChatGPT to shape new ideas, Copilot to speed up development, and Claude to generate summaries. The point is that all these features add to an existing business. This business has customers, data, business rules, revenue, products, marketing, and all the other things that make a business tick. And most businesses had these things before 2022. GenAI allows us to add new features, and often faster than before. <em>But GenAI has no value without an existing product to apply it to</em>.</p>



<p>And this is where my work, my interests, and my passions come in. I like building products. I like designing scalable infrastructure. I like developing maintainable applications. And I love AWS for the tools they provide me to do this.</p>



<h2>The implicit message</h2>



<p>But AWS and I are growing apart. I feel the things I value are no longer the things they value. By only talking about GenAI, they implicitly tell me databases are not important. Scalable infrastructure is not important. Maintainable applications are not important. Only GenAI is.</p>



<p>The same goes for feature releases. If the vast bulk of all new feature releases are geared towards GenAI, it implicitly means AWS is rerouting investments from classic infrastructure to shiny GenAI. It means that the products I love get smaller budgets. It means that the products I use will not get the next feature I want, or only at a slower pace.</p>



<p>In summary, AWS’ implicit messaging tells developers they should no longer focus on core infrastructure, and spend their time on GenAI instead. I believe this is wrong. Because GenAI can only exist if there is a business to serve. Many, if not almost all of us developers got into AWS because we want to build and support these businesses. We’re not here to be gaslighted into the “GenAI will solve every problem” future. We know it won’t.</p>



<h2>A better way</h2>



<p>I’m not saying there is no value in GenAI. I’m not even saying AWS shouldn’t be building GenAI products. What I’m saying is that AWS is not a <em>GenAI only</em> company and shouldn’t pretend to be. $22.8 billion of <a href="https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2024/Amazon.com-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-Results/default.aspx">AWS operating income</a> in 2022 and $24.6 billion in 2023 is a hell of a user base to ignore. It is also a financial foundation that should allow them to focus on more than one thing.</p>



<p>I would love to see AWS un-ignore its roots. Show us you still value the businesses and products you supported in the past. Help developers build better applications by listening to them and solving their pain points. Educate them on the fundamentals of infrastructure: performance, reliability, cost efficiency, security, operational excellence, and sustainability.</p>



<p>Your first <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us/leadership-principles">leadership principle</a> is customer obsession: “Leaders start with the customer and work backwards”. </p>



<p>I’m your customer, and I’m begging you: please let me be a cloud engineer again.</p>

<p>Hacktivist group NullBulge claims to have breached Disney, leaking 1.1 TiB of internal Slack data. The leak allegedly includes messages, files, code, and more. This comes amidst breaches affecting AT&amp;T and Ticketmaster.</p>


<p>A self-proclaimed hacktivist group named NullBulge, aiming to “protect artists’ rights and ensure fair compensation for their work,” claims to have breached Disney and leaked 1.1 TiB (1.2 TB) of the company’s internal Slack infrastructure. These claims were posted on the notorious cybercrime and hacker platform <strong><a href="https://hackread.com/breach-forums-return-clearnet-dark-web-fbi-seizure/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="117113" rel="noreferrer noopener">Breach Forums</a></strong> on July 12, 2024.</p>



<p>The breach, which is yet to be verified, allegedly contains a complete copy of the company’s Slack communications used by their development team including messages, files, and other data exchanged within the Slack workspace.</p>



<p>The hackers further claim the dump includes “almost 10,000 channels, every message and file possible, unreleased projects, raw images, code, logins, links to internal API/web pages, and more!”</p>

<p>As for Disney, in recent years, the company has faced criticism and legal issues regarding the payment of fair shares to artists and writers. Prominent figures like Neil Gaiman have <strong><a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/623157/neil-gaiman-calls-out-disney-for-failing-to-pay-royalties-to-writers-and-artists/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">highlighted</a> </strong>that Disney has stopped paying royalties to some writers and artists for works that include novelizations and graphic novels of Disney-owned properties. This issue affected various creators who worked on popular franchises such as “Star Wars” and “Alien.</p>



<p>The problem came into the spotlight when author Alan Dean Foster publicly stated that he had not received royalties for his “Star Wars” and “Alien” novels after Disney acquired the respective franchises. </p>



<p>Despite some high-profile settlements, many writers and artists <a href="https://wdwnt.com/2022/05/writers-and-artists-still-fighting-to-receive-overdue-royalties-from-disney/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>continue to struggle</strong></a> to get their due payments. Organizations like the Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA) have been actively campaigning for these creators, forming task forces to pressure Disney into fulfilling its financial obligations​.</p>



<p>Hackread.com has reached out to Disney for comment. Meanwhile, VX-Underground, an online malware repository, <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1811783405127749647" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>tweeted</strong></a> that if proven legitimate, the hack could be the work of infostealer malware. </p>


<p>Nevertheless, the alleged data breach is just another in a series affecting companies based in the United States. On July 12, 2024, <strong><a href="https://hackread.com/att-data-breach-hackers-steal-call-text-records/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AT&amp;T announced</a> </strong>that hackers had stolen call records and text message logs of “nearly all” customers, impacting over 110 million Americans.</p>
