<p>Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) have demonstrated that an Apple iPad likely jammed against the co-pilot’s left pedal prior to the fatal crash of a Rotak Helicopter Services Chinook in Idaho last year.</p>

NTSB Photo</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Boeing CH-47D had been filling its bucket on a long line in the Salmon River on the afternoon of July 21, 2022, when it began spinning to the left. Eyewitness video captured the helicopter continuing its counterclockwise rotation as it descended and impacted the river just 13 seconds later.</p>
<p>Although ground firefighters on scene quickly extracted the pilot, Thomas Hayes, 41, and co-pilot, Jared Bird, 36, from the water, both men ultimately died from their injuries.</p>
<p>The NTSB has not yet released its final report on the accident, which will include its determination of probable cause. However, the newly opened <a href="https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=105544">public docket</a> for the crash contains an “Exemplar Helicopter and iPad Examination Summary” that details how investigators established the source of damage on the flight crew’s iPad, which was recovered from the river with three distinct gouge marks and a bend from the back of the case toward the screen.</p>
<p>Apple iPads and other so-called electronic flight bags (EFBs) have become common equipment in aircraft cockpits, used for flight planning, as a supplemental navigation aid, and to replace paper documents, among other purposes.</p>

NTSB Photo</figcaption></figure>
<p>NTSB investigators conducted their study using an exemplar CH-47D with a cockpit configuration similar to that of the accident helicopter. During the accident flight, the pilot was sitting in the left seat and the co-pilot in the right.</p>
<p>Using auxiliary power to activate hydraulic assistance, investigators first pushed the pilot’s left pedal forward, which resulted in the co-pilot’s left pedal also moving forward. (Left pedal is used to commence a yaw to the left and/or stop a right yaw, and vice versa.)</p>
<p>Investigators then placed the study’s iPad between the left pedal and the airframe, next to the heel slide support assembly, on the co-pilot’s side. When additional pressure was applied to the pilot’s left pedal, the iPad fell and jammed between the left pedal and heel slide support assembly. That prevented the pedals from re-centering while also pushing against the co-pilot’s left pedal adjustment lever.</p>
<p>When pressure was applied to the pilot’s right pedal, the iPad was squeezed in between the pedal and the heel slide support assembly. The gouges in the recovered iPad aligned with a sharp, vertical metal piece of the assembly underneath the heel slide.</p>
<p>Additional right pedal input forced the iPad to apply more pressure to the co-pilot’s pedal adjustment lever. Examination of the accident helicopter’s wreckage revealed that the co-pilot’s left pedal was at the forward-most adjustment setting, while his right pedal was at the middle adjustment setting.</p></div><div>
<p>According to investigators, the accident co-pilot’s height was five feet, ten inches. During the study, with seat restraints on and seats adjusted for comfort, neither a slightly shorter (5’7”) nor a slightly taller (6’2”) man could reach the iPad in its jammed position.</p>

<p>Investigators also pointed out that the co-pilot’s flight helmet would have further complicated any attempts to retrieve the iPad, as the helmet would have contacted the visor over the instrument panel.</p>
<p>Andy Evans, director of the aviation safety consultancy Aerossurance, said that while operators are generally required to conduct risk assessments before adopting EFBs, there is often not an explicit requirement to consider the risk of the EFB as a loose object.</p>
<p>“Hopefully this accident will prompt operators to have a long hard look at all possible loose articles in cockpits and robustly securing valuable tools and sources of situational awareness like EFBs,” he told <em>Vertical</em> by email.</p>

    <p>“To be truly countercultural in a time of tech hegemony, one has to, above all, betray the platform which may come in the form of betraying or divesting from your public online self.”</p>
    <p>Search Google Images for ‘counterculture’ and it overwhelmingly returns black-and-white photos of young people all now over 60. In the pictures, it is so clear what they were countering: The Man, of course, who, with his white collar, white skin, and short hair, singlehandedly symbolized dominant cultural norms. In the age of social media, personal expression has become the most valuable form of currency, yet we still use the term ‘counterculture’ to describe alternatives to the hegemonic forces of yesteryear, as if dressing middle-class, white, and preppy still aligned with the rules of power today.</p>
<p>In an era more profoundly organized by Big Tech than our own elected governments, the new culture to be countered isn’t singular or top-down. It’s rhizomatic, nonbinary, and includes all who live within the Google/Apple/Facebook/Amazon digital ecosystem (aka GAFA stack). With digital platforms transforming legacy countercultural activity into profitable, high-engagement content, being countercultural no longer means being counter-hegemonic. What logic could possibly be upended by punks, goths, gabbers, or neo-pagans when the internet, a massively lucrative space of capitalization, profits off the personal expression and political conflict of its users?</p>
<p>As recently as the early ’90s, abjection and extreme profanity still worked pretty well to repel the big social threats of the time: pearl-clutching conservatives with their anti-progressive ideology and market recuperation. Take, for instance, musician GG Allin in an American-flag loincloth, fighting with his audience and shitting on stage before launching into a performance of “I’m Gonna Rape You,” or artist and noise musician Boyd Rice, in what he reports was a prank, joining the founder of the white supremacist group American Front in a 1989 Sassy photo shoot for an article the teen magazine was running on neo-Nazis. In context, these artists (like the psychedelic hippies of yore) were being literally countercultural—using culture against itself to violate the hegemonic push toward, in Allin’s and Rice’s case, neoliberal “responsibilization.”</p>
<p>In today’s online space, however, this strategy breaks down. Brought back into the spotlight in 2018 via a NYC gallery exhibition of visually innocuous abstract paintings, Rice quickly found himself at the center of controversy as his decades-old Sassy appearance (among other such stunts) tripped present-day censors. An old punk, he smirked at the outrage. “I’m too dangerous for New York City,” he told <a href="https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/boyd-rice-greenspon-show-canceled-1346441">Artnet</a>. Yet he wasn’t too dangerous for the internet. High-tension discussion of his work and life and the gallerist’s moral compass raged online, which is to say Rice was attentionally successful online. Despite being informed by billions, this new technological hegemony isn’t democratic; it’s a swarm-led form of para-governance programmed to maximize engagement while obfuscating responsibility for the social and environmental damage it wreaks. Zuckerberg, Bezos, Thiel, and other tech behemoths are quick to remind us that they’re not in charge of public laws or policy; their empires were built according to the “peaceful mechanisms” of free-market capitalism—and that society has adopted their tools and spaces through its own free will. If pressed, they’ll point out how their platforms reflect the countercultural demands of earlier generations: eschewing big government and vertical corporate culture while encouraging personal fulfillment and flat organizational structures. Today you can be a coder and a DJ, an Uber driver and a travel blogger, a Sand Hill Road suit and a Robot Heart Burner.</p>
<blockquote><p>What logic could possibly be upended by punks, goths, gabbers, or neo-pagans when the internet, a massively lucrative space of capitalization, profits off the personal expression and political conflict of its users?</p></blockquote>
<p>Similarly slippery is the new look of power. Far from the parades, palaces, and outsize girths of present-day strongmen like Viktor Orbán, Kim Jong-un, and Donald Trump, the most iconic tells you’ll find among the big tech set are more likely to be a black turtleneck, a Patagonia fleece, and the absence of carrying bags. It’s a flex to be visually indistinguishable from the crowd. The power of today is firmly situated in minimalism, restraint, and ease—it’s only power under threat that turns to physical displays of strength. Actual power is controlling the means by which lesser power can be displayed—i.e., congrats on the 500K likes on your polling numbers, @jack still owns all your tweets. Actual power keeps a low profile; actual power doesn’t need a social media presence, it owns social media.</p>
<p>In recent years, users have started to register this shift. Yet the term counterculture still gets used to describe someone like rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine, whose notoriety—first breaking society’s code (sexual abuse and murder conspiracy, among other offenses) and then the omertà code of the streets (snitching on fellow gang members to lessen his own sentence)—propelled him to superstardom: “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPw_izFr5PA">Gooba</a>,” a track he surprise-dropped upon being surprise-released from prison, made YouTube history by becoming the most-watched rap video in a 24-hour span, frying the platform’s view counter. That same day, 2 million simultaneous users tuned in to his Instagram Live as he confessed into his phone camera: “I snitched, I ratted. But who was I supposed to be loyal to?” And then with a sparkle of VVS diamonds, “I broke the YouTube. I’m at 5 million views in one hour. […] A rat is doin’ more numbers than you. Numbers don’t lie.” But behind 6ix9ine’s self-loyalty is an unwitting loyalty to the platform and, by extension, to the shareholders of Alphabet and Facebook, Inc. And this is where it gets tricky. To be truly countercultural today, in a time of tech hegemony, one has to, above all, betray the platform, which may come in the form of betraying or divesting from your public online self.</p>
<blockquote><p>To be truly countercultural today, in a time of tech hegemony, one has to, above all, betray the platform, which may come in the form of betraying or divesting from your public online self.</p></blockquote>
<p>6ix9ine is subcultural, but he isn’t countercultural. Someone like Edward Snowden, by comparison, isn’t subcultural but may be the closest we get to a countercultural figure in the postdigital age. A US government subcontractor with access to classified intelligence, Snowden saw Big Tech’s radically scaling power and, in 2013, exposed the NSA’s illegal agreements with major tech platforms to intercept the private e-mail, call records, and cache of “almost anything done on the internet” by users worldwide. Snowden’s whistleblowing targeted a major chakra of the new hegemony, resulting in great personal compromise. But a single individual isn’t an entire counterculture.</p>
<p>Counterculture requires a group. Us against the world. And the internet is excellent at bringing groups together around collective dissent. But just like the internet, there is nothing inherently socially progressive about these tools. Extinction Rebellion is countercultural in spirit but so too are QAnon, the armed right-wing libertarian Boogaloo Boys, and Europe’s Reichsbürger, who deny the existence of present-day Germany, claiming to be citizens of the Third Reich (which, they argue, technically never ended).</p>
<p>A truth specific to our time is that dissent against one level of authority is now very often driven by a deeper hegemonic force. Perhaps this is why, among many younger people (Greta Thunberg notwithstanding), there is less focus on battling current leaders and more interest in divining counter-futures. Instead of attempting to dismantle the master’s house using the master’s tools, it’s more something like: Let’s pool crypto to book the master’s Airbnb and use the tools we find there to forge a forest utopia that the master could never survive. Central to this counter-future crafting is a strong belief in impending ecological collapse, rendering all the existing systems of control obsolete—which is a logical work-around for thinking about dissent in a time when the socially and ecologically corrosive systems are deemed too sprawling to effectively counter or boycott. Another key factor is Gen Z’s rediscovery of <a href="https://politicalcompass.org/">PoliticalCompass.org</a>, a Web 1.0 site that, via six sets of prompts with which a user is asked to dis/-identify, generates an approximate position on the Political Compass’s X/Y axis of Left to Right, Authoritarian to Libertarian.</p>
<p>Having spent the past several years intensively studying the development of Gen Z’s online political expression, artist Joshua Citarella points to the emergence of “e-deologies, radical politics as a form of niche personal branding.” In his 2019 report <em>20 Interviews</em>, Citarella underscores the influence of Political Compass and gaming more generally on ideations of countercultural participation—or what he refers to as a “choose your character / choose your future” mode of “identity play that gained heightened relevance as American politics subsumed all of pop culture” during the mid-2010s.</p>
<p>Among the political identities one finds in this space is, for example: “Ted was right” anarcho-primitivism (anprim), which, following Ted Kaczynski’s <em>Industrial Society and Its Future</em> manifesto, promotes a reactionary return to pre-agrarian times where people, reskilled as hunters and gatherers, are no longer alienated from their labor and seek fulfillment through daily survival. If you think this sounds fringe, consider the 10.3 million users currently subscribed to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA">Primitive Technology</a> channel on YouTube, which has tutorialized building things “in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials, […] seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology”—except, of course, the device you use to stream the video showing you how.</p>
            <div>
                                                        <p><img alt="The internet didn’t kill counterculture—you just won’t find it on Instagram" src="https://djwp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/14115608/DJ_Sebastian-Lager-2.jpg" data-src="https://djwp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/14115608/DJ_Sebastian-Lager-2.jpg">
                                                                                                          </p>
                                                </div>
            
<p>The names of these e-deologies tend to be both fantastical and literal. A “post-civilizationist” might focus on what optimal human survival would look like were civilization no longer possible. A “voluntarist post-agrarianist,” meanwhile, might value anarcho-primitivism skills but see them as integral to realizing a civilization sustained through opt-in agrarian communes. Elsewhere on the compass, one finds the likes of “Fully Automated Luxury Gay Space Communism” (where a total embrace of technology delivers humanity from scarcity, ecological volatility, and the reactionary social ills of resource competition) and the defiantly neo-traditionalist “technocratic theocracy,” which puts its faith in a machine-governed future that upholds Christian virtues. E-deologies are further explored on message boards and social media via memes, TikTok posts, and livestreamed Twitch and YouTube debates, all of which can get pretty gnarly (calls for “eco-fash global genocide” and “secession of white ethnostates,” etc.) And maybe here, we do have an aesthetic counter to the wallflower non-style of Big Tech: a raging messy semiotic meltdown of radicalizing (if absurdist) meme culture where the only ideological no-go zone is the liberal center. Key here is that most of this activity is happening under the guise of avatars, pseudonyms, and collectively run social media accounts where direct lines between IRL subjects and online personas are rarely clear. The “niche personal branding” is gamified—push an account to the extreme, see what happens. If the platform shuts you down, start over.</p>
<p>While climate change is a shared concern for many younger people, their responses might be more accurately understood as competitive-futurist than countercultural. As the greatly imaginative range of Political Compass positions illustrates, there is little consensus over who or what they are specifically opposing. This is wise in an era when the complexity of global crises makes it exceedingly difficult to effectively isolate responsible parties. How would one even begin to hold, say, Apple accountable for all of the externalities within the life of an iPhone? Who among us could easily give up our connectivity and still be economically and socially okay? It’s as if, having grown up on a fully networked Earth, Gen Z has bypassed counterculture, finding it futile in the face of a hegemonic system that more clearly resembles a Hydra than the monolithic forces that legacy counterculture was rebelling against. Intuiting that any activity directly opposing the system will only make the system stronger, the next generation is instead opting for radical hyperstition: constructing alternative futures that abandon our current infrastructure entirely (the emergence of blockchain-based currencies, for instance, or calls to not merely reform but fully abolish the police).</p>
<p>While Citarella’s research focuses on teenagers who began posting online around 2016 (and in 2020 are roughly 18 years old), it nevertheless distills the changing nature of contemporary countercultural activity more broadly. For one, anonymity, or at least pseudonymity, is increasingly important if not fundamental to being active online in counter-hegemonic ways. This is very different from, say, 1990s ideations of IRL counterculture, where there was a premium on unmediated authenticity and “being real” (think MTV Unplugged). Now “selling out” is tying your online identity to your IRL life and real name. In part, this is because one of the biggest impediments to countercultural activity is the fact that the internet doesn’t suppress expression—it forces you to express and then holds you accountable for whatever you say for years. On the platform, silence isn’t an option, at least not if you want the network to remember you exist. This is especially true in the culture sector, where being visible means being kept in mind for gigs and collaborations. There is a reason why 6ix9ine is obsessed with breaking YouTube and why talented young rappers must be equally talented at social media marketing if they ever hope to build a career.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s as if, having grown up on a fully networked Earth, Gen Z has bypassed counterculture, finding it futile in the face of a hegemonic system that more clearly resembles a Hydra than the monolithic forces that legacy counterculture was rebelling against.</p></blockquote>
<p>We saw this dynamic metastasize in the wake of George Floyd’s murder, when well-intentioned claims of “silence is violence” (recalling the powerful 1987 ACT-UP “Silence = Death” campaign) spiraled into calling out individuals with even a small following who hadn’t come forward with a timely public statement of solidarity or remorse. Yet public posts were subject to popular scrutiny and judged based on sincerity, originality, and tone. Not surprisingly, many people defaulted to posting a somber plain black square. But this generated criticism of its own by clogging the feed with an informational blackout during a moment when community resource sharing was critically important. Amid a chaotic time, the platform functioned exactly as designed: amplification of emotions, uptick in user interaction, growth in platform engagement and data cultivation. <em>Cha-ching</em>, the platform cashes in. What’s really messed up about this is that users, despite understanding that the platform’s mechanics are net-bad, still feel a moral responsibility to obey the platform-enabled-hive-mind’s rules.</p>
<p>On the dark edges of the early internet, hackers foresaw the enclosure of the public commons long before the likes of 6ix9ine, Snowden, and teenage Gen Z. These users developed an ethos that valued the radical freedom of a fully anonymous, hyperconnected zone where people could communicate unburdened by their physical bodies and government names. As online activity began to centralize around search engines, such as Netscape, Explorer, and Google, in the late-’90s and early-’00s, the internet bifurcated into what became known as the “clearnet,” which includes all publicly indexed sites (i.e., big social media, commercial platforms, and anything crawled by major search engines) and the “darknet” or “deep web,” which is not publicly indexed (due to being built on anonymized, encrypted networks such as Tor). There were also a number of sites that though officially clearnet, laid the groundwork for a sub-clearnet space that we might think of as a “dark forest” zone—particularly message board forums like Reddit and 4chan, where users can interact without revealing their IRL identity or have this activity impact their real-name SEO.</p>
<p>Taken from the title of Chinese sci-fi writer Liu Cixin’s 2008 book, “the dark forest” region of the web is becoming increasingly important as a space of online communication for users of all ages and political persuasions. In part, this is because it is less sociologically stressful than the clearnet zone, where one is subject to peer, employer, and state exposure. It also now includes Discord servers, paid newsletters (e.g., Substack), encrypted group messaging (via Telegram, etc.), gaming communities, podcasts, and other off-clearnet message board forums and social media. One forages for content or shares in what others in the community have retrieved rather than accepting whatever the platform algorithms happen to match to your data profile. Additionally, dark forest spaces are both minimally and straightforwardly commercial. There is typically a small charge for entry, but once you are in, you are free to act and speak without the platform nudging your behavior or extracting further value. It is also interesting to keep in mind that the dark forest shares the same cables and satellite arrays as clearnet channels, is accessed via the same devices, and essentially all of its denizens continue to simultaneously participate in clearnet spaces (as contemporary professional protocol demands). It is therefore not analogous to legacy countercultural notions of going off-grid or “dropping out.”</p>
<p>To be sure, none of these spaces are pure, and users are just as vulnerable to echo chambers and radicalization in the dark forest as on pop-stack social media. But in terms of engendering more or less counter-hegemonic potential, the dark forest is more promising because of its relative autonomy from clearnet physics (the gravity, velocity, and traction of content when subject to x algorithm). Unlike influencers and “blue checks,” who rely on clearnet recognition for income, status, and even self-worth, dark forest dwellers build their primary communities out of clearnet range—or offline in actual forests, parks, and gardens (e.g., cottagecore and related eco-social trends)—and then only very selectively or even absurdly/incoherently show themselves under clearnet light. The crux of Liu Cixin’s book is the creed, when called by the clearnet: “Do not answer! Do not answer!! Do not answer!!! But if you do answer, the source will be located right away. Your planet will be invaded. Your world will be conquered.”</p>
<p>So what does today’s counter-hegemonic culture look like? It’s not particularly interested in being seen—at least not in person. It gets no thrill out of wearing leather and a mohawk and walking past main-street shops, which are empty now anyway. But it does demonstrate a hunger for freedom—freedom from the attention economy, from atomization, and the extractive logic of mainstream communication. We can imagine collectively held physical spaces reclaimed from empty retail or abandoned venues hosting esoteric local scenes, a proliferation of digital gangs in dark forests who hold secrets dear, and a new desire for scarcity in cultural objects—deeper and closer connections made between people even while rejecting the platform’s compulsion to “like and share.” In the internet era, true counterculture is difficult to see, and even harder to find—but that doesn’t mean it’s not there.</p>

<p>Theo de Raadt (<code>deraadt@</code>)
has updated
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/innovations.html"><code>innovations.html</code></a>
to include an item regarding the work which has been done
to enforce indirect branch target restriction
(on the
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/amd64.html"><code>amd64</code></a>
[Intel]
and
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/arm64.html"><code>arm64</code></a>
platforms).</p>

<p>The
<a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&amp;m=168925685303781&amp;w=2">commit message</a>
provides some detail:</p>

<blockquote>

Changes by:	deraadt@cvs.openbsd.org	2023/07/13 08:02:00

Log message:
Over the last 6 months we've worked on adding arm64 <abbr title="Branch Target Identification">BTI</abbr> &amp; Intel <abbr title="Indirect Branch Tracking">IBT</abbr> support
in the kernels and all userland binaries.  We have been fixing all the
applications along the way. Many developers were involved.

<blockquote>
<pre>There is an innovative and substantial difference in our approach compared
to how Linux is doing it:
- On <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>, <abbr title="Indirect Branch Tracking">IBT</abbr>/<abbr title="Branch Target Identification">BTI</abbr> enforcement is on by default (meaning mandatory),
unless a binary is linked to request opt-out (using -Wl,-z,<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ld.1#nobtcfi">nobtcfi</a>). After all
our fixes, very few application binaries need that, and that count is expected
to shrink quickly as we (or upstreams) fix the outstanding issues.
- On Linux they are rehashing the same design as their executable-stack mechanism:
if a single .o file in a resulting binary isn't marked as <abbr title="Indirect Branch Tracking">IBT</abbr>/<abbr title="Branch Target Identification">BTI</abbr> enforcement,
the system will (silently) execute the program without enforcement and noone
knows this is happening.  So for an issue from around 2001, today Linux binaries
with executable stack exist and work unsafely.  I expect that 20 years from
now Linux binaries without <abbr title="Indirect Branch Tracking">IBT</abbr>/<abbr title="Branch Target Identification">BTI</abbr> enforcement will also exist and work unsafely..</pre>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>Today, we’re thrilled to share our v1.0 goals with <a href="https://polar.sh/?ref=blog.polar.sh">Polar</a> and announce our $1.8M pre-seed round to help us pursue our mission of expanding the open source economy.</p><p>Open source is the greatest lever ever for human innovation. Powering all of the products and services that we use and love on a daily basis. Accelerating our ability and velocity to build towards an even better future. Doing it all in the open to push the boundaries of our craft and make knowledge and opportunities accessible to all.</p><p>It’s magical. Yet, funding means to strengthen this lever is outdated: Causing unnecessary tension for all parties involved and holding the ecosystem back from its full potential.</p><p><strong>It’s time to move beyond sponsorship &amp; donations</strong></p><p>These models standalone made sense last century when software emerged as a nascent industry built by passionate hobbyists for themselves and their peers. Since then, however, software has “eaten the world”. Dramatically increasing the adoption, usage and reliance on open source from individuals, startups to Fortune 500s.</p><p>As a result, questions, bug reports and feature requests are no longer rare and from curious peers. It’s now a constant stream creating an endless backlog of inbound issues. For maintainers, it quickly goes from a hobby to a stressful and unpaid side gig. Turning to sponsorship for support since it’s accessible, but getting little to no return. This dynamic of a growing workload with dwindling support is leading to initiatives being abandoned or worse, maintainer burnout.</p><p>In order to get meaningful capital, businesses need to invest. They won’t with the current model. Getting them – and most individuals too – to deploy capital at scale requires a narrative around additional and measurable value in return. Sponsorship offers neither: Emphasizing value given vs. ahead.</p><p>Yet, demand is clearly growing significantly for support, issues to be fixed and specific features to be built – all tangible, additional and measurable needs. The problem is we can’t leverage it with current models and workflows redirect it toward fueling the fires:</p><ol><li>More issues. <em>Amplifying maintainer pressure and tensions.</em></li><li>Private forks. <em>Lost opportunities,</em> <em>massively inefficient and a hidden business expense.</em></li></ol><p>It’s a lose-lose. It’s time to fix it.</p><p><strong>Polar v0.1: Converting issues to a funded backlog</strong></p><figure><img src="https://blog.polar.sh/content/images/2023/07/image.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1200" srcset="https://blog.polar.sh/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/image.png 600w, https://blog.polar.sh/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/image.png 1000w, https://blog.polar.sh/content/images/size/w1600/2023/07/image.png 1600w, https://blog.polar.sh/content/images/2023/07/image.png 2104w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Today, Polar offers users the ability to seamlessly pledge behind impactful efforts and maintainers to go beyond chronologically sorted issues to a funded and stack ranked backlog.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7pHLDEnCKm4-LKmlg9DmcUe6LuE5Mii2nkUTSVpomcC0bZ_fPoLslxjG1HZD1Cas1mZWz4boy0ai9i3eTAREgSEUWI3325DZYUiElbgZFESHtvFkdUBae3HgZuQL59-HwKySCOXnoA8MCXh8J3pa1pg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="624" height="332"></figure><p>Our product is designed to empower maintainers with better insights on what their users want, seek to fund and progress in flight across their community of contributors. All available through our dashboard or directly on GitHub using our Chrome Extension.</p><p>Once funded issues are marked completed, maintainers receive 90% of the capital pledged (our commission is 10%). Of course, in case such efforts were achieved together with contributors, maintainers can soon seamlessly split the rewards. Or leverage the capital for community merchandise or meetups to re-investing it behind their own issue dependencies. <br></p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Y8ewxSfPHvHgRM3Z3sHdiUZm6obQdedApQWY570856mf8WbJ15eHRYPerREW2T2dndbsGZBZaVbaaDVYIVWj_anCJGxh_WnqIeH8MT_492c2dU7KO7hTzL1eCHA9cnBBBkISNka4HyzmdPu5RADaJoI" alt="" loading="lazy" width="624" height="565"></figure><p>What’s issue dependencies? Whether you’re a maintainer, user or business, Polar offers the ability to easily track all the specific open source issues your own initiatives depend on. By identifying static references to them across internal issues and bringing them to life through our dashboard.</p><p>Offering a helicopter view of the state and progress of such dependencies. Making it easy to keep track, plan ahead and seamlessly pledge behind those impactful efforts to support their progress and thereby your own.</p><p>We’re just getting started.</p><p><strong>Polar v.1.0: Empowering maintainers to become entrepreneurs</strong></p><p>Our goal is to build a platform for open source maintainers to seamlessly set up, operate and scale value-add services and subscriptions to their backers – individuals and businesses alike.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.polar.sh/content/images/2023/07/Frame-755.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1397" srcset="https://blog.polar.sh/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/Frame-755.jpg 600w, https://blog.polar.sh/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/Frame-755.jpg 1000w, https://blog.polar.sh/content/images/size/w1600/2023/07/Frame-755.jpg 1600w, https://blog.polar.sh/content/images/size/w2400/2023/07/Frame-755.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> This is a sketch and not a final version of our v1.0 design. </em></p><p>Crafting on-demand and tiered subscription services tailored to suit their initiative, community and their users’ needs. From a suite of offerings such as:</p><ul><li><strong>Prioritized issues.</strong> What Polar is today with more to come.</li><li><strong>Backer management &amp; communication.</strong> Automated and streamlined promotions, i.e tiered logos on README/Sites, newsletters, polls etc.</li><li><strong>Premium support.</strong> Questions, implementation guidance to consultation scheduling etc.</li><li><strong>Premium access</strong>. Educational material, roadmap voting, early or private access to repositories and packages and more.</li><li><strong>Custom.</strong> We’ll have a Polar API to enable unlimited creativity for other services you might want to build across your domains and other platforms.</li></ul><p>All available in a dashboard designed to make managing these services a delightful experience. In combination with insights and marketing tools to help grow them over time. </p><p>Of course, this model is not new. Be it through dual-licensing, sponsorware or hosting in combination with professional support, it’s what defines commercial open source software (COSS) &amp; SaaS. That’s great since such examples showcase the success and opportunities of the model. However, creating and maintaining a growing open source initiative in combination with building the infrastructure behind these services on top is a significant investment. So it’s not surprising that it’s almost exclusively deployed by open source companies with funding.</p><p>It’s time to change that. Equipping maintainers across the entire ecosystem with the infrastructure to leverage the same model with ease. In order to create an organic pathway toward independent open source entrepreneurship at scale. </p><p>That’s what we’re building towards. </p><p><br><strong>Shape Polar v1.0 with us – built in public &amp; open source</strong></p><p>We’re excited to be building Polar in public and open source (<a href="https://github.com/polarsource/polar?ref=blog.polar.sh">GitHub</a>). Join our <a href="https://discord.gg/STfRufb32V?ref=blog.polar.sh">Discord</a> to discuss ideas, early design proposals and upcoming features. We’d love your input and feedback: Let’s shape the future of Polar and the open source economy, together!</p><p><strong>Thank you to our backers</strong></p><p>We’re also thrilled to announce our $1.8M pre-seed to help us pursue this mission. From world-class early stage funds like Mischief &amp; Abstract to some incredible angels like David Cramer, Tristan Handy, Gustaf Alströmer, Carl Rivera, Siavash Ghorbani, Kaj Drobin, Andrea Wang, Fredrik Björk, Joel Hellermark, Sri Batchu and a few more incoming. Thank you for believing in this mission and vision from Day 0 and making this possible!</p><p>Let’s build.</p><p><em>PS. We’ll use Polar ourselves for our open source repository at Polar. However, given that we have funding, we will pledge anything we receive from Polar to our open source dependencies and others.</em><br></p>

<p>India has successfully launched its latest mission to the moon, Chandrayaan-3. The spacecraft is designed to explore the south pole of the moon, which has water reserves that could help make a permanent lunar base possible.</p>
<p>The Indian Space Research Organisation’s Chandrayaan-3, which takes its name from the Sanskrit word for “mooncraft”, took off onboard a Launch Vehicle Mark-III rocket from the southern state of Andhra Pradesh at 2:35pm, local time, on 14 July.</p>
<p>The preceding Chandrayaan-2 mission ended in failure in 2019 when a software glitch caused the lander to <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2225704-nasa-has-found-the-remnants-of-indias-vikram-moon-lander/">crash into the surface of the moon</a>. The Vikram lander carried on that mission was meant to deploy a six-wheeled rover named Pragyan that would have explored the <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/definition/the-moon/">moon’s</a> south pole, but both were destroyed on impact.</p>
<p>The earlier Chandrayaan-1 mission consisted of a lunar orbiter and a probe designed to deliberately hit the moon at speed, again targeting the south pole. That mission was a success and made India the fourth nation on Earth to leave its flag on the moon.</p>
<p>To date, only the US, the USSR and China have successfully landed lunar missions intact. A private attempt by a Japanese start-up in April <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2370784-japanese-hakuto-r-spacecraft-seems-to-have-crash-landed-on-the-moon/">ended unsuccessfully</a> when it, too, crashed into the surface at speed.</p>

    
<p>Chandrayaan-3 will be a repeat of the Chandrayaan-2 mission, but <span></span> this time there will be no orbiter, with the lander and contained rover instead handling their own communications with Earth without the need for an intermediary satellite. The mission will arrive at the moon on 23 or 24 August, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-66185565">according to officials</a>. The lander will then detach and drop out of orbit towards the moon’s surface. Once released, the rover is expected to last just two weeks in the harsh lunar environment.</p>
<p>The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, <a href="https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/1679728845149052930">said on Twitter</a>: “4th July 2023 will always be etched in golden letters as far as India’s space sector is concerned… This remarkable mission will carry the hopes and dreams of our nation.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  
<p><em>This post is part of a short series about my experience in the VP of Engineering role at Honeycomb.</em></p>


<p>In February of 2020, I was promoted from Director of Engineering to Honeycomb’s first VP of Engineering. Although Charity wrote an extremely generous public <a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/honeycomb-welcomes-new-vp-engineering-why-its-so-important-to-look-inside-your-org-before-you-look-outside/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement</a>, I hesitated to talk about this new role for quite a while as I was figuring out the job. But since 2020, I’ve noticed how little candid writing there is about paths to the VPE role or what the job is really like.*&nbsp;</p>


<p>I understand why: the stakes for public comment become higher as you move up the ladder, every social media post has the potential to be interpreted as a subtweet or request, and your highest-priority work is often deeply entangled with confidential company and personnel matters.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Nonetheless, I think it’s useful to share what I can about my experience in the hope that it might encourage others to seriously consider this role, especially those from backgrounds, identities, and genders poorly represented in the VP of Engineering ranks today. VPs of Engineering often have a lot of influence over both company culture and policy, and the decisions our companies make ripple outside of the companies themselves. The whole tech industry would benefit from more perspectives in this role.</p>


<h2 id="h-not-the-plan">Not the plan</h2>


<p>I didn’t join Honeycomb with the goal of becoming an engineering executive. I joined to be an engineer (employee ~12), with the understanding that I might go back to a management role when there was a need.&nbsp;</p>


<p>I had enough experience at early-stage startups to know that, if the company is successful, you’ll probably do a whole host of things as the company moves through different phases. Being attached to a particular job was more likely to be a hindrance than a help to either my success or the company’s. I was curious about moving up the engineering management ladder eventually, but I assumed a VP opportunity would be out of reach for a long time, if ever.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Instead, I joined Honeycomb because the team seemed incredibly smart and kind, I thought I would learn a lot, and the product seemed like something I’d wanted at past jobs but could never find. Happily, all these things turned out to be true and are still true to this day.&nbsp;</p>


<p>If you hope to grow into a specific role sooner rather than later, I suspect joining a startup at a later stage (series B+) might be the most efficient route. Nonetheless, I loved joining Honeycomb at series A, even though it has meant working through some of the wandering-in-the-desert phases of the company. (I’ll save writing about those for my post-IPO Honeycomb screenplay.)</p>


<h2 id="h-the-path">The path</h2>


<p>In the early days of the company, co-founder and then-CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charity Majors</a> managed basically everyone, from execs to individual engineers. In what was mostly a happy accident, Charity and I turned out to be philosophically aligned on most things management, and I have long admired how her insights <a href="https://charity.wtf/2016/06/30/devops-vs-sre-delayed-coverage-of-the-dumbest-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shape</a> <a href="https://charity.wtf/2019/01/04/engineering-management-the-pendulum-or-the-ladder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSIPhVjWBO0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conversations</a> in our industry. However, we have fairly different backgrounds and skill sets. While Charity has deep experience in the domains of infrastructure &amp; operations, databases, and backend engineering, I come originally from design, frontend, and product engineering, and I take a particular joy in collaborating with product management and ux design.&nbsp;</p>


<p>We share a lot of experience with metrics and monitoring technologies, although she kind of despises them and I feel a profound affection for them. I’m also a rules and process person — my daily work and even my hobbies often revolve around planning things and managing risk — whereas Charity has a more intuitive, spontaneous style, often shines brightest in a crisis, is allergic to checklists, and is quick to spot when things aren’t working, including when a particular rule or process isn’t serving us.</p>


<p>As Honeycomb grew and the management workload within R&amp;D increased, I was able to load-balance more and more management work with Charity, usually picking up areas where the work matched my background better than hers. I wish I could call out specific milestones on the path, but the truth is it was done in a thousand small steps. A few title changes along the way were useful backward-looking markers of progress, but they didn’t often denote major changes in scope beyond (usually) new meetings to attend.</p>


<p>If a startup is growing, there are always new gaps in processes &amp; responsibilities opening up, quickly going from tiny pinpricks in the dam to major leaks of time &amp; attention. There are <em>always</em> new problems to level up on, if you’re willing to lend a hand with whatever comes up. But to give credit where it’s due: it’s natural for startup founders to look for ways to get <em>more</em> out of their team, and yet it doesn’t seem to be as natural to recognize successes by granting new titles and roles. I have seen both of Honeycomb’s co-founders support this enthusiastically, both for me and for others at Honeycomb, and it is a rare and lovely thing. If I went looking for another startup to join at some point in the future, I would specifically look for an exec team or founding team that could cite examples of building up high performers for internal promotions — and swiftly recognizing and rewarding those already having impact outside of their role-defined scope.</p>


<p>In retrospect, the most interesting transition along the whole journey for me was probably moving from managing only ICs to also managing managers. I’ll write more about this another day, but I would encourage anyone hoping to make this leap to do it at a company where they already know the team, technology, and business problems, rather than moving to a new company to try it out.&nbsp;</p>


<p>While many of the line management skills I already had translated over, it nonetheless took me quite a while to learn how to effectively “see” the whole organization (and especially where there was friction or where we might need more support) through an additional layer of management. My prior first-hand experience with the people and problems in engineering tided me over until I could work with my managers to build the practices and skills to assess what was happening on my teams effectively.</p>


<p>As Charity mentioned in her blog post, at a slightly rocky point in the company trajectory, we did also explore hiring a VP of Engineering from outside the company. I was grateful that Charity was upfront with me about considering this, and that she invited me into the process of finding and selecting the right person.&nbsp;</p>


<p>We talked to a handful of extraordinary engineering leaders, some who didn’t feel like quite the right fit for where we were at, and some who decided we weren’t the right next step in their journey. And then one day we realized we had a fresh new batch of problems to think about, and the old problems that seemed intractable had become… more tractable. I didn’t get promoted right then (it wasn’t the right time) but we also stopped looking for an external hire.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Nonetheless, I think we were all glad we went through this process. Above a certain level, leadership promotions have to be about what the company needs, not the individual, and it was valuable to imagine together what a great VP of Engineering for Honeycomb might look like.</p>


<h2 id="h-how-to-prepare">How to prepare</h2>


<p>While I didn’t see myself on the path to VP when I joined Honeycomb, in hindsight I can see some traits that helped me become a fit for the role:</p>


<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Holistic thinking.</strong> My focus naturally tends toward how to make Honeycomb the company more successful, not just my teams. I thrive where I am rewarded for acting in the best interests of the whole company, not my department, team, or self. (This is more often the case at startups than at <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/this-org-chart-explains-why-microsofts-ceo-in-waiting-is-suddenly-out-2012-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">large companies</a>&nbsp; and part of why I gravitate toward early stage businesses.)</li>


<li><strong>A generalist streak</strong>. I find basically all business problems and domains within a software company interesting, and I have always loved that startups let you see how all the pieces fit together. I also don’t mind taking on unglamorous work outside of the spotlight when needed.</li>


<li><strong>Happiness at varying levels of abstraction</strong>. I can work at many layers of abstraction and can quickly pick up concepts of a higher-level layer without needing to grok the layers below — but I also enjoy getting into the weeds when it makes sense.</li>


<li><strong>An overgrown sense of responsibility</strong>. I have a bad habit of walking into a room with five problems and walking out owning six. This is helpful at a startup where lots of important work falls into gaps between functions. However, it needs to be counterbalanced with a constant effort to wrap up or hand off jobs to others to avoid getting bogged down or stifling the growth of the rest of the team.</li>


<li><strong>A knack for systems thinking, paired with equal interest in both human &amp; technological systems</strong>. I believe this is a super common and normal thing but have had at least one great coach insist that it is not, so I’m putting it on the list.&nbsp;</li>


<li><strong>A genuine joy in seeing teammates level up</strong>. As a manager, nothing brings me more energy than finding a match between a person ready to take their next step and an important problem at the edge of their abilities that needs to be solved — and then building the plan to help them do it.</li>


<li><strong>Good relationships up, down, and sideways</strong>. People all around the company had to be more excited to have me in the job than to roll the dice on an external candidate.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>


<p>These work experiences also helped me out:</p>


<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Working at other startups of a variety of stages and sizes, especially B2B SaaS startups</strong>. B2C and B2B startups often deal with relatively distinct categories of problems and have each cultivated their own techniques for solving them. It’s good to see both sides at some point. However, there’s a lot of value in specializing in either B2B or B2C. The go-to-market motions, org structures, engineering problems, and scaling challenges you’ll see at a B2B company often will differ from what is popular in the B2C world; it’s useful to know the common patterns for the type of company you’re at.&nbsp;</li>


<li><strong>Working across the stack</strong>. While my engineering experience is deepest in frontend technologies, I am very grateful to have built early experience in a number of shops that did pair programming and brought a DevOps mindset to their work. I was able to learn from great backend, infrastructure, platform, and ops engineers and get a sense for both how they thought and what problems were important to them. (It delights me that two of the engineers who taught me the most, Eric Saxby and Blake Irvin, are now regular Honeycomb users who I bump into sometimes in our community Slack.) While you don’t need to be an expert in every area of engineering to be an engineering executive, a little empathy and high-level domain understanding across all your teams goes a long way.</li>


<li><strong>Having experience in the dev tools and monitoring space; being a tools nerd</strong>. I’ve worked for three dev tools companies in a row, and I have a hard time imagining doing something else. I genuinely love the Honeycomb product and feel great affection for many other products in the observability, monitoring, and dev tools space. My knowledge of our domain and enthusiasm for these tools can be useful to my colleagues and be a source of energy when we otherwise might get discouraged.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="h-an-element-of-luck-and-a-great-team">An element of luck and a great team</h2>


<p>Despite the long preceding section about how to prepare for this role, there was a lot of luck involved in being the right person for this role at the right time.</p>


<p>I’ve talked about how Charity’s complementary skills and experience were part of what made me a fit for this role, but that’s not the whole picture. I was also able to take on the job because we had a deeply experienced team of early senior ICs who had key engineering challenges more than handled, especially Ben Hartshorne and Ian Wilkes.&nbsp;</p>


<p>VPs of Engineering from frontend backgrounds are relatively rare, and it’s partly because the most pressing technical challenges a startup faces are often around scaling, reliability, and backend architecture. If we had been dealing with nonstop incidents, constant struggles with scaling, and major architectural challenges with our query and storage engine, someone with deeper backend and operational experience likely would have been chosen for the job, not me.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Because of Ben, Ian, and other incredibly talented ICs on our team, and some of the solid design decisions the founding team made that bought us a lot of technical runway, these concerns were not top of mind for our leaders. Goals like executing well against our product strategy and leveling up our user experience were instead the concerns of the day, and there I could be more helpful.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Our executive team also already had some accomplished, seasoned external hires within our go&nbsp; to market functions. Even the execs you might describe as company-grown leaders (Christine and Charity) already had founder or leadership experience from prior companies, and Charity was well-known as a talented manager long before starting Honeycomb. If the exec team had tilted more heavily toward new execs or those promoted from within, there might not have been space to grow one more exec into their role, which takes both months of runway and patience from other leaders on the team. I’m very lucky to have had such a strong crew of exec peers who generously shared their wisdom with me as I stepped into the role and extended some grace as I figured it out.</p>


<h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>


<p>The most important thing I learned in hindsight is that the right VP of Engineering for a company is <em>contextual</em>. Before Honeycomb, I would have thought I could list off a set of canonical traits that make a great VP of Engineering. Sure, some roles might call for a larger helping of one strength or another, but I thought the basic template would be unchanged from company to company. This is much less true than I first thought.</p>


<p>Generally, the same basic things need to get done in most software companies, but the shape of the executive needed to guide those things can change dramatically depending on the current set of problems for the organization and who is already there, whether exec, manager, or IC. And once you’re in the job, the requirements also don’t stay static, especially in a growing company. The role may morph and shift over time just as other startup roles do.</p>

  <p>Anyone who built software for a while knows that estimating how long something is going to take is <em>hard</em>.
It's hard to come up with an unbiased estimate of how long something will take, when fundamentally the work in itself is about <em>solving</em> something.
One pet theory I've had for a really long time, is that some of this is really just a statistical artifact.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I suspect devs are actually decent at estimating the *median* time to complete a task. Planning is hard because they suck at the *average*.</p>— Erik Bernhardsson (@bernhardsson) <a href="https://twitter.com/bernhardsson/status/862791164759617536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2017</a></blockquote>


<p>Let's say you estimate a project to take 1 week. Let's say there are three equally likely outcomes: either it takes 1/2 week, or 1 week, or 2 weeks. The <em>median</em> outcome is actually the same as the estimate: 1 week, but the <em>mean</em> (aka <em>average</em>, aka <em>expected value</em>) is 7/6 = 1.17 weeks. The estimate is actually calibrated (unbiased) for the median (which is 1), but not for the the mean.</p>
<p>A reasonable model for the “blowup factor” (actual time divided by estimated time) would be something like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution">log-normal distribution</a>. If the estimate is one week, then let's model the real outcome as a random variable distributed according to the log-normal distribution around one week. This has the property that the median of the distribution is exactly one week, but the mean is much larger:</p>
<p><img src="https://erikbern.com/assets/software-estimation/log_normal.png" alt="log normal"></p>
<p>If we take the logarithm of the blowup factor, we end up with a plain old normal distribution centered around 0. This assumes the median blowup factor is 1x, and as you hopefully remember, log(1) = 0. However, different tasks may have different uncertainties around 0. We can model this by varying the σ parameter which corresponds to the standard deviation of the normal distribution:</p>
<p><img src="https://erikbern.com/assets/software-estimation/normal.png" alt="normal"></p>
<p>Just to put some numbers on this: when log(actual / estimated) = 1 then the blowup factor is exp(1) = e = 2.72. It's equally likely that a project blows up by a factor of exp(2) = 7.4 as it is that it completes in exp(-2) = 0.14 i.e. completes in 14% of the estimated time. Intuitively the reason the mean is so large is that tasks that complete faster than estimated have no way to compensate for the tasks that take much longer than estimated. We're bounded by 0, but unbounded in the other direction.</p>
<p>Is this just a model? You bet! But I'll get to real data shortly and show that this in fact maps to reality reasonably well using some empirical data.</p>

<p>So far so good, but let's really try to understand what this means in terms of software estimation. Let's say we look at the roadmap and it consists of 20 different software projects and we're trying to estimate: how long is it going to take to complete <em>all of them</em>.</p>
<p>Here's where the the mean becomes crucial. Means add, but medians do not. So if we want to get an idea of how long it will take to complete the sum of n projects, we need to look at the mean. Let's say we have three different projects in the pipeline with the exact same σ = 1:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Median</th>
<th>Mean</th>
<th>99%</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Task A</td>
<td>1.00</td>
<td>1.65</td>
<td>10.24</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Task B</td>
<td>1.00</td>
<td>1.65</td>
<td>10.24</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Task C</td>
<td>1.00</td>
<td>1.65</td>
<td>10.24</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SUM</td>
<td>3.98</td>
<td>4.95</td>
<td>18.85</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Note that the means add up and 4.95 = 1.65*3, but the other columns don't.</p>
<p>Now, let's add up three projects with different sigmas:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Median</th>
<th>Mean</th>
<th>99%</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Task A (σ = 0.5)</td>
<td>1.00</td>
<td>1.13</td>
<td>3.20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Task B (σ = 1)</td>
<td>1.00</td>
<td>1.65</td>
<td>10.24</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Task C (σ = 2)</td>
<td>1.00</td>
<td>7.39</td>
<td>104.87</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SUM</td>
<td>4.00</td>
<td>10.18</td>
<td>107.99</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The means still add up, but are nowhere near the naïve 3 week estimate you might come up with. Note that the high-uncertainty project with σ=2 basically ends up <em>dominating</em> the mean time to completion. For the 99% percentile, it doesn't just dominate it, it basically absorbs all the other ones. We can do a bigger example:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Median</th>
<th>Mean</th>
<th>99%</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Task A (σ = 0.5)</td>
<td>1.00</td>
<td>1.13</td>
<td>3.20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Task B (σ = 0.5)</td>
<td>1.00</td>
<td>1.13</td>
<td>3.20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Task C (σ = 0.5)</td>
<td>1.00</td>
<td>1.13</td>
<td>3.20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Task D (σ = 1)</td>
<td>1.00</td>
<td>1.65</td>
<td>10.24</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Task E (σ = 1)</td>
<td>1.00</td>
<td>1.65</td>
<td>10.24</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Task F (σ = 1)</td>
<td>1.00</td>
<td>1.65</td>
<td>10.24</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Task G (σ = 2)</td>
<td>1.00</td>
<td>7.39</td>
<td>104.87</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SUM</td>
<td>9.74</td>
<td>15.71</td>
<td>112.65</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Again, one single misbehaving task basically ends up dominating the calculation, at least for the 99% case. Even for mean though, the one freak project ends up taking over roughly half the time spend on these tasks, despite all of these tasks having a similar median time to completion. To make it simple, I assumed that all tasks have the same estimated size, but different uncertainties. The same math applies if we vary the size as well.</p>
<p>Funny thing is I've had this gut feeling for a while. Adding up estimates rarely work when you end up with more than a few tasks. Instead, figure out which tasks have the highest uncertainty – those tasks are basically going to dominate the mean time to completion.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have two methods for estimating project size:<br>(a) break things down into subprojects, estimate them, add it up<br>(b) gut feeling estimate based on how nervous i feel about unexpected risks<br>So far (b) is vastly more accurate for any project more than a few weeks</p>— Erik Bernhardsson (@bernhardsson) <a href="https://twitter.com/bernhardsson/status/1103871565685391360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 8, 2019</a></blockquote>


<p>A chart summarizes the mean and 99th percentile as a function of the uncertainty (σ):</p>
<p><img src="https://erikbern.com/assets/software-estimation/sigmas.png" alt="sigmas"></p>
<p>There is math to this now! I've started appreciating this during project planning: I truly think that adding up task estimates is a really misleading picture of how long something will take, because you have these crazy skewed tasks that will end up taking over.</p>
<h2 id="wheres-the-empirical-data">Where's the empirical data?</h2>
<p>I filed this in my brain under “curious toy models” for a long time, occasionally thinking that it's a neat illustration of a real world phenomenon I've observed. But surfing around on the interwebs one day, I encountered an interesting dataset of <a href="https://github.com/Derek-Jones/SiP_dataset">project estimation and actual times</a>. Fantastic!</p>
<p>Let's do a quick scatter plot of estimated vs actual time to completion:</p>
<p><img src="https://erikbern.com/assets/software-estimation/scatter.png" alt="scatter"></p>
<p>The median blowup factor turns out to be <em>exactly</em> 1x for this dataset, whereas the mean blowup factor is 1.81x. Again, this confirms the hunch that developers estimate the <em>median</em> well, but the mean ends up being much higher.</p>
<p>Let's look at the distribution of the blowup factor. We're going to look at the logarithm of it:</p>
<p><img src="https://erikbern.com/assets/software-estimation/distribution.png" alt="distribution"></p>
<p>You can see that it's pretty well centered around 0, where the blowup factor is exp(0) = 1.</p>

<p>I'm going to get a bit fancy with statistics now – feel free to skip if it's not your cup of tea. What can we infer from this empirical distribution? You might expect that the logarithms of the blowup factor would distribute according to a normal distribution, but that's not quite true.
Note that the σs are themselves random and vary for each project.</p>
<p>One convenient way to model the σs is that they are sampled from an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-gamma_distribution">inverse Gamma distribution</a>. If we assume (like previously) that the log of the blowup factors are distributed according to a normal distribution, then the “global” distribution of the logs of blowup factors ends up being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution">Student's t-distribution</a>.</p>
<p>Let's fit a Student's t-distribution to the distribution above:</p>
<p><img src="https://erikbern.com/assets/software-estimation/distribution_plus_t.png" alt="distribution"></p>
<p>Decent fit, in my opinion! The parameters of the t-distribution also define the inverse Gamma distribution of the σ values:</p>
<p><img src="https://erikbern.com/assets/software-estimation/sigma_distribution.png" alt="sigma distribution"></p>
<p>Note that values like σ &gt; 4 are incredibly unlikely, but when they happen, they cause a mean blowup of several thousand times.</p>
<h2 id="why-software-tasks-always-take-longer-than-you-think">Why software tasks always take longer than you think</h2>
<p>Assuming this dataset is representative of software development (questionable!), we can infer some more numbers. We have the parameters for the t-distribution, so we can compute the mean time it takes to complete a task, without knowing the σ for that task is.</p>
<p>While the median blowup factor imputed from this fit is 1x (as before), the 99% percentile blowup factor is 32x, but if you go to 99.99% percentile, it's a whopping 55 <em>million</em>! One (hand wavy) interpretation is that some tasks end up being essentially impossible to do. In fact, these extreme edge cases have such an outsize impact on the <em>mean</em>, that the mean blowup factor of <em>any task</em> ends up being <em>infinite</em>. This is pretty bad news for people trying to hit deadlines!</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>If my model is right (a big <em>if</em>) then here's what we can learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>People estimate the <em>median</em> completion time well, but not the mean.</li>
<li>The mean turns out to be substantially worse than the median, due to the distribution being skewed (log-normally).</li>
<li>When you add up the estimates for n tasks, things get even worse.</li>
<li>Tasks with the most uncertainty (rather the biggest size) can often dominate the mean time it takes to complete all tasks.</li>
<li>The mean time to complete a task we know nothing about is actually <em>infinite</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>This is obviously just based on one dataset I found online. Other datasets may give different results.</li>
<li>My model is of course also highly subjective, like any statistical model.</li>
<li>I would ❤️  to apply the model to a much larger data set to see how well it holds up.</li>
<li>I assumed all tasks independent. In reality they might have a correlation which would make the analysis a lot more annoying but (I think) ultimately with similar conclusions.</li>
<li>The sum of log-normally distributed value is not another log-normally distributed value. This is a weakness with that distribution, since you could argue most tasks is really just a sum of sub-tasks and it would be nice if our distribution was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_distribution">stable</a> like that.</li>
<li>I removed small tasks (estimated time less than or equal to 7 hours) from the histogram since small tasks skew the analysis and there there was an odd spike at exactly 7.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/erikbern/software-estimation">code is on my Github</a>, as usual.</li>
<li>There's some discussion <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19671673">on Hacker News</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/bdrmm6/why_software_projects_take_longer_than_you_think/">on Reddit</a>.</li>

<p>This article is about Intuitionism in mathematics and philosophical logic. For the term in moral epistemology, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_intuitionism" title="Ethical intuitionism">Ethical intuitionism</a>.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics" title="Philosophy of mathematics">philosophy of mathematics</a>, <b>intuitionism</b>, or <b>neointuitionism</b> (opposed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preintuitionism" title="Preintuitionism">preintuitionism</a>), is an approach where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a> is considered to be purely the result of the constructive mental activity of humans rather than the discovery of fundamental principles claimed to exist in an objective reality. That is, logic and mathematics are not considered analytic activities wherein deep properties of objective reality are revealed and applied, but are instead considered the application of internally consistent methods used to realize more complex mental constructs, regardless of their possible independent existence in an objective reality.

<h2><span id="Truth_and_proof">Truth and proof</span><span><span>[</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intuitionism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1" title="Edit section: Truth and proof">edit</a><span>]</span></span></h2>
<p>The fundamental distinguishing characteristic of intuitionism is its interpretation of what it means for a mathematical statement to be true. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luitzen_Egbertus_Jan_Brouwer" title="Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer">Brouwer's</a> original intuitionism, the truth of a mathematical statement is a subjective claim: a mathematical statement corresponds to a mental construction, and a mathematician can assert the truth of a statement only by verifying the validity of that construction by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_intuition" title="Logical intuition">intuition</a>. The vagueness of the intuitionistic notion of truth often leads to misinterpretations about its meaning. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Cole_Kleene" title="Stephen Cole Kleene">Kleene</a> formally defined intuitionistic truth from a realist position, yet Brouwer would likely reject this formalization as meaningless, given his rejection of the realist/Platonist position. Intuitionistic truth therefore remains somewhat ill-defined. However, because the intuitionistic notion of truth is more restrictive than that of classical mathematics, the intuitionist must reject some assumptions of classical logic to ensure that everything they prove is in fact intuitionistically true. This gives rise to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionistic_logic" title="Intuitionistic logic">intuitionistic logic</a>.
</p><p>To an intuitionist, the claim that an object with certain properties exists is a claim that an object with those properties can be constructed. Any mathematical object is considered to be a product of a construction of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind" title="Mind">mind</a>, and therefore, the existence of an object is equivalent to the possibility of its construction. This contrasts with the classical approach, which states that the existence of an entity can be proved by refuting its non-existence. For the intuitionist, this is not valid; the refutation of the non-existence does not mean that it is possible to find a construction for the putative object, as is required in order to assert its existence. As such, intuitionism is a variety of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_constructivism" title="Mathematical constructivism">mathematical constructivism</a>; but it is not the only kind.
</p><p>The interpretation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negation" title="Negation">negation</a> is different in intuitionist logic than in classical logic. In classical logic, the negation of a statement asserts that the statement is <i>false</i>; to an intuitionist, it means the statement is <i>refutable</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>
There is thus an asymmetry between a positive and negative statement in intuitionism. If a statement <i>P</i> is provable, then <i>P</i> certainly cannot be refutable. But even if it can be shown that <i>P</i> cannot be refuted, this does not constitute a proof of <i>P</i>. Thus <i>P</i> is a stronger statement than <i>not-not-P</i>.
</p><p>Similarly, to assert that <i>A</i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction" title="Logical disjunction">or</a> <i>B</i> holds, to an intuitionist, is to claim that either <i>A</i> or <i>B</i> can be <i>proved</i>. In particular, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_excluded_middle" title="Law of excluded middle">law of excluded middle</a>, "<i>A</i> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negation" title="Negation">not</a> <i>A</i>", is not accepted as a valid principle.  For example, if <i>A</i> is some mathematical statement that an intuitionist has not yet proved or disproved, then that intuitionist will not assert the truth of "<i>A</i> or not <i>A</i>". However, the intuitionist will accept that "<i>A</i> and not <i>A</i>" cannot be true. Thus the connectives "and" and "or" of intuitionistic logic do not satisfy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws" title="De Morgan's laws">de Morgan's laws</a> as they do in classical logic.
</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionistic_logic" title="Intuitionistic logic">Intuitionistic logic</a> substitutes constructability for abstract <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth" title="Truth">truth</a> and is associated with a transition from the proof of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_theory" title="Model theory">model theory</a> to abstract <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth#Truth_in_mathematics" title="Truth">truth in modern mathematics</a>. The logical calculus preserves justification, rather than truth, across transformations yielding derived propositions. It has been taken as giving philosophical support to several schools of philosophy, most notably the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-realism" title="Anti-realism">Anti-realism</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dummett" title="Michael Dummett">Michael Dummett</a>. Thus, contrary to the first impression its name might convey, and as realized in specific approaches and disciplines (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_set" title="Fuzzy set">Fuzzy Sets</a> and Systems), intuitionist mathematics is more rigorous than conventionally founded mathematics, where, ironically, the foundational elements which Intuitionism attempts to construct/refute/refound are taken as intuitively given.

<h2><span id="Infinity">Infinity</span><span><span>[</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intuitionism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Infinity">edit</a><span>]</span></span></h2>
<p>Among the different formulations of intuitionism, there are several different positions on the meaning and reality of infinity.
</p><p>The term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_infinity" title="Potential infinity">potential infinity</a> refers to a mathematical procedure in which there is an unending series of steps. After each step has been completed, there is always another step to be performed. For example, consider the process of counting: <span>1, 2, 3, ...</span>
</p><p>The term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actual_infinity" title="Actual infinity">actual infinity</a> refers to a completed mathematical object which contains an infinite number of elements. An example is the set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number" title="Natural number">natural numbers</a>, <span><span><b>N</b></span> = {1, 2, ...}.</span>
</p><p>In Cantor's formulation of set theory, there are many different infinite sets, some of which are larger than others. For example, the set of all real numbers <span><b>R</b></span> is larger than <span><b>N</b></span>, because any procedure that you attempt to use to put the natural numbers into one-to-one correspondence with the real numbers will always fail: there will always be an infinite number of real numbers "left over". Any infinite set that can be placed in one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers is said to be "countable" or "denumerable". Infinite sets larger than this are said to be "uncountable".<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>Cantor's set theory led to the axiomatic system of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory" title="Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory">Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory</a> (ZFC), now the most common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_mathematics" title="Foundations of mathematics">foundation of modern mathematics</a>. Intuitionism was created, in part, as a reaction to Cantor's set theory.
</p><p>Modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_set_theory" title="Constructive set theory">constructive set theory</a> includes the axiom of infinity from ZFC (or a revised version of this axiom) and the set <span><b>N</b></span> of natural numbers. Most modern constructive mathematicians accept the reality of countably infinite sets (however, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Esenin-Volpin" title="Alexander Esenin-Volpin">Alexander Esenin-Volpin</a> for a counter-example).
</p><p>Brouwer rejected the concept of actual infinity, but admitted the idea of potential infinity.
</p>
<dl><dd>"According to Weyl 1946, 'Brouwer made it clear, as I think beyond any doubt, that there is no evidence supporting the belief in the existential character of the totality of all natural numbers ... the sequence of numbers which grows beyond any stage already reached by passing to the next number, is a manifold of possibilities open towards infinity; it remains forever in the status of creation, but is not a closed realm of things existing in themselves. That we blindly converted one into the other is the true source of our difficulties, including the antinomies – a source of more fundamental nature than Russell's vicious circle principle indicated. Brouwer opened our eyes and made us see how far classical mathematics, nourished by a belief in the 'absolute' that transcends all human possibilities of realization, goes beyond such statements as can claim real meaning and truth founded on evidence." (Kleene (1952): <i>Introduction to Metamathematics</i>, p. 48-49)</dd></dl>

<p>Intuitionism's history can be traced to two controversies in nineteenth century mathematics.
</p><p>The first of these was the invention of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfinite_arithmetic" title="Transfinite arithmetic">transfinite arithmetic</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor" title="Georg Cantor">Georg Cantor</a> and its subsequent rejection by a number of prominent mathematicians including most famously his teacher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_Kronecker" title="Leopold Kronecker">Leopold Kronecker</a>—a confirmed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finitism" title="Finitism">finitist</a>.
</p><p>The second of these was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege" title="Gottlob Frege">Gottlob Frege</a>'s effort to reduce all of mathematics to a logical formulation via set theory and its derailing by a youthful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell" title="Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>, the discoverer of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox" title="Russell's paradox">Russell's paradox</a>. Frege had planned a three volume definitive work, but just as the second volume was going to press, Russell sent Frege a letter outlining his paradox, which demonstrated that one of Frege's rules of self-reference was self-contradictory.  In an appendix to the second volume, Frege acknowledged that one of the axioms of his system did in fact lead to Russell's paradox.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>
</p><p>Frege, the story goes, plunged into depression and did not publish the third volume of his work as he had planned. For more see Davis (2000) Chapters 3 and 4: Frege: <i>From Breakthrough to Despair</i> and Cantor: <i>Detour through Infinity.</i> See van Heijenoort for the original works and van Heijenoort's commentary.
</p><p>These controversies are strongly linked as the logical methods used by Cantor in proving his results in transfinite arithmetic are essentially the same as those used by Russell in constructing his paradox. Hence how one chooses to resolve Russell's paradox has direct implications on the status accorded to Cantor's transfinite arithmetic.
</p><p>In the early twentieth century <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luitzen_Egbertus_Jan_Brouwer" title="Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer">L. E. J. Brouwer</a> represented the <i>intuitionist</i> position and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert" title="David Hilbert">David Hilbert</a> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formalism_(mathematics)" title="Formalism (mathematics)">formalist</a> position—see van Heijenoort. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del" title="Kurt Gödel">Kurt Gödel</a> offered opinions referred to as <i>Platonist</i> (see various sources re Gödel). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing" title="Alan Turing">Alan Turing</a> considers:
"non-constructive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_of_logic" title="Systems of logic">systems of logic</a> with which not all the steps in a proof are mechanical, some being intuitive". (Turing 1939, reprinted in Davis 2004, p.&nbsp;210) Later, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Cole_Kleene" title="Stephen Cole Kleene">Stephen Cole Kleene</a> brought forth a more rational consideration of intuitionism in his <i>Introduction to Metamathematics</i> (1952).

We changed. The technology we use every day has changed. And so, our search of the perfect font for higher resolution screens began. The font needed to have sharpness, uniformity, and be great for display type. It was exciting at times, but also intimidating. How do you replace Calibri? How do you find that one true font that can take its place as the rightful default?</p><p id="010f">As we <a rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/microsoft-design/beyond-calibri-finding-the-next-microsoft-365-default-font-5ef83f028be2">shared</a> before, Microsoft commissioned five new fonts: Bierstadt, Grandview, Seaford, Skeena, and Tenorite. It was our hope that one of them would be our next default font for Microsoft 365. All of them were added to the drop-down font picker. From there, as you got a chance to use them, we listened to your impassioned <a href="https://twitter.com/Microsoft/status/1387421384582733827" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">feedback</a> and chose the one that resonated most which was Bierstadt. But as there was a change of guard so too the name. Bierstadt is now known as Aptos.</p></div><div><p id="ed75">Today we begin the final phase of this major change where Aptos will start appearing as the new default font across Word, Outlook, PowerPoint and Excel for hundreds of millions of users. And, over the next few months it will roll out to be the default for all our customers. We can’t wait for Aptos to be readily available since it was crafted to embody the many aspects of the human experience.</p><p id="9eae">The typeface was created by <a href="https://mattesontypographics.com/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Steve Matteson</a>, one of the world’s leading type designers. His previous work includes the development of the original Windows TrueType core fonts and the creation of Segoe. Steve renamed the typeface he designed from Bierstadt to Aptos after his favorite unincorporated town in Santa Cruz, California, whose widely ranging landscape and climate epitomizes the font’s versatility. The fog, beaches, redwood trees, and mountains of Aptos summed up everything that he loved about California. Getting away from digital and evoking the outdoors was akin to getting back to pencil and paper. Drawing letters by hand would play a pivotal role in Steve’s creative process.</p><p id="6faf">He designed the font with a slight humanist touch. He wanted Aptos to have the universal appeal of the late NPR newscaster Carl Kasell and the astute tone of The Late Show host Stephen Colbert. “There’s always that little voice inside of me saying, ‘You know, you gotta try to sneak in a little bit of humanity. You can’t just use rulers and straight edges and French curves (a template used to help draw uniformed curves) to make all these shapes mechanical.’ I did that by adding a little swing to the R and the double stacked g,” he said. Steve wanted the font to be more universal and less mechanical or institutional. Aptos had to induce trust and be engaging to read.</p></div><div><p id="baee">Similar to mid-20th-century Swiss typography, Aptos is a sans serif. Also referred to as Grotesque or Gothic, sans serif often have simple letterforms, even strokes, and they’re easily readable. Aptos, made of varying geometric shapes, is bold, well-defined, directive, and constrained. It articulates many different languages and tones. Stem ends are clean cut. Subtle circular squares within the letters’ contours allow higher legibility, especially at small sizes.</p><p id="ce76">There are different font weights to help set modes and direct the reader’s attention. The new default typeface is professional, and yet relatable. Aptos embodies professionalism, adaptability, subtle flourishes of expression, and more clarity. Now the lowercase l has a distinctive tail, separating it from the capital I. The heads of i’s and j’s are circular dots as opposed to grotesque squares. 6 is single stroked while two piled ellipticals make 8.</p><p id="3498">Steve said the font has an understated personality that couldn’t be “overtly” neutral. There had to be some warmth. “It’s kind of like listening to a GPS voice versus a human voice. People would rather listen to a human than a robot telling you to turn left, that’s my ethos getting put into the design,” Steve said. His process begins with a pencil and sketch pad. All fonts get ideated through scribbling on paper. To him, working strictly on the computer becomes too “ephemeral” and the why behind the ideas becomes easy to forget.</p><p id="a5a1">Drawing letters preserves the handmade craftsmanship of the typeface when it’s finally digitized. “[On the computer] I can refine the details and I draw very quickly on screen, but sometimes there’s nuances that you get on paper that may not occur if you’re clicking, dragging and holding down the shift key. It’s [drawing on paper is] a more physical expression of yourself.” Though as we celebrate Aptos, we still encourage you to go beyond the default.</p></div><div><p id="035d">To all the fans of our other great font contenders, do not fret, all four fonts: Grandview, Seaford, Skeena, and Tenorite are still there. We even have Aptos in there under the Bierstadt name in the drop-down picker for those who just aren’t ready for the font’s new name. Please know that for some of us Beer Town (the English translation of the German word Bierstadt) will forever live in our hearts.</p><p id="e30f">And, just like its predecessors Times New Roman and Arial, Calibri is pre-pinned at the top of the new font menu (web only for now). They are yours to choose. Fonts are personal. We get that. Remember you can always select the font you want to be your default font in settings.</p><p id="2367">Aptos is a part of a broader wave of features coming to Microsoft 365. We’re pushing to make the software more expressive and inclusive. There’s a newly designed font picker experience, along with new themes, colors, and backgrounds. These updates signify our devotion to those who use M365 the same way a mechanic does a toolbox, or an artist does a paint brush.</p><p id="e475">For almost five decades it’s been a great honor to serve you and all of your desktop endeavors. Without you, none of this would’ve been possible.</p><p id="4b4f">We know you will enjoy the new font and we look forward to your feedback.</p><p id="513b">Sincerely,</p><p id="c53b">Microsoft</p></div></div></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <header>

  <p>Between Reddit, twitter, LinkedIn and various Slack communities, I see multiple junior folk looking to break into Data Engineering and asking for advice. Every single day. Many ask for a “roadmap” or some kind of step by step lesson plan that will land them their dream job. I don’t believe that such a roadmap exists.</p>
<h2 id="newbies-are-welcome">Newbies are welcome 👋</h2>
<p>I have seen some say “Data Engineering is not an entry level role” and this is nothing more than toxic gatekeeping. Data Engineering is no more, and no less, complex than any other software discipline. Every discipline is open to newbies. If you want to get into data, you can do it. You don’t <em>need</em> to “graduate” into it from a different discipline.</p>
<p>Moving sideways into Data Engineering is very common, not because it’s necessary, but because Data Engineering is relatively new as a somewhat well-defined job category. Data Engineering teams haven’t been commonplace for long, in fact, there’s many industries still just starting to catch on. Many Data Analysts and Software Engineers already have at least <em>some</em> level of hands-on experience with data, so it makes total sense to use &amp; develop those skills. This has happened with every single kind of engineering role in the history of engineering. But there’s only so many people who want to make the switch, and you can’t reallocate <em>everyone</em> from your other teams. So, Data Engineering absolutely needs entry-level engineers.</p>
<p>People used to say “Software Engineering is not an entry level role”. They don’t anymore, because people know it is total rubbish.</p>
<p>Everyone is welcome in data.</p>
<h2 id="all-you-need-is-love-sql-️">All you need is <del>love</del> SQL ❤️</h2>
<p>So, how does an entry-level engineer get started in Data Engineering?</p>
<p>Firstly, go unfollow all those influencers on LinkedIn and Twitter. You don’t need them, in fact, they are dangerous. They’re not here to guide, help or teach you. They will take you down a path of failure so that you are more open to giving them your money for a quick win (<a href="#%F0%9F%8C%B6%EF%B8%8F-a-quick-rant-%F0%9F%8C%B6%EF%B8%8F">rant</a>).</p>
<p>With that out the way, understand that there is no roadmap. There is no single path, no clear linear progression of knowledge. No one can tell you that you absolutely must learn A, then B, then C and you’re guaranteed to be a successful Data Engineer.</p>
<p>The same applies to pretty much all engineering roles; front end, back end, embedded systems, networking, analytics. Whatever.</p>
<p>In all of these cases, there are basics that <em>everyone</em> should get familiar with, and these are usually enough to get you your first gig. Remember, there is a fundamental difference between “What do I need to get my first job?” and “How do I progress my career?“.</p>
<p>For Data Engineering, there is only one skill that is absolutely, non-negotiably, the first thing you should learn to get started.</p>
<p><strong>SQL.</strong></p>
<p>Yep, SQL. It’s not dead. It never will be. SQL is the cockroach of data and it’s not going anywhere. People have tried to displace it, and they have all failed.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://www.alasdairb.com/_astro/quote.b861bda1_SP6yT.webp" width="850" height="400" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>SQL is the only skill that every single Data Engineer uses every single day. No other skill or tool can claim the same. Python is common, some folks are using Scala, Snowflake is popular…but there’s more data teams <em>not</em> using those tools than those who <em>are</em>. But not for SQL.</p>
<p>You’re an entry level engineer, you don’t need to be an expert in SQL. You need to be able to solve problems. When you write some shit SQL, and you absolutely will, one of two things will happen:</p>
<p>Thing 1, someone will tell you it’s shit and you’ll learn how to do it better.</p>
<p>Thing 2, people will thank you for solving the problem and ask you to do something else.</p>
<p>Win win.</p>
<h2 id="how-should-i-learn-sql">How should I learn SQL?</h2>
<p>If you’re new to SQL and databases, you should know that “SQL” is very poorly standardised. You’ll hear folks say “ANSI SQL” which many think is some kind of standard, but it’s not really. Anyway, if that topic interests you, <a href="https://blog.ansi.org/sql-standard-iso-iec-9075-2023-ansi-x3-135/">read up on it</a>. There is a common SQL base, but pretty much every single database in existence customises and extends SQL to do whatever it wants.</p>
<p>This means that SQL you write for Postgres <em>might</em> work in MySQL, but don’t be surprised if it doesn’t. The same is true across Microsoft’s SQL Server, Oracle Database, BigQuery, Redshift, Snowflake, ClickHouse and any other database you can think of. The different flavours of SQL used by these databases are called “dialects”.</p>
<p>This can make it daunting to get started, but it’s no different than getting into Software Engineering. There’s a million programming languages and most people start with one and then try a bunch of others.</p>
<p>So, pick any database, don’t worry about the dialect. The database is simply a vehicle for you to learn SQL.</p>
<p>Stuck? Start with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres</a>. It’s the world’s favorite free, open source database. You can’t go wrong starting with Postgres.</p>
<p>Follow some simple tutorials; get it set up, load some data and start asking questions with SQL.</p>
<p>Google around for “SQL challenges”, there’s loads. Some are better than others, just go through them all and challenge yourself. As your knowledge improves, look for harder problems and bigger data sets.</p>
<p>When you’re starting to feel confident - change database. Try solving the same problems with <a href="https://mariadb.org/">MariaDB</a>. Then try out <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery">Google’s BigQuery</a> (there is a generous free-tier for BigQuery, be careful to stay under the limits and you won’t pay anything).</p>
<p>Pay attention to how your queries change, particularly with more complex queries. Notice that different kinds of queries are faster or slower between databases. Get used to reading the SQL reference documentation for each of these databases.</p>
<p>If you need something more guided, there are plenty - literally <em>thousands</em> - of free SQL resources on the internet. There’s nothing wrong with following a <em>free</em> SQL introduction course, but always challenge what you learn by applying it to a different database.</p>
<p>You will have time to specialise in a specific database later in your career, now is not the time.</p>
<p><strong>If you’re in the UK, the UK Gov is sponsoring a whole bunch of entry-level bootcamps across loads of sectors. One of the biggest areas of funding is Data Engineering. I can’t vouch for these bootcamps, some look better than others, but they are <em>free</em>, so if you’re eligable, why not? <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-a-skills-bootcamp/">https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-a-skills-bootcamp/</a></strong></p>
<h2 id="what-if-i-already-know-sql">What if I already know SQL?</h2>
<p>If you’re coming from a Data Analytics background, or any other role where you’re already reasonably comfortable with SQL, then you have it easy. Anyone with this background should be able to start looking for an entry-level or junior Data Engineering role.</p>
<p>Now, if you’re sitting on 15 years of experience as an Analyst, going back to a junior role might not be something you’re willing to do - but that’s a different discussion.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>
<p>What about Python? Pandas? dbt? Rust? Airflow? Spark?</p>
<p>Later. These are all things you can learn on the job <em>if the job even needs them</em>.</p>
<p>Go get your first data job. I’m not going to tell you it will be easy. Lots of people struggle to find the right entry-level job in all fields of engineering.</p>
<p>But when you land it, make it your primary goal to absorb the knowledge from your new colleagues. Learn something every single day.</p>
<p>When the learning stops, move on. Use what you’ve learnt to get a pay bump and find new people to learn from.</p>
<p>Rinse and repeat. That’s your roadmap.</p>
<p>Everything else comes later. Go get your hands dirty.</p>
<h3 id="️-a-quick-rant-️">🌶️ A quick rant 🌶️</h3>
<p><em>Unfortunately, I see a lot of bad advice handed out. Now, much of it is others just innocently sharing an opinion, but, often there is a clear financial incentive behind it. Vendors who want their tools to be the “baseline” to enter the industry. So-called “influencers” who take money from those vendors, or want to convince you to buy their Data Engineering bootcamps. Because, if data engineering is spooky and complicated, you’re more inclined to buy their “land your first job in 90 days” course, right?</em></p>
<p><em>Now, there’s nothing wrong with vendors advertising their tools, or individuals creating genuinely helpful content that earns themselves a living. Tools have a place in the world, as do creators. But certain bad actors target junior and entry-level engineers who don’t have the experience to identify blatant bullshit from real advice. Be wary.</em></p>

            <pubDate>Fri, 14 Jul 2023 00:08:44 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://fev.al/posts/personal-relations/">https://fev.al/posts/personal-relations/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36717790">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    
    <p>I was reminded by a discussion with a friend why, as a manager, you should be cautious about the relations you develop with the people in your team.</p>

<p>Since the day I started to have people “reporting to me”, I have felt weird about the hierarchical nature of the relation it creates. This is probably rooted in some form of an imposter/inferiority syndrome, which evolved into the underlying philosophy of my early management style.  To this day, I hate considering that switching to management is a promotion, because it’s just a different function<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I feel uncomfortable when people in a team are referred to as “under” their manager, due to the suggested superiority/inferiority it creates. The lingo of management is full of these concepts, fundamentally based on hierarchy (in which what is higher is more important), paternalism (the boss knows better than you and will tell you what), property[<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> (“it is my team”, which can be quite twisted when you talk about a group of people) and dehumanization (humans are <strong>not</strong> resources).</p>

<p>As a result I had been over-compensating in the early years of my management career, trying to distance myself from this view, because I certainly didn’t feel like I was any better<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> than people in “my” team. I was desperately trying to prove that I didn’t feel superior, wrapping feedback in all sorts of caveats (or worse keeping it for myself), trying to give as much autonomy as was imaginable, never telling people what to do, not forcing people to do things in a way they didn’t like, pulling as much shit as I can so that they wouldn’t have to do it, putting me at their level, oversharing, and worst of all, being their friends.</p>

<p>This behavior has positive effects, especially when the usual manager is the opposite of that. Autonomy, vulnerability, considering the human side and personal preferences, not thinking of yourself as smarter, tolerating failure, having fun, they’re all essential management traits. And being a basic, fallible human being makes a world of difference. This behavior is not an issue as long as things are going well, and people in your team are good.</p>

<p>But the day things go sideways, it backfires in an explosive way. Because at the end of the day, as a manager, you <em>will</em> have to deal with shit situations. You <em>will</em> have to give feedback that the receiver doesn’t want (but needs to hear). You <em>will</em> have to ask someone to shut up and do it anyways. You <em>will</em> have to not promote/give a raise to someone and tell them why. You <em>will</em> have to fire someone who under-performs. You <em>will</em> have to distribute some of the blame. And worst of all, as is happening to the friend I mentioned, you <em>will</em> have to lay-off people who don’t deserve it, just because the company says so.</p>

<p>Good luck doing that if everyone in your team is your buddy. I learned it the hard way, the first time I had to fire someone.</p>

<p>There is a balance to be achieved between being a frigid, all-knowing dictator, and the janitorial team servant who also doubles as party-buddy / best-friend. You can remain human, have fun and crack a joke, while not being a friend. You can prioritize other people’s opinion and remain decisive. You can be personable and bring your personality at work, yet set limits and remain professional. You can be vulnerable but still respected. You can provide hard feedback and still care at a personal level<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>You also need to come into terms that in the end, if the bucks stops with you, you cary more responsibility<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> than people in your team, and as a result have some power they don’t have.</p>

<p>Beyond that, there will come a day where you <em>have to</em> do something to someone that you <em>do not want to</em> do at a personal level. To make that easier, you need to keep some distance with the folks you manage.</p>

   <p>The Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into the popular chatbot ChatGPT. The agency says it's looking into whether the AI tool has harmed people by generating incorrect information about them, according to a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/67a7081c-c770-4f05-a39e-9d02117e50e8.pdf?itid=lk_inline_manual_4">letter</a> sent to its parent company OpenAI.</p>   <p>The FTC's investigation, which was first <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/13/ftc-openai-chatgpt-sam-altman-lina-khan/">reported by the Washington Post</a>, is also looking into OpenAI's privacy and data security practices. A person familiar with the matter confirmed the investigation. </p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1187539178" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>The 20-page letter is requesting that OpenAI turn over company records and data on several issues, including company policies and procedures, financial earnings and details of the Large Language Models it uses to train its chatbot. </p>   <p>The agency wrote that it's looking into whether the company has "engaged in unfair or deceptive practices relating to risks of harm to consumers, including reputational harm."</p>   <p>Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, responded via Twitter on Thursday afternoon saying he was disappointed to see the FTC's request start with a leak. Then added, "that said, it's super important to us that out [SIC] technology is safe and pro-consumer, and we are confident we follow the law." </p>   
   <p>The FTC's investigation<strong> </strong>is breaking new ground with government regulatory action involving the AI industry, which has exploded in popularity over the last year. Altman himself has regularly warned about the risks of AI and advised that the new technology needs to be regulated. He's <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/05/16/1176508612/a-leader-in-artificial-intelligence-is-urging-congress-to-regulate-it">testified before Congress</a> and met with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1187539321" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Lawmakers from New York to California have been hashing out how to regulate the burgeoning technology. Congressman Ted Lieu, D-CA, has proposed putting together an AI commission to study the impact of the technology. Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/05/18/1176894731/schumer-meets-with-bipartisan-group-of-senators-to-build-a-coalition-for-ai-law">working on possible AI legislation</a>. But experts say that regulation could be months, even years, off.</p>   <p>"OpenAI, Microsoft, and other companies selling generative AI systems have said they welcome regulation," said <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/bhr.stern.nyu.edu/tech-generativeai__;!!Iwwt!Qzaaz2ypzmPCqERmTPHzonlvVanI38gokjzn2D0hhtK3nxa6FeHetaJsjTQoLD53GXxb1tQ5NNNtmqwRD7o$">Paul Barrett</a>, deputy director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. "The FTC has responded appropriately--by seeking extensive disclosure of how industry leader OpenAI assembles and refines its artificial intelligence models."</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1187539488" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Under the helm of Chair Lina Khan, the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/03/07/1161312602/lina-khan-ftc-tech">FTC has gone after major tech companies</a> such as Meta, Amazon and Microsoft. The watchdog agency also has repeatedly said that AI falls under the purview of consumer protection laws.</p>   <p>"There is no AI exemption to the laws on the books," Khan <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/04/25/artificial-intelligence-bias-eeoc/?itid=ap_catzakrzewski">said in an April news conference</a>.</p>   <p>Khan testified before the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday to address the agency's work to protect consumers from unfair or deceptive practices. She spoke about the agency's concerns about A.I. and tools like ChatGPT saying they're being fed troves of data, and the type of data they're using is unclear.</p>   
   <p>"We've heard about reports where people's sensitive information is showing up in response to an inquiry from somebody else," Khan said. "We've heard about, libel, defamatory statements, flatly untrue things that are emerging. That's the type of fraud and deception that we're concerned about." </p>   <p>ChatGPT has come under scrutiny for parroting false information about various individuals, including radio hosts and lawyers. In one incident, the chatbot said a lawyer <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/04/05/chatgpt-lies/">was accused of harassing a student</a>—but that incident never reportedly happened.</p>   <p>Along with potential risks to consumers from false statements, the FTC is also concerned about security issues with ChatGPT. In its letter, it pointed to an incident that OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/blog/march-20-chatgpt-outage">revealed</a> in March, saying a bug in its system let some users see other users chat history and "payment-related information."</p>   <p>Some industry groups and conservative think tanks have already decried the FTC's investigation, saying it could stifle innovation. </p>   <p>"The letter is clearly a shakedown by the FTC," said Will Rinehart, senior research fellow at Utah's Center for Growth and Opportunity. "And it's also a risky move. The advances coming from AI could boost US productivity. Chair Khan has put the entire industry in the crosshairs."</p>

<div data-nosnippet=""><p><iframe data-lazy-priority="high" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-BP7DhHTU-I?start=7" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div><p>This is the Chungus 2, a fully working PC built inside Minecraft—so you can play Minecraft while you play Minecraft. But that's not all it does, oh no.</p><p>Also known as the Computational Humongous Unconventional Number and Graphics Unit, this machine is the lowest spec thing I think I've ever written about. But hats off to project lead Sammyuri and team for managing to push Minecraft redstone crafting to new heights.</p><p>Technically <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwHBaSySHmo" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwHBaSySHmo">someone did create a Minecraft-alike in Minecraft</a> with redstone back in 2012. And while that's damn impressive, it was only a 2D version of the game. This one plays it in 3D.</p><p>Essentially what we're looking at here is a virtual machine, only these utter ballers painstakingly crafted the components using the tools Minecraft has to offer—along with a healthy helping of code—and put them together in-game.</p><p>"Built over a period of many many months, with a significant amount of planning and dedication," the video says in a rather swift wall-of-text splash screen.&nbsp;</p><p>It then goes on to detail an important disclaimer:</p><p>"Some viewers, for example those used to videos of simpler farms and piston doors, may not be able to comprehend the scale of this build and may suffer adverse affects including but not limited to having their minds blown in spectacular fashion."</p><p>Honestly, it is pretty mind-blowing watching all the components chugging along in real time, so we thought we'd bring you the specs so you can see what they managed to scrape together using Minecraft materials alone.</p><div><p>CHUNGUS 2 CPU specs</p><p>8 bit data, 16 bit fixed size instruction length<br>
1Hz clock speed, 4 stage instruction pipeline (fetch - decode - execute - writeback)<br>
64 byte automatic 8-way associative data cache and 256 bytes RAM<br>
Up to 256 addressable I/O ports<br>
7 general purpose registers<br>
Over 40 ALU functions, including a hardware barrel shifter, multiplier, divider and square rooter<br>
32x128 byte program pages for a total of 4KiB program storage</p></div><p>The CPU runs at 1Hz, and the AMOGUS (Absurdly Massive Operator of Graphics) graphics processor packs just 6KB of graphics memory. It's sure as hell not about to win a place in our <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/best-gaming-pc/" target="_blank">best gaming PC</a> guide, though I'm very tempted to sneak it in there when my boss isn't looking.</p><p>The 96 x 64p resolution is garbage by modern standards, and the graphics are rendered in only two colours: brown, and brown. But what did I expect? The main thing is that it works. You can craft, smelt, take fall damage, and all that good Minecraft stuff, even if you do need to be superhuman to tell what half the things on the screen are.</p><p>Of course one of the top comments is "Can it play Doom?" And although there's no evidence of that, I can tell you it runs Tetris, Snake, Conways Game of Life, and even renders Mandlebrot sets.</p><p>Sammyuri cites Mumbo Jumbo specifically "for inspiring me to begin my redstone journey back in 2013." From there they learned computer architecture and how to build it in Minecraft from the <a href="https://openredstone.org/" target="_blank" data-url="https://openredstone.org/">ORE Minecraft server</a> community, and they encourage anyone looking to learn the trade to head over and check it out.</p><p>So here's a nod to Sammyuri, Uwerta, StackDoubleFlow for putting the Chungus together, and to Dimdom10 for running the server and helping to render some of their work. May they be forever immortalised as the bringers of Minecraftception, even if the r/Minecraft mods team decided to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/x7mfdy/i_made_3d_minecraft_in_minecraft_with_only/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/x7mfdy/i_made_3d_minecraft_in_minecraft_with_only/">remove their post</a> and lock the comments section.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://almalinux.org/blog/future-of-almalinux/">https://almalinux.org/blog/future-of-almalinux/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36716891">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://almalinux.org/blog-images/23.07.13.future.png"></p><p>It’s been a whirlwind few weeks here at AlmaLinux, and I’m elated to be able to finally share this update.</p><h2 id="the-future-of-almalinux-os">The future of AlmaLinux OS</h2><p>In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/furthering-evolution-centos-stream">Red Hat announced</a> they will no longer be providing the means for downstream clones to continue to be 1:1 binary copies of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Very quickly, both <a href="https://almalinux.org/blog/our-value-is-our-values/">Jack</a> and <a href="https://almalinux.org/blog/impact-of-rhel-changes/">I shared</a> some initial thoughts, but we intentionally took our time deciding the next right step for AlmaLinux OS. After much discussion, the AlmaLinux OS Foundation board today has decided to drop the aim to be 1:1 with RHEL. AlmaLinux OS will instead aim to be Application Binary Interface (ABI) compatible*.</p><p><em>We will continue to aim to produce an enterprise-grade, long-term distribution of Linux that is aligned and ABI compatible with RHEL in response to our community’s needs, to the extent it is possible to do, and such that software that runs on RHEL will run the same on AlmaLinux.</em>
– From yesterday’s meeting notes:&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13q6udmzAEqHIoPf2cQJ-QJrYosaFWd_m/view">Minutes - Board Meeting #23 July, 2023</a></p><h2 id="what-this-change-means-for-users-of-almalinux-os">What this change means for users of AlmaLinux OS</h2><p>For a typical user, this will mean very little change in your use of AlmaLinux. Red Hat-compatible applications will still be able to run on AlmaLinux OS, and your installs of AlmaLinux will continue to receive timely security updates. The most remarkable potential impact of the change is that we will no longer be held to the line of “bug-for-bug compatibility” with Red Hat, and that means that we can now accept bug fixes outside of Red Hat’s release cycle. While that means some AlmaLinux OS users may encounter bugs that are not in Red Hat, we may also accept patches for bugs that have not yet been accepted upstream, or shipped downstream.</p><h2 id="changes-to-our-development-process">Changes to our development process</h2><p>As one might anticipate, the change in our goals will require changes in our development and build processes.</p><p>One of the first things you will see is that we will include comments in our patches that include a link to where we got the patch that’s been applied (like <a href="https://git.almalinux.org/rpms/grafana/src/branch/a9/SPECS/grafana.spec#L74">Grafana’s release </a>yesterday). This change is helpful for several reasons, but it helps us specifically further our goal of transparency.</p><p>We will also start asking anyone who <a href="https://bugs.almalinux.org/">reports bugs in AlmaLinux OS</a> to attempt to test and replicate the problem in CentOS Stream as well, so we can focus our energy on correcting it in the right place.</p><h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2><p>Now that we will no longer be holding ourselves to being a 1:1 Red Hat downstream rebuild, we are taking some time to consider the possibilities around what that means. We will continue to provide updates around that process and will include the members of the AlmaLinux OS Foundation in that conversation and decision-making process as well.</p><p>There are also a ton of exciting developments and partnerships in the works that we will be able to announce in the coming weeks and months.</p><h2 id="commitment-to-open-source">Commitment to Open Source</h2><p>While all of these changes open up a lot of opportunities, we want to be clear about the fact that we are still dedicated to being good open source citizens. We’ll continue to contribute upstream in Fedora and CentOS Stream and to the greater Enterprise Linux ecosystem, just as we have been doing since our inception, and we invite our community to do the same!</p><h2 id="thank-you-and-how-to-help">Thank you, and how to help!</h2><p>I want to say thank you to everyone who has reached out with interest and offers of assistance in the last few weeks, and to our users for making it clear that they understand and continue to see our value in the Enterprise Linux ecosystem.</p><p>Thanks also to our individual <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/AlmaLinux">sponsors</a> and <a href="https://opencollective.com/almalinux-os-foundation">backers</a> in addition to our corporate sponsors. You are the biggest part of the reason we can continue to provide AlmaLinux OS free forever.</p><p>If you have any interest in helping us out, there are a ton of ways to get involved. For folks that have time to offer: the Infrastructure and Cloud SIGs are always welcoming more folks, and the Marketing and Membership committees are looking for help, too! If you want to show support but don’t have much time, just joining the foundation is a great way to <a href="https://almalinux.org/members/">join us</a>. You can also convince your company to become a sponsor or just back us yourself as an individual <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/AlmaLinux">on GitHub</a> or <a href="https://opencollective.com/almalinux-os-foundation">OpenCollective</a>.</p><p>There’s a lot of work to be done, and we are very excited to welcome you.</p><p>–-</p><p>* <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface">ABI compatibility</a> in our case means working to ensure that applications built to run on RHEL (or RHEL clones) can run without issue on AlmaLinux. Adjusting to this expectation removes our need to ensure that everything we release is an exact copy of the source code that you would get with RHEL.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>
Jul 10, 2023
</h2>
<p>
Mayor Michelle Wu today announced the City will launch a new “Downtown Office to Residential Conversion Pilot Program,” a public-private partnership program to incentivize the conversion of underutilized office buildings to residential use in Downtown this fall.</p>
<p>
The program, which is anticipated to begin accepting applications this fall, will be administered jointly by the Boston Planning &amp; Development Agency (BPDA), Mayor's Office of Housing (MOH), and the City of Boston Finance Cabinet to help meet City goals of creating housing units Downtown and having more consistent foot traffic throughout the week to support Downtown businesses. This program may be modified to acknowledge and respond to changing market conditions.</p>
<p>
“We must take every possible action to create more housing and more affordability so that Boston’s growth meets the needs of current and future residents,” said Mayor Michelle Wu. “This program will help us take advantage of the opportunity we have to rethink Downtown as a space where people from all over come together to collaborate, create, live, and play.”</p>
<p>
“Through this conversion program, we seek to incentivize lenders, property owners, downtown stakeholders, and the State to partner with the City to increase the production of much needed housing in our downtown core,” said Chief of Planning Arthur Jemison. “This public private partnership opportunity is the right tool to unlock new housing and shape a new, mixed-use neighborhood Downtown.”</p>
<p>
“By converting office space into residential homes, we can fulfill the housing needs of our thriving City, while revitalizing and stabilizing our downtown neighborhood," said Chief of Housing Sheila Dillon. “New residents will enjoy the advantages of living in a neighborhood with many amenities, including shopping options, recreational spaces and multiple transportation hubs. This initiative aligns with this administration’s dedication to creating accessible and equitable housing in every neighborhood, strengthening our small businesses and commercial centers.”</p>
<p>
The program would offer owners of commercial office buildings Downtown reduced property tax rates in return for immediately converting their buildings to residential uses. Based on studies prepared for the City as part of <a href="https://www.bostonplans.org/planning/planning-initiatives/plan-downtown">PLAN: Downtown</a>, a rate reduction by up to 75% of the standard tax rate for residential for up to 29 years could provide a strong incentive to encourage conversion. This would be implemented through a public-private partnership that will enable the BPDA, the City, and the proponent to enter into a payment in lieu of taxes (PILOT) agreement. These terms were developed with the assistance of outside experts in order to make residential construction economically possible in the short term given the high cost of such conversions. These projects will also receive the support of the new Ombudsperson’s office at the BPDA to help with streamlining the approvals process from other City departments following BPDA Board approval. Final program parameters will be defined when applications are made available this fall.</p>
<p>
The program is planned to be time-limited and will only accept applications through June of 2024. To be eligible, projects must comply with the proposed Inclusionary Zoning standards when approved; and the new Stretch Code’s energy efficiency standards. Applicants will be encouraged to maintain ground floor retail or other public uses. Projects will be required to start construction by October 2025, and will be subject to paying any forgone taxes if these commitments are not met. In order to recoup the forgone tax revenue over time, the City will also require a 2% payment on future sales of the property.</p>
<p>
Following the release of a <a href="https://www.boston.gov/sites/default/files/file/2022/10/Revive%20and%20Reimagine%20-%20a%20Strategy%20to%20Revitalize%20Boston's%20Downtown%20-%20Oct%202022.pdf" target="_blank">Downtown Revitalization Report</a> released in October of 2022 that showed post-pandemic commercial office space vacancy rates are approximately 20 percent, Downtown neighborhood planners facilitated several conversations with developers to gather information on interest in residential conversions and possible pathways to achieve more housing Downtown. The BPDA also contracted HR&amp;A Advisors Inc. to produce a report on the feasibility of office conversion in Downtown Boston and the Financial District. This research all suggested that partnership from the City was the only financially feasible path forward for private development to complete residential conversions. The study was conducted alongside PLAN: Downtown, the BPDA’s ongoing Downtown planning initiative, a draft of which will be released in August 2023. This program furthers the Plan’s goals to increase residential growth downtown and revitalize the area through a greater mix of uses while also preserving the historic urban fabric that makes Boston’s Downtown so unique.</p>
<p>
The program is part of Mayor Wu’s <a href="https://www.bostonplans.org/news-calendar/news-updates/2023/01/26/in-state-of-the-city-address-mayor-wu-announces">ambitious growth agenda</a> for Boston, which is focused on advancing the City’s resilience, affordability, and equity goals in order to make Boston the best city in the country to raise a family. The agenda also includes the creation of a City Planning and Design Department operating under the direction of Chief of Planning Arthur Jemison, and the <a href="https://www.boston.gov/news/katharine-lusk-named-executive-director-planning-advisory-council" target="_blank">appointment of Katharine Lusk to lead the newly created Planning Advisory Council</a> which was created to coordinate planning processes across City departments. The Mayor also committed to update Boston’s zoning code to create thousands of additional housing units in Boston’s squares and corridors and <a href="https://www.boston.gov/news/members-steering-committee-advise-reforms-article-80-development-review-process-announced" target="_blank">reform</a> the <a href="https://www.bostonplans.org/projects/development-review/what-is-article-80">Article 80</a> process to increase speed and predictability for development.</p>

Murray" data-headline="Remembering Lithium-Ion Battery Pioneer John Goodenough" data-page-title="Remembering Lithium-Ion Battery Pioneer John Goodenough - IEEE Spectrum"><p>Nobel Laureate <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2019/goodenough/facts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">John B. Goodenough</a>, one of the inventors of the lithium-ion battery, died on 25 June at age 100.</p><p>Goodenough, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Texas at Austin</a>, authored more than 800 technical papers during his career. He and his colleagues were recently granted a <a href="https://patents.justia.com/patent/20220115739" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.S. patent</a>, shortly before his 100th birthday.</p><p>A mathematician and physicist by education, Goodenough had a 70-year career in physics and chemistry. He probably is best known for developing the lithium cobalt oxide cathode in 1980—which became the foundation for <a href="https://jglobal.jst.go.jp/en/detail?JGLOBAL_ID=200902083334341504" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sony’s first</a> commercial lithium-ion battery in 1991.</p><p>For that, he won a 2019 <a href="https://region8today.ieeer8.org/nobel-prize-in-chemistry-2019-is-awarded-for-the-development-of-the-lithium-ion-battery/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a>, sharing the award with <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38243696500" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">M. Stanley Whittingham</a>, who created the lithium-ion concept, and <a href="https://www.asahi-kasei.com/asahikasei-brands/interview/yoshino/profile/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Akira Yoshino</a>, who developed the anode chemistry that was used in Sony’s first lithium-ion battery.</p><p>Goodenough was awarded the <a href="https://ieeetv.ieee.org/ieeetv-specials/2012-ieee-honors-medal-for-environmental-and-safety-technologies" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2012 IEEE Medal for Environmental and Safety Technologies</a> for discoveries that “paved the way for development of the rechargeable lithium-ion battery technology.”</p><p>Starting in the 1990s, his lithium cobalt oxide cathode was used in many electronic products including camcorders, laptop computers, and mobile phones. It later became the chemistry of choice for early electric cars including the <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/tesla/roadster/2008/review/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2008 Tesla Roadster</a>.</p><p>Within the battery community, Goodenough is known for more than just lithium cobalt oxide, though. He helped develop three of the five most commonly used types of lithium-ion chemistries. His first was lithium cobalt oxide. His second, lithium manganese oxide, is used in power tools, medical devices, and some <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/electric-vehicles">electric vehicles</a>. His third, lithium iron phosphate, is now one of the most popular battery chemistries in the automotive industry.</p><h2>Overcoming struggles with dyslexia</h2><p>Born in Jena, Germany, Goodenough grew up in Woodbridge, Conn., about 13 kilometers from <a href="https://www.yale.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Yale</a>, where his father was a religion professor.</p><p>Goodenough was dyslexic and struggled to read—which almost caused him to be held back in the sixth grade.</p><p>“I was so frustrated that I couldn’t read,” he wrote in his memoir, <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Witness_to_Grace/K5T8oAEACAAJ?hl=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Witness to Grace</em></a>. “And, of course, my [older] brother read really well, and my father was a professor with a lot of books to read. It was terrible.”</p><p>Goodenough taught himself to read and became a high-achieving student in high school. But even after gaining acceptance to Yale, he said, he steered clear of all courses with long reading lists, fearing that he wouldn’t be able to keep up. </p><p>After graduating in 1943 with a bachelor’s degree in mathematics, Goodenough joined the U.S. Army. He worked as a meteorologist and was tasked with predicting the weather for the Allies’ D-Day invasion.</p><p>Following World War II, he pursued a doctorate in physics at the <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Chicago</a>. He studied under <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6781744" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Enrico Fermi</a>, the physicist who created the world’s first nuclear chain reaction, and <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4640583" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Edward Teller</a>, the so-called “father of the hydrogen bomb.” His doctoral supervisor was <a href="https://history.aip.org/phn/11806003.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Clarence Zener</a>, whose diode famously allowed current to flow in reverse.</p><p>After Goodenough earned a Ph.D. in 1952 in solid-state physics, he joined MIT’s <a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lincoln Laboratory</a>, in Lexington, Mass., as a researcher. He was part of a team there that developed the world’s first random-access magnetic memory. His ability to cross disciplines started at MIT.</p><p>“At Lincoln Lab, in order to solve problems, we had to bring physics and chemistry together with engineering,” he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ylhy-utbXY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said during an interview</a> in 2016.</p><p><img alt="Photo of an olderman in a tie in front of a flowered tree.

It was there that Goodenough made his mark while working on a rechargeable lithium battery with<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koichi_Mizushima_(scientist)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Koichi Mizushima</a>, a postdoctoral researcher. </p><p><a href="https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Exxon</a> researcher <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38243696500" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Whittingham</a> had developed a lithium titanium disulfide battery in the 1970s; Goodenough decided to replace the titanium disulfide with lithium cobalt oxide. It gave the battery a significant voltage boost: from 2.4 to 4 volts. The higher voltage made his new battery chemistry almost impossible to ignore.</p><p>Goodenough patented his battery in 1980, signing away his financial claim to it in order to fund the patent.</p><p>Sony produced its first commercial lithium-ion battery in 1991 using Goodenough’s and Mizushima’s cobalt oxide cathode. The company originally employed the battery in its <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/CorporateInfo/History/sonyhistory-f.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Handycam</a>, and the lithium-ion technology soon made its way into billions of mobile phones and laptop computers.</p><p>While still at Oxford in 1981, Goodenough worked with <a href="https://www.anl.gov/profile/michael-m-thackeray" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Michael M. Thackeray</a> on a lithium manganese oxide battery. The LMO battery was less expensive and safer to use than lithium cobalt oxide, and it became a mainstay in tools and medical devices. In 2010 Nissan used it in its <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/reviews/2010-nissan-leaf-first-look/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Leaf</a> electric car.</p><p>Goodenough moved back to the United States in 1986 and joined the University of Texas at Austin as a professor of mechanical engineering. He worked on another lithium-ion chemistry there in 1995: lithium iron phosphate. </p><p>At first, he had little confidence in the chemistry, thinking it was too low in energy. But French battery scientist <a href="https://cicenergigune.com/en/michel-armand" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Michel Armand</a> called Goodenough and offered to collaborate on it. The duo created a lithium-ion battery with lower voltage but also lower cost and greater safety.</p><p>Twenty-five years later, the battery is gaining momentum in the auto industry as a means of reducing the cost of electric cars. Today it is being employed by Chinese EV manufacturers including <a href="https://www.byd.com/us" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BYD</a>, as well as by <a href="https://www.ford.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ford</a>, <a href="https://www.gm.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">General Motors</a>, and <a href="https://www.tesla.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tesla</a>.</p><p><img alt="A group photo of three men.

"And unfortunately there's huge collateral damage to the industry, to people who are, you know, support services. I could go on and on. It will affect the economy of different regions, even, because of the sheer size of the business. It's a shame.

<code>redbean</code> webserver</a> in 2021, an immediate question was how existing
C software would run on it. The best way to test a new libc is to build more
code on top, and <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/tree/master/third_party">many codebases have been ported</a> to use cosmo. The
porting efforts have also helped fill out the libc API. However, a new libc must
also fit in with how C software is conventionally built – things like
<code>./configure</code> and <code>cmake</code> – so that porting more software is easy. When
<a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/releases/tag/2.1"><code>pthreads</code> became available last year</a>, I said: <a href="https://ahgamut.github.io/2022/07/27/ape-rust-example/">porting is just a
matter of convincing the build system</a>. I believe my <code>gcc</code> patch is a
big step towards seamlessly building a lot of software with Cosmopolitan Libc.
This blog post will cover how the patch came to be.</p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/issues/61">Lua</a> was the first programming language to be ported to Cosmopolitan Libc,
followed by <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/issues/104">Wren</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/issues/114">Janet</a>, and Fabrice Bellard’s
<a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/issues/97#issuecomment-816831508"><code>quickjs</code></a>. There appeared to be a common change across the ports:
<code>switch</code> statements with system values like <code>SIGTERM</code> or <code>EINVAL</code> had to be
rewritten as <code>if</code> statements. <strong>2021-03-24:</strong> I raised issue #134 on Github
about this, and got the below answer from <a href="https://github.com/jart">Justine Tunney</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Code that uses <code>switch</code> on system constants needs to be updated to use <code>if</code>
statements. That’s unavoidable unfortunately. It’s the one major breakage we
needed to make in terms of compatibility. The tradeoff is explained in the APE
blog post […] C preprocessor macros relating to system interfaces need to be
symbolic. This is barely an issue, except in cases like <code>switch(errno){case EINVAL:}</code> If we feel comfortable bending the rules […]</p></blockquote><p><strong>2022-09-05:</strong> After writing a bunch of ports, it was clear that the
<code>switch(errno)</code> pattern is quite common, and porting software would be much
faster if the rules could be bent automatically. I decided to try solving
<code>this</code>, but let’s define what <code>this</code> is.</p><h2 id="switch-to-if"><code>switch</code> to <code>if</code></h2><p>Consider the below code snippet:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span><span>// somewhere within your code

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The C standard<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> says that <code>case</code> labels need to be compile-time
constants. If <code>EINVAL</code> is not a compile-time constant, you would get an error
like <code>case label does not reduce to an integer constant</code> when compiling this
snippet with <code>gcc</code>. So you’d need to rewrite the <code>switch</code> statement into an <code>if</code>
statement. My code rewrites <code>switch</code> statements like this:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span><span>// rewriting the switch to an if

are not valid<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> in C. My fix was to dummy-initialize the <code>struct</code>s and
then add an <code>if</code> statement or an <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-11.2.0/gcc/Common-Function-Attributes.html#Common-Function-Attributes"><code>__attribute__((constructor))</code></a> to fill

statements and <code>struct</code> initializations may not compile, because they rely on
system values being compile-time constants. Now:</p><ul><li>Can we (automatically) find these <code>switch</code> statements and convert them into
<code>if</code>s and <code>goto</code>s?</li><li>Can we (automatically) find these <code>struct</code> initializations and insert the
necessary code that fills in the correct runtime values?</li></ul><p>I started off trying to automate these conversions using <code>sed</code> in a shell
script. After a while, it was a python script with some extra regex work to
handle <code>switch</code> fallthroughs. But neither of these worked completely because of
the C preprocessor and <code>ifdef</code>s. It is difficult to perform the rewrite as a
<em>text substitution</em> when you do not know which <code>ifdef</code>s would activate during
compilation. Then, maybe I could perform the rewrite as an <em>AST substitution</em> –
if the code was available as an AST (abstract syntax tree), performing a rewrite
would be replacing one subtree with another. I could also avoid dealing with
the C preprocessor…</p><h2 id="curiously-exploring-gcc-plugins">Curiously exploring <code>gcc</code> plugins</h2><p><code>gcc</code> provides a plugin architecture via which you can access the AST of the
code being compiled. You compile your code as a shared object, load it alongside
<code>gcc</code> with the flag <code>-fplugin=your-plugin.so</code>. The <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-11.2.0/gccint/"><code>gcc</code> internals
documentation</a> provides detailed explanations as to when and how the
plugin writers can interact with the compilation process, and there are some

the function you will use the most when developing a plugin. There are also
convenient macros to access, say, the second arg of the <code>ADD_EXPR</code> or the

raised by <code>gcc</code> earlier would still mean the compilation fails.</p><p>Was this the end?</p><h2 id="return-of-the-c-preprocessor">Return of the C preprocessor</h2><p><strong>2023-03-14:</strong> <code>PLUGIN_PRE_GENERICIZE</code> only received an AST after parsing, and
but <code>gcc</code> gave me an invalid AST due to the <code>switch</code> statement. I needed to
ensure a valid AST before I could rewrite it, and one way to interact with the
code before parsing is … with the C preprocessor! Could I interact with the C
preprocessor from within the plugin? Yes! The <code>gcc</code> plugin headers provide a
structure called <code>cpp_reader</code>, within which you can define custom callbacks that
activate when a macro is <code>#define</code>’d, <code>#undef</code>’d, and used! I still don’t
understand exactly how <code>cpp_reader</code> works, but now there was another line of
attack:</p><ul><li>Cosmopolitan Libc (used to) provide macros for system values like below, so

</span></span></code></pre></div><ul><li><p>and then within my plugin code, I could <em>intercept the usage of the macro
<code>SYMBOLIC(SIGTERM)</code> and substitute my temporary value instead</em>, so that the
parsing would not error out.</p></li><li><p>Finally, with a valid AST in <code>PLUGIN_PRE_GENERICIZE</code>, I could <em>look up the
specific line of code where I did the interception</em> and rewrite the AST with
the correct <code>VAR_DECL</code> of <code>SIGTERM</code> instead of the temporary value.</p></li></ul><p>Let me repeat: a <code>#define</code> in Cosmopolitan Libc headers, a temporary <code>static const</code> in my custom header, a macro interception in the plugin, followed by an

week, I had a plugin that successfully worked around both the <code>switch</code>-<code>case</code>
and the <code>struct</code> initialization errors, which I could verify with a bunch of
simple examples. <strong>2023-03-26:</strong> I got a minimal <a href="https://github.com/ahgamut/cpython/tree/py311-custom">CPython 3.11</a>

whatever I needed. I was initially hesitant<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, but the edge cases and

and the plugin can handle that. However, the macro substitution due to
<code>ACTUALLY(ENOSYS)</code> meant that the plugin also had to handle every other (valid)
use of <code>ENOSYS</code>, which could (hopefully) be avoided by patching <code>gcc</code> instead.</p><p>It took a while to figure out where to add my code into the <code>gcc</code> source tree,
but the overall design of the plugin became simpler. Instead of <code>-fplugin</code>, the
code was now activated with a compiler flag <code>-fportcosmo</code>. To my great relief,
I could delete all my macro-related hacks. Now I could just intercept the parser
error instead: right before <code>gcc</code> raised a <code>case is not constant</code> error, check
if <code>flag_portcosmo</code> is active, and if yes, perform the necessary substitution.
The AST rewriting code was a copy-paste from the plugin, and it was executed
by <code>gcc</code> right before invoking other plugin callbacks.</p><h2 id="porting-software-with-the-patched-gcc">Porting software with the patched <code>gcc</code></h2><p><strong>2023-06-05:</strong> At this stage, the patched <code>gcc</code> was passing all the test cases
I had written for the plugin earlier, and new binaries were added into the
Cosmopolitan Libc monorepo. This allowed for compiling a lot more code, leading
to fixes and improvements. Building <code>lua</code> was now straightforward, and for
<code>python3.11</code> I added some changes to access the ZIP store within the executable.
I found out where <code>g++</code> raised the <code>case constant</code> error so <code>ninja</code> could build.

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>With that, <code>ncurses</code> built without a complaint. Note that the C standard allows

the build system. I mentioned this last year, and this <code>gcc</code> patch experiment
was to reduce the amount of convincing you would need to do. One of the
motivations for this experiment was to find an answer to the question “what is
the minimum amount of source code that would need to change in order to port
something to Cosmopolitan Libc?” I am glad to find out that the answer is less
than ten lines in most cases, and could even be zero.</p><p>Of course, my patch isn’t perfect. It can’t handle some anonymous structs,
<code>enum</code>s, <code>const int</code>s, or amazing things like using <code>SIGILL</code> as an array index
within an initializer. Rare compiler crashes may still occur in some weird
<code>static</code> initializations, or if you try stuffing <code>SIGTERM</code> into a <code>static const int8_t</code>. But I’ve spent a good chunk of time removing obvious counterexamples,
and a lot of popular software builds seamlessly. A stringent testing setup will
reveal more things to improve.</p><p>If you prefer, you can still rewrite the <code>switch</code> statements and <code>struct</code>
initializers by hand, but for many cases the compiler can do it for you, and all
that is necessary for a port is to specify the right flags to <code>./configure</code> or
<code>cmake</code>. If you can build your C software statically (bonus points if it builds
with <code>musl</code>), there’s a decent chance it builds with Cosmopolitan Libc right
now. Just try to build it! There are lots of possibilities.</p><hr></div></div>]]></description>

<fbs-ad position="top" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-top"></fbs-ad>
<p>Cyrus Hodes, an artificial intelligence entrepreneur, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23873690-2c08f586-1e20-4303-8536-13ba3940c4e9" target="_blank" title="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23873690-2c08f586-1e20-4303-8536-13ba3940c4e9" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23873690-2c08f586-1e20-4303-8536-13ba3940c4e9" aria-label="filed the lawsuit">filed the lawsuit</a> on Thursday to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. It alleges that he was misled by Mostaque into believing his 15% stake in the business was “worthless” just months before Stability AI’s August 2022 <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2022/09/07/stability-ai-funding-round-1-billion-valuation-stable-diffusion-text-to-image/" target="_self" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2022/09/07/stability-ai-funding-round-1-billion-valuation-stable-diffusion-text-to-image/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2022/09/07/stability-ai-funding-round-1-billion-valuation-stable-diffusion-text-to-image/" aria-label="fundraise">fundraise</a> of more than $100 million at a $1 billion valuation from venture capital firms Coatue and Lightspeed. The company, which is best known for its association with the viral text-to-image generation system Stable Diffusion, has since emerged as one of the leading public faces of the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2023/02/02/inside-chatggpts-breakout-moment-and-the-race-for-the-future-of-ai/" target="_self" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2023/02/02/inside-chatggpts-breakout-moment-and-the-race-for-the-future-of-ai/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2023/02/02/inside-chatggpts-breakout-moment-and-the-race-for-the-future-of-ai/" aria-label="generative AI boom">generative AI boom</a>.</p>

<p>In the suit, Hodes says he sold his stake to Mostaque for $100 across two transactions in October 2021 and May 2022. In doing so, he alleges he was “fraudulently cheated” out of equity that within months would have been worth $150 million on an undiluted basis because Mostaque withheld information about active fundraising attempts and a planned business pivot into AI text-to-image generation.</p>

<p>The suit further accuses Mostaque of destroying evidence after being notified by Hodes’ counsel of potential legal action in December 2022. Mostaque wrote in a March 2023 <a href="https://twitter.com/EMostaque/status/1633631383166889985" target="_blank" title="https://twitter.com/EMostaque/status/1633631383166889985" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://twitter.com/EMostaque/status/1633631383166889985" aria-label="Twitter post">Twitter post</a> that his “WhatsApp got deleted,” which the complaint alleges to have been intentional.</p>

<p>Avi Weitzman, a partner at law firm Paul Hastings who is representing Hodes, described the maneuver as a “shocking swindling” in a statement shared with <em>Forbes</em>. “This was corporate greed at its worst. We look forward to a full airing of Defendants’ wrongdoing in Court,” he wrote.</p>

<p>Stability AI was unable to provide comment at the time of publication.</p><p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2023/06/04/stable-diffusion-emad-mostaque-stability-ai-exaggeration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="The AI Founder Taking Credit For Stable Diffusion's Success Has A History Of Exaggeration" data-ga-track="forbesEmbedly:https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2023/06/04/stable-diffusion-emad-mostaque-stability-ai-exaggeration/"><span><span>MORE FROM FORBES</span><span>The AI Founder Taking Credit For Stable Diffusion's Success Has A History Of Exaggeration</span><small>By <span>Kenrick Cai</span></small></span><span><span></span></span></a></p><p>The lawsuit also claims that Mostaque “embezzled funds” from external investors to pay the rent for his family’s London apartment and his children’s schooling. It cites an unnamed “former investor in one of Mostaque’s businesses” who disclosed to Weitzman that Mostaque “has a pattern of bamboozling investors and misappropriating investor and company assets for personal use.” The suit further alleges that Mostaque himself acknowledged to Hodes in 2021 “that he had improperly used company funds” — obtained from the Trinity Challenge, an organization which provides grants to health-related projects — for personal use.</p><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-1"></fbs-ad>

Motez Bishara, a spokesperson for the company, said at the time the couple had made loans to the business and sums owed to, or by, the couple were settled by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>Hodes was an early collaborator with Mostaque on a business idea of using artificial intelligence to help governmental agencies address the Covid-19 pandemic. He appears alongside Mostaque in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehjVRmHqTvA" target="_blank" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehjVRmHqTvA" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehjVRmHqTvA" aria-label="virtual event">virtual event</a> for the project’s launch on YouTube. But the business failed to take off and was scrapped the following year. “Lots of people promised a lot and they didn’t come through,” Mostaque previously told <em>Forbes</em>. Hodes’ lawsuit alleges that a key reason for the project’s failure was that Mostaque was “secretly diverting” his attention and company resources to Stability’s AI image generation efforts.</p>
<p>The case has similarities to another lawsuit leveled against the startup best known for its association with the viral text-to-image generation system Stable Diffusion. In May, Tayab Waseem claimed that Mostaque reneged on an agreement to grant him a 10% cofounder stake in the company. That suit, which was <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/epvzam/stability-ai-co-founder-sued-ceo-for-10-percent-of-the-company" target="_blank" title="https://www.vice.com/en/article/epvzam/stability-ai-co-founder-sued-ceo-for-10-percent-of-the-company" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.vice.com/en/article/epvzam/stability-ai-co-founder-sued-ceo-for-10-percent-of-the-company" aria-label="first reported by Vice">first reported by Vice</a>, was voluntarily dismissed by Waseem on the same day. (Stability AI previously did not comment on Waseem’s suit.)</p>
<p>Waseem’s complaint also portrays Hodes as a cofounder of Stability. It includes a slide from a company investment pitch deck which states that “Emad [Mostaque] founded stability.ai with Cyrus [Hodes] on the premise that the principles he used as a former hedge fund CIO in emerging markets and technology could be used to solve large problems and create huge value.”</p>

<p>Our universe could be twice as old as current estimates, according to a new study that challenges the dominant cosmological model and sheds new light on the so-called "impossible early galaxy problem."

										  
											        </p>
										 
										 											  
<p>The work is published in the journal <i>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</i>.
</p><p>"Our newly-devised model stretches the galaxy formation time by a several billion years, making the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/universe/" rel="tag">universe</a> 26.7 billion years old, and not 13.7 as previously estimated," says author Rajendra Gupta, adjunct professor of physics in the Faculty of Science at the University of Ottawa.
</p><p>For years, astronomers and physicists have calculated the age of our universe by measuring the time elapsed since the Big Bang and by studying the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/oldest+stars/" rel="tag">oldest stars</a> based on the redshift of light coming from distant galaxies. In 2021, thanks to new techniques and advances in technology, the age of our universe was thus estimated at 13.797 billion years using the Lambda-CDM concordance model.
</p><p>However, many scientists have been puzzled by the existence of stars like the Methuselah that appear to be older than the estimated age of our universe and by the discovery of early galaxies in an advanced state of evolution made possible by the James Webb Space Telescope. These galaxies, existing a mere 300 million years or so after the Big Bang, appear to have a level of maturity and mass typically associated with billions of years of cosmic evolution. Furthermore, they're surprisingly small in size, adding another layer of mystery to the equation.
</p><p>Zwicky's tired light theory proposes that the redshift of light from distant galaxies is due to the gradual loss of energy by photons over vast cosmic distances. However, it was seen to conflict with observations. Yet Gupta found that "by allowing this theory to coexist with the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/expanding+universe/" rel="tag">expanding universe</a>, it becomes possible to reinterpret the redshift as a hybrid phenomenon, rather than purely due to expansion."
</p><p>In addition to Zwicky's tired light theory, Gupta introduces the idea of evolving "coupling constants," as hypothesized by Paul Dirac. Coupling constants are <a href="https://phys.org/tags/fundamental+physical+constants/" rel="tag">fundamental physical constants</a> that govern the interactions between particles. According to Dirac, these constants might have varied over time. By allowing them to evolve, the timeframe for the formation of early galaxies observed by the Webb telescope at high redshifts can be extended from a few hundred million years to several billion years. This provides a more feasible explanation for the advanced level of development and mass observed in these ancient galaxies.
</p><p>Moreover, Gupta suggests that the traditional interpretation of the "cosmological constant," which represents <a href="https://phys.org/tags/dark+energy/" rel="tag">dark energy</a> responsible for the accelerating expansion of the universe, needs revision. Instead, he proposes a constant that accounts for the evolution of the coupling constants. This modification in the cosmological model helps address the puzzle of small galaxy sizes observed in the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/early+universe/" rel="tag">early universe</a>, allowing for more accurate observations.

Apple says it gets one every year.&nbsp;</b></i></h2><p><b>Key Points:&nbsp;</b></p><ul><li><p>In its May earnings call, Apple claimed that the iPhone 14 had a 99% customer satisfaction rating citing a third party research firm it hired.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Apple has made a similar claim in every single earnings call for the past seven years.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>A customer satisfaction rating this high is nearly impossible to find using traditional survey methods and a representative sample.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Independent sources find iPhone satisfaction ratings significantly lower than what Apple claims.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Apple’s claimed iPhone satisfaction is far higher than what other consumer companies and brands claim for beloved products.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>We asked Apple’s press team to explain how the company arrived at these results. They opened our email 73 times, but didn’t respond.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Our best guess is that Apple wants to make bold customer satisfaction claims, and has hired a third-party research firm that will produce those numbers to make them seem more credible – and perhaps to provide plausible deniability.</p></li><li><p>That firm is likely using a highly unrepresentative sample of tech enthusiasts and early adopters to generate extraordinary satisfaction numbers that Apple then presents as representative of consumers generally.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Toward the end of its earnings call in May, Apple made an extraordinary claim: “The latest survey of US Consumers from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction at 99% for the iPhone 14 family,” Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem is a 99% satisfaction rate is so high, there’s almost no way to get it using standard survey methods and a representative sample.&nbsp;</p><p>“Even if every single person actually loved their iPhone it would still be nearly impossible to find near unanimous satisfaction using traditional survey methods,” said economist and PerfectRec founder Joe Golden. “A few percent of people just won’t understand the question, or will give the wrong response by mistake,” Golden said.&nbsp;</p><p>If Apple’s claims of 99% satisfaction were true, it would mean the iPhone 14 was not only the most popular mass market consumer product of all time, but it would also probably make it the most popular&nbsp;<i>anything of all time.&nbsp;</i>To get a sense of just how extraordinary Apple’s iPhone 14 claims were, we looked at some other satisfaction numbers and approval ratings for context.&nbsp;</p><p>America’s favorite holiday, Thanksgiving, enjoys 82% popularity according to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1277607/most-popular-holidays-in-the-united-states/#:~:text=Thanksgiving%2C%20Memorial%20day%2C%20and%20Veterans,Veterans%20day%20with%2077%20percent."><u>2023 survey by Statista</u></a>. Memorial Day comes in second at 77%.&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/?ref_=nv_mv_250"><u>three most popular movies</u></a>&nbsp;of all time on IMDB are&nbsp;<i>The Shawshank Redemption</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Godfather</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Dark Knight</i>. They have ratings of 9.2, 9.2 and 9.0 respectively. </p><p>If we look at some of the most popular retailers in America, we find satisfaction ratings maxing out in the 80s. Trader Joe’s fans will stand in line for hours for groceries but still give the store just an 84%&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theacsi.org/industries/retail/supermarkets/"><u>satisfaction rating</u></a>, according to a survey by the American Customer Satisfaction Institute. 82% of Costco customers say they are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theacsi.org/industries/retail/general-merchandise-retailers/"><u>satisfied with the retailer</u></a>, and they pay $60-120 a year for the privilege of shopping there.</p><p>What about politics where tribal loyalties tend to trump facts?&nbsp;<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/203006/obama-job-approval-ratings-politically-polarized-far.aspx"><u>According to Gallup</u></a>, President Barack Obama enjoyed an average approval rating across his two terms of just 83%&nbsp;<i>among Democrats</i>. Donald Trump performed a bit better among Republicans while in the White House, averaging an&nbsp;<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx"><u>86% approval rating</u></a>&nbsp;from members of his own party. Even Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Asad only&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Syrian_presidential_election"><u>managed 95% support</u></a>&nbsp;in the last election, and that was condemned by the United Nations for being undemocratic.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, the only other poll we could find claiming 99% support for&nbsp;<i>anything</i>&nbsp;was a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/is-america-still-sweet-on-ice-cream-national-survey-reveals-our-relationship-may-be-cooling-off-300488561.html#:~:text=Among%20the%20findings%3A%20While%2099,due%20to%20%22health%22%20concerns."><u>press release</u></a>&nbsp; that said 99% of Americans enjoy ice cream. It was authored by a frozen dessert company. I’d note they didn’t bother sharing methodology for such an implausible claim.&nbsp;</p><p>So what is going on with Apple’s claimed iPhone satisfaction rates? We reached out to Apple to find out, but didn’t get any response. When we kept digging, this is what we found.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading--third-party-sources-find-much-lower-satisfaction-rates-for-the-iphone">Third-party sources find much lower satisfaction rates for the iPhone</h2><p>Independent sources do not match Apple’s claimed satisfaction rates.&nbsp;</p><p>The American Consumer Satisfaction Institute regularly surveys consumers about cell phones and wireless carriers. Their&nbsp;<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/05/16/iphone-beats-samsung-in-satisfaction-survey/"><u>latest survey</u></a>&nbsp;found iPhone satisfaction at 81% for 5G models and 78% for other models. That was the highest combined satisfaction rate of any smartphone manufacturer, but still a far cry from the company’s own findings through 451 Research.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/6fetvjj0zxvn/35oovuXDQwc5z2k5OE3DZh/dee474b1b912e34dedb3c640b2828bf0/satisfaction-survey.png?fit=fill&amp;w=768" height="639" width="768" alt=""></p><p>User reviews on Google tell a similar story. People love the iPhone, but not as much as Apple claims.&nbsp;</p><p>While Apple has not published their methodology, a&nbsp;<a href="https://451research.com/images/Marketing/press_releases/iPhone-PR-1_31_2018-f.pdf?&amp;utm_campaign=2018_vocul_apple_pr&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=press_release&amp;utm_term=apple_iphone_pr"><u>2018 press release</u></a>&nbsp;about the survey from its creator, 451 Research shows at least two categories of support: “Very Satisfied” and “Somewhat Satisfied.” If Apple and 451 Research are using a traditional five-point satisfaction scale ranging from “Not At All Satisfied” to “Very Satisfied,” those responses would correspond to four and five stars respectively.&nbsp; If we map that to ratings for the iPhone on Google Reviews, which uses a five-star scale, we find that&nbsp; between 87% to 90% of users are rating the iPhone 4+ stars, depending on the model. Those are great reviews, but they are not a 99% satisfaction rate.&nbsp;</p><p>Even if you took the most favorable approach to Apple and said anything that’s not a one-star review counts as satisfied, you would still fall short of Apple’s claimed satisfaction rates. Six percent of users rate the various iPhone 14 models 1 star on Google as of July 6, 2023. That extremely generous scale would translate into a satisfaction rate of 94%, still not the 99% Apple is claiming.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading--when-other-consumer-companies-brag-about-satisfaction-they-cite-much-lower-numbers">When other consumer companies brag about satisfaction, they cite much lower numbers&nbsp;</h2><p>An analysis of dozens of earnings call transcripts show that executives are usually extremely cautious about satisfaction claims.&nbsp;</p><p>Companies love talking about how happy their customers are, but in the context of heavily scrutinized public earnings calls, they tend to keep their remarks extremely vague. When the word “satisfaction” is used at all, it’s usually part of broad statements like Disney CEO Bob Iger pledging to “<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4576588-walt-disney-company-dis-q1-2023-earnings-call-transcript"><u>increase park capacity while preserving guest satisfaction</u></a>.”&nbsp;</p><p>We combed through the last four quarters of earnings transcripts from consumer favorites like Costco, Disney and McDonald’s as well as popular electronics companies like Samsung and Sony, for claims about customer satisfaction. The only quantitative claim we found was Sony touting that the PlayStation Plus subscription service enjoyed 72% customer satisfaction in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/irday/pdf/2022/GNS_E.pdf"><u>2022 investor presentation</u></a>.</p><p>Even outside of investor calls, it’s unusual for consumer-facing companies to make concrete claims about customer satisfaction. One example of the few examples we found was the appliance company Dyson, which thought an 84% customer satisfaction rating for one of its vacuum cleaners was impressive enough to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/search/news/?keyword=customer%20satisfaction&amp;page=1&amp;pagesize=100"><u>merit a press release</u></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Apple, by contrast, has claimed 98%-or-above approval in every investor call for the last half decade.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4550156-apple-inc-aapl-q4-2022-earnings-call-transcript"><u>Q4, 2022</u></a>&nbsp;- “And the latest survey of US consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98%” - Luca Maestri</p></li><li><p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4463261-apple-inc-aapl-ceo-tim-cook-on-q4-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript"><u>Q4, 2021</u></a>&nbsp;- “The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone, and our active installed base of iPhones reached a new all-time high.” - Luca Maestri</p></li><li><p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4382943-apple-inc-aapl-ceo-tim-cook-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript"><u>Q4, 2020</u></a>&nbsp;- “In fact, in the U.S., the last survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max combined.” - Luca Maestri</p></li><li><p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4300690-apple-inc-aapl-ceo-tim-cook-on-q4-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript"><u>Q4, 2019</u></a>&nbsp;- “And in the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone XR, XS and XS Max combined.” - Luca Maestri</p></li><li><p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4217359-apple-aapl-q4-2018-results-earnings-call-transcript"><u>Q4, 2018</u></a>&nbsp;- “The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone X, 8, and 8 Plus combined.” - Luca Maestri</p></li></ul><p>You can see the full list of Apple’s earnings call satisfaction claims in the appendix. The trend goes back to at least 2011.Other research firms were hired to produce the satisfaction claims prior to 2016, finding similar results.</p><p>It’s worth noting that Apple cites third-party research firms they have hired in every single quantitative mention of customer satisfaction they make on earnings calls going back to at least 2013. Why do this? Apple is the largest company in the world and almost certainly has extremely precise in-house measures of customer satisfaction. The answer likely has to do with credibility and deniability. An extraordinary claim sounds more credible if it’s coming from an independent party, even if you pay to produce it. Furthermore, if investors or others start asking questions about something as eyebrow raising as near-universal satisfaction, it’s easier to deflect than if Apple had produced the statistic in house.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading--we-contacted-apple-and-451-research-to-try-and-figure-out-what-was-going-on-with-the-satisfaction-numbers-they-didnt-respond">We contacted Apple and 451 Research to try and figure out what was going on with the satisfaction numbers.

We recommend it to consumers using PerfectRec every day. But we’re 99% confident something doesn’t quite add up about Apple’s customer satisfaction claims.*&nbsp;</p><p><b>Consider:&nbsp;</b></p><ul><li><p>Independent sources report iPhone satisfaction levels that are significantly lower than what Apple claims.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The iPhone 14 did not get a great critical reception when it launched late last year, and earlier research by PerfectRec found user reviews for the model were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.perfectrec.com/posts/the-iphone-14-is-apples-biggest-disappointment"><u>significantly worse</u></a>&nbsp;than previous editions of the handset.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Other companies with beloved consumer products tout much lower satisfaction rates when they talk about satisfaction at all.</p></li><li><p>It would be extraordinarily hard to find near-universal satisfaction using normal survey research methods and a representative sample.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>It is likely that Apple continues to work with 451 Research not despite its unusual results but because of them. Apple wants to make extraordinary customer satisfaction claims and has found an outside research firm to produce them. 451 Research polls an unrepresentative panel of tech professionals, early adopters and gadget enthusiasts about their iPhone satisfaction, which Apple presents as reflecting the opinions of iPhone users as a whole. It doesn’t. The iPhone is perhaps the most successful consumer product in the world. Its market long ago grew beyond early adopters and gadget enthusiasts.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s worth noting that Apple almost certainly has highly accurate internal measures of customer satisfaction. But instead of sharing those, the company instead highlights and likely misrepresent the findings of a third-party research firm they hired.&nbsp;</p><p>“We’re not calling on the SEC to investigate these customer satisfaction claims, since they have more important cases to go after,” Golden said.&nbsp; “But extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and we believe Apple should review the survey results they trumpet on every earnings call. If they truly think they are valid, they should publish their methodology, and if not, they should issue retractions.”&nbsp;</p><p>*<i>In this case, it’s a figure of speech.&nbsp;</i></p><h2 id="heading--about">About:</h2><h3 id="heading--joe-golden">Joe Golden&nbsp;</h3><p>Dr. Joe Golden is founder and CEO of PerfectRec.

<p>The FCC reached out to me and is asking all of you who signed the petition to also file a comment in their docketing system for the ATSC 3 petition. This is very easy to do and will just take a few minutes. So far there are only about a dozen or so complaints filed. We can do better!! </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b8fiUHt03A">I discuss this in my latest video</a>. </p>

<p>2. On the first line for proceedings type in 16-142 . The system will then display the text “Authorizing Permissive Use of the “Next Generation” Broadcasting Television Standard.” Click on that to lock in the docket number. Here’s what it looks like:</p>

<p><br>3. Fill in your information. A US address is required and note that this will be part of the public record.</p>
<div><p>4. Write your comment in the comment section. It’s important to provide some detail especially how this change will make it difficult for YOU to consume over the air television.</p><p>Below is what I submitted, you are free to <strong><em>re-purpose</em></strong> this for your own submission but DO NOT COPY AND PASTE. The commission values feedback on how this transition will impact consumers and each unique story helps build the case better than a form letter. </p></div>
<blockquote>
<p>I am writing in opposition to DRM Encryption being part of the ATSC 3.0 standard. Over the last several weeks broadcasters have aggressively rolled out encryption on their ATSC 3 signals throughout the United States. At the moment this restricts most currently available tuners from being able to tune ATSC 3 content.</p>
<p>The standard’s voluntary rollout began with much promise. Prior to ATSC 3 being enabled here in Connecticut I could not reliably receive ATSC 1.0 content. When ATSC 3 spun up last year I could finally receive reliable over the air signals at my home. That was until WFSB-TV encrypted their broadcast and I’m now blocked from watching that station.</p>
<p>Encrypting over the air signals goes against the spirit of serving the public’s interest. Encryption adds an additional and unnecessary point of failure for receiving important information during emergency situations.</p>
<p>There are anti-trust implications too. Encryption restricts the consumer’s right to watch content from the public airwaves using tuners and personal recording equipment of their choice. With ATSC 1.0 consumers have many choices for watching and recording over the air television. With ATSC 3 only equipment blessed by the broadcasters through an arduous, opaque and expensive process will be allowed to tune content. One broadcaster, E.W. Scripps, purchased a manufacturer of tuning and recording equipment giving Scripps an advantage in the marketplace over competing products.</p>
<p>The broadcasters have said encryption is important for copy protection or other nonsense about protection from hackers and “deep fakes.” But the reality is they are trying to protect broadcast retransmission fees that now make up a significant portion of their revenue.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the broadcasters have effectively stopped every large scale retransmission effort making encryption unnecessary to protect their broadcast exclusivity rights. What this is really about is making it more difficult for everyday consumers to watch free over the air TV in an effort to push us back onto paid subscription services.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s really important if you care about this issue to make a submission. It doesn’t have to be long – just long enough for you to convey the impact that DRM encryption will have in accessing broadcasts on the public airwaves. </p>
<p>I still plan to drop this petition off with the FCC and congressional stakeholders in person with the Antenna Man. But the more of us who tell the FCC directly the better!</p>

<ul>
<li>The European Council has ended its adoption procedure for rules related to phones with replaceable batteries.</li>
<li>By 2027, all phones released in the EU must have a battery the user can easily replace with no tools or expertise.</li>
<li>The regulation intends to introduce a circular economy for batteries.</li>
</ul>
</div><p>In the middle of June, we shared <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/replaceable-batteries-eu-2023-3335711/">a news report</a> about the future of <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-android-phones-removable-battery-697520/">replaceable batteries in smartphones</a>. That report focused on the European Parliament voting to enact a law forcing manufacturers of all battery-powered devices — including smartphones — to offer easily replaceable batteries.</p><p>This week, the European Council <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2023/07/10/council-adopts-new-regulation-on-batteries-and-waste-batteries/" target="_blank">officially agreed</a> to the new regulation. Now, the only step left is for the European Council and Parliament to sign on the dotted line. Once they do, the clock starts ticking: any manufacturer wanting to sell phones in the EU must ensure those phones have replaceable batteries by 2027.</p><div><h2>Phones with replaceable batteries: What does this law mean?</h2>
<p>The European Council only has jurisdiction over Europe, obviously. So this law will not, technically, have an effect in any other area of the world.</p></div><p>However, that doesn’t really mean much in the grand scheme of things. Companies like Samsung, Google, Apple, etc., don’t design devices specific to Europe. Apple, for example, is not going to create a European iPhone with a replaceable battery and one for the United States without. In other words, this law will change all iPhones. It will also change all tablets, laptops, EVs, e-bikes, and anything else with a rechargeable battery.</p><p>The grace period from now until 2027 is to give OEMs enough time to redesign their products. This new law states, specifically, that users should be able to replace a battery in their phone without any special expertise or tools. Being that almost all smartphones today are designed like a “glass sandwich” that relies on extensive use of adhesives, the very fundamentals of how companies design phones will need to change.</p><p>It’s too early to say yet how this law will change iPhones, Galaxy S phones, Pixels, etc. However, they&nbsp;<strong>will</strong> change in response to this law, which is huge news.</p><div><h2>What is the intention of this law?</h2>
<p>This law exists to force manufacturers to create a circular economy for batteries. A “circular economy” refers to a manufacturing model in which the resources put into it are recycled or reused as much as possible. In a perfect world, the resources needed to create a smartphone would be sourced 100% from older smartphones, so nothing new would ever need to be used. Obviously, the 100% figure would be practically impossible, but getting much closer to 100% is a very realistic goal.</p></div><div><p>Here are some other rules this new law covers related to phones with replaceable batteries:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collection of waste:&nbsp;</strong>OEMs will need to collect 63% of portable batteries that would normally go to a landfill by the end of 2027. By the end of 2030, that number should be at 73%.</li>
<li><strong>Recovery of waste:&nbsp;</strong>Lithium recovery from waste batteries will need to be at 50% by 2027. By the end of 2031, it should be at 80%, meaning 80% of the lithium inside a battery can be recovered and repurposed for new batteries.</li>
<li><strong>Recycling minimums:&nbsp;</strong>Industrial, SLI, and EV batteries will need to be made up of certain percentages of recycled content. Initially, this will be 16% for cobalt, 85% for lead, 6% for lithium, and 6% for nickel.</li>
<li><strong>Early recycling efficiency target: </strong>Nickel-cadmium batteries should have a recycling efficiency target of 80% by the end of 2025. All other batteries should be at a 50% efficiency target by 2025.</li>
</ul>
</div><div><h2>What happens now?</h2>
<p>We likely won’t see anything change this year. However, over the next few years, you’ll likely begin to see smartphones with slightly different designs as manufacturers move toward compliance with this new law. It will take years before manufacturers will have the designs, supply chains, and equipment needed to create phones with replaceable batteries at scale.</p></div><p>Remember that consumers expect certain things from smartphones nowadays, which will mean that OEMs can’t just go back to the old way of doing things. An IP68 rating would be very difficult to obtain while still offering a premium-feeling device with an easily replaceable battery, for example. These are hurdles OEMs will need to get over to be in compliance.</p><p>Regardless, things are going to be very different in just a few years!</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><em>This article is the second in a series that explores potential privacy vulnerabilities in Apple devices. In the <a href="https://fingerprint.com/blog/apple-id-region-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first article</a>, we discussed detecting a system Apple ID region. This article presents a technique for revealing a user's first name without permissions using the mDNS protocol.</em></p><p>

<strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> <a href="https://fingerprint.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fingerprint</a> as a company does not use this technique in our products, and we do not provide cross-site tracking services. We focus on detecting and preventing fraud and supporting modern privacy trends for removing third-party tracking entirely. There should be open discussions about such techniques to help internet browser providers fix them quickly.</p></div>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this article, we explain how the real name of a macOS user can be leaked through a browser without permissions. The proof of concept <a href="https://mdns-name-guesser.vercel.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demo</a> is optimized for performance rather than accuracy and results may be affected by device or network configuration.</p>
<p>The name brute-forcing technique uses a pre-made list of the 50 most popular gender-specific names from a specific country origin. Our experiments showed that this is enough to detect a macOS user’s name correctly in 65% of the cases on average.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="multicast-dns-protocol-and-apple-bonjour">Multicast DNS protocol and Apple Bonjour&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The exploit implementation relies on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multicast DNS</a> (mDNS) protocol. In simple terms, the mDNS protocol is designed to register, discover, or broadcast device names over a local network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, when a specific device, such as a printer, wants to be discovered on a local network, it sends a registration UDP packet to the reserved internal IP address <code>224.0.0.251</code>, which contains a hostname like <code>HP_LaserJet_Printer.local</code>. The <code>.local</code> domain TLD indicates that the hostname should be resolved using the mDNS protocol.</p>
<p>Such packets are automatically broadcast by a router to other devices in a local network, so they can cache the hostname. Alternatively, devices can send query packets to the same reserved IP address and try to discover a specifically named device, which may not exist in the network.</p>
<p>Some examples of mDNS hostnames are:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>johns-mac-mini.local</code></li>
<li><code>david-ZenBook-UX431DA-UM431DA.local</code></li>
<li><code>james-iphone.local</code>&nbsp;</li>
<li><code>canon-mf644c.local</code></li>
<li><code>bedroom-appletv.local</code></li>
<li><code>dlinkrouter.local</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The multicast DNS protocol is widely used on Apple devices as part of the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/bonjour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Bonjour</a> feature.</p>
<p>By default, Apple devices expose the first name of a user in their local hostnames, which we are going to use for the name brute-forcing technique. You can view or change your macOS local hostname in the <strong>Sharing</strong> section of <strong>System Settings.</strong></p>

<h2 id="resolving-mdns-hostnames-from-a-browser">Resolving mDNS hostnames from a browser</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the multicast DNS protocol is based on UDP packets. Browser JavaScript environments do not support arbitrary UDP sockets, so it is not possible to use the mDNS protocol directly in a browser.</p>
<p>However, we can resolve hostnames from browsers by using a timing workaround. Let’s make two regular <code>fetch</code> GET requests to existing <code>device-1.local</code> and non-existing <code>device-2.local</code> mDNS addresses:</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="2" title="" src="https://fingerprint.com/static/26c7e56f5f5d571c768d19409122b586/f7616/2.png" srcset="https://fingerprint.com/static/26c7e56f5f5d571c768d19409122b586/8514f/2.png 192w,

    </span></p>
<p>The browser will try to resolve the hostname provided in a URL address. If the address is resolved, it will send a TCP packet to the 80 port, which in our case will most likely be closed. On the screenshot above you can see two different error messages:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED</code> for the existing <code>device-1.local</code></li>
<li><code>ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED</code> for non-existing <code>device-2.local</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Both errors will be mapped into the same <code>Failed to fetch</code> JavaScript error, so we can’t rely on the error type, but we can perform a timing attack. Local networks are fast, so the valid mDNS hostname registered in the network will be resolved in a reasonable time frame, which is significantly faster than the default connection timeout. In the example above, the difference is four milliseconds for a valid address versus five seconds for an invalid one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This approach is consistent enough for the proof of concept solution and works similarly in all major browsers. In practice, you can use any network JavaScript API, such as <code>iframe</code>, <code>Image</code> or <code>WebRTC</code>, to perform timing attacks for DNS resolving.</p>
<h2 id="macos-user-name-brute-forcing">MacOS user name brute-forcing</h2>
<p>As illustrated earlier, the default macOS local hostname contains the user's first name and device name. Moreover, the hostname depends on a system language locale:</p>
<ul>
<li>English: <code>&lt;name&gt;s-macbook-pro.local</code></li>
<li>French: <code>macbook-air-de-&lt;name&gt;.local</code></li>
<li>Russian: <code>mac-mini-&lt;name&gt;.local</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, we can take the top 1,000 names, the top 10 locales, and five common macOS device names. In this scenario, it would be necessary to test 50,000 distinct hostnames, which might take over an hour. A more efficient strategy would be to limit the search scope to a single locale, a single device, and the 50 most common names within that specific locale. While this affects accuracy, it makes the attack more feasible in practical terms and significantly faster in general.</p>
<p>The locale selection can be based on a browser time zone, language, or IP address location. Safari browser, for example, reveals the system locale with the <code>navigator.language</code> property, which is typically consistent with the targeted hostname locale. Also, there are other workarounds to discover the user's country of origin, such as the <a href="https://fingerprint.com/blog/apple-id-region-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple ID region detection</a> method discussed previously.</p>
<p>The device options can be narrowed down by using the screen resolution. For instance, the <code>1728x1117</code> resolution is most likely a 16-inch Macbook Pro. An extended screen can be detected by using the <code>screen.isExtended</code> property, which will fallback the device options to three to five of the most commonly used Apple macOS devices.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://mdns-name-guesser.vercel.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proof of concept demo</a> has a name country origin and name gender selectors, which results in 50-100 potential hostnames that can be enumerated within seconds. Among the 100 FingerprintJS employees who participated in an internal test, the demo successfully predicted the name in 65% of instances. <a href="https://github.com/fingerprintjs/blog-macos-mdns-brute-force" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The source code is available on GitHub.</a></p>

<p>It's important to mention that the proof of concept demo is simply a demonstration of the attack and may not be successful in some cases. Some of the factors that could impact the results are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The presence of rare or unique names or non-standard macOS hostnames</li>
<li>Particular network configurations or VPN networks</li>
<li>Enabled firewall in macOS network settings</li>
</ul>
<p>If the demo does not work for you, consider using the advanced configuration settings to verify the list of the probed names and the device name pattern applied. If you use a VPN, consider testing it with and without VPN, because the result may change.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Considering the inherent weaknesses and numerous limitations, this attack isn't practical. It can be effortlessly detected in the network tab of browser developer tools unless there is deliberate intent from a website owner to de-anonymize its visitors.</p>
<p>This series of articles merely explores the boundaries of internet privacy and relies on unconventional privacy breaching techniques. As another example, by combining this method with <a href="https://fingerprint.com/blog/external-protocol-flooding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">detection of installed applications</a>, there’s a potential to develop a harmful website capable of displaying your real name and job title, based on the list of professional applications used, all without requiring any permissions.</p>
<p>Even though this article mentions Apple devices running macOS, the mDNS discovery technique can be utilized in variety of ways. For instance, it could be used to perform a local network scan to detect devices such as printers, smart TVs, smart speakers, and other home IoT devices.</p>
<p>This method is also applicable to iPhones and iPads, given that <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/wi-fi-syncing-mchlada1d602/mac" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sync over Wi-Fi</a> or Safari remote debug features are activated.</p></div></div>]]></description>

        <h2 id="how-hype-will-turn-your-security-key-into-junk">How Hype Will Turn Your Security Key Into Junk</h2>
<p>In the last few months there has been a lot of hype about "passkeys"
and how they are going to change authentication forever. But that hype
will come at a cost.</p>
<p>Obsession with passkeys are about to turn your security keys (yubikeys,
feitian, nitrokeys, ...) into obsolete and useless junk.</p>
<p>It all comes down to one thing - resident keys.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-resident-key">What is a Resident Key</h2>
<p>To understand the problem, we need to understand what a
discoverable/resident key is.</p>
<p>You have probably seen that most keys support an 'unlimited' number of
accounts. This is achieved by sending a "key wrapped key" to the
security key. When the Relying Party (Authentication Server) wants to
authenticate your security key, it will provide you a "credential id".
That credential ID is an encrypted blob that only your security key can
decrypt. If your security key can decrypt that blob it yields a private
key that is specific to that single RP that you can use for signatures.</p>

<p>This is what is called a non-resident or non-discoverable credential.
The reason is that the private key must be <em>discovered</em> by the security
key having the Credential ID provided to it externally. This is because
the private keys are <em>not resident</em> inside the security enclave - only
the master key is.</p>
<p>Contrast to this, a resident key or discoverable credential is one where
the private key is <em>stored</em> in the security key itself. This allows the
security key to discover (hence the name) what private keys might be
used in the authentication.</p>

<p>Now, the primary difference here is that resident/discoverable keys
consume <em>space</em> on the security key to store them since they need to
persist - there is no credential id to rely on to decrypt with our
master key!</p>
<h3 id="are-non-resident-keys-less-secure">Are non-resident keys less secure?</h3>
<p>A frequent question here is if non resident keys are less secure than
resident ones. Credential ID's as key wrapped keys are secure since
they are encrypted with aes128 and hmaced. This prevents them being
tampered with or decrypted by an external source. If aes128 were broken
and someone could decrypt your private-key in abscence of your security
key, they probably could also break TLS encyrption, attack ssh and do
much worse. Your key wrapped keys rely on the same security features
that TLS relies on.</p>
<h2 id="resident-keys-and-your-security-key">Resident Keys and Your Security Key</h2>
<p>Now that we know what a resident key is, we can look at how these work
with your security keys.</p>
<p>Since resident keys store their key in the device, this needs to consume
<em>space</em> inside the security key. Generally, resident key slots are at a
premium on a security key. Nitrokeys for example only support 8 resident
keys. Yubikeys generally support between 20 and 32. Some keys support
<em>no</em> resident keys at all.</p>
<p>The other problem is what CTAP standard your key implements. There are
three versions - CTAP2.0, CTAP2.1PRE and CTAP2.1.</p>
<p>In CTAP2.1 (the latest) you can individually manage, update and delete
specific resident keys from your device.</p>
<p>In CTAP2.0 and CTAP2.1PRE however, you can not. You can not delete a
residentkey without <em>resetting the whole device</em>. Resetting the device
also resets your master key, meaning all your non-resident keys will no
longer work either. This makes resident keys on a CTAP2.0 and CTAP2.1PRE
device a serious commitment. You really don't want to accidentally fill
up that limited space you have!</p>
<p>In most cases, your key is <em>very likely</em> to be CTAP2.0 or CTAP2.1PRE.</p>
<h2 id="so-why-are-resident-keys-a-problem">So Why Are Resident Keys a Problem?</h2>
<p>On their own, and used carefully resident keys are great for certain
applications. The problem is the hype and obsession with <em>passkeys</em>.</p>
<p>In 2022 Apple annouced their passkeys feature on MacOS/iOS allowing the
use of touchid/faceid as a webauthn authenticator similar to your
security key. Probably quite wisely, rather than calling them
"touchid" or "credentials" or "authenticators" Apple chose to have
a nicer name for users. Honestly passkeys is a good name rather than
"webauthn authenticator" or "security key". It evokes a similar
concept to passwords which people are highly accustomed to, while also
being different enough with the 'key' to indicate that it operates in
a different way.</p>
<p>The problem (from an external view) is that passkeys was a branding or
naming term of something - but overnight authentication thought leaders
needed to be <em>on the hype</em>. "What is a passkey?". Since Apple didn't
actually define it, this left a void for our thought leaders to answer
that question for users hungry to know "what indeed is a passkey?".</p>
<p>As a creator of a relying party and the webauthn library for Rust, we
defined passkeys as the name for "all possible authenticators" that a
person may choose to use. We wanted to support the goal to remove and
eliminate passwords, and passkeys are a nice name for this.</p>
<p>Soon after that, some community members took to referring to passkeys to
mean "credentials that are synchronised between multiple devices".
This definition is at the least, not harmful, even if it doesn't
express that there are many possible types of authenticators that can be
used.</p>
<p>Some months later a person took the stage at FIDO's Authenticate
conference and annouced "a passkey is a resident key". Because of the
scale and size of the platform, this definition has now stuck. This
definition has become so invasive that even <em>FIDO</em> now use it as <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/#faq">their
definition</a>.</p>
<p>Part of the reason this definition is hyped is because it works with an
upcoming browser feature that allows autocomplete of a username and
webauthn credential if the key is resident. You don't have to type your
username. This now means that we have webauthn libraries pushing for
residentkey as a requirement for all registrations, and many people will
follow this advice without seeing the problem.</p>
<p>The problem is that security keys with their finite storage and lack of
credential management will fill up <em>rapidly</em>. In my password manager I
have more than 150 stored passwords. If all of these were to become
resident keys I would need to buy at lesat 5 yubikeys to store all the
accounts, and then another 5-10 as "backups". I really don't want to
have to juggle and maintain 10 to 15 yubikeys ...</p>
<p>This is an awful user experience to put it mildly. People who choose to
use security keys, now won't be able to due to passkeys resident key
requirements. What will also confuse users is this comes on the tail of
FIDO certified keys marketing with statements (which are true with
non-resident keys) like:</p>
<p><em>Infinite key pair storage</em></p>
<p><em>There is no limit to the number of accounts registered in [redacted]
FIDO® Security Key.</em></p>
<p>To add further insult, an expressed goal of the Webauthn Work Group is
that users should always be free to choose any authenticator they wish
without penalty. Passkeys forcing key residency flies directly in the
face of this.</p>
<p>This leaves few authenticator types which will work properly in this
passkey world. Apples own passkeys, Android passkeys, password managers
that support webauthn, Windows with TPM 2.0, and Chromium based browsers
on MacOS (because of how they use the touchid as a TPM).</p>

<p>Rather than passkeys being resident keys, passkeys could be expanded to
be all possible authenticators where some subset opportunistically are
resident. This puts passwordless front and center with residency as a
bonus ui/ux for those who opt to use devices that support unlimited
resident keys.</p>
<p>Currently there are three levels of request an RP can make to request
resident keys. Discouraged, Preferred and Required. Here is what happens
with different authenticator types when you submit each level.</p>

<p>Notice that in rk=preferred the three columns behave the same as
rk=required?</p>
<p>Rather than passkeys setting rk=required, if rk=preferred were softened
so that on preferred meant "create a resident key only if storage is
unlimited" then we would have a situation where Android/iOS would
always get resident keys, and security keys would not have space
consumed.</p>
<p>However, so far the WG is resistant to this change. It is not out of the
question that browsers could implement this change externally, but that
would in reality be down to the chrome team to decide.</p>
<h3 id="insist-on-your-passkey-library-setting-rk-discouraged">Insist on your Passkey library setting rk=discouraged</h3>
<p>Rather than rk=required which excludes security keys, rk=discouraged is
the next best thing. Yes it means that android users won't get
conditional UI. But what do we prefer - some people have to type a
username (that already has provisions to autocomplete anyway). Or do we
damage and exclude security keys completely?</p>
<h3 id="contact-fido-and-request-rk-storage-as-a-certification-feature">Contact FIDO and request RK storage as a certification feature</h3>
<p>Currently FIDO doesn't mandate any amount of storage requirements for
certified devices. Given that FIDO also seem to want resident keys, then
they should also mandate that certified devices have the ability to
store thousands of resident keys. This way as a consumer you can pick
and select certified devices.</p>
<h3 id="something-else">Something Else?</h3>
<p>If you have other ideas on how to improve this let me know!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The hype around passkeys being resident keys will prevent - or severly
hinder - users of security keys from choosing the authenticator they
want to use online in the future.</p>
