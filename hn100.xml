This letter verifies the company's request for privacy, indicating that the documents contain "confidential and proprietary trade secrets." The cover letter asks for the documents to be withheld from public view "indefinitely." Apple even suggested that a release of the files could give competitors an "unfair advantage."</p><p>To that end, the documents feature full schematics of the iPhone 16e. These include block diagrams, electrical schematic diagrams, antenna locations and more. Competitors could simply buy a handset and open it up to get to this information, as the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-16e-review-whats-your-acceptable-compromise-020016288.html" data-ylk="slk:iPhone 16e came out back in February;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"><ins>iPhone 16e came out back in February</ins></a>, but this leak would eliminate any guesswork.

CEO Tim Cook even <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/engadget-podcast-apple-bows-to-the-trump-regime-again-113025360.html" data-ylk="slk:brought the president a gold trophy;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"><ins>brought the president a gold trophy</ins></a> for being such a good and important boy.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>Claude Sonnet 4.5 is the best coding model in the world. It's the strongest model for building complex agents. It’s the best model at using computers. And it shows substantial gains in reasoning and math.</p><p>Code is everywhere. It runs every application, spreadsheet, and software tool you use. Being able to use those tools and reason through hard problems is how modern work gets done.</p><p>Claude Sonnet 4.5 makes this possible.

In <a href="https://anthropic.com/news/enabling-claude-code-to-work-more-autonomously" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claude Code</a>, we've added checkpoints—one of our most requested features—that save your progress and allow you to roll back instantly to a previous state. We've refreshed the terminal interface and shipped a <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anthropic.claude-code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">native VS Code extension</a>. We've added a new <a href="https://anthropic.com/news/context-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">context editing feature and memory tool</a> to the Claude API that lets agents run even longer and handle even greater complexity.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-mdx-content="true"><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="627" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://jameelur.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffriction-growth.dcafe3c3.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75 1x, https://jameelur.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffriction-growth.dcafe3c3.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://jameelur.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffriction-growth.dcafe3c3.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><p>The title of this article says it all. Overcoming friction leads to growth. Comfort leads to stagnation.</p>
<p>ChatGPT and by extension “AI” is likely the biggest “revolution” of my generation. It is likely also going to be the biggest killer of creativity in my generation. I always thought the creativity killer was going to be access to infinite entertainment. I think I was wrong.</p>
<p>I’ve come to believe that with the rise of convenience and comfort, it becomes harder for us to reach our potential. Technology and Capitalism is taking us towards an extreme.</p>
<p>A certain level of convenience can lead to efficiency gains. Automation is important for a reason. Too much convenience though, that's a killer. When friction was inherent in the system, applying ourselves led to growth as we overcame that friction. We simply didn’t have an alternative that was viable. And this principle applies to everything.</p>
<p>When I was a child in Sri Lanka, I ended up memorizing the landline numbers of all my close relatives. To this day I remember them. The moment I got a phone where my contacts could be saved, I stopped remembering numbers. It may seem like a small thing but it illustrates the principle. The ease of access to information has geared us towards efficiently looking up information instead of remembering it. I won't argue the utility of having hundreds of numbers saved on your phone, I simply want to make a point. Overcoming friction leads to growth.</p>
<p>Let's take another activity where creativity is important, writing. When it's easier to prompt ChatGPT to write your college essay, you'll never apply yourself. Afterall, when everyone is doing it, why not you? As everyone uses ChatGPT, the expectation of high quality writing will increase, making it harder for people to be vulnerable. You can’t become a master without making mistakes and learning from it.</p>
<p>Humans are creatures of comfort. Just like so many things in this world, we follow the path of least resistance. With access to technology being ubiquitous, and ChatGPT being so widely available, to choose not to use it is very hard. You need to deliberately prioritize your growth and choose to go against the current. You need to deliberately introduce friction to the process.</p>
<p>That said, total abstinence is not the solution. ChatGPT is here to stay. Just like most advancements in technology are. As a child of the 21st Century, you’ll need to learn to utilize this new tool in a manner that aids you, not hinders you. More importantly, not hinder the <strong>future</strong> you.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content" id="article-content"><p>A year ago, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/oracle/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/oracle/">Oracle</a> cofounder and Chairman Larry Ellison described a future where everyone, including law enforcement, <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/09/17/oracle-larry-ellison-surveillance-state-police-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/09/17/oracle-larry-ellison-surveillance-state-police-ai/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/09/17/oracle-larry-ellison-surveillance-state-police-ai/">will face regular surveillance</a> as daily life is documented seemingly nonstop.</p><div>



<p>At Oracle’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oracle.com/events/financial-analyst-meeting-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.oracle.com/events/financial-analyst-meeting-2024/">financial analyst meeting</a>&nbsp;last September, he predicted artificial intelligence will help process the vast amounts of footage recorded by cameras placed on everything from car dashboards and front doors to security systems and cops.



</p><p>“We’re going to have supervision,” Ellison said. “Every police officer is going to be supervised at all times, and if there’s a problem, AI will report that problem and report it to the appropriate person. Citizens will be on their best behavior because we are constantly recording and reporting everything that’s going on.”



</p><p>Those comments have gained fresh relevance now that his company has emerged as a major player in the AI industry and is poised to play a critical role in the deal for TikTok’s U.S. operations. TikTok’s video-sharing platform is among the most popular social media properties in the country.



</p><p>Oracle didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The company has been an AI infrastructure provider and stunned Wall Street earlier this month by reaching a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/openai-oracle-sign-300-billion-computing-deal-among-biggest-in-history-ff27c8fe?st=vUBGuq&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.wsj.com/business/openai-oracle-sign-300-billion-computing-deal-among-biggest-in-history-ff27c8fe?st=vUBGuq&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.wsj.com/business/openai-oracle-sign-300-billion-computing-deal-among-biggest-in-history-ff27c8fe?st=vUBGuq&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink">$300 billion deal with OpenAI</a>, which will purchase computing power over about five years in one of the largest cloud contracts ever signed. 



</p><p>And earlier this week, OpenAI signed deals with SoftBank and Oracle&nbsp;for new data centers as part of the massive Stargate Project.



</p><p>In its most recent quarterly earnings call with analysts, management also offered&nbsp;revenue projections that cited $455 billion in contracts, up 359% from a year earlier.&nbsp;CEO Safra Catz&nbsp;revealed that Oracle landed deals with three different customers during the quarter.



</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://fortune.com/how-we-test-supplements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/how-we-test-supplements/" data-type="page" data-id="4319596">Oracle is expected to be among the companies</a> that will buy TikTok’s U.S. business from Chinese parent company ByteDance. In addition, Oracle&nbsp;will spearhead U.S. oversight of the algorithm and security.



</p><p>President Donald Trump on Thursday afternoon signed an executive order clearing the way for a deal to put TikTok in U.S. hands. The <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/09/25/trumps-billionaire-backers-tiktok-deal-murdochs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2025/09/25/trumps-billionaire-backers-tiktok-deal-murdochs/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2025/09/25/trumps-billionaire-backers-tiktok-deal-murdochs/">U.S. ownership structure is still being finalized</a>, but Trump said&nbsp;Oracle&nbsp;and Ellison would play a “big” role in managing the app, while conservative media mogul Rupert Murdoch and computer billionaire Michael Dell would sit on the board. Trump hinted that three more “blue-chip” backers are also part of the ownership group.</p><p>Vice President JD Vance said that the algorithm will be “under the control of American investors,” adding that more details would be forthcoming.&nbsp;



</p><p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tiktok-algorithm-secured-oracle-trump-100000512.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tiktok-algorithm-secured-oracle-trump-100000512.html">Reports earlier this week</a>&nbsp;said&nbsp;Oracle&nbsp;will re-create TikTok’s algorithm and provide a new U.S. version while also ensuring security for users’ data.



</p><p>“This deal will allow for the U.S. to control the app’s algorithm,” Vance said. “It’s actually going to be American-operated all the way.”

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<article>
    <p>I am very much enjoying my newly-resurrected hobby of Airsoft.</p>
<p>Running around in the woods, firing small plastic pellets at other people, in pursuit of a contrived-to-be-fun mission, turns out to be, well, fun.</p>
<p>I have also had to accept that, for some other players, part of that fun comes from making videos of their game days, and uploading them to YouTube.</p>
<p>They often have quite impressive setups, with multiple cameras - head, rear-facing from barrel of weapon, and scope cam - and clearly put time, money, and effort into doing this.</p>
<p>Great! Just like someone taking photos on their holidays, or when out and about, I can see the fun in it.</p>
<p>It is the “non-consensually publishing it online for the world to see” aspect which bugs me a bit.</p>
<p>In the handful of games that I have played, no-one has ever asked about consent of other participants.</p>
<p>There has been no “put on this purple lanyard if you don’t want to be included in the public version of the video” rule, which I’ve seen work pretty well at conferences I have attended (even if it is opt-out rather than consent).</p>
<p>I could, I suppose, ask each person that I see with a camera “would you mind not including me in anything you upload, please?”. And, since everyone with whom I’ve spoken at games, so far anyway, has been perfectly pleasant and friendly, I’d be hopeful that they would at least consider my request. I have not done this.</p>
<p>The impression I get is that this is just seen as part and parcel of the hobby: by running around in the woods of northern Newbury on a Sunday morning, I need to accept that I may well appear on YouTube, for the world to see.</p>
<p>I don’t love it, but it is not a big enough deal for me to make a fuss.</p>
<h2 id="other-notes">Other notes</h2>
<p>I occasionally see people saying “well, if you don’t want to be in photos published online, don’t be in public spaces”.</p>
<p>This is nonsense, for a number of reasons. Clearly, one should be able to exist in society, including going outside one’s own home, without needing to accept this kind of thing.</p>
<p>In any case, here, the issue is somewhat different, since it is a private site, where people engage in private activity (a hobby).</p>
<p>But then I’ve seen the same at (private) conferences, with people saying “Of course I’m free to take photos of identifiable individuals without their consent and publish them online”.</p>
<p>Publishing someone’s photo online, without their consent, without another strong justification, just because they happen to be in view of one’s camera lens, feels wrong to me.</p>
<p>This isn’t about what is legal (although, in some cases, claims of legality may be poorly conceived), but around my own perceptions of a private life, and a dislike for the fact that, just because one <em>can</em> publish such things, that one <em>should</em>.</p>

<p dir="auto">We are excited to announce the official release of DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp, an experimental version of our model. As an intermediate step toward our next-generation architecture, V3.2-Exp builds upon V3.1-Terminus by introducing DeepSeek Sparse Attention—a sparse attention mechanism designed to explore and validate optimizations for training and inference efficiency in long-context scenarios.</p>
<p dir="auto">This experimental release represents our ongoing research into more efficient transformer architectures, particularly focusing on improving computational efficiency when processing extended text sequences.</p>

</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA) achieves fine-grained sparse attention for the first time, delivering substantial improvements in long-context training and inference efficiency while maintaining virtually identical model output quality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">To rigorously evaluate the impact of introducing sparse attention, we deliberately aligned the training configurations of DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp with V3.1-Terminus. Across public benchmarks in various domains, DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp demonstrates performance on par with V3.1-Terminus.</p>

<p>When I set out to write a program that would allow me to do basic digital photography on the Apple II, I decided I would do it with the Quicktake cameras. It seemed the obvious choice as they were Apple cameras, and their interface to the computer is via serial port.</p>



<p>The scope creeped a bit after managing to decode Quicktake 100 photos. I wanted it to be able to decode Quicktake 150 and Quicktake 200 pictures too. This threw me into image processing much more than I initially wanted to. This article explains the process of how I got the Quicktake 150 decoder to a reasonabl-ish speed on a 6502 at 1MHz.</p>



<p>The Quicktake 150 format is proprietary and undocumented. Free software decoders exist though, in the dcraw project. This was my source for the initial Apple II decoder. Sadly, it is written in C, is extremely non-documented, and is extremely hard to read and understand (to me). The compression is based on Huffman coding, with variable-length codes (which means bit-shifting), and the image construction involves a lot of 16-bits math. None of this is good on a 6502.</p>



<p>But first I had to rework the original algorithm to work with bands of 20 pixels, for memory reasons. Once I had a functional decoder, it ran perfectly, but it took… seventy minutes to decode a single picture.</p>

<p>Of course, I didn’t get there that fast. My first implementation was released two years ago, in November 2023. Getting where I’m now took, I think, five or six deep dives with each time, one or two weeks worth of late evenings and full week-ends dedicated to progressing, wading through hundreds or thousands of debug printf()s, gdb’ing, variables and offsets comparisons, etc.</p>



<p>Follow me through the algorithmic iterations that allowed me to get that decoding time to under one minute. My implementation is now full assembly, but the commits I will link to here are to the general decoding algorithm, that is easier to read in C. </p>



<p>I have noticed that hand-optimizing assembler yields good results, but usually optimizing the algorithm itself leads to much more impressive speed gains. Doing <strong>too many things</strong> faster is not as good as doing <strong>the minimum</strong> faster. And that Quicktake 150 decoder sure did useless things, especially in my case where I don’t care about color and end up with a 256×192 image!</p>



<p>I have made a specific repository to track these algorithmic changes. It started <a href="https://github.com/colinleroy/qtkn_decoder/commit/ceef883b4528a01658f446f9fde233d8846b98e0#diff-538608780127f20219d177da9582dffbd84063d74807cd8980d62ee09f7689a3" data-type="link" data-id="https://github.com/colinleroy/qtkn_decoder/commit/ceef883b4528a01658f446f9fde233d8846b98e0#diff-538608780127f20219d177da9582dffbd84063d74807cd8980d62ee09f7689a3">here</a> (already a little bit deobfuscated <a href="https://github.com/ncruces/dcraw/blob/8fe4d3825595816ea7d6880d9253f9edd143cacb/dcraw.c#L2198">compared to dcraw</a>), at 301 millions x86_64 instructions.</p>



<p><strong>Dropping color</strong></p>



<p>I didn’t have to decode color at all, as I was going to drop it, anyway. <a href="https://github.com/colinleroy/qtkn_decoder/commit/615ecd7406a65dd43da07443cb5c3f93a8d5fa95#diff-538608780127f20219d177da9582dffbd84063d74807cd8980d62ee09f7689a3R217">I added a flag to only decode the green pixels out of the Bayer matrix, and drop the rest</a>. 264M instructions.</p>



<p><strong>Understanding the buffers</strong></p>



<p>I then set out to understand the use of the various temporary buffers: the more buffers, the more intermediary steps, the more copy and looping. I wanted to drop as much of them as possible. <a href="https://github.com/colinleroy/qtkn_decoder/commit/fd6cd2c44d1cc961f8827ec6b5958521543e6d8d#diff-538608780127f20219d177da9582dffbd84063d74807cd8980d62ee09f7689a3L244">The first step towards it was unrolling some little imbricated loops that worked on y [1,2], x [col+1,col].</a> 238M instructions.</p>



<p>I figured I still had extra processing I didn’t need, <a href="https://github.com/colinleroy/qtkn_decoder/commit/73935481468c2a1d20a4640352caed4e47308b54#diff-538608780127f20219d177da9582dffbd84063d74807cd8980d62ee09f7689a3">removed it, dropped a buffer</a> (and dropped the #ifdef COLOR conditional to make things clearer). 193M instructions.</p>

<p>At that point, my implementation still outputted green pixels only in a Bayer matrix to a 640×480 buffer, and then interpolated them.

<p>At this point I was able to figure out that out of the three buf_m[3], only <a href="https://github.com/colinleroy/qtkn_decoder/commit/b3ac5d70edf0e836aa4b784fc06093d2606f7747">buf_m[1] was used to construct the picture</a>, that <a href="https://github.com/colinleroy/qtkn_decoder/commit/8b6a1c65011645c810f1a9fbb7d9eb56fe3e702e">buf_m[2] was only used to feed back into buf_m[0] at the start of a row</a>, that I could <a href="https://github.com/colinleroy/qtkn_decoder/commit/b44aac77d966c292f0762165cdf5b0818a8a0f91">construct the image from the buf_m[1] values on the fly instead of doing an extra loop on it</a>, and that <a href="https://github.com/colinleroy/qtkn_decoder/commit/4142412bda1388b6fadb5d343de07605c1e93ae8">I could entirely drop it too</a>. This allowed me to <a href="https://github.com/colinleroy/qtkn_decoder/commit/5161e9e33e5c3f064b0a3c0e5d29e6e7ece4280f" data-type="link" data-id="https://github.com/colinleroy/qtkn_decoder/commit/5161e9e33e5c3f064b0a3c0e5d29e6e7ece4280f">rename the last remaining buffer for more clarity</a>. 22M instructions. </p>



<p><strong>Optimizing divisions</strong></p>



<p>That was about it for the buffers. The rework of the code, at that point, made clear that every final pixel value was computed by dividing the 16-bits values computed from the image data by a given factor, and that this factor changes at most once every two rows. The result of that division was then clamped to [0-255]. This allowed me to <a href="https://github.com/colinleroy/qtkn_decoder/commit/865ca287f15bfccbca909b464b5939d8c4368f5a">precompute a division table every two rows, storing the final result, pre-clamped, in a simple array.</a> This also came with a bit of non-visible precision loss. On an x86_64, still 22M instructions, but on 6502, this was a huge gain, transforming 153600 divisions into less than 2000.</p>



<p>I verified the precision loss was acceptable using a small ad-hoc tool displaying my output buffers and comparing the reference decoding to the approximated one. Pixel values differ by at most 1.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.colino.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/image-122.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1541" height="386" src="https://www.colino.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/image-122.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.colino.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/image-122.png 1541w, https://www.colino.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/image-122-400x100.png 400w, https://www.colino.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/image-122-150x38.png 150w, https://www.colino.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/image-122-768x192.png 768w, https://www.colino.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/image-122-1536x385.png 1536w, https://www.colino.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/image-122-1280x321.png 1280w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1541px) 100vw, 1541px"></a><figcaption>Left: the normal output; middle: the comparison; right: the output with approximated divisions</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Output index</strong></p>



<p>So far we set the output buffer using the usual <strong>buffer[y*WIDTH+x]</strong> access method, which is really slow on a processor with no multiplication support. <a href="https://github.com/colinleroy/qtkn_decoder/commit/7112b2b96e3d249f4a65532035dff9a8708bc914">I changed that to a much simpler line-by-line indexing</a>. (Even on x86_64, the change is notable: 20M instructions).</p>



<p><strong>Huffman decoding</strong></p>



<p>The algorithm initialized full tables so that it was possible to get a Huffman code by just looking at the bitbuffer: for code <strong>10001</strong>, for example, all codes from <strong>10001000</strong> to <strong>10001111</strong> were matched to the correct value, then the bitbuffer shifted &lt;&lt;5. This seems good at first, but not on 6502, as this requires a 16-bits bitbuffer to make sure we always have a full byte to look at. <a href="https://github.com/colinleroy/qtkn_decoder/commit/b0179e034a4396b8b6d09d489608bf0080e7b8d6">I reworked that to get bits one at a time</a>. This made the x86_64 implementation slower, but the 6502 one 20 seconds faster, spending 9 seconds shifting bits instead of 29. It also allowed me to pack the tables more tight, freeing up some memory for the cache.</p>



<p><strong>Assembly</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/colinleroy/qtkn_decoder/blob/b0179e034a4396b8b6d09d489608bf0080e7b8d6/qtkn-decoder.c">This algorithm</a> still performs very poorly when compiled by cc65, but is far easier to manually translate into optimized 6502 assembly. There are also a lot of ad-hoc optimisations, for example:</p>



<ul>
<li>The division factor for final pixel values for a pair of rows is 48 more than 50% of the time, on any image I tested. So the 6502 implementation has two divisions lookup tables, one for 48 that is never recomputed, one for another factor, recomputed if needed at the start of a pair of rows.</li>



<li>The row initialization multiplies all 320 next_line values by a factor, which is 255 about 66% of the time. In this case, instead of multiplying a = a*255, the assembly version does (a*256)-a, which is (a&lt;&lt;8)-a, which is much faster.</li>



<li>There is a whole lot of &lt;&lt;4 going on in the main loop, which is lookup-table based in the assembly implementation. &lt;&lt;4 is larger than 8 bits, so there are two tables needed, but it still is worth the memory usage.</li>



<li>Half the Huffman codes read are discarded (they are used for blue and red pixels), so “discarder” functions are used in that case, only shifting the bitbuffer without fetching the value.</li>



<li>Buffers accesses (to next_line and output buffer) are patched in self-modifying code rather than using zero-page pointers, which require to keep track and patch about 54 labels on each page cross. This is ugly as hell, but this requires about 50k cycles per image, but spares 9M cycles overall.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>The final code</strong></p>



<p>I have pointed to commits to my “test” repository so far, but if you’re interested in the actual 6502 implementation, you can find it in my repository: <a href="https://github.com/colinleroy/a2tools/blob/master/src/quicktake/qtkn_platform.s">the decoder</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/colinleroy/a2tools/blob/master/src/quicktake/qtk_bithuff.s">the bitbuffer</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Questions remain</strong></p>



<p>There still are things I don’t understand in dcraw’s decoder, that my simplifications didn’t uncover. The main thing I wonder is, how did Dave Coffin, dcraw’s author, implement this decoder first? It seems so full of “magic” numbers and arithmetic operations that I have no idea how one would look at pictures at the bit level, and figure out <em>anything</em> about the format. Did he reverse-engineer Apple’s binary? Did he have documentation? Is it in fact a common kind of encoding I have no idea about?</p>



<p>I would love to see documentation of this format, maybe I would understand more and be able to progress further.</p>

            <p>Google appears to have deleted its political ad archive for the EU; so the last 7 years of ads, of political spending, of messaging, of targeting - on YouTube, on Search and for display ads - for countless elections across 27 countries - is all gone. </p><p>We had been told that Google would try to stop people placing political ads, a "ban" that was to come into effect this week. I did not read anywhere that this would mean the erasure of this archive of our political history. </p><p>When you go to the Google Ad Archive (which you can here: <a href="https://adstransparency.google.com/?region=IE&amp;ref=thebriefing.ie">https://adstransparency.google.com/</a>) until last week you could search all political ads shown in your country by a date range of your choosing going back to 2018. You could browse all the ads in that range, or search for keywords, candidates, parties. You could view each ad - watch the video, see the images - who had been targeted, how much had been spent etc. </p><p>Now when you try to click on "political ads" you get re-directed to a page asking you to select from a small number of countries - the US, of course, UK, India, Australia, Brazil, Israel - but not one EU country (see below): </p><figure><img src="https://www.thebriefing.ie/content/images/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-28-at-10.38.47.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="585" height="819"><figcaption><span>The page you are diverted too if you try to find political ads on Google. </span></figcaption></figure><p>The political ad archive - now deleted? - allowed people like me (and many others) to understand what happened in elections, like this longer piece I was able to write during the European &amp; Local elections last year on the use of YouTube by a far right party, Sinn Féin's big push on search result ads, and the growth of attacks ads in Ireland: </p><figure><a href="https://www.thebriefing.ie/campaign-round-up-google-youtube-ad-spend/"><div><p>Campaign round up: Irish Freedom Party dominating YouTube ad spend</p><p>The Irish Freedom Party spent €4,100 in the past 3 weeks on YouTube ads, the biggest spenders on YouTube ads this election.</p><p><img src="https://www.thebriefing.ie/content/images/icon/tb-logos-61.png" alt=""><span>Liz Carolan</span></p></div><p><img src="https://www.thebriefing.ie/content/images/thumbnail/Website-1920x1080-7.png" alt="" onerror="this.style.display = 'none'"></p></a></figure><p>Now you need the specific name of an advertiser, and when I looked for, for example, "Sinn Fein", it (a) only gave me the option of searching for their website, and (b) showed zero results.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/taste/">https://www.seangoedecke.com/taste/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45410940">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Technical taste is different from technical skill. You can be technically strong but have bad taste, or technically weak with good taste. Like taste in general, technical taste sometimes runs ahead of your ability: just like you can tell good food from bad without being able to cook, you can know what kind of software you like before you’ve got the ability to build it. You can develop technical ability by study and repetition, but good taste is developed in a more mysterious way.</p>
<p>Here are some indicators of software taste:</p>
<ul>
<li>What kind of code “looks good” to you? What kind of code “looks ugly”?</li>
<li>Which design decisions you feel really good about, and which ones are just fine?</li>
<li>Which software problems really bother you, to the point where you’re worrying about them outside of work? Which problems can you just brush off?</li>
</ul>
<p>I think taste is <strong>the ability to adopt the set of engineering values that fit your current project</strong>.</p>
<h3>Why taste is different from skill</h3>
<p>Aren’t the indicators above just a part of skill? For instance, doesn’t code look good <em>if it’s good code</em>? I don’t think so.</p>
<p>Let’s take an example. Personally, I feel like code that uses map and filter looks nicer than using a for loop. It’s tempting to think that this is a case of me being straightforwardly correct about a point of engineering. For instance, map and filter typically involve pure functions, which are easier to reason about, and they avoid an entire class of off-by-one iterator bugs. It feels to me like this isn’t a matter of taste, but a case where I’m right and other engineers are wrong.</p>
<p>But of course it’s more complicated than that. Languages like Golang don’t contain map and filter at all, for principled reasons. Iterating with a for loop is easier to reason about from a performance perspective, and is more straightforward to extend to other iteration strategies (like taking two items at a time). I don’t care about these reasons as much as I care about the reasons in favour of map and filter - that’s why I don’t write a lot of for loops - but it would be far too arrogant for me to say that engineers who prefer for loops are simply less skilled. In many cases, they have technical capabilites that I don’t have. They just care about different things.</p>
<p>In other words, our disagreement comes down to a difference in <em>values</em>. I wrote about this point in <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/confidence"><em>I don’t know how to build software and you don’t either</em></a>. Even if the big technical debates do have definite answers, no working software engineer is ever in a position to know what those answers are, because you can only fit so much experience into one career. We are all at least partly relying on our own personal experience: on our particular set of engineering values.</p>
<h3>What engineering taste actually is</h3>
<p>Almost every decision in software engineering is a tradeoff. You’re rarely picking between two options where one is strictly better. Instead, each option has its own benefits and downsides. Often you have to make hard tradeoffs between engineering <em>values</em>: past a certain point, you cannot easily increase performance without harming readability, for instance<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Really understanding this point is (in my view) the biggest indicator of maturity in software engineering. Immature engineers are rigid about their decisions. They think it’s always better to do X or Y. Mature engineers are usually willing to consider both sides of a decision, because they know that both sides come with different benefits. The trick is not deciding if technology X is better than Y, but whether the benefits of X outweigh Y <em>in this particular case</em>.</p>
<p>In other words, <strong>immature engineers are too inflexible about their taste</strong>. They know what they like, but they mistake that liking for a principled engineering position. What defines a particular engineer’s taste?</p>
<p>In my view, <strong>your engineering taste is composed of the set of engineering values you find most important</strong>. For instance:</p>
<p><strong>Resiliency</strong>. If an infrastructure component fails (a service dies, a network connection becomes unavailable), does the system remain functional? Can it recover without human intervention?</p>
<p><strong>Speed</strong>. How fast is the software, compared to the theoretical limit? Is work being done in the hot path that isn’t strictly necessary?</p>
<p><strong>Readability</strong>. Is the software easy to take in at a glance and to onboard new engineers to? Are functions relatively short and named well? Is the system well-documented?</p>
<p><strong>Correctness</strong>. Is it possible to represent an invalid state in the system? How locked-down is the system with tests, types, and asserts? Do the tests use techniques like fuzzing? In the extreme case, has the program been proven correct by formal methods like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloy_(specification_language)">Alloy</a>?</p>
<p><strong>Flexibility</strong>. Can the system be trivially extended? How easy is it to make a change? If I need to change something, how many different parts of the program do I need to touch in order to do so?</p>
<p><strong>Portability</strong>. Is the system tied down to a particular operational environment (say, Microsoft Windows, or AWS)? If the system needs to be redeployed elsewhere, can that happen without a lot of engineering work?</p>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong>. If traffic goes up 10x, will the system fall over? What about 100x? Does the system have to be over-provisioned or can it scale automatically? What bottlenecks will require engineering intervention?</p>
<p><strong>Development speed</strong>. If I need to extend the system, how fast can it be done? Can most engineers work on it, or does it require a domain expert?</p>
<p>There are many other engineering values: elegance, modern-ness, use of open source, monetary cost of keeping the system running, and so on. All of these are important, but <strong>no engineer cares equally about all of these things.</strong> Your taste is determined by which of these values you rank highest. For instance, if you value speed and correctness more than development speed, you are likely to prefer Rust over Python. If you value scalability over portability, you are likely to argue for a heavy investment in your host’s (e.g. AWS) particular quirks and tooling. If you value resiliency over speed, you are likely to want to split your traffic between different regions. And so on<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It’s possible to break these values down in a more fine-grained way. Two engineers who both deeply care about readability could disagree because one values short functions and the other values short call-stacks. Two engineers who both care about correctness could disagree because one values exhaustive test suites and the other values formal methods. But the principle is the same - there are lots of possible engineering values to care about, and because they are often in tension, each engineer is forced to take some more seriously than others.</p>
<h3>How to identify bad taste</h3>
<p>I’ve said that all of these values are important. Despite that, it’s possible to have <em>bad</em> taste. In the context of software engineering, bad taste means that <strong>your preferred values are not a good fit for the project you’re working on</strong>.</p>
<p>Most of us have worked with engineers like this. They come onto your project evangelizing about something - formal methods, rewriting in Golang, Ruby meta-programming, cross-region deployment, or whatever - because it’s worked well for them in the past. Whether it’s a good fit for your project or not, they’re going to argue for it, because it’s what they like. Before you know it, you’re making sure your internal metrics dashboard has five nines of reliability, at the cost of making it impossible for any junior engineer to understand.</p>
<p>In other words, most bad taste comes from <strong>inflexibility</strong>. I will always distrust engineers who justify decisions by saying “it’s best practice”. No engineering decision is “best practice” in all contexts! You have to make the right decision for the specific problem you’re facing.</p>
<p>One interesting consequence of this is that engineers with bad taste are like broken compasses. If you’re in the right spot, a broken compass will still point north. It’s only when you start moving around that the broken compass will steer you wrong. Likewise, many engineers with bad taste can be quite effective in the particular niche where their preferences line up with what the project needs. But when they’re moved between projects or jobs, or when the nature of the project changes, the wheels immediately come off. No job stays the same for long, particularly <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/good-times-are-over">in these troubled post-2021 times</a>.</p>
<h3>How to identify good taste</h3>
<p>Good taste is a lot more elusive than technical ability. That’s because, unlike technical ability, good taste is the ability to select the right set of engineering values <strong>for the particular technical problem you’re facing</strong>. It’s thus much harder to identify if someone has good taste: you can’t test it with toy problems, or by asking about technical facts. You need there to be a real problem, with all of its messy real-world context.</p>
<p>You can tell you have good taste if the projects you’re working on succeed. If you’re not meaningfully contributing to the design of a project (maybe you’re just doing ticket-work), you can tell you have good taste if the projects where you agree with the design decisions succeed, and the projects where you disagree are rocky. Importantly, you need a set of different kinds of projects. If it’s just the one project, or the same kind of project over again, you might just be a good fit for that. Even if you go through many different kinds of projects, that’s no guarantee that you have good taste in domains you’re less familiar with<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>How do you develop good taste? It’s hard to say, but I’d recommend working on a variety of things, paying close attention to which projects (or which parts of the project) are easy and which parts are hard. You should focus on <strong>flexibility</strong>: try not to acquire strong universal opinions about the right way to write software. What good taste I have I acquired pretty slowly. Still, I don’t see why you couldn’t acquire it fast. I’m sure there are prodigies with taste beyond their experience in programming, just as there are prodigies in other domains.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.zeroasic.com/blog/wildebeest-launch">https://www.zeroasic.com/blog/wildebeest-launch</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45410155">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <h3 id="zero-asic-releases-wildebeest-the-worlds-highest-performance-fpga-synthesis-tool">Zero ASIC releases Wildebeest, the world’s highest performance FPGA synthesis tool.</h3>
<p>Cambridge, MA – September 17, 2025 – Zero ASIC, a U.S. semiconductor startup on a mission to democratize silicon, today announced the release of Wildebeest<sup>TM</sup>, the world’s highest performance FPGA synthesis tool.</p>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>The software world has largely moved away from proprietary, vendor-locked compilers in favor of open source alternatives such as LLVM<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> and GCC. Early on, these open source compilers lagged behind in performance, but over time, through the collective effort of the community, they caught up and even surpassed their proprietary counterparts.</p>
<p>In hardware, a similar transformation has been unfolding. Thanks to the pioneering work of Alan Mishchenko (ABC<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>), Claire Xenia Wolf (Yosys<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-3" id="user-content-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup>), and the broader open source EDA community, FPGA developers have had access to a full-featured Verilog RTL synthesis toolchain for years. Recently, SystemVerilog support has since been added through Mike Popoloski’s excellent Slang parser<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-4" id="user-content-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup>. Thanks to strong community involvement, the Yosys project now supports FPGA synthesis for a number of commercial and academic FPGA architectures.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, funding for open source FPGA synthesis has been minimal, and as a result a large QoR gap between open source and proprietary synthesis remains. Industrial users, who care obsessively about performance, have thus been stuck between a rock and a hard place: “Freedom or Performance”.</p>













































<table><thead><tr><th>Attribute</th><th>Vendor Tool</th><th>Yosys</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>FPGA Support</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Lock-in</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Open Source</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Free</td><td>Yes/No</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Binary Size</td><td>Large</td><td>Small</td></tr><tr><td>QoR</td><td>Great</td><td>Good</td></tr><tr><td>Robustness</td><td>Great</td><td>Good</td></tr></tbody></table>
<h3 id="wildebeest-intro">Wildebeest Intro</h3>
<p>Wildebeest introduces a number of critical optimization techniques to open source. Some of these techniques are standard practice in commercial compilers, but this is the first time they have been demonstrated in an open source FPGA synthesis tool.</p>
<p>The most important Wildebeest strategy is the use of circuit size as a primary feature for selecting the synthesis algorithms. Existing single script solutions don’t work well because they either fail to converge for large circuits or sacrifice performance for robustness. Using a carefully selected set of size appropriate optimization scripts, Wildebeest achieves robustness and high performance for a wide range of benchmark (up to 1M LUT designs).</p>
<p>Another important aspect of the Wildebeest approach is the effective use of the most advanced <code>abc9</code> commands for speculative synthesis and logic depth minimization. ABC is an incredibly powerful logic synthesis library, but making effective use of all commands is a non-trivial task that requires deep expertise in logic synthesis, the ABC architecture, and Yosys, and software development.</p>
<p>Logic optimization is only as good as the benchmark data that grounds the algorithms used. Wildebeest adopted an industrial approach to development from day one, developing an internal suite of 150+ carefully selected benchmarks and automated profiling utilities. The open source <a href="https://github.com/zeroasiccorp/logikbench">LogikBench</a> benchmarks suite was created to enable independent evaluation and benchmarking.</p>
<p>Logic synthesis has been around for over 50 years. During this time, basic synthesis algorithms and approaches have been openly published by the synthesis R&amp;D community, but many of the “outer loop” tricks of the trade have been kept hidden by practitioners within proprietary tools. The lead Wildebeest developer, Dr. Thierry Besson is an industry insider with 30 years of experience in developing state of the art commercial logic synthesis solutions. Dr. Besson has previously contributed the fastest/smallest results on a number of the EPFL logic synthesis benchmarks and with Wildebeest he is releasing many of these techniques into the wild.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-5" id="user-content-fnref-5" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="benchmark-results">Benchmark Results</h3>
<p>The table below shows how Wildebeest compares against both open-source and proprietary synthesis tools for the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeroasiccorp/logikbench/refs/heads/main/logikbench/blocks/picorv32/rtl/picorv32.v">picorv32 CPU design</a>.

<p>The results show that Wildebeest QoR exceeds both proprietary and open source FPGA synthesis solutions.</p>
<h3 id="future-work">Future Work</h3>
<p>This initial Wildebeest release is only the beginning of the journey. The development team has a pipeline of optimization techniques in development with QoR that is expected to exceed current proprietary tools by a wide margin.</p>
<p>The long term goal of the Wildebeest project is to help bring forth an era of “LLVM for synthesis” by working with the community to develop high performance open source FPGA tools, robust standard IRs and file formats, and broad hardware vendor adoption.</p>

    <p>For the past 15 years<sup id="fnref:fifteen" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fifteen" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, F-Droid has provided a safe and secure
haven for Android users around the world to find and install free and open
source apps. When contrasted with the commercial app stores — of which the
Google Play store is the most prominent — the differences are stark: they
are hotbeds of spyware and scams, blatantly promoting apps that prey on
their users through attempts to monetize their attention and mine their
intimate information through any means necessary, including trickery and
dark patterns.[^spyware1]</p>

<p>F-Droid is different. It distributes apps that have been validated to work
<em>for</em> the user’s interests, rather than for the interests of the app’s
distributors. The way F-Droid works is simple: when a developer creates an
app and hosts the source code publicly somewhere, the F-Droid team reviews
it, inspecting it to ensure that it is completely open source and contains
no undocumented <em>anti-features</em> such as advertisements or
trackers<sup id="fnref:antifeatures" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:antifeatures" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Once it passes inspection, the F-Droid build
service compiles and packages the app to make it ready for distribution. The
package is then signed either with F-Droid’s cryptographic key, or, if the
build is reproducible[^reproducible], enables distribution using the
original developer’s private key. In this way, users can trust that any app
distributed through F-Droid is the one that was built from the specified
source code and has not been tampered with.</p>

<h3 id="googles-move-to-break-free-app-distribution">Google’s move to break free app distribution</h3>

<p>The future of this elegant and proven system was put in jeopardy last month,
when Google unilaterally decreed<sup id="fnref:regann" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:regann" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> that Android developers everywhere
in the world are going to be required to register centrally with Google. In
addition to demanding payment of a registration fee and agreement to their
(non-negotiable and ever-changing) terms and conditions, Google will also
require the uploading of personally identifying documents[^regid], including
government ID, by the authors of the software, as well as enumerating all
the unique “application identifiers” for every app that is to be distributed
by the registered developer.[^regappid]</p>

<p>require all apps to be registered by verified developers in order to be
installed by users on certified Android devices.”
<a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/08/elevating-android-security.html">https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/08/elevating-android-security.html</a>

your apps by providing your app package name and app signing keys.”:
<a href="https://developer.android.com/developer-verification#register-your-apps">https://developer.android.com/developer-verification#register-your-apps</a></p>

<p>The F-Droid project cannot require that developers register their apps
through Google, but at the same time, we cannot “take over” the application
identifiers for the open-source apps we distribute, as that would
effectively seize exclusive distribution rights to those applications.</p>

<p>If it were to be put into effect, the developer registration decree will end
the F-Droid project and other free/open-source app distribution sources as
we know them today, and the world will be deprived of the safety and
security of the catalog of thousands of apps that can be trusted and
verified by any and all. F-Droid’s myriad users<sup id="fnref:howmanyusers" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:howmanyusers" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> will be left
adrift, with no means to install — or even update their existing installed —
applications.</p>

<p>because we don’t track users or have any registration. “No user accounts, by
design”:
<a href="https://f-droid.org/en/2022/02/28/no-user-accounts-by-design.html">https://f-droid.org/2022/02/28/no-user-accounts-by-design.html</a></p>

<h3 id="the-security-canard">The Security Canard</h3>

<p>While directly installing — or “sideloading”<sup id="fnref:sideloading" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sideloading" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> — software can be
construed as carrying some inherent risk, it is false to claim that
centralized app stores are the only safe option for software
distribution. Google Play itself has repeatedly hosted
malware[^playmal1][^playmal2], proving that corporate gatekeeping doesn’t
guarantee user protection. By contrast, F-Droid offers a trustworthy and
transparent alternative approach to security: every app is free and open
source, the code can be audited by anyone, the build process and logs are
public, and reproducible builds ensure that what is published matches the
source code exactly. This transparency and accountability provides a
<em>stronger</em> basis for trust than closed platforms, while still giving users
freedom to choose. Restricting direct app installation not only undermines
that choice, it also erodes the diversity and resilience of the open-source
ecosystem by consolidating control in the hands of a few corporate players.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Google’s framing that they need to mandate developer
registration in order to defend against malware is disingenuous because they
<em>already</em> have a remediation mechanism for malware they identify on a
device: the Play Protect service<sup id="fnref:playprotect" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:playprotect" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> that is enabled on all
Android Certified devices already scans and disables apps that have been
identified as malware, regardless of their provenience. Any perceived risks
associated with direct app installation can be mitigated through user
education, open-source transparency, and existing security measures without
imposing exclusionary registration requirements.</p>

<p>harmful behavior”:
<a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2812853">https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2812853</a></p>

<p>We do not believe that developer registration is motivated by security. We
believe it is about consolidating power and tightening control over a
formerly open ecosystem.</p>

<h3 id="the-right-to-run">The Right to Run</h3>

<p>If you own a computer, you should have the right to run whatever programs
you want on it. This is just as true with the apps on your Android/iPhone
mobile device as it is with the applications on your Linux/Mac/Windows
desktop or server. Forcing software creators into a centralized registration
scheme in order to publish and distribute their works is as egregious as
forcing writers and artists to register with a central authority in order to
be able to distribute their creative works. It is an offense to the core
principles of free speech and thought that are central to the workings of
democratic societies around the world.</p>

<p>By tying application identifiers to personal ID checks and fees, Google is
building a choke point that restricts competition and limits user
freedom. It must find a solution which preserves user rights, freedom of
choice, and a healthy, competitive ecosystem.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-we-propose">What do we propose?</h3>

<p>Regulatory and competition authorities should look carefully at Google’s
proposed activities, and ensure that policies designed to improve security
are not abused to consolidate monopoly control. We urge regulators to
safeguard the ability of alternative app stores and open-source projects to
operate freely, and to protect developers who cannot or will not comply with
exclusionary registration schemes and demands for personal information.</p>

<p>If you are a developer or user who values digital freedom, you can
help. Write to your Member of Parliament<sup id="fnref:mp" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:mp" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>,
Congressperson[^congressperson] or other representative, sign petitions in
defense of sideloading, and contact the European Commission’s Digital
Markets Act (DMA) team<sup id="fnref:dmacontact" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:dmacontact" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> to express why preserving open
distribution matters. By making your voice heard, you help defend not only
F-Droid, but the principle that software should remain a commons, accessible
and free from unnecessary corporate gatekeeping.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><em>*Updated July 1, 2025</em></p><p>FedEx was founded in 1971 as an express delivery service. An early motto captures its basic promise: “When it absolutely, positively has to be there overnight.”</p><p><span>The Federal Aviation Act of 1977, which was intensely advocated for by FedEx founding president Fred Smith, allowed FedEx </span><a href="https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy1.lib.asu.edu/science/article/pii/S0966692312001299" rel="">to bring larger aircraft into its fleet</a><span>. Larger aircraft in turn allowed FedEx to concentrate most of its sorting operations in one hub, Memphis, where the company built its superhub in 1979. Today Memphis is the largest cargo airport in the country, and second in the world, all thanks to FedEx’s massive operation.</span></p><p>While FedEx was founded as an air service, and UPS as a ground service, both FedEx and UPS have air and ground services today, though FedEx still has an edge in the air game, with 741 aircraft it operates as opposed to UPS’s 506. It is the largest cargo airline in the world, serving more than 650 airports around the world and shipping 16 million packages daily.</p><p><span>As with all of our primers, this one has an associated </span><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1CSzopj5FzanEmqLVh9ZbAqALsL28laU&amp;usp=sharing" rel="">map of FedEx’s Distribution Network</a><span>, which </span><em>On the Seams</em><span> will do its best to keep updated. (Once again, if you have an update to this map, email us at ontheseams.newsletter@gmail.com.)</span></p><p><span>FedEx </span><a href="https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-rctom/submission/fedex-the-worlds-largest-continuous-flow-process/" rel="">traditionally generates</a><span> between 55-60% of its revenue from Express, about 25% from Ground, 10% from freight, and the remainder from other services. </span></p><p><span>Speed is the name of the game for Express, so everything in this operation is about getting packages on and off planes as quickly as possible. At many airports (102 by my count), they have Air Freight Centers (AFCs); these are also listed publicly. Employment levels at these AFCs range widely, from 27 in Grand Junction, CO to 643 at JFK. They also have a whole bunch of Ship Centers that are either on airport grounds or just a few blocks away, and I’ve listed these on the map as well. (Note, only the Ship Centers </span><em>close to airports</em><span> are on the map. FedEx has many other Ship Centers, the spoke nodes of the Express system, and you can search for them on </span><a href="https://local.fedex.com/en-us/wa/seattle" rel="">FedEx’s site</a><span>.)</span></p><p>Express operates by a hub-and-spoke logic, which the company pioneered, though the spokes typically have their own mini-spokes as well. For instance, a package coming from Grand Forks, North Dakota will first go to Fargo, North Dakota (KFAR), be processed at its Air Freight Center there, and then go on to FedEx’s world hub in Memphis (KMEM), where it’s sorted to its destination.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ajZN!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b934bcc-876b-4999-aafa-62df958898cb_1540x926.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ajZN!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b934bcc-876b-4999-aafa-62df958898cb_1540x926.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ajZN!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b934bcc-876b-4999-aafa-62df958898cb_1540x926.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ajZN!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b934bcc-876b-4999-aafa-62df958898cb_1540x926.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ajZN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b934bcc-876b-4999-aafa-62df958898cb_1540x926.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ajZN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b934bcc-876b-4999-aafa-62df958898cb_1540x926.png" width="500" height="300.4807692307692" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2b934bcc-876b-4999-aafa-62df958898cb_1540x926.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:875,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:500,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ajZN!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b934bcc-876b-4999-aafa-62df958898cb_1540x926.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ajZN!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b934bcc-876b-4999-aafa-62df958898cb_1540x926.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ajZN!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b934bcc-876b-4999-aafa-62df958898cb_1540x926.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ajZN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b934bcc-876b-4999-aafa-62df958898cb_1540x926.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>FedEx Air Hubs (yellow) and Airports served (orange)</figcaption></figure></div><p>By far the largest Express sort facilities are in Memphis and Indianapolis (KIND), the latter being FedEx’s national hub. KIND has about 180 flights in and out every day, KMEM about 250. Around 5500 people are employed at the facilities around KIND, and more than 20,000 at the facilities around KMEM. Both facilities can handle more than 2 million packages a day; a package can be in and out of a sort facility like this within 15 minutes. In addition to these superhubs, there are smaller regional hubs in Anchorage (PANC), Fort Worth (KAFW), Greensboro (KGSO), Miami (KMIA), Newark (KEWR), Oakland (KOAK), and Ontario (KONT).&nbsp;</p><p>Sortation is a science all its own, and we will devote a separate primer to various sort logics, operations, technologies, etc. But the basic goal of these sort hubs is all the same: get inbound packages organized on conveyor belts so that they can be scanned and kicked to slides/chutes with other packages bound for the same area.&nbsp;</p><div id="youtube2-SNFE_1Rnsu8" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;SNFE_1Rnsu8&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SNFE_1Rnsu8?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p><span>FedEx Express pickup and delivery drivers are employees of the company. Unlike with Ground, which will send a driver out for the day to do pickups/deliveries, Express drivers typically have to work around </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FedEx/comments/hawj7d/delivery_routes/" rel="">time-committed packages</a><span>, meeting one or a few loop deadlines for the day, doing on-call pickups, and making a certain number of required delivery attempts. </span></p><p>FedEx Ground was founded in 1985 as Roadway Package System (RPS). It was bought in 1998 by FedEx and rebranded as Ground in 2000.&nbsp;</p><p>Like Express, Ground operates by a hub-and-spoke structure. Let’s say a package is dropped off at a FedEx store in Cloquet, Minnesota, and it’s going to Chandler, Arizona by Ground. It will first get picked up and sent to the local Ground Facility in Superior, Wisconsin (ZDUL), and then sent to the regional Ground Hub in St. Paul (STPL). The Ground Facilities are in green, and the Ground Hubs are in purple. Below is depicted the spoke structure around the St. Paul hub; highlighted are the hub itself and the Superior facility.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UdK8!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c66c0bd-7640-4dca-87bf-63ea676b2ef1_722x824.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UdK8!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c66c0bd-7640-4dca-87bf-63ea676b2ef1_722x824.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UdK8!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c66c0bd-7640-4dca-87bf-63ea676b2ef1_722x824.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UdK8!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c66c0bd-7640-4dca-87bf-63ea676b2ef1_722x824.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UdK8!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c66c0bd-7640-4dca-87bf-63ea676b2ef1_722x824.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UdK8!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c66c0bd-7640-4dca-87bf-63ea676b2ef1_722x824.png" width="356" height="406.29362880886424" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4c66c0bd-7640-4dca-87bf-63ea676b2ef1_722x824.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:824,&quot;width&quot;:722,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:356,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UdK8!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c66c0bd-7640-4dca-87bf-63ea676b2ef1_722x824.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UdK8!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c66c0bd-7640-4dca-87bf-63ea676b2ef1_722x824.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UdK8!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c66c0bd-7640-4dca-87bf-63ea676b2ef1_722x824.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UdK8!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c66c0bd-7640-4dca-87bf-63ea676b2ef1_722x824.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>FedEx Ground Hub and Spoke Structure around St. Paul Hub (purple)</figcaption></figure></div><p>From STPL, the package goes on a linehaul run to another Ground Hub, in this case the one in Phoenix (PHOE).

They can also help with sortation during peak season, and so also serve as spillover sortation centers.</span></p><p>Each Ground Hub employs 1,200 people on average. Employment at Ground facilities varies widely, but there are about 200 employees working at each on average. Average employment at a Regional Sort Facility is 575. This is all according to 2024 OSHA ITA data.</p><p><span>Unlike with Express, where drivers are employees of FedEx, Ground P&amp;D drivers work for third-party Independent Service Providers (ISPs), which contract with FedEx to pickup/deliver packages in a specific geographic area. ISP contractors, of which there are roughly </span><a href="https://www.deliveryroutesforsale.com/resources/fedex-isp/" rel="">5900 in the US</a><span>, are required to cover at least 5 routes or 500 daily deliveries. The linehaul drivers are also independent contractors but work for what FedEx calls Transportation Service Providers (TSPs). Both ISPs and TSPs are considered CSPs (Contracted Service Providers).</span></p><p><span>FedEx Freight is its less-than truckload (LTL) business; it handles shipments weighing over 150 lbs. It operates about </span><a href="https://www.truckingdive.com/news/fedex-freight-opens-new-facility-phoenix-market-ltl-dock-door/629458/" rel="">30,000 vehicles out of roughly 400 Service Centers</a><span>, which are included on the map. It also appears to operate by a hub-and-spoke system, though I have not been able to determine the hubs thus far (and will update this primer if I can).</span></p><p><span>Freight has a much higher operating margin than Express or Ground (</span><a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/fedex-launches-long-awaited-operational-integration" rel="">20-22% as opposed to 8-9% and 11-12% respectively</a><span>), and the company is in the process of spinning it off into its own company in order to </span><a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/fedex-explores-divestment-of-freight-business" rel="">“unlock sustainable shareholder value.”</a><span> At the same time that it is organizationally separating Freight into its own unit, however, it’s also integrating the Ground and Freight networks as part of their much anticipated Network 2.0 initiative. A large number of Freight Service Centers </span><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fedex-freight-close-7-centers-154905491.html" rel="">have been closed</a><span> in the past two years.</span></p><p>FedEx also has a relatively small Supply Chain segment that provides different logistical services, including warehousing, order fulfillment, freight forwarding, transportation management, and other specialized services. It claims to have 30+ fulfillment centers, 130+ distribution centers, and more than 40 million square feet of warehouse space. </p><p>Again, Supply Chain is a negligible part of FedEx’s overall operation, but they do have some pretty big facilities in that segment. For instance, they operate a distribution center for Target in York, PA and one for T-Mobile in Coppell, TX that each employ about 1,200 people. </p><p><span>In 2022, FedEx announced its intention to create </span><a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/fedex-launches-long-awaited-operational-integration" rel="">Network 2.0</a><span>, which will unsilo its previously independent operations. As Satish Jindel explains </span><a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/fedex-and-ups-must-adapt-to-changing-parcel-landscape" rel="">here</a><span>, both FedEx and UPS’s Ground operations have become so fast that they’ve unintentionally created competitors for their Express services. The average time that a package spends in the FedEx Ground system is a </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDEF0EgQgaI" rel="">mere 1.9 days</a><span>. FedEx is telling its contractors that it is merely piloting network integration at present, but that they should begin to see significant overhaul to the network in 2026 and 2027. FedEx is planning to shrink its distribution network from roughly 1200 facilities to about 1000.</span></p><p>In more remote locations, like Yakima, Kennewick, and Lewiston (pictured below), FedEx will often have flights going in and out of the regional airport and also have a Ground Facility and Freight Service Center. An integrated network will likely not see this same kind of redundant clustering.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r2H4!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdba52f29-e605-476a-b729-6a6b62027a76_1580x354.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r2H4!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdba52f29-e605-476a-b729-6a6b62027a76_1580x354.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r2H4!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdba52f29-e605-476a-b729-6a6b62027a76_1580x354.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r2H4!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdba52f29-e605-476a-b729-6a6b62027a76_1580x354.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r2H4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdba52f29-e605-476a-b729-6a6b62027a76_1580x354.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r2H4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdba52f29-e605-476a-b729-6a6b62027a76_1580x354.png" width="560" height="125.38461538461539" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/dba52f29-e605-476a-b729-6a6b62027a76_1580x354.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:326,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:560,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r2H4!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdba52f29-e605-476a-b729-6a6b62027a76_1580x354.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r2H4!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdba52f29-e605-476a-b729-6a6b62027a76_1580x354.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r2H4!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdba52f29-e605-476a-b729-6a6b62027a76_1580x354.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r2H4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdba52f29-e605-476a-b729-6a6b62027a76_1580x354.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Clustered FedEx facilities in Yakima, Kennewick, and Lewiston</figcaption></figure></div></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <article data-astro-cid-xj2uyz6m="">   <h2 id="go-ahead---write-the-stupid-code">Go Ahead - Write the “stupid” code</h2>
<p>When I finished school in 2010 (yep, along time ago now), I wanted to go try and make it as a musician. I figured if punk bands could just learn on the job, I could too. But my mum insisted that I needed to do something, just in case. So I went down to the local TAFE (this is like a trade school in Australia, though it has pathways into uni, it’s pretty neat!) and signed up for whatever looked good. I had always loved computers and gaming, I did all the courses for computing short of programming in school (the school didn’t offer it), and had an interest so I signed up.</p>
<p>It wasn’t love at first sight, as I still remember after a week freaking out in my room that I couldn’t do this. But I sat down with my massive VB.NET textbook we had to buy and pushed through it. And once I made it through, it clicked. I fell in love with programming after that, and it became something I was both good at and started growing a passion for.</p>
<p>From there, going through my games diploma, and my bachelors in games design and development (think a comp sci degree with game design elements, it’s pretty neat and I’m happy to answer questions about it), I wrote a lot of stupid code. Like a lot of it. In my courses, in my game jams (god good times), in my spare time when I was learning things both in uni and early in my career. It helped me refine my skills, but also learn a lot.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today. I’ve been doing a dive on JavaScript/TypeScript and different runtimes like NodeJS and Deno, amongst a bunch of other stuff. At first, I was looking into a deep dive into node with <a href="https://youtu.be/rUFUTdQALrk?si=wSZcxvzoO3eA1_fj">this talk by James Snell</a> and wanted to try out the Streams API. Part of me wanted to start writing straight away, but held back because I didn’t think I had anything to use it on. After being unable to resist the urge to write some code after a few minutes, I just made the dumbest stock ticker I could so I could try streams out in an arbitrary way. But it left me thinking, “why didn’t I hold back”.</p>
<p>As I’m writing this now, I came up with the answer. As I was writing a little <a href="https://github.com/SpikePuppet/daily-inspo">app to output inspirational quotes</a>, I started umm’ing and ahh’ing over if I should make this. It’s small, it’s dumb, and there were probably plenty of options out there. But I wanted to write some code, and was interested in trying out Deno and seeing how it compiles binaries. So I did it. And I was happy (I’m very excited to use it), and I realised that I was scared to write something dumb. All my years of doing this helped refine my own abilities, but also made me much more harsh on myself. Harsh on my own code, harsh on just trying things.</p>
<p>After coming to this realisation, I’ve decided I’m going to give myself more grace when it comes to writing software for myself, and I encourage you all dear readers to do the same if you’ve been feeling this. There is no stupid code. There’s only code. Enjoy writing it, it doesn’t have to be nice or pretty if it’s for you. Have fun, try out that new runtime or language. Poke around and see what breaks. Keep that learning mindset, and keep feeding your curiosity. It’ll help you continue to grow across your career, and if you enjoy this kind of thing as a hobby like me, it’ll keep stoking your own enjoyment and passion.</p>   </article> </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If this post is appearing, it means I’ve succumbed to cancer or one of its side effects. Please don’t feel sad for me. I’ve had a life filled with love, great experiences and wonderful career opportunities. Despite my demise at a relatively young age, I consider myself beyond fortunate.</p><p>I’m hoping that, under the tree in front of our little Philadelphia rowhome, my wife Elaine will place a stone tablet inscribed with my name, and the year I was born and died. Underneath, I’d like the tablet to read:</p><p>Family • Readers • Words</p><p>(Note to Elaine: If you ever move, feel free to take the tablet with you.)</p><p>Family is everybody who’s brought love into my life: Elaine, my two children, my larger family, my close friends. Meanwhile, readers have been those I’ve served, and who rewarded that service with so much loyalty and affection. Finally, words have been my playground, taking the insights I’ve garnered and trying to make them understandable to others. Beside the tree are two metal chairs. I hope family and passersby will occasionally stop by, and fill me in on what I’ve been missing.</p><p>I’ve asked Elaine to arrange a memorial service at <a href="https://www.stpetersphila.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">St Peter’s Church</a> in Philadelphia’s Old City. She’ll post the time and date to the Forum when the details have been worked out.</p><p>Regular readers will know much of my life’s story. But I figure it’s appropriate to offer a not-so-brief recap.</p><p>I was born at 14 St Margarets Drive in Twickenham, London, on Jan. 2, 1963. At that time in the UK, it was standard practice for mothers to give birth in the hospital if it was their first child—or, in my mother’s case, her first two children. My older brothers, who are identical twins, had been born two years earlier. Because that first delivery went smoothly, my birth would be at home. From what I gather, the midwife took cigarette and scotch breaks with my father during lulls in the action. I was born at 6 a.m., thus establishing a lifetime habit of starting early.</p><p>In 1966, my father left financial journalism for a job at the World Bank, and we moved from London to Washington, DC. Two years later, my younger sister was born. In late 1972, my father was posted to the World Bank’s Bangladesh office for four years, and I was dispatched to boarding school in England, joining my two brothers.</p><p>After the comforts of a U.S. suburban childhood, it was a <a href="https://humbledollar.com/2023/03/the-other-enough/">brutal</a> change—cold dormitories, disgusting food, endless bullying—and I carried the scars for the rest of my life. But there was a silver lining: After nine years of boarding school, I squeaked into Cambridge University, where I spent much of my three years writing for and editing the student newspaper.</p><p>When I graduated Cambridge in 1985, the UK economy was in rough shape and landing a job was difficult. I ended up working for <em>Euromoney</em> magazine in London. Initially, all went well. But then there was a change in editor and, for reasons I never understood, the new editor took an instant dislike to me and made it clear he wanted me gone. But by then, I’d already decided to leave London and return to the U.S.</p><p>My then-fiancee and I flew to New York in August 1986. After a desperate scramble, I landed a job as a reporter—read “fact checker”—at <em>Forbes</em> magazine. The pay was miserable, but I couldn’t have been more grateful for that first paycheck. By then, all I had to my name was credit card debt.</p><p>Molly and I were married the following June, and Hannah arrived 15 months later. Her younger brother, Henry, would follow in 1992.</p><p>After 23 months as a fact checker, I was promoted to staff writer at <em>Forbes</em>, covering mutual funds. <em>The Wall Street Journal,</em> which was also in need of a funds reporter, came calling 16 months later. I’d always thought I’d never be a real journalist until I worked for a daily newspaper, and yet initially I said no.</p><p>At the time, I was in the midst of six months as a single parent, looking after Hannah on my own while Molly was in Syria, Greece and Turkey conducting research for her PhD. Still,&nbsp;the <em>Journal</em> wasn’t deterred, saying it would make allowances during my initial months.</p><p>In the early 1990s, the <em>Journal </em>was very different from the newspaper it is today. No photos, just the dot drawings for which the paper was renowned. While strong opinions could be found on the editorial page, they were to be avoided in the news pages. The sort of advice journalism I favored was frowned upon by some among the paper’s senior ranks.</p><p>Still, in 1994, Managing Editor Paul Steiger said he’d consider a few columnists for the <em>Journal’s</em> news pages. At age 31, and with some trepidation, I put up my hand. Thus was born the <em>Getting Going</em> column, which I wrote for the next 13-plus years, penning 1,009 columns for both <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> and <em>Wall Street Journal Sunday</em>. The latter were branded pages that appeared in some 70 newspapers around the country.</p><p>In retrospect, it’s astonishing that I was given my own column at such a young age. It took me a few months to hit my stride, but I was soon pounding away at the virtues of index funds, while also exploring new topics, often scouring academic research for insights I could share with readers.</p><p>The decade and a half that followed are something of a blur. I was cranking out columns, commuting into New York City from the New Jersey suburbs, and raising two children. In my memory, the years have the monotony of a hamster wheel. But that wasn’t the reality: There were high points and low points, plus the joy of watching Hannah and Henry grow up. The low points included&nbsp;the World Trade Center <a href="https://humbledollar.com/2021/09/twenty-years-ago/">attack</a>, my father’s <a href="https://humbledollar.com/2024/08/on-the-clock/">death</a> and a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB945822461920337432" target="_blank" rel="noopener">libel suit</a>&nbsp;brought against the <em>Journal</em>. I’d been involved in editing the story that triggered the lawsuit.</p><p>In early 1995, while in Pittsburgh, I went on a nine-mile run with my brother-in-law, who was training for the city’s marathon. I’d long viewed running those 26.2 miles as a heroic endeavor. I committed to returning for the next year’s marathon. But I didn’t simply want to complete the distance. Instead, I set a goal of finishing in under three hours. I managed it, though barely, crossing the finish line <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB833401105627639500" target="_blank" rel="noopener">24 seconds</a> under the three-hour mark.</p><p>I ran countless road races over the next dozen years. I had my greatest success with half-marathons, finishing third in the four races I ran on land—and first in the 2001 half-marathon held on the deck of a boat floating off <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB984088892480498588" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Antarctica</a>. In shorter races, from one mile to 10, I also managed perhaps a dozen first-place finishes. What about the tearful, wimpy English schoolboy who had previously shunned athletic endeavors? Over countless miles, I managed to leave him behind.</p><p>Career and athletic success were not, alas, rivaled by relationship success. Molly announced she wanted a divorce in 1998. It would be the first of two failed marriages—not an achievement I’m proud of. But the third time was a charm. In the midst of the pandemic, Elaine and I met in August 2020, the month my second marriage officially ended. We were living together by the end of the month and married almost four years later, in May 2024, five days after my cancer diagnosis. I met Elaine during one of my life’s roughest periods, and was so lucky to have done so. Elaine, I fear, was not so fortunate, for now she must navigate the world on her own.</p><p>By 2006 or so, I’d started to tire of the <em>Getting Going</em> column, and began casting around for what to do next. I had a few conversations with potential employers, but those came to naught. Then, one day in early 2008, my phone rang. It was Andy Seig from Citigroup. He was heading up a startup within Citi known as myFi, which was aiming to deliver advice on a client’s entire financial life in return for a flat monthly fee. It was, I imagined, the exit from the <em>Journal</em> I was looking for.</p><p>I joined myFi that spring, and it soon became apparent that launching a startup in the middle of a huge corporate bureaucracy was a foolhardy endeavor. Layered on top of that was the financial crisis that unfolded through the year. By mid-2009, myFi was dead, and we employees spent a long, aimless summer trying to figure out what was next.</p><p>Next turned out to be a new wealth management operation cobbled together by combining myFi’s remaining employees, who had been hired to launch an innovative new financial service, and the old school brokers who sat in Citi’s bank branches. It wasn’t exactly a match made in heaven.</p><p>I toughed it out at Citi until spring 2014. Money was undoubtedly part of the reason. I was making more than $300,000 a year, a gaudy sum for a onetime ink-stained wretch. And the job wasn’t without interest. As director of financial education for the U.S. wealth management business, I gave more than 30 speeches in some years—forcing me to overcome my fear of public speaking—and I was dealing with financial topics I’d rarely written about as a journalist, while also learning about the investment business from the inside. Still, I was also frustrated by the nit-picky oversight of lawyers and compliance officers, and vowed to leave.</p><p>For a year, I planned my departure, getting my finances in order and setting in motion some work projects for my life after Citi. I waited until I got my final year-end bonus in early 2014, and then handed in my notice.</p><p>What followed was a period I came to call my <a href="https://humbledollar.com/2018/01/second-childhood/">second childhood</a>. Initially, that meant a 15-month return to <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> as a freelance columnist—I left when my editor got ousted during a round of layoffs in 2015—and also working on two annual editions of the <em>Jonathan Clements Money Guide</em>. That <a href="https://humbledollar.com/money-guide/main-menu/">guide</a> eventually became the core of <em>HumbleDollar</em>, which I launched on Dec. 31, 2016.</p><p>The two printed editions of the money guide were among the nine <a href="https://humbledollar.com/books/">books</a> I wrote over my career—eight personal finance books and a novel. I also edited two books, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/My-Money-Journey-financial-freedom/dp/0857199862/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>My Money Journey</em></a>, a compilation of 30 essays by <em>HumbleDollar</em> writers, and contributed essays to &nbsp;a fistful of other tomes, including penning the foreword to two Bill Bernstein books. None of the books I authored was a huge success. But my favorite, and the one with the best sales, was my 2016 book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1523770813" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>How to Think About Money</em></a>.</p><p>In 2016, I was also contacted by Peter Mallouk, president of fast-growing Creative Planning, a registered investment advisor that favored index funds and sought to help clients with their entire financial life. As at Citi, I was again given the title of director of financial education, though I remained an independent contractor and worked limited hours for Creative. Still, for me, it proved to be one of my career’s most enjoyable professional relationships. Peter was great to work with, and together we hosted a monthly podcast that ran for the rest of my life.</p><p>By May 2024, I’d been living in Philadelphia for more than three years, I was engaged to Elaine and living just an eight-minute walk from my daughter, son-in-law and two grandsons. The youngest was born that month. Elaine and I were talking about retirement, trying to figure out how we could travel more and have more time for each other, even as I kept <em>HumbleDollar</em> humming along.</p><p>And then I got my cancer <a href="https://humbledollar.com/2024/06/the-c-word/">diagnosis</a>.</p><p>The period immediately after was astonishingly <a href="https://humbledollar.com/2024/07/no-slowing-down/">busy</a>, as I tried to get my affairs in order and prep <em>HumbleDollar</em> for a life without me, even as my diagnosis triggered a surprising amount of media attention. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/13/your-money/jonathan-clements-cancer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The New York Times</em></a> wrote about my illness, I was interviewed for Consuelo Mack’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9op9EXJ493s" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>WealthTrack</em></a>, and I was asked to pen articles for <a href="https://archive.ph/ZeWeF" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/health/other/i-m-61-and-i-ve-got-a-year-left-to-live-but-i-still-plan-to-work-every-day/ar-AA1rakRY" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Telegraph</em></a> of London, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/jonathan-clements-personal-finance-cancer-e30d1396?st=ZHog6a&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> and <a href="https://www.aarp.org/benefits-discounts/members-only-access/info-2025/cancer-changed-retirement-plan.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AARP</a> magazine. Who knew that candor about one’s own death would generate so much interest? It was an odd bookend to a life spent partly in the public eye—one that had previously been most notable for pounding the table for index funds.</p><p>I faced the final months not with sorrow, but with great <a href="https://humbledollar.com/2024/09/no-regrets/">gratitude</a>. I had spent almost my entire adult life doing what I love and surrounded by those that I love. Who could ask for more?</p></div><p>Did you just log in?
