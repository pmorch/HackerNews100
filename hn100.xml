        <p>After announcing its retirement, many generous people and organizations offered help - thank you! The project is now transitioning to an RIR (Regional Internet Registry), which will continue running the site in the public interest. I'll share updates as things progress.</p>

        <details><summary>Click to see the previous message</summary>

        <h2>Previous message</h2>

        <p><strong>TL;DR: I will retire <a href="http://test-ipv6.com/">test-ipv6.com</a> in December 2025.</strong></p>

        <p>I have provided <a href="http://test-ipv6.com/">test-ipv6.com</a> to the public since 2010. I've sunk significant resources - engineering, support, equipment, and hosting fees - into what is a revenue-free product.</p>

        <p>Without going into details: I feel now is the time for me to refocus my resources within the family.<br>
        I hope people will understand, and respect this decision.</p>

        <p>I am shutting the site down, with a target of "during winter break"  (December) 2025.</p>

        <p>Mirror operators: Should you wish to keep your mirrors up, they will stop getting updates in December.</p>

        <p>Service providers: If you have runbooks for your support team based on this site, or based on RIPE-631, you'll need to update those.</p>

        <p>FAQ:</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Will I (jfesler) transfer the source?</strong></p>

        <p><strong>A:</strong> These portions are already public.</p>

        <p>These are already public.<br>
        <a href="http://github.com/falling-sky/source">http://github.com/falling-sky/source</a><br>
        <a href="https://github.com/falling-sky/fsbuilder">https://github.com/falling-sky/fsbuilder</a> - used to build what's in source<br>
        <a href="https://github.com/falling-sky/mod_ip">https://github.com/falling-sky/mod_ip</a> - the /ip/ handler for Apache<br>
        <a href="https://github.com/falling-sky/mtu1280d">https://github.com/falling-sky/mtu1280d</a> - the synthetic MTU180 netfilter daemon.</p>

        <p>The remaining parts, such as geolocation and service provider lookups,  I am contractually unable to release.  Please do not ask.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What about monitoring and validation?</strong></p>

        <p>Delan Azabani has shared with me <a href="https://codeberg.org/shuppy/fallen-sky">https://codeberg.org/shuppy/fallen-sky</a>, which includes a standalone validator.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Will I (jfesler) transfer the domain?</strong></p>

        <p><strong>A:</strong> I'd consider a reputable RIR or NIC organization serving the public interest taking things over.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Should mirrors be retired?</strong></p>

        <p><strong>A:</strong> I would suggest it.  Once the primary site is retired, I will stop monitoring the functionality of your mirror, and stop providing geolocation and service provider lookups.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: I have more questions or comments!</strong></p>

        <p><strong>A:</strong> If we ever meet for coffee or beer, ask me then.</p>

            <pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 17:36:18 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/x86-Opcodes-Not-AMD-Or-Intel">https://www.phoronix.com/news/x86-Opcodes-Not-AMD-Or-Intel</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45608285">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img alt="LINUX KERNEL" src="https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/linuxkernel.webp" width="100" height="100"></p><p>
Posted to the Linux kernel mailing list and GNU Binutils mailing list today is an intriguing message from a longtime x86/x86_64 expert around a "a corporate entity other than Intel/AMD" using some x86 opcodes not used by AMD or Intel processors.
</p><p>
Longtime x86 expert Christian Ludloff posted a cryptic message to the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAKSQd8WQDfSax83Fyja0Y_aF-jq+7qfOpDo3GU5bz-8wEVUA1A@mail.gmail.com/">LKML</a> and <a href="https://sourceware.org/pipermail/binutils/2025-October/144875.html">Binutils</a> mailing lists. An anonymous Phoronix reader in turn relayed the interesting occurrence to me. Christian Ludloff has worked for Google, AMD, TI, and others over the years as an x86 architecture expert as well as being known for his sandpile.org x86 CPU information site.
</p><p>
The subject for the mailing list posts by Christian Ludloff was <strong>x86 opcode/CPUID/MSR allocations</strong> and simply said:
</p><blockquote>"If x86 opcode/CPUID/MSR allocations are not of your concern, then you can stop reading.
<p>
-------------------- 8&lt; -------------------
</p><p>
I was asked to relay this to binutils/LKML.
</p><p>
As of 2025, the following are in active use by a corporate entity other than Intel/AMD.
</p><p>
Any collisions with them should be avoided.
</p><p>
- opcode 0Eh in PM64 - x86 PUSH CS that got removed by x86-64 in 2002; not used since
</p><p>
- opcode 0Fh,36h and opcode 0Fh,3Eh - there is a historic collision with Cyrix RDSHR, but that is not considered to be an issue
</p><p>
- opcode 0Fh,3Ah,E0h...EFh in classic, VEX, EVEX, Map3, and Map7 encodings, without a prefix, or CS/SS/DS/ES/FS/GS, LOCK, REPE/REPNE, or ASIZE/OSIZE/REX (but not REX2!) prefixes - a historic collision with K10M VCVTFXPNTPD2DQ (at MVEX opcode E6h prefix F2) exists but is not considered an issue
</p><p>
- opcode 0Fh,1Eh,/0 - a "hinting NOP" group
</p><p>
- CPUID range E000_xxxxh - unspecified leaf return values at this particular time
</p><p>
- MSR range E000_xxxxh - unspecified values after RESET - unchanged values after INIT
</p><p>
I have documented them at www.sandpile.org.
</p><p>
-------------------- 8&lt; -------------------
</p><p>
--
<br>C."</p></blockquote>
<p>These x86 opcodes and CPUs and MSR ranges now "<em>in active use by a corporate entity other than Intel/AMD</em>" makes this rather intriguing... And that it's a "corporate" entity rather than noting a research organization, hobbyist project, etc. And how said corporate entity has the legal ability to even work on a new x86-based implementation is interesting. For Christian Ludloff to be involved does give it additional weight.</p><p>As pointed out in the Phoronix Forums, it could be <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/search/Zhaoxin">Zhaoxin</a>. But as they have <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Zhaxoin-Shijidadao-GCC-15">contributed GCC patches</a>, Glibc patches, Linux kernel patches, etc, over the years it's not clear why they would go unnamed or have to relay the message via Ludloff rather than their prior direct mailing list posts.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2025&amp;image=x86_intrigue"></p>
<p>For now that's all I know but rather interesting seeing this message from Ludloff today on the public mailing lists.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>So I kept reading rumors that Gemini 3.0 is accessible through Google AI Studio through A/B testing and the SVGs folks were posting (of Xbox controllers in particular) made me think that they might be right.</p><p>Gemini 3.0 is one of the most anticipated releases in AI at the moment because of the expected advances in coding performance.</p><p>Evaluating models is a difficult task, but surprisingly the SVG generation task seems to be a very efficient proxy for gauging model quality as <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/pelican-riding-a-bicycle/">@simonw</a> has shown us using his ‚Äúpelican riding a bicycle‚Äù test.</p><p>Lo and behold, after trying a couple of times I got the A/B screen and got an SVG image of an Xbox 360 controller that looked VERY impressive compared to the rest of the frontier.</p><p><img alt="Gemini 3.0 Xbox controller output" loading="lazy" src="https://ricklamers.io/gemini-3-xbox-controller.png"></p><p>The exact prompt I used:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>Create an SVG image of an Xbox 360 controller.

Perhaps since I user selected Gemini 2.5 Pro it is actually Gemini 3.0 Pro that it is pitted against, as comparing Gemini 3.0 Flash to Gemini 2.5 Pro in an A/B test makes less sense to me. Also, it had about 24s higher TTFT and output length was about 40% longer (this includes reasoning tokens AFAICT), but that doesn‚Äôt say much other than it‚Äôs likely not a ‚ÄúGPT-5 Pro‚Äù type answer that uses significant test time compute.</p><h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2><p>‚ÄúGemini 3.0‚Äù A/B result versus the Gemini 2.5 Pro model:</p><p><img alt="Gemini 3.0 vs Gemini 2.5 Pro comparison" loading="lazy" src="https://ricklamers.io/gemini-3-vs-2-5-comparison.png"></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>When we introduced the <a href="https://agentclientprotocol.com/">Agent Client Protocol (ACP)</a> in <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/bring-your-own-agent-to-zed">collaboration with Google's Gemini CLI team</a>, we did not anticipate how much pent-up demand there was for a protocol like this!</p>


<p>As of today, Zed supports Codex out-the-box via ACP. You can select it from the New Thread menu, just like Claude Code or Gemini CLI:</p>
<p><figure><video src="https://customer-snccc0j9v3kfzkif.cloudflarestream.com/33ed2569d4edb50dcaa1ddcc7db6857e/downloads/default.mp4" width="3840" height="2160" poster="https://zed.dev/img/post/acp-codex/video-poster.webp" controls=""></video><figcaption>A walkthrough of OpenAI's Codex in Zed.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Like our other ACP integrations, Codex via ACP is strictly about improving UI and keeping you in flow in your IDE of choice; the billing and legal/terms arrangement is directly between you and OpenAI. Zed does not charge for use of external agents like Codex, nor do prompts and code sent via Codex-ACP to OpenAI touch Zed's servers! We've also separately open-sourced the <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/codex-acp">codex-acp adapter</a> so you can use it outside of Zed as well.</p>

<p>Every model behaves a bit differently than the others, and the same is true of agents. For example, some agents
support switching models in the middle of a conversation, whereas others require sticking with the same model throughout.
Some support viewing and resuming past conversations, whereas others have no concept of conversation persistence.
ACP is designed to be flexible enough to work with a variety of agent capabilities, but the experience of using them
still varies based on the agent's implementation details.</p>
<p>A detail that came up when we were building the Codex ACP adapter was that the Codex agent runs terminal commands in its own process, and then streams output bytes from that terminal process to the client. In the past, we've had this reversed: the
agent would send the client a request to run a terminal command (e.g. <code>mkdir examples</code>) and then the client would manage
the actual running of that command.</p>
<p>Naturally, we want to keep the look and feel consistent no matter which agent you're using, but this design difference
between Codex and other agents makes certain details unavoidably different. For example, for other agents we can spawn
terminals in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoterminal">pseudoterminal (PTY)</a> mode. This means you can actually interact
with the terminal right in the Agent Panel if the agent launches an interactive process, and it also means things like
colorful terminal output tend to be enabled by default.</p>
<p>On the other hand, being in PTY mode means that an agent can get stuck. A classic example of this is when an agent tries to
run <code>git rebase --continue</code> and the terminal pops up the configured editor, then waits for the programmer to make any
edits (if desired) to the commit message. This can be nice for a human, but for an agent that's waiting for the command to
finish, it creates a deadlock. The process won't proceed without interaction, and the agent won't interact until the process
completes! Having terminals work in non-PTY mode might result in fewer colors and less interactivity, but it also results in
fewer cases of agents getting stuck.</p>
<p>Now that we've integrated agents that both enable and disable PTY mode, we can compare how the experience feels in both cases, and use that to inform our recommendations for future ACP integrations.</p>

<p>In addition to Codex, we have already added support to Zed for Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/acp-progress-report#agents-more-options-for-developers">other agents</a>, all via ACP. Since ACP is not specific to Zed,
we've also seen it be adopted by editors like Neovim, Emacs, and now the <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/ai/2025/10/jetbrains-zed-open-interoperability-for-ai-coding-agents-in-your-ide/">JetBrains family of IDEs</a>.</p>
<p>Now that the protocol has picked up enough adoption on its own, we're happy to shift our focus to working with the community on the future of the protocol‚Äîas opposed to building ACP adapters ourselves like we did with Codex and Claude Code. We're excited to see what amazing ACP integrations the community cooks up!</p><hr><div><h3 id="looking-for-a-better-editor">Looking for a better editor?</h3>

            <p>EA employees and the Communications Workers of America union have issued a statement against the proposed private acquisition of the company, claiming they were not represented in the negotiations and any jobs lost as a result would "be a choice, not a necessity, made to pad investors' pockets".</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">acquisition of EA by a group of private investors</a> was announced at the end of September. The deal, for $55bn, includes investment from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Affinity Partners, the company of President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p>
<p>Following the announcement, there's been plenty of speculation around the future of EA and its multiple owned studios, split between EA Sports and EA Entertainment. Now, members of the United Videogame Workers union and the CWA have <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/united-videogame-workers-cwa-statement-proposed-electronic-arts-buyout">issued a formal response</a> alongside a <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/make-ea-better">petition for regulators to scrutinise the deal</a>.</p>
<p>"EA is not a struggling company," the statement reads. "With annual revenues reaching $7.5 billion and $1 billion in profit each year, EA is one of the largest video game developers and publishers in the world."</p>
<p>This success has been driven by company workers, the union stated. "Yet we, the very people who will be jeopardised as a result of this deal, were not represented at all when this buyout was negotiated or discussed."</p>
<p>Citing the number of layoffs across the industry since 2022, workers fear for "the future of our studios that are arbitrarily deemed 'less profitable' but whose contributions to the video game industry define EA's reputation."</p>
<p>"If jobs are lost or studios are closed due to this deal, that would be a choice, not a necessity, made to pad investors' pockets - not to strengthen the company," the statement reads.</p>
<p>"Every time private equity or billionaire investors take a studio private, workers lose visibility, transparency, and power," it continues. "Decisions that shape our jobs, our art, and our futures are made behind closed doors by executives who have never written a line of code, built worlds, or supported live services. We are calling on regulators and elected officials to scrutinise this deal and ensure that any path forward protects jobs, preserves creative freedom, and keeps decision-making accountable to the workers who make EA successful."</p>
<p>As such, workers have launched a petition in a "fight to make video games better for workers and players - not billionaires".</p>
<p>The statement concludes: "The value of video games is in their workers. As a unified voice, we, the members of the industry-wide video game workers' union UVW-CWA, are standing together and refusing to let corporate greed decide the future of our industry."</p>
<p>Eurogamer contacted the Federal Trade Commission following news of the proposed acquisition of EA, but it refused to comment "on pending mergers or acquisitions".</p>
<p>A report from The Financial Times suggested the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-private-acquisition-deal-expected-to-go-smoothly-says-report-as-what-regulator-is-going-to-say-no-to-the-presidents-son-in-law">deal won't face much opposition</a>. As one source said: "What regulator is going to say no to the president's son-in-law?"</p>
<p>Eurogamer also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-takeover-the-saudi-arabian-public-investment-fund-and-vanity-mega-projects-human-rights-watch-assesses-the-impact-of-gamings-latest-controversy">spoke with the Human Rights Watch on the controversial acquisition</a>. "We have found that the public investment fund has contributed to, and is responsible for, human rights abuses," said researcher Joey Shea on the involvement of Saudi Arabia's government. "This is a trillion dollars in Saudi state wealth that should be invested to realise the economic and social rights of Saudi citizens. We've found it's been invested in vanity mega projects inside and outside of the country.</p><p>"We see this as a deliberate attempt to distract from the country's human rights abuses [...] MBS himself wields enormous power over what is effectively public funds, and he wields this power in a highly arbitrary and personalised manner, rather than the benefit of the Saudi people more broadly. Effectively, Saudi Arabia's vast fossil fuel-derived state wealth is controlled by one person, which isn't good for human rights, or business either."</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/new-alpha-release-tor-browser-150a4/">https://blog.torproject.org/new-alpha-release-tor-browser-150a4/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45605842">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tor Browser 15.0a4 is now available from the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/alpha/">Tor Browser download page</a> and also from our <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/15.0a4/">distribution directory</a>.</p>
<p>This version includes important <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/">security updates</a> to Firefox.</p>
<h2>Release Candidate</h2>
<p>If all goes as planned, this will be our last alpha release in the 15.0 series before it is promoted to stable in the last week of October. Next week we will be focusing primarily on QA and ensuring all the various features and scenarios supported in Tor Browser still work as expected. This QA work will be tracked in the following gitlab issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/43894">tor-browser#43984 - Tor Browser 15.0 Release QA - Desktop </a></li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/43895">tor-browser#43985 - Tor Browser 15.0 Release QA - Android </a></li>
</ul>
<p>As we reach the home stretch, now would be a great time to download and try out Tor Browser Alpha! We would appreciate it if the community would evaluate and exercise these following changes:</p>
<h3>ü§ñ Removal of Various AI Features</h3>
<p>Over the past year Mozilla has been working on integrating various AI features and integrations into Firefox (e.g. <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/ai-chatbot">the AI chatbot sidebar</a>). Such machine learning systems and platforms are inherently un-auditable from a security and privacy perspective. We also do not want to imply recommendation or promotion of such systems by including them in Tor Browser. Therefore, we have done what we can to remove such features from the browser.</p>
<h3>‚òÅÔ∏è Rename <code>meek-azure</code> pluggable-transport to just <code>meek</code></h3>
<p>In the past, we have used various cloud platform to host <code>meek</code> pluggable-transport backends including Google, Amazon, and Azure. However, as time passed these backends have moved and migrated and thus the cloud provider-specific name has become an historical artifact. Therefore, we have <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/44069">dropped the Azure part of the name</a> and now just call it <code>meek</code>. Let this be a lesson to you about naming things!</p>
<h3>üü™ Improved Dark Theme Support in Browser Chrome</h3>
<p>We have improved the styling for our various Tor Browser-specific UI components for  dark browser themes. All of our various purple elements should now look like they belong.</p>
<h3>ü¶ä Removal/Replacement of New Firefox/Mozilla-specific Branding and Features</h3>
<p>As part of ordinary incremental UI updates over the past year and the implementation of new features, Mozilla has added various new brand assets and service integrations. This includes things like those cute little fox graphics, Firefox Home, and the new History Sidebar. As of this release, there should not be any more Firefox or Mozilla specific branding, features, or service integrations accessible in Tor Browser. The new history sidebar in particular has been <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/44108">replaced with the legacy history panel</a> from previous Tor Browser versions.</p>
<h3>üêß Updated Emoji Font for Linux</h3>
<p>We have included the <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser-build/-/issues/41561">Noto Color Emoji font</a> with our Linux builds. Linux users should now have all the latest and greatest emoji provided by <a href="https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji/">Noto Emoji</a>.</p>
<h3>üà¥Ô∏è Improved CJK Glyph Rendering</h3>
<p>At the <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/44227">suggestion of a cypherpunk</a>, we have swapped out the Noto font family for <a href="https://kamichikoichi.github.io/jigmo/">Jigmo</a>. This <em>should</em> allow more Chinese, Japanese, and Korean graphemes to render accurately in web content.</p>
<h3>‚úâÔ∏è Letterboxing Styling Improvements</h3>
<p>We have tweaked our custom styling of the web-content letterboxing feature to confirm with and adapt to Firefox's own styling changes in Firefox 140. These tweaks should also play nicely with upstream's vertical tabs feature.</p>
<h3>üö´ WebAssembly Restrictions Now Managed by NoScript</h3>
<p>Historically, we have disabled <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly">WebAssembly</a> globally when the browser is in the  <code>Safer</code> and <code>Safest</code> security levels. However, with the latest Firefox version this has proven to be too aggressive, as doing so <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/44234">broke functionality in the built-in PDF reader</a>. We therefore now rely on the <a href="https://noscript.net/">NoScript extension</a> built into the browser to handle disabling WebAssembly functionality in web content while the browser is in the <code>Safer</code> and <code>Safest</code> security levels, while also allowing WebAssembly to run unhindered in safe+privileged contexts like the PDF reader.</p>
<h3>üîç Stopped Hiding Protocol in URL on Desktop</h3>
<p>Mozilla has reversed course on when the protocol portion (e.g. <code>http</code> or <code>https</code>) of the URL in the URL bar is hidden since Firefox 128. We used to have logic in one of our patches around Onion Services (which are always end-to-end encrypted regardless of the application-level protocol used) to follow whatever Firefox does for <code>https</code>. However, with the latest changes in Firefox, this patch became a bit gnarly to apply correctly so we took a step back and thought to ourselves, why are we even conditionally hiding this from the user?</p>
<p>So for now, we have decided <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/44123">not to hide the protocol from the user on Desktop platforms</a> using a supported Firefox pref. We continue to follow upstream and <em>always</em> hide the protocol in the URL bar on Android (where horizontal space is at a premium). Users of Tor Browser Android can simply click the icon in the URL bar to get all the info about a websites HTTPS usage.</p>
<h2>Send us your feedback</h2>
<p>If you find a bug or have a suggestion for how we could improve this release, <a href="https://support.torproject.org/misc/bug-or-feedback/">please let us know</a>.</p>
<p>‚ö†Ô∏è <strong>Reminder</strong>: Tor Browser Alpha release channel is for <a href="https://community.torproject.org/user-research/become-tester/">testing only</a>. If you are at risk or need strong anonymity, stick with the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/">stable release channel</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>First things first, why do we code? To solve problems in the most optimal way possible.</p>

      <p>
        For me, the number one factor is speed: both application speed and development speed.
        That‚Äôs exactly what led me to <strong><a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/" target="_blank">Phoenix LiveView</a></strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If I had chosen React or Next.js with Laravel, or even Inertia.js with Laravel,
        I would have had to maintain both sides of the stack, frontend and backend.
        As a solo developer, I didn‚Äôt have the time to manage state in two different places.
        I needed a solid monolithic solution that could handle everything together.
      </p>

      <p>
        So I looked into Laravel Livewire and Rails Hotwire. Both are great tools that simplify frontend work
        without depending too much on JavaScript. I even thought about going full JavaScript with Next.js,
        but I‚Äôve never been a big fan of using JS on the backend.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rails Hotwire really caught my attention, especially because of how fast you can build an MVP with Rails.
        But I still needed background jobs, real-time updates, and two-way communication that just works.
        Those things are possible in Rails and Laravel, but they take a bit more effort to set up.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then I came across <strong>Elixir</strong> and its framework <strong>Phoenix</strong>.
        It had all the elegance of Ruby on Rails, but with far better performance.
        It came with built-in <strong><a href="https://github.com/oban-bg/oban" target="_blank">background jobs through Oban</a></strong>, a familiar and clean syntax,
        and something truly special called <strong>LiveView</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        LiveView feels like the perfect balance between traditional server-rendered apps and frontend-heavy frameworks.
        It‚Äôs way ahead of both Rails Hotwire and Laravel Livewire. LiveView communicates through WebSockets,
        which means real-time two-way updates without sending new requests every time something changes.
        You can still use <strong>Alpine.js</strong> or any JavaScript library you want through hooks when needed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Phoenix also comes with <strong>Oban</strong> jobs built in. You can declare background jobs easily,
        and when something fails, it automatically restarts without breaking the app.
        That‚Äôs the beauty of Elixir. It‚Äôs a compiled language built on top of Erlang,
        which powers highly concurrent systems like WhatsApp and Discord.
      </p>

      <h2>Here‚Äôs what sealed it for me:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I can build fast</li>
        <li>I can handle high concurrency if needed</li>
        <li>I write almost everything in one language</li>
        <li>I can write clean, readable code</li>
        <li>The compiler catches most bugs before they reach production</li>
        <li>The app is fault tolerant and rarely goes down</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I‚Äôm not saying Phoenix is better than Laravel, Rails, or Next.js. All of these are excellent frameworks, and I‚Äôve personally used them to build applications. Phoenix just turned out to be the best fit for my specific use case. This is my project - <a href="https://hyperzoned.com/?ref=akarshc.com" target="_blank">Hyperzoned.com</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        I don‚Äôt know who needs to hear this, but try exploring beyond what you already know.
        You might find a better and more efficient way to solve your next problem.
        After all, never stop learning.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main">
        <p>Elixir v1.19 brings further improvements to the type system and compilation times, allowing us to find more bugs, faster.</p>

<h2 id="type-system-improvements">Type system improvements</h2>

<p>This release improves the type system around two key areas: type inference and type checking of anonymous functions and protocols. These enhancements seem simple on the surface but required us to go beyond existing literature by extending current theory and developing new techniques. We will outline the technical details in future articles. For now, let‚Äôs look at what‚Äôs new.</p>

<h3 id="type-inference-of-all-constructs">Type inference of all constructs</h3>

<p>Type inference (or reconstruction) is the ability of a type system to automatically deduce, either partially or fully, the type of an expression at compile time. Type inference may occur at different levels. For example, many programming languages can automatically infer the types of variables, also known ‚Äúlocal type inference‚Äù, but not all can infer type signatures of functions.</p>

<p>Originally, our plan with Elixir‚Äôs upcoming type system was to support type inference of patterns, guards, and return types. Therefore, if you wrote this simple function:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>even?</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>when</span> <span>is_integer</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>rem</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Elixir would correctly infer the type to be <code>integer() -&gt; boolean()</code>. However, if you wrote this function:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>even?</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>rem</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The type would be <code>dynamic() -&gt; boolean()</code>, since there are no guards, even though the functions behave virtually the same, as the <code>rem</code> operator expects both arguments to be integer (they just raise different exceptions for non-integer values).</p>

<p>Inferring type signatures comes with a series of trade-offs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Speed - type inference algorithms are often more computationally intensive than type checking algorithms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Expressiveness - in any given type system, the constructs that support inference are always a subset of those that can be type-checked. Therefore, if a programming language is restricted to only fully reconstructed types, it is less expressive than a solely type checked counterpart.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incremental compilation - type inference complicates incremental compilation. If module A depends on module B, which depends on module C, a change to C may require the type signature in B to be reconstructed, which may then require A to be recomputed (and so on). This dependency chain may require large projects to explicitly add type signatures for stability and compilation efficiency.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cascading errors - when a user accidentally makes type errors or the code has conflicting assumptions, type inference may lead to less clear error messages as the type system tries to reconcile diverging type assumptions across code paths.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, type inference offers the benefit of enabling type checking for functions and codebases without requiring the user to add type annotations. To balance these trade-offs, we are exploring ‚Äúmodule type inference‚Äù: our goal is to infer type signatures considering invocations of functions in the same module and of functions from <em>other applications</em> (such as Elixir itself and your dependencies). Once module types are inferred, your whole project is type checked considering all declared and inferred types.</p>

<p>We have successfully implemented these features as part of Elixir v1.19, by performing inference of all constructs (except guards), taking into account the signatures from calls to functions within the same module and in Elixir‚Äôs standard library. This means the second function above, without the guard, will also infer the type <code>integer() -&gt; boolean()</code>.</p>

<p>In future releases, we plan to perform type inference of guards (originally planned for v1.19) and also consider the type signatures of your dependencies during inference. Overall, these changes allow us to assess the impact of the trade-offs above as the type system evolves, which suits well our current goals of incrementally using types to find bugs in existing codebases, without changing them.</p>

<p>Keep in mind this only applies to <em>type inference</em>. Once we introduce type signatures and you explicitly annotate your functions, type inference and the trade-offs above no longer play a role. Any function with an explicit type signature will be typed checked against the user-provided annotations, as in other statically typed languages.</p>

<h3 id="type-checking-of-protocol-dispatch-and-implementations">Type checking of protocol dispatch and implementations</h3>

<p>This release adds type checking when dispatching and implementing protocols.</p>

<p>For example, string interpolation in Elixir uses the <code>String.Chars</code> protocol. If you pass a value that does not implement said protocol, Elixir will now emit a warning accordingly.</p>

<p>Here is an example passing a range, which cannot be converted into a string, to an interpolation:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>Example</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>my_code</span><span>(</span><span>first</span><span>..</span><span>last</span><span>//</span><span>step</span> <span>=</span> <span>range</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>"hello </span><span>#{</span><span>range</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>the above emits the following warnings:</p>

<div><pre><code>warning: incompatible value given to string interpolation:

    data

it has type:

    %Range{first: term(), last: term(), step: term()}

but expected a type that implements the String.Chars protocol, it must be one of:

    dynamic(
      %Date{} or %DateTime{} or %NaiveDateTime{} or %Time{} or %URI{} or %Version{} or
        %Version.Requirement{}
    ) or atom() or binary() or float() or integer() or list(term())
</code></pre></div>

<p>Warnings are also emitted if you pass a data type that does not implement the <code>Enumerable</code> protocol as a generator to for-comprehensions:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>Example</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>my_code</span><span>(%</span><span>Date</span><span>{}</span> <span>=</span> <span>date</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>for</span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>date</span><span>,</span> <span>do</span><span>:</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>will emit:</p>

<div><pre><code>warning: incompatible value given to for-comprehension:

    x &lt;- date

it has type:

    %Date{year: term(), month: term(), day: term(), calendar: term()}

but expected a type that implements the Enumerable protocol, it must be one of:

    dynamic(
      %Date.Range{} or %File.Stream{} or %GenEvent.Stream{} or %HashDict{} or %HashSet{} or
        %IO.Stream{} or %MapSet{} or %Range{} or %Stream{}
    ) or fun() or list(term()) or non_struct_map()
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="type-checking-and-inference-of-anonymous-functions">Type checking and inference of anonymous functions</h3>

<p>Elixir v1.19 can now type infer and type check anonymous functions. Here is a trivial example:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>Example</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>run</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>fun</span> <span>=</span> <span>fn</span> <span>%{}</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>:map</span> <span>end</span>
    <span>fun</span><span>.</span><span>(</span><span>"hello"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The example above has an obvious typing violation, as the anonymous function expects a map but a string is given. With Elixir v1.19, the following warning is now printed:</p>

<div><pre><code>    warning: incompatible types given on function application:

        fun.("hello")

    given types:

        binary()

    but function has type:

        (dynamic(map()) -&gt; :map)

    typing violation found at:
    ‚îÇ
  6 ‚îÇ     fun.("hello")
    ‚îÇ        ~
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îî‚îÄ mod.exs:6:8: Example.run/0
</code></pre></div>

<p>Function captures, such as <code>&amp;String.to_integer/1</code>, will also propagate the type as of Elixir v1.19, arising more opportunity for Elixir‚Äôs type system to catch bugs in our programs.</p>

<h2 id="faster-compile-times-in-large-projects">Faster compile times in large projects</h2>

<p>This release includes two compiler improvements that can lead up to 4x faster builds in large codebases.</p>

<p>While Elixir has always compiled the given files in project or a dependency in parallel, the compiler would sometimes be unable to use all of the machine resources efficiently. This release addresses two common limitations, delivering performance improvements that scale with codebase size and available CPU cores.</p>

<h3 id="code-loading-bottlenecks">Code loading bottlenecks</h3>

<p>Prior to this release, Elixir would load modules as soon as they were defined. However, because the Erlang part of code loading happens within a single process (the code server), this would make it a bottleneck, reducing parallelization, especially on large projects.</p>

<p>This release makes it so modules are loaded lazily. This reduces the pressure on the code server and the amount of work during compilation, with reports of more than two times faster compilation for large projects. The benefits depend on the codebase size and the number of CPU cores available.</p>

<p>Implementation wise, <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2012/04/24/a-peek-inside-elixir-s-parallel-compiler/">the parallel compiler already acts as a mechanism to resolve modules during compilation</a>, so we built on that. By making sure the compiler controls both module compilation and module loading, it can also better guarantee deterministic builds.</p>

<p>There are two potential regressions with this approach. The first one happens if you spawn processes during compilation which invoke other modules defined within the same project. For example:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>MyLib</span><span>.</span><span>SomeModule</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>list</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>...</span><span>]</span>

  <span>Task</span><span>.</span><span>async_stream</span><span>(</span><span>list</span><span>,</span> <span>fn</span> <span>item</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
    <span>MyLib</span><span>.</span><span>SomeOtherModule</span><span>.</span><span>do_something</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Because the spawned process is not visible to the compiler, it won‚Äôt be able to load <code>MyLib.SomeOtherModule</code>. You have two options, either use <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Kernel.ParallelCompiler.html#pmap/2"><code>Kernel.ParallelCompiler.pmap/2</code></a> or explicitly call <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Code.html#ensure_compiled!/1"><code>Code.ensure_compiled!(MyLib.SomeOtherModule)</code></a> before spawning the process that uses said module.</p>

<p>The second one is related to <code>@on_load</code> callbacks (typically used for <a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/system/nif.html">NIFs</a>) that invoke other modules defined within the same project. For example:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>MyLib</span><span>.</span><span>SomeModule</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>@on_load</span> <span>:init</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>init</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>MyLib</span><span>.</span><span>AnotherModule</span><span>.</span><span>do_something</span><span>()</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>something_else</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>...</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>MyLib</span><span>.</span><span>SomeModule</span><span>.</span><span>something_else</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The reason this fails is because <code>@on_load</code> callbacks are invoked within the code server and therefore they have limited ability to load additional modules. It is generally advisable to limit invocation of external modules during <code>@on_load</code> callbacks but, in case it is strictly necessary, you can set <code>@compile {:autoload, true}</code> in the invoked module to address this issue in a forward and backwards compatible manner.</p>

<p>Both snippets above could actually lead to non-deterministic compilation failures in the past, and as a result of these changes, compiling these cases are now deterministic.</p>

<h3 id="parallel-compilation-of-dependencies">Parallel compilation of dependencies</h3>

<p>This release introduces a variable called <code>MIX_OS_DEPS_COMPILE_PARTITION_COUNT</code>, which instructs <code>mix deps.compile</code> to compile dependencies in parallel.</p>

<p>While fetching dependencies and compiling individual Elixir dependencies already happened in parallel, as outlined in the previous section, there were pathological cases where performance gains would be left on the table, such as when compiling dependencies with native code or dependencies where one or two large files would take most of the compilation time.</p>

<p>By setting <code>MIX_OS_DEPS_COMPILE_PARTITION_COUNT</code> to a number greater than 1, Mix will now compile multiple dependencies at the same time, using separate OS processes. Empirical testing shows that setting it to half of the number of cores on your machine is enough to maximize resource usage. The exact speed up will depend on the number of dependencies and the number of machine cores and some users reported up to 4x faster compilation times when using our release candidates. If you plan to enable it on CI or build servers, keep in mind it will most likely have a direct impact on memory usage too.</p>

<h2 id="erlangotp-28-support">Erlang/OTP 28 support</h2>

<p>Elixir v1.19 officially supports Erlang/OTP 28.1+ and later. In order to support the new Erlang/OTP 28 representation for regular expressions, structs can now control how they are escaped into abstract syntax trees by defining a <code>__escape__/1</code> callback.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the new representation for regular expressions in Erlang/OTP 28+ implies they can no longer be used as default values for struct fields. Therefore, this is not allowed:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>defstruct</span> <span>regex:</span> <span>~r/foo/</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can, however, still use regexes when initializing the structs themselves:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>defstruct</span> <span>[</span><span>:regex</span><span>]</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>new</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>%</span><span>Foo</span><span>{</span><span>regex:</span> <span>~r/foo/</span><span>}</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="openchain-certification">OpenChain certification</h2>

<p>Elixir v1.19 is also our first release following OpenChain compliance, <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2025/02/26/elixir-openchain-certification/">as previously announced</a>. In a nutshell:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Elixir releases now include a Source SBoM in CycloneDX 1.6 or later and SPDX 2.3 or later formats.</li>
  <li>Each release is attested along with the Source SBoM.</li>
</ul>

<p>These additions offer greater transparency into the components and licenses of each release, supporting more rigorous supply chain requirements.</p>

<p>This work was performed by <a href="https://maennchen.dev/">Jonatan M√§nnchen</a> and sponsored by the <a href="https://erlef.org/">Erlang Ecosystem Foundation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>There are many other goodies in this release, such as improved option parsing, better debuggability and performance in ExUnit, the addition of <code>mix help Mod</code>, <code>mix help Mod.fun</code>, <code>mix help Mod.fun/arity</code>, and <code>mix help app:package</code> to make documentation accessible via shell for humans and agents, and much more. <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.19/changelog.html">See the CHANGELOG</a> for the complete release notes.</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>

                                        <p>NEW YORK (AP) ‚Äî Dozens of reporters turned in access badges and exited the Pentagon on Wednesday rather than agree to government-imposed <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/pentagon-journalists-new-restrictions-hegseth-b9e70801f7d7930251a0740e7168f775">restrictions on their work</a></span>, pushing journalists who cover the American military further from the seat of its power. The nation‚Äôs leadership called the new rules ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù to help regulate a ‚Äúvery disruptive‚Äù press. </p><p>News outlets were nearly unanimous in rejecting new rules imposed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that would leave journalists vulnerable to expulsion if they sought to report on information ‚Äî classified or otherwise ‚Äî that had not been approved by Hegseth for release.</p>
    
<p>Many of the reporters waited to leave together at a 4 p.m. deadline set by the Defense Department to get out of the building. As the hour approached, boxes of documents lined a Pentagon corridor and reporters carried chairs, a copying machine, books and old photos to the parking lot from suddenly abandoned workspaces. Shortly after 4, about 40 to 50 journalists left together after handing in badges.</p><div data-align-center="">

<p>
The
<a href="https://rust-for-linux.com/">
Rust for Linux</a> project has been good for Rust, Tyler Mandry, one of the
co-leads of Rust's language-design team, said. He
gave a talk at
<a href="https://kangrejos.com/">
Kangrejos&nbsp;2025</a> covering upcoming Rust language features and thanking
the Rust for Linux developers for helping drive them forward. Afterward, Benno Lossin and Xiangfei Ding
went into more detail about their work on the three most important language
features for kernel development: field projections, in-place initialization, and arbitrary self types.
</p>

<p>
Many people have remarked that the development of new language features in Rust
can be quite slow, Mandry said. Partly, that can be attributed to the care the
Rust language team takes to avoid enshrining bad designs. But the biggest reason
is "<q>alignment in attention</q>". The Rust project is driven by volunteers,
which means that if there are not people focusing on pushing a given feature or
group of related features forward, they languish. The Rust for Linux project has
actually been really helpful for addressing that, Mandry explained, because it
is something that a lot of people are excited about, and that focuses effort
onto the few specific things that the Linux kernel needs.
</p>

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1040419">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2025/tyler-mandry-kangrejos-small.png" alt="[Tyler Mandry]" title="Tyler Mandry">
</a></p><p>
Mandry then went through a whirlwind list of upcoming language features,
including
<a href="https://github.com/Skepfyr/rfcs/blob/extern-types-v2/text/3396-extern-types-v2.md">
types without known size information</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/joshtriplett/rfcs/blob/use/text/3680-use.md">
reference-counting improvements</a>,
<a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-pre-rfc-generic-effect-system-for-functions/22550?utm_source=chatgpt.com">
user-defined function modifiers of the same kind as <tt>const</tt></a>, and more.
At the end, he asked which of those were most
important to Rust for Linux, and how the assembled kernel developers would
prioritize them. Beyond the three features to be discussed later,
Lossin said that the project definitely wanted the ability to
write functions that can be evaluated at compile time (called
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/keyword.const.html#compile-time-evaluable-functions">
<tt>const</tt>
functions</a> in Rust) in trait definitions.
Danilo Krummrich asked for
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/31844">
specialization</a>, which immediately
prompted an "<q>Oh no!</q>" from Lossin, due to the feature's nearly decade-long
history of causing problems for Rust's type system. Specialization would allow
two overlapping implementations for a single trait to exist, with the compiler
picking the more specific one. Matthew Maurer asked for some ability to control
what the compiler does on integer overflow.
</p>

<p>
Ultimately, Miguel Ojeda told Mandry that the priority should be on stabilizing the
unstable language features that Rust for Linux currently uses, followed by
language features that would change how the project structures its code, followed by
everything else. The next two talks went into much more detail about the current
status and future plans for some of those key language features.

<h4>Field projections</h4>

<p>
Field
projection refers to the idea of taking a pointer to a structure, and turning it
into a pointer to a field of the structure. Rust does already have this for the
built-in reference and pointer types, but it can't always be made to work for
user-defined smart-pointer types. Since the Rust for Linux developers would like
to have custom smart pointers to handle
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1034603/">
untrusted data</a>, reference counting,
external locking, and related kernel complications, they would benefit from a
general language feature allowing field projections for all pointer types using
the same syntax.
Lossin spoke about his work on the problem, which has been ongoing
since Kangrejos&nbsp;2022. There has been "<q>lots of progress</q>" so far, but the
work is still in the design stage, with a few details left to work out.
</p>

<p>
The built-in field projections all have the same kind of type signature, Lossin
explained. For example, the code for
converting a reference to an object into a reference to one of its
fields and the code for
converting a raw pointer to an object into a raw pointer to one of its fields
look different, but have similar signatures:
</p>

<pre>    fn project_reference(r: &amp;MyStruct) -&gt; &amp;Field {
        &amp;r.field
    }

    unsafe fn project_pointer(r: *mut MyStruct) -&gt; *mut Field {
        unsafe { &amp;raw mut (*r).field }
    }

    // The equivalent C code would look like this:
    struct field *project(struct my *r) {
        return &amp;(r-&gt;field);
    }
</pre>

<p>
This example uses the relatively recent
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2582-raw-reference-mir-operator.md">
raw borrow</a> syntax.
</p>

<p>
The
<a href="https://rust.docs.kernel.org/core/pin/struct.Pin.html">
<tt>Pin</tt></a> type throws a bit of a wrench into things.
The Rust
compiler is, by default, free to move structures around for performance reasons.
That doesn't work when the structure is being referenced from the C side, so the
<tt>Pin</tt> type is used to mark structures that shouldn't be moved.
Projecting a
<s><tt>Pin&lt;MyStruct&gt;</tt></s> <tt>Pin&lt;&amp;mut MyStruct&gt;</tt>
[Lossin sent LWN a correction: <tt>Pin</tt> is always used to wrap a pointer
type, not a structure directly]
might produce either a <tt>Pin&lt;&amp;mut Field&gt;</tt> or a
plain <tt>&amp;mut Field</tt> depending on whether the field is also of a type that
shouldn't be moved or not. So the most general possible signature for the field projection operation
would be something like this, Lossin said:
</p>

<pre>    Container&lt;'a, Struct&gt; -&gt; Output&lt;'a, Field&gt;
</pre>

<p>
That is, given some pointer type that wraps a structure and must be valid for
lifetime <tt>a</tt>, projecting a field gives a (possibly different) output
pointer type wrapping a field of that structure, valid for the same lifetime.
Lossin then gave an example of how supporting this could make fully implementing
read-copy-update (RCU)
support in the kernel's Rust bindings a lot easier.
</p>

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1040419#benno">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2025/benno-lossin-kangrejos-small.png" alt="[Benno Lossin]" title="Benno Lossin">
</a></p><p>
The RCU mechanism protects readers from concurrent writers, he explained, but it
doesn't protect writers from each other. It's somewhat common in the kernel, therefore,
to have a mutex protecting some data, with a frequently accessed
field of that data being protected by RCU. That way, readers rely on the RCU
lock (which is cheap), and writers synchronize with each other using the mutex.
Translating that interface to Rust poses problems: Rust doesn't allow any access
to the content inside a
<a href="https://rust.docs.kernel.org/kernel/sync/lock/mutex/type.Mutex.html">
<tt>Mutex</tt></a> without locking it first, so the
straightforward translation of this pattern wouldn't work. It would force Rust
readers to lock the mutex in order to read the RCU field, which would be an
unacceptable performance hit.
</p>

<p>
With generalized field projection in the language, though, the Rust for Linux
developers could write bindings that permit projecting a
<tt>&amp;Mutex&lt;MyStruct&gt;</tt> into an <tt>&amp;Rcu&lt;Field&gt;</tt> without holding
the lock. In driver code, attempting to read from the RCU-protected field
would look like a normal access, the same way it is in C ‚Äî but the compiler
would still check that the other, non-RCU-protected data isn't touched without
holding the mutex.
</p>

<p>
Lossin ended by asking the assembled developers to keep an eye on
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/146307">the tracking issue</a>
for the feature, and provide feedback on it. Daniel Almeida asked whether
testing the feature outside the mainline kernel was really helpful; Ojeda
affirmed that it was, because that makes it easier to go to the Rust team and
make a case to stabilize the feature. The Rust for Linux project is trying not
to use any new unstable features (and to compile with a version of Rust equal to
or older than the version
packaged on Debian stable), so the feature needs to be completed and make it
into Debian&nbsp;14 (expected in 2027) before it will be widely usable in kernel code.
</p>

<p>
Andreas Hindborg asked: "<q>Can we have this yesterday, please?</q>", to general
amusement. The kernel's Rust bindings already feature a plethora of custom
pointers encoding various invariants; this feature, whenever it becomes
available to kernel code, may make them a good deal easier to use in driver code.
</p>

<h4>Arbitrary self types</h4>

<p>
Ding gave an update immediately afterward about another ergonomic language
feature for custom pointers: arbitrary self types. In Rust, a method on a type
can have a first argument that is an object of the type or that is a reference
to one.
Such a method can be called with the <tt>.method()</tt> syntax, instead of the
more general <tt>Type::function()</tt> syntax. But the proliferation of smart
pointers in kernel Rust code means that the programmer frequently does not have
a plain reference; often, they instead have a
<tt>Pin</tt>, an
<a href="https://rust.docs.kernel.org/kernel/sync/struct.Arc.html">
<tt>Arc</tt></a>,
or some other smart-pointer type.
</p>

<p>
The arbitrary self types proposal that Ding has been working on would let
programmers write methods that take smart pointers, instead of normal references:
</p>

<pre>    impl MyStruct {
        fn method(self: Pin&lt;&amp;mut MyStruct&gt;) {}
    }
</pre>

<p>
Unfortunately, adding this to the compiler has not proved to be straightforward.
The interaction with  Rust's existing
<a href="https://rust.docs.kernel.org/core/ops/trait.Deref.html">
<tt>Deref</tt> trait</a>, which makes custom smart pointers possible in the first
place, complicates the implementation because not all of the type information is
available while searching for matching methods. Currently, if the user has a
<tt>Pin&lt;&amp;mut MyStruct&gt;</tt> and they call a method on it, the compiler
will first look for a matching method for <tt>Pin</tt>. If one isn't found, it
will try to dereference the type, producing a <tt>&amp;mut MyStruct</tt>. That
type is checked for matching methods, and then
is dereferenced one final time, producing a <tt>MyStruct</tt>. That type will
finally have a matching method, or else the compiler will emit a type error.
</p>

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1040419#xiangfei">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2025/xiangfei-ding-kangrejos-small.png" alt="[Xiangfei Ding]" title="Xiangfei Ding">
</a></p><p>
By the time that procedure begins checking functions associated with
<tt>MyStruct</tt>, it will have already discarded information about the wrapping
types, which an implementation of arbitrary self types needs.
Ding spent a few minutes explaining the approaches for
rectifying the problem that he had tried and discarded, before focusing on the
current approach. He has added another trait ‚Äî tentatively called
<tt>Receiver</tt> ‚Äî that is used to mark types that can be used with arbitrary
self types. Then the compiler can try following the chain of <tt>Receiver</tt>
implementations before following the chain of <tt>Deref</tt> implementations.
That does mean that a pointer type will have to opt into being used as an arbitrary
self type, but Ding didn't see that as a downside. Letting the author of a
pointer type decide when it should support the new feature eliminates a lot of
concerns around accidentally introducing backward compatibility problems. For
the kernel, it doesn't really impose a barrier, because the Rust developers can
just add <tt>Receiver</tt> implementations as they run across cases that require
them.
</p>

<p>
Ojeda asked how long Ding thought it would take to finalize the arbitrary self
types feature; in particular, would it be ready within a year? Ding agreed that
a year was possible, although he would need support from the Rust language team
in order to make that happen. He wants to run
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/crater?tab=readme-ov-file#crater">
Crater</a>, the tool that the Rust
community uses to check whether compiler changes break any published Rust
libraries, against his change before submitting the code. Ojeda offered help with
obtaining a large build machine to do that, since Ding has had trouble previously
with the memory requirements to compile some packages during a Crater run.
</p>

<h4>In-place initialization</h4>

<p>
The other topic that Ding wanted to cover was his work on in-place
initialization. Like the other new language features being discussed, this
doesn't really enable new use cases, but it does make common kernel code
cleaner. Currently, Rust code in the kernel uses the
<a href="https://rust.docs.kernel.org/kernel/prelude/macro.pin_init.html">
<tt>pin_init!()</tt> macro</a>
to create structures that are fixed in place after initialization (by being
wrapped in <tt>Pin</tt>).
</p>

<p>
There's nothing wrong with <tt>pin_init!()</tt>: "<q>We love <tt>pin_init!()</tt>! We
want to make a language feature out of it.</q>" Adopting a language feature for
in-place initialization would also help with a handful of sharp edges outside
kernel code; it could make creating large
<a href="https://rust.docs.kernel.org/core/future/trait.Future.html">
<tt>Future</tt></a> values on the heap
more ergonomic, and let some traits become
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html#dyn-compatibility">
dyn-compatible</a>. The exact design of
this language feature was more up in the air; Ding covered three different
proposals for how it could work.
</p>

<p>
The simplest, proposed by Alice Ryhl and Lossin, would be to add a new
keyword, <tt>init</tt>, before a structure-initializing expression in order to ask
the compiler to automatically write an
implementation of the kernel's
<a href="https://rust.docs.kernel.org/kernel/prelude/trait.PinInit.html">
<tt>PinInit</tt> trait</a>. That has the nice
benefit of being a fairly minimal change to the language, although it would lock
in the use of the <tt>PinInit</tt> trait in its current form.
</p>

<p>
Another solution,
<a href="https://hackmd.io/@rust-lang-team/r1zNmpwwgl#In-place-initialization-via-outptrs">
proposed</a> by Taylor Cramer, would introduce a new type of
reference into the language. Rust's existing references can either be read from
(<tt>&amp;</tt>) or read from and written to (<tt>&amp;mut</tt>). This proposal
would add a third type, <tt>&amp;out</tt>, that can only be written to, not read
from. The only way to use an <tt>&amp;out</tt> reference would be to
either write to it, or use projection to break it apart into multiple
<tt>&amp;out</tt> references to various fields. Under this scheme, in-place
initialization would look like allocating space on the heap, and then returning
an <tt>&amp;out</tt> reference. The calling code could then fill it in however
it wants to, potentially passing off sub-parts to other functions. The compiler
would track that the <tt>&amp;out</tt> references
are all used before allowing the code to obtain a
normal <tt>&amp;mut</tt> reference to the heap allocation.
</p>

<p>
That proposal was considerably less polished than Ryhl and Lossin's approach,
however. Ding later told me that he, Mandry, and other compiler contributors at
Kangrejos were actually working on figuring out how it
would interact with some of the Rust compiler's internals in between talks that
day. By the end of the conference, they had a rough idea of how it could be
implemented, so a more detailed version of the out-pointer proposal may be
forthcoming shortly.
</p>

<p>
The final design, taking inspiration from C++, would be a form of guaranteed
optimization, where constructing a new value and then immediately moving it to
the heap causes it to be constructed on the heap in the first place. Ding was
less sure about the details of the final proposal; he suggested that the best
way forward might be to implement both the <tt>PinInit</tt> proposal and the
out-reference proposal, and see how well each approach works in practice.
</p>

<p>
Regardless of which approach ends up being chosen, it seems clear that Mandry's
point about the Rust for Linux project driving language improvement is
correct. While these features are in the early stages, adopting them could
significantly simplify code involving user-defined smart pointers, both within
and outside the kernel.
</p>

<p>
<b>Update:</b> Since the talks described in this article, the work on field
projection has received an update. Lossin wrote in to inform LWN that all fields
of all structures are now considered structurally pinned, so projecting a
<tt>Pin</tt> will now always produce a <tt>Pin&lt;&amp;mut Field&gt;</tt> or
similar value.

	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">Last fall, Intuit‚Äôs longtime CEO Brad Smith embarked on a farewell tour of the company‚Äôs offices around the world. Smith had presided over 11 years of explosive growth, a period when Intuit had secured its place in the Silicon Valley pantheon, and the tour was like a long party.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">In Ontario, employees wore T-shirts with Smith‚Äôs quasi-spiritual sayings: ‚ÄúDo whatever makes your heart beat fastest‚Äù and ‚ÄúRepetition doesn‚Äôt ruin the prayer.‚Äù In Bangalore, India, workers put on Smith face masks as they posed for selfies with the man himself. Fittingly, the tour culminated in San Diego, the home of TurboTax, the software that transformed the company‚Äôs fortunes. There, Smith arrived at his party in a DeLorean, and as he walked a red carpet, cheering employees waved ‚ÄúBrad is Rad‚Äù signs. To Smith‚Äôs delight, his favorite rock star, Gene Simmons of Kiss, emerged. The two posed for pictures, Simmons clad in black and the beaming CEO flashing the ‚Äúrock on‚Äù hand sign.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">Intuit began in the 1980s as an accounting software company focused on helping people with their bookkeeping. Over time, the company, like the other giants of Big Tech, cultivated an image of being not just good at what it did, but good, period. In a recent Super Bowl ad, Intuit portrayed itself as a gentle robot that liberates small-business owners from paperwork. The company stresses values above all, urging employees to ‚Äúdeliver awesome‚Äù and pursue ‚Äúintegrity without compromise.‚Äù</p>
                
    

               

   
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">Intuit‚Äôs QuickBooks accounting product remains a steady moneymaker, but in the past two decades TurboTax, its tax preparation product, has driven the company‚Äôs steadily growing profits and made it a Wall Street phenom. When Smith took over in 2008, TurboTax was a market leader, but only a small portion of Americans filed their taxes online. By 2019, nearly 40% of U.S. taxpayers filed online and some 40 million of them did so with TurboTax, far more than with any other product.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.0">But the success of TurboTax rests on a shaky foundation, one that could collapse overnight if the U.S. government did what most wealthy countries did long ago and made tax filing simple and free for most citizens.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0">For more than 20 years, Intuit has waged a sophisticated, sometimes covert war to prevent the government from doing just that, according to internal company and IRS documents and interviews with insiders. The company unleashed a battalion of lobbyists and hired top officials from the agency that regulates it. From the beginning, Intuit recognized that its success depended on two parallel missions: stoking innovation in Silicon Valley while stifling it in Washington. Indeed, employees ruefully joke that the company‚Äôs motto should actually be ‚Äúcompromise without integrity.‚Äù</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.0">Internal presentations lay out company tactics for fighting ‚Äúencroachment,‚Äù Intuit‚Äôs catchall term for any government initiative to make filing taxes easier ‚Äî such as creating a free government filing system or pre-filling people‚Äôs returns with payroll or other data the IRS already has. ‚ÄúFor a decade proposals have sought to create IRS tax software or a ReturnFree Tax System; All were stopped,‚Äù reads a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6483065-Intuit-board-of-directors-presentation-2007.html">confidential 2007 PowerPoint</a> presentation from an Intuit board of directors meeting.

	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.0">The centerpiece of Intuit‚Äôs anti-encroachment strategy has been the Free File program, hatched 17 years ago in a moment of crisis for the company. Under the terms of an agreement with the federal government, Intuit and other commercial tax prep companies promised to provide free online filing to tens of millions of lower-income taxpayers. In exchange, the IRS pledged not to create a government-run system.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0">Since Free File‚Äôs launch, Intuit has done everything it could to limit the program‚Äôs reach while making sure the government stuck to its end of the deal. As ProPublica has <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-deliberately-hides-its-free-file-page-from-search-engines">reported</a>, Intuit added code to the Free File landing page of TurboTax that hid it from search engines like Google, making it harder for would-be users to find.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">Twelve years ago, Intuit launched its own ‚Äúfree‚Äù product: the similarly named ‚ÄúFree Edition‚Äù of TurboTax. But unlike the government program, this one comes with traps that can push customers lured with the promise of ‚Äúfree‚Äù into paying, some more than $200. Free Edition was a smash hit for Intuit and its pitch for ‚Äúfree‚Äù prep remains core to the company‚Äôs growth.

	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="16.0">Intuit also continues to use <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-just-tricked-you-into-paying-to-file-your-taxes">‚Äúdark patterns‚Äù</a> ‚Äî design tricks to get users of its website to do things they don‚Äôt necessarily mean to do ‚Äî to ensure that as many customers as possible pay, former employees say. A marketing concept frequently invoked at Intuit, which goes by the acronym ‚ÄúFUD,‚Äù seeks to tap into Americans‚Äô fear, uncertainty and doubt about the tax filing process.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0">An Intuit spokesman declined to answer ProPublica‚Äôs detailed questions about its efforts to fend off a government filing system, but he provided a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6476893-Intuit-Statement-to-ProPublica.html">statement</a>.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="18.0">‚ÄúWe empower our customers to take control of their financial lives, which includes being in charge of their own tax preparation,‚Äù he said, adding that a ‚Äúgovernment-run pre-filled tax preparation system that makes the tax collector (who is also the investigator, auditor and enforcer) the tax preparer is fraught with conflicts of interest.‚Äù</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0">The IRS is seemingly the biggest threat to Intuit and other commercial tax prep businesses, but it has more frequently acted as the industry‚Äôs ally, defending the Free File program even in the face of critical internal reviews. The IRS declined to comment for this article.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0">The consequences of Intuit‚Äôs efforts affect a huge proportion of the taxpaying public. Americans spend an estimated 1.7 billion hours and $31 billion doing their taxes each year. Just 2.8 million participated in the Free File program this year, down from 5.1 million at the program‚Äôs peak in 2005.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0">Intuit‚Äôs success has made the men who run the company rich. Smith, the CEO who stepped down last year and is now executive board chair, had a stake worth $20 million when he became chief executive. It ballooned to $220 million by last year.

	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0">This year, Intuit was close to realizing a long-held goal: enshrining the Free File program in law, effectively closing the door on the IRS ever creating a free tax filing system. But an outcry followed ProPublica‚Äôs reporting on the matter and Intuit‚Äôs treatment of its customers, prompting the provision to be <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/congress-scraps-provision-to-restrict-irs-from-competing-with-turbotax">dropped</a> and state and <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/senior-irs-leaders-launch-review-of-partnership-with-turbotax-and-h-r-block">federal</a> <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-maker-intuit-h-r-block-new-york-regulator-launches-investigation">investigations</a> into Intuit‚Äôs practices.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="24.0">Yet even after this setback, the company remained steadfastly confident that its clout in Washington would win the day.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0">‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre not gonna do is fight this publicly because that is exactly what they want us to do,‚Äù said Sasan Goodarzi, the new CEO, in a video released to staff this May and obtained by ProPublica. ‚ÄúWe are actually working with the IRS and members of the Congress to ensure that the facts are very clear.‚Äù</p>
            
	<hr>

            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.0">Intuit has dominated the tax software market since 1993, when for $225 million, it bought Chipsoft, the San Diego-based company that had created TurboTax. Even then, TurboTax was the most popular option, but Intuit pursued a plan of aggressive growth. The product necessarily came on a disk, and by the end of the 1990s TurboTax boxes were nearly ubiquitous, on shelves in office supply stores across America.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="28.0">As internet speeds increased and dot-com mania took hold, it became apparent that Intuit‚Äôs future was not in a box on a shelf. It was online.</p>
	
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="28.1">The prospect of TurboTax‚Äôs growth was vast for another reason. As late as 2001, around 45 million Americans still filled out their tax forms on paper. For Intuit, those were all potential customers.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0">But Intuit wasn‚Äôt alone in seeing possibilities in the spread of high-speed internet. In Washington, lawmakers began pushing the IRS to modernize and get more taxpayers to file electronically. It was a no-brainer: Filing taxes online would be easier, and the IRS would save staff costs on processing paper returns.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0">The danger to Intuit‚Äôs growing business was obvious. If the government succeeded in creating a system that allowed the vast majority of taxpayers to file online for free, TurboTax profits would plummet. Intuit recognized that the notion of ‚Äúreturn-free filing‚Äù was not going away on its own.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0">And so in 1998, the company hired Bernie McKay, a onetime Carter administration aide and a senior lobbyist at AT&amp;T, to be its vice president for corporate affairs. Intuit executives like to talk about having a ‚Äúcustomer obsession‚Äù in developing their products. McKay‚Äôs obsession is stopping government encroachment. Known to physically bang the table to drive home a point, McKay‚Äôs style is ‚Äúaggressive to the point of offense,‚Äù said one fellow tax prep lobbyist. An Intuit spokesman said, ‚ÄúThis mischaracterization of Mr. McKay is pure fiction.‚Äù</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.0">McKay, for his part, when asked at a recent tax industry conference which Star Wars character he is, responded, ‚ÄúDarth Vader.‚Äù</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.0">The year McKay was hired, Congress passed a major overhaul of the IRS. The bill, reflecting Intuit‚Äôs lobbying, said that the IRS ‚Äúshould cooperate with and encourage the private sector‚Äù to increase electronic filing.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="34.0">While McKay came through in his first big test, in 2002, the company found itself up against an unexpected foe, the George W. Bush administration. The threat came from a broad administration initiative to upgrade government technology. One of the proposals called for the IRS to develop ‚Äúan easy, no-cost option for taxpayers to file their tax return online.‚Äù</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.0">Without such an option, taxpayers were stuck either filing on paper or, to file electronically, paying a tax professional or software company like TurboTax. Providing an alternative would be an obvious improvement, said Mark Forman, an official at the Office of Management and Budget who led the ‚Äúe-government‚Äù program. The technology wasn‚Äôt all that complicated, and creating a free, automated filing system would help tens of millions of Americans. ‚ÄúThis was seen as a low-cost, high-payoff initiative,‚Äù Forman recalled in a recent interview with ProPublica. Standing in the way, he said, was an industry ‚Äúthat lives off the complexity of the tax code.‚Äù</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="36.0">Intuit revved its new lobbying machine. Even before the OMB report was publicly released, a group of Republican lawmakers, led by TurboTax‚Äôs hometown congressman, wrote to the agency arguing that there was no reason for the government to ‚Äúcompete‚Äù with the ‚Äúwell-established‚Äù private tax prep companies. Intuit‚Äôs lobbyists also went above the OMB and pressed their case directly to the White House, Forman recalled.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.0">At the IRS, ‚Äúall hell broke loose,‚Äù remembered Terry Lutes, who was then the head of electronic filing at the agency. Intuit‚Äôs clout on the Hill meant that lawmakers were soon accusing the IRS of making ‚Äúsecret plans to undercut the industry,‚Äù Lutes said. The agency ran the risk of seeing its funding cut if it were to pursue the Bush plan.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="38.0">The IRS commissioner at the time, Charles Rossotti, also opposed the idea. The IRS‚Äô customer service staff, already too thin to respond adequately to Americans‚Äô questions about the tax code, would have to grow substantially to handle millions of software queries. Congress ‚Äúwill never give you sufficient funding,‚Äù Rossotti told ProPublica.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="39.0">So the IRS felt caught in the middle. The question became, Lutes said, ‚ÄúIs there some way to come out of this with something for taxpayers that addresses the administration‚Äôs objective and at the same time is acceptable to industry?‚Äù</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="40.0">Intuit, it turned out, did have a way. Since 1999, as part of the company‚Äôs strategy to head off encroachment, TurboTax had been offering free tax prep to the poorest filers. It was a program that served to bolster the company‚Äôs arguments that government intervention was unnecessary.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="41.0">This became the basis for a deal. The industry would offer free tax prep to a larger portion of taxpayers. In exchange, the IRS would promise not to develop its own system.</p>

	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="43.0">Intuit organized a coalition of tax prep companies under the name the Free File Alliance, and after negotiations with the IRS, the group agreed to provide free federal filing to 60% of taxpayers, or about 78 million people at the time. Government officials touted the solution as a marvel of public and private cooperation. Americans would get free tax prep, and it would cost the government almost nothing.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="44.0">For Intuit, it was the culmination of years of lobbying. The IRS had signed a contract that said it ‚Äúwill not compete with the [Free File Alliance] in providing free, online tax return preparation and filing services to taxpayers.‚Äù</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="45.0">What‚Äôs more, ‚Äúfree‚Äù wasn‚Äôt as unprofitable as it sounded. The alliance, guided by a lawyer who was also an Intuit lobbyist, won a series of concessions that made the program palatable to industry. Free File only required the companies to offer free federal returns. They could charge for other products. The state return was the most common, but they could also pitch loans, ‚Äúaudit defense‚Äù or even products that had nothing to do with taxes.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="46.0">Free File had another bright side: The companies could tailor their Free File offers so that they didn‚Äôt cut into their base of paying customers. The agreement said the industry had to offer free federal services to at least 60% of taxpayers, but each company individually only had to cover 10% of taxpayers. Intuit and the others were free to limit their offers of free tax prep by age, income or state.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.0">There was little incentive for the companies to publicize a free alternative to their paid products, and the IRS agreed that the Free File offers need only be listed on a special page of the agency‚Äôs website.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="48.0">For Intuit, it was a major victory in the war against encroachment. The company could now focus on turning whatever new customers it acquired through the program into paying users, both that year and in the future.</p>
            
	<hr>

            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="50.0">The first year of Free File was 2003, and for Intuit, things went well. On paper, the Free File Alliance was a collection of 17 companies, all of them vying to serve the American taxpayer. But in reality, it was a group made up of two giants and a bunch of gnats. Intuit‚Äôs only significant competitor was H&amp;R Block, and even it was a distant second. The rest of the alliance consisted mostly of tiny companies with names like Free1040TaxReturns.com. As a result, Intuit could tailor its Free File offer just the way it wanted.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="51.0">But the next year, Intuit began to lose control of its creation. A scrappy competitor, TaxAct, decided to use Free File to stand out. The company decided it would try to pick up as many new customers as possible and then charge them for ancillary services. Instead of following Intuit‚Äôs lead and constraining its offer to a subset of low-income taxpayers, TaxAct went the opposite direction.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="52.0">‚ÄúWhy not go for an offer that‚Äôs much simpler to understand?‚Äù is how Lance Dunn, the president of the maker of TaxAct, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6480807-Lance-Dunn-Transcript-Day-2.html#document/p78">described</a> the strategy in a later court hearing. It began advertising a pitch for ‚Äúfree federal online tax preparation and e-filing for all taxpayers. No restrictions. Everyone qualifies.‚Äù</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="53.0">TurboTax‚Äôs offer on the Free File page, meanwhile, was more difficult to parse: ‚Äúif you are eligible for EIC, are age 22 or younger, age 62 or older, or active Military with a W2.‚Äù (EIC stood for the Earned Income Tax Credit.)</p>
            
    
                        
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="55.0">TaxAct‚Äôs ploy was a smashing success. The company‚Äôs volume exploded.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="56.0">Alarmed, Intuit tried to get the other companies not to offer their products for free to too many potential customers, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6477791-Lance-Dunn-Transcript.html#document/p50">according</a> to Dunn. Such a request could be collusion, a violation of antitrust law, Dunn said. ‚ÄúIntuit asked the Free File Alliance members that we should restrict offers, which I believe is probably not legal for that group to restrain trade,‚Äù he said.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="57.0">ProPublica asked Intuit about Dunn‚Äôs accusation, but the company did not respond.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="58.0">Dunn, who declined to speak with ProPublica, made these remarks during sworn testimony in 2011. The hearing was part of an antitrust case by the Justice Department against H&amp;R Block after it tried to buy TaxAct. The U.S. argued that, by eliminating a competitor, the merger would create a duopoly of Intuit and H&amp;R Block. Although the Justice Department ultimately blocked that takeover, the market has grown even more consolidated in recent years. In 2019, according to a ProPublica analysis of IRS data, the two giants accounted for 81% of all individual returns filed using tax prep software.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="59.0">On the defensive, Intuit and H&amp;R Block matched TaxAct‚Äôs ‚Äúno restrictions‚Äù offer on Free File. Americans rushed to file for free, and in 2005, 5 million people filed their taxes through the program. Free File had become the most popular way to file taxes online.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.0">Intuit viewed the popularity of Free File as a serious threat and took its case to Congress. That year, Brad Smith, then a senior vice president at the company and head of TurboTax, told a House committee that ‚Äúthe current Free File Alliance program has drifted very far from its original public service purpose and objective,‚Äù as he put it. The program wasn‚Äôt supposed to be for everyone, he said: It was for the ‚Äúdisadvantaged, underprivileged and underserved taxpayer populations.‚Äù</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="61.0">Intuit‚Äôs arguments quickly gained traction at the IRS. Already, in March 2005, the IRS had written to the Justice Department for legal advice on modifying the Free File program. The agency wanted to know: Would it run afoul of antitrust laws if the IRS barred companies in the Free File Alliance from offering a free product to everyone?</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="62.0">The Justice Department responded in a May 2005 <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6477776-DoJ-Free-File-Letter-to-IRS.html">letter</a>. Clearly, wrote Renata Hesse, an antitrust section chief at the department, ‚Äúany agreement among Alliance members to restrict such free service is likely a form of price fixing‚Äù and thus illegal. But there was still a way for Intuit to get what it wanted. She wrote that if the IRS itself were to impose such a restriction, it would be legal.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="63.0">The IRS swooped in to beat back Intuit‚Äôs competition, doing for Intuit what the company could not on its own. Despite just 5 million Americans using a program that was purportedly available to 80 million, the IRS agreed that Free File needed to be reined in.</p>

	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="65.0">The agency made its reasoning clear in a previously unreported letter sent to the Free File Alliance the following year. Bert DuMars, then head of electronic filing at the IRS, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6477777-IRS-Letter-to-Free-File-Alliance.html">wrote</a> that there‚Äôd been a huge jump in people using Free File in 2005, but no corresponding boom in people paying for tax prep. ‚ÄúIf this trend continued, the IRS was concerned that it could cause many vendors to go out of business,‚Äù he wrote. Stock market analysts, he pointed out, had said Free File ‚Äúrepresented a threat to future revenues and profits of the publicly traded company participants.‚Äù The IRS decided to remove this threat.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="66.0">The new agreement, struck between the IRS and the alliance in 2005, gave Intuit what it had sought. Companies were now expressly barred from offering free tax prep to everyone through the program. Instead, only taxpayers under an income cap, then $50,000 a year, would be eligible.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="67.0">On paper, the program‚Äôs eligibility had actually increased to 70% of taxpayers, or about 93 million households, up from the previous 78 million. But in practice, because broad, easy-to-understand offers were now barred, it was clear the program‚Äôs use would decline.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="68.0">Intuit had again bent the power of the federal government in its favor. After 2005, the Free File program was never again as popular, eventually falling to about half that year‚Äôs level.</p>

	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="69.0">With the threat of government encroachment on ice and high-speed internet access proliferating in the mid-2000s, Intuit looked forward to steady growth and big profits. The upside of the online software business was huge, with the cost of producing each additional unit approaching zero. And TurboTax was hardly a niche product: Intuit executives still excitedly talk about the TAM, total available market, of TurboTax as every single tax filer in the country, now over 150 million households.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="70.0">But TaxAct‚Äôs Free File gambit had forever transformed the industry. Advertising ‚Äúfree‚Äù was a great lure, so TaxAct took the battle to a different venue. Barred from making a free offer to everyone through Free File on the IRS‚Äô website, TaxAct decided to make the offer on its own website in 2006. Intuit recognized a credible challenge from the upstart and countered the next year, launching TurboTax Free Edition on its website.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="71.0">Confusingly, there were now two distinct options: the government-sponsored Free File and the commercial free editions.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="72.0">For customers who managed to qualify, the new commercial options offered by these companies were similar to what they could get on the IRS‚Äô Free File website: The underlying software was the same, only the federal return was free, and the companies expected to make money on each customer through charging for a state tax return or other services.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="73.0">But for the companies, there was a clear benefit to winning customers directly, rather than through the IRS program. The companies had complete control over how they handled customers from start to finish.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="74.0">Intuit poured ad dollars into its Free Edition. Not only did the new product effectively meet TaxAct‚Äôs challenge, it quickly became the major driver of TurboTax‚Äôs customer growth.</p>

                    <h3>How Intuit Stopped Free File From Spreading</h3>
                                    <p data-pym-src="https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/embed-free-file-annotated?layout=embed">Loading...</p>
                    </figure>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="76.0">That growth posed a challenge: how to, as internal company documents put it, ‚Äúmonetize free.‚Äù Over successive tax seasons, Intuit unleashed teams of designers, engineers, marketers and data scientists on that problem, working at its headquarters in Mountain View and TurboTax‚Äôs main offices in San Diego.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="77.0">Part of the solution was to pitch users side products like loans or ‚ÄúAudit Defense.‚Äù But it also meant misleading customers. Frequently ‚Äúfree‚Äù didn‚Äôt mean free at all. Many who started in TurboTax Free Edition found that if their return required certain commonplace tax forms, they would have to upgrade to a paid edition in order to file.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="78.0">The company came to a key insight: Americans‚Äô anxiety around tax filing is so powerful that it usually trumps any frustration with the TurboTax product, according to three former Intuit staffers. So even if customers click on ‚Äúfree‚Äù and are ultimately asked to pay, they will usually do it rather than start the entire process anew. Intuit capitalized on this tendency by making sure the paywall popped up only when the taxpayer was deep into the filing process.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="79.0">‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of desperation ‚Äî people will agree, will click, will do anything to file,‚Äù said a former longtime software developer.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="80.0">Every fall before tax season, the company puts every aspect of the TurboTax homepage and filing process through rigorous user testing. Design decisions down to color, word choice and other features are picked to maximize how many customers pay, regardless if they are eligible for the free product. ‚ÄúDark patterns are something that are spoken of with pride and encouraged in design all hands‚Äù meetings, said one former designer. In the design world, ‚Äú<a href="https://www.darkpatterns.org/">dark patterns</a>‚Äù are tactics to get users to do something they don‚Äôt necessarily mean to do. (ProPublica <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-just-tricked-you-into-paying-to-file-your-taxes">previously documented</a> dark patterns encountered by people trying to file their taxes for free.)</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="81.0">On TurboTax‚Äôs homepage, for example, the company carefully chooses how it describes the different editions. Prominently featured next to Deluxe Edition, which costs around $100, is the phrase ‚Äúmaximize your deductions.‚Äù</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="82.0">If users initially click on the Deluxe software, they are never offered the choice to go to the Free Edition even if the no-cost option would produce the same return. ‚ÄúMaximize your deductions‚Äù was legendary at Intuit for its effectiveness in steering customers eligible for free filing to buy the paid product, according to a former marketing staffer.</p>
                <figure data-pp-id="83" data-pp-blocktype="embed">
                    <h3>Intuit's Share Price Has Shot Up in Recent Years</h3>
                                    <p data-pym-src="https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/embed-intuit-stock-prices?layout=embed">Loading...</p>
                    </figure>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="84.0">Another celebrated feature, former staffers said, were the animations that appear as TurboTax users prepare their returns. One shows icons representing different tax deductions scrolling by, while another, at the end of the process, shows paper tax forms being scanned line-by-line and the phrase ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs comb through your returns.‚Äù What users are not told is that these cartoons reflect no actual processing or calculations; rather, Intuit‚Äôs designers deliberately added these delays to both reinforce and ease users‚Äô ‚ÄúFear, Uncertainty, and Doubt.‚Äù The animations emphasize that taxes are complicated but also reassure users that the technological wizardry of TurboTax will protect them from mistakes.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="85.0">In a statement, the Intuit spokesman said, ‚ÄúThe process of completing a tax return often has at least some level of stress and anxiety associated with it. ‚Ä¶ To offset these feelings, we use a variety of design elements ‚Äî content, animation, movement, etc. ‚Äî to ensure our customers‚Äô peace of mind.‚Äù</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="86.0">The 2007 launch of Free Edition started a period of rapid growth for TurboTax. Within two years, use of its web products had almost doubled, and over the past decade, its website has grown each year by an average of 2 million more customers. The company reported this year that TurboTax online had handled 32 million returns. In a statement, it said around a third of that number used Free Edition.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="87.0">The government‚Äôs Free File program, meanwhile, has mostly faded into the background, drowned out by Intuit‚Äôs and other companies‚Äô ‚Äúfree‚Äù offers. The IRS did try advertising campaigns, spending around $2 million some years to spread the word. But compared with the reach of Intuit, this was a pittance: The company reported this year that it spent $800 million on advertising. With its budget <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-irs-was-gutted">slashed</a> by Congress, the IRS has spent no money at all to advertise the program in recent years.</p>
            
	<hr>

            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="89.0">Amid its success, Intuit has sometimes had to put down insurgents bent on reforming the tax filing system. In 2007, the same year Intuit launched its Free Edition, Barack Obama, then a candidate for president, took aim at the tax prep industry. In a speech to an audience of tax wonks in Washington, he promised that the IRS would establish a simple return system. ‚ÄúThis means no more worry, no more waste of time, no more extra expense for a tax preparer,‚Äù he declared.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="90.0">But the Obama administration, as Bush‚Äôs had before, found that it was no match for Intuit.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="91.0">Again, Bernie McKay, the lobbyist who had joined Intuit in the late 1990s and outlasted multiple CEOs, led the company‚Äôs campaign. In response to the Obama threat, McKay and Intuit‚Äôs small army of outside lobbyists turned to Congress, where lawmakers friendly to the company introduced a series of bills that would elevate Free File from a temporary deal with the IRS to the law of the land.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="92.0">Republicans have historically been the company‚Äôs most reliable supporters, but some Democrats joined them. <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/L000397-zoe-lofgren">Rep. Zoe Lofgren</a>, the California Democrat whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, has introduced or co-sponsored five bills over the years that would codify the Free File program, with names like the Free File Permanence Act. Lofgren‚Äôs spokesperson told ProPublica that the congresswoman believes the IRS, because of its role as tax collector, should not also be the tax preparer.</p>
                        
                
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="94.0">Hedging its bets, the company also sought to make sure the IRS could not spend a single dollar creating a public filing system. One internal document says Intuit would ‚Äúadvance legislative language in House Appropriations for ‚ÄòNo Funds‚Äô restriction on IRS spending‚Äù on such a system. It worked. Within a few years, Congress passed a 3,000-page appropriations bill that included a single sentence crucial to Intuit‚Äôs financial future: ‚Äú<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6396945-PLAW-114publ113.html#document/p190">No funds</a>,‚Äù the law decreed, could be used ‚Äúto provide to any person a proposed final return or statement.‚Äù</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="95.0">Another important aspect of Intuit‚Äôs influence strategy during the Obama years was covertly <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-maker-linked-to-grassroots-campaign-against-free-simple-tax-filing">enlisting</a> minority and women‚Äôs groups to press its case.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="96.0">The <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6483061-Intuit-TurboTax-2014-15-Encroachment-Strategy.html">internal 2014-15 ‚Äúencroachment strategy‚Äù document</a> discloses plans to ‚Äúleverage trade groups to support House/Senate Free File bills.‚Äù It goes on to list the groups Women Impacting Public Policy, The Latino Coalition and the National Black Chamber of Commerce.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="97.0">Intuit has given money to all of those groups over the years. All have signed letters urging Congress to make the Free File deal permanent. ‚ÄúThe Free File program has been a clear success,‚Äù said one <a href="https://www.atr.org/conservative-coalition-free-file-solution-tax-complexity">letter</a> signed by The Latino Coalition and the Hispanic Leadership Fund.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="98.0">A spokesperson for Women Impacting Public Policy said it has received $70,000 from Intuit. The amounts given to the other groups are unknown, and they did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
	
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="98.1">Company documents also outline plans to ‚Äúmobilize‚Äù a ‚Äúcoalition‚Äù that included think tanks and academics, who published op-eds.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="99.0">Will Marshall, president of the pro-business Progressive Policy Institute, opposed return-free filing in an <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-a-budget/293095-return-free-filing-proposal-is-not-tax-reform">op-ed</a> in The Hill because doing one‚Äôs taxes is ‚Äúa teachable moment [that] prompts us to review our financial circumstances.‚Äù</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="100.0">Anti-tax activist Grover Norquist, the most consistent champion of Intuit‚Äôs policy positions, <a href="https://www.atr.org/taxpayer-advocates-issue-joint-free-file-a7496">warned</a> that ‚Äúbig spenders in Washington, D.C. want to socialize all tax preparation in America.‚Äù</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="101.0">It is unclear whether they were paid by Intuit or the Free File Alliance. Norquist didn‚Äôt respond to a request for comment, and a Progressive Policy Institute spokesman declined to say whether Intuit gave the group money.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="102.0">Whatever external challenges to the status quo Intuit has faced, the company has been able to rely on the IRS‚Äô continuing enthusiastic support of the Free File program. Every few years, the IRS and the industry got together to renew the deal.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="103.0">In part, that was due to the relationships Intuit had developed with high-ranking IRS officials. One, Dave Williams, served as the agency‚Äôs top negotiator on the Free File program for several years and ‚Äúwas very commercially sensitive,‚Äù said Mark Ernst, the CEO of H&amp;R Block until 2007. Ernst, who later held a senior role at the IRS, told ProPublica that Williams ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt want to offend the industry,‚Äù noting that ‚Äúhe was particularly open to having sidebar conversations with key people where he could imagine himself landing some day.‚Äù</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="104.0">Today, Williams works at Intuit, where he‚Äôs held the title of chief tax officer since 2013. He is one of several former IRS employees who have gone on to work there. In a statement, Williams told ProPublica he did not have discussions about future employment with Intuit or other companies until after he left the IRS. He added that his career in government was focused on ‚Äúwhat is best for the taxpayer‚Äù and that he ‚Äújoined Intuit for the same reason: to help the American taxpayer.‚Äù</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="105.0">Despite Free File‚Äôs declining use, the IRS often claimed that the program was nevertheless meeting one of its original goals: driving more people to file electronically instead of on paper. Ernst, who served as a senior official at the IRS from 2009 to 2010, didn‚Äôt believe that a program used by so few people was having any such effect. ‚ÄúIt was a talking point that got trotted out all the time to justify the Free File Alliance,‚Äù he said.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="106.0">Internally, IRS managers have also argued that the program is, in a way, a success, because it created ‚Äúa free marketplace,‚Äù as one internal management <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6550454-2017-11-BPR-Page.html">report</a> in 2017 put it. Apparently, customers weren‚Äôt the only ones taken in by the word ‚Äúfree.‚Äù</p>
            
	<hr>

            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="108.0">In 2018, Intuit faced rare scrutiny from inside the IRS. The agency asked its Advisory Council, a group of outside experts, to take stock of Free File. To the company‚Äôs alarm, it soon became apparent that the council‚Äôs report might be sharply critical.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="109.0">That July, council chair and University of California, Davis, law professor Dennis Ventry wrote two pieces criticizing an Intuit-backed bill in Congress that would make the program permanent. His <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/395762-free-file-providers-scam-taxpayers-congress-cant-be-fooled">op-ed</a> in The Hill was called, ‚ÄúFree File providers scam taxpayers; Congress shouldn‚Äôt be fooled.‚Äù</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="110.0">In response, the IRS again rose to Intuit‚Äôs aid. It rushed to assure the company that Ventry‚Äôs power to affect the program was limited, according to <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6191309-Free-File-IRS-Records-FOIA.html#document/p14">emails</a> to the Free File Alliance obtained through a public records request.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="111.0">‚ÄúThe Commissioner has met directly with Mr. Ventry,‚Äù IRS official Ken Corbin wrote to Steve Ryan, a lobbyist for Intuit who also represented the alliance. ‚ÄúMr. Ventry will recuse himself from participating or contributing to the topic of Free File.‚Äù</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="112.0">Corbin heads the IRS division that processes most Americans‚Äô tax returns and negotiates the Free File deal with Intuit and the industry.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="113.0">A few days later, Ryan arrived at the IRS‚Äô Constitution Avenue headquarters in Washington to mount a defense of the program. A former Democratic Senate aide turned lawyer-lobbyist, Ryan is known on Capitol Hill for taking on politically fraught clients, including Trump attorney Michael Cohen and the government of Qatar. He helped create Free File in the early 2000s, and it was now his job to secure its future.</p>
                        
                
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="115.0">Ryan‚Äôs <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6030111-FFA-PPT-Presentation-to-IRSAC-July-2018.html#document/p8">PowerPoint</a> presentation at the IRS rehashed arguments that the company had been making for the past 15 years. It also highlighted a 2013 study by Brown University professor <a href="https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Economics/Faculty/John_Friedman/">John Friedman</a>, a former Obama National Economic Council official, to make the point that the program had been successful in generating ‚ÄúFree Tax Returns <strong>Outside</strong> of Free File.‚Äù The presentation did not mention that Friedman‚Äôs study was paid for by the Free File companies and was not published in an academic journal. Friedman declined to say what he was paid but told ProPublica he ‚Äúwrote the piece based on my analysis of the issues, which I stand by.‚Äù</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="116.0">Ventry, who attended the meeting, got a call the next day alerting him that a California public records request had been filed for his emails ‚Äî they were subject to such a request because he‚Äôs an employee of a state university. It came from the Free File Alliance, as The New York Times later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/us/politics/freedom-of-information-requests.html">reported</a>. The request, Ventry believes, was designed to ‚Äúfreak me out.‚Äù</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="117.0">In early October, the council sent a version of its final report, which included a harsh appraisal of the Free File program, to the IRS to seek responses before releasing it publicly the following month.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="118.0">But in mid-October, just weeks before the report saw the light of day, the Free File industry group fired off an ‚Äú<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6191309-Free-File-IRS-Records-FOIA.html#document/p9">urgent</a>‚Äù request to meet with IRS officials. The goal was to re-sign and ‚Äúimprove‚Äù the memorandum of understanding that governed the Free File program, according to the emails. The current agreement wasn‚Äôt expiring for another two years, but Ryan cited the ‚Äútime urgency to make changes that will benefit taxpayers‚Äù in the coming tax season, adding, ‚ÄúI have not darkened your door in 2018 and need your ‚Ä¶ attention to this opportunity.‚Äù</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="119.0">The IRS‚Äô Corbin signed the new deal on Oct. 31. Two weeks later, the Advisory Council report was released, with a damning indictment of the program: ‚ÄúThe IRS‚Äôs <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5910811-Internal-Revenue-Service-Advisory-Council.html#document/p15">deficient oversight</a> and performance standards for the Free File program put vulnerable taxpayers at risk,‚Äù the report found.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="120.0">The expert body recommended that the IRS negotiate a series of new provisions designed to increase the use and oversight of the program, including mandating advertising by the companies. But it was too late. A new deal had already been signed with modest changes. As it had in the past, Intuit and the alliance had effectively insulated the program from reform. Members of the council, Ventry said, were ‚Äúpissed off.‚Äù</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="121.0">A spokesman for the Free File Alliance said the group had pushed to renegotiate the deal in 2018 because of the looming 2020 presidential campaign. ‚ÄúThe reason for the timing of the extension of the agreement was the political season,‚Äù he said. The group had not seen the report before its release, he added.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="122.0">(In August, ProPublica sued the IRS to get more correspondence between the agency and Intuit‚Äôs lobbyists. In response to our Freedom of Information Act requests, the agency has withheld over 100 pages. The case is ongoing.)</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="123.0">The new deal included rules that barred Free File companies from offering extra products to the relatively small number of users who access the program. This makes it much more difficult to convert those users into paying customers.</p>
            
    
                        
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="125.0">At around the same time, the industry took steps to make the program more difficult to find. Both Intuit and H&amp;R Block added code to their Free File websites that shielded them from search engines such as Google. The Intuit spokesman said the company increased paid search advertising for Free File ‚Äúby nearly 80 percent‚Äù over the last year and has data showing more people found the program through online search this year than last year, but he declined to provide specific figures.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="126.0">What is clear is that Intuit‚Äôs business relies on keeping the use of Free File low. The company has repeatedly declined to say how many of its paying customers are eligible for the program, which is currently open to anyone who makes under $66,000. But based on publicly available data and statements by Intuit executives, ProPublica estimates that roughly 15 million paying TurboTax customers could have filed for free if they found Free File. That represents more than $1.5 billion in estimated revenue, or more than half the total that TurboTax generates. Those <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/here-are-your-stories-of-being-tricked-into-paying-by-turbotax-you-often-need-the-money">affected</a> include retirees, students, people on disability and minimum-wage workers.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="127.0">Customers, meanwhile, remain confused by Intuit‚Äôs myriad uses of ‚Äúfree,‚Äù and internal documents show the company knows it. Over just a two-week period this past filing season, Intuit received nearly 7,000 TurboTax customer calls in which the phrase ‚Äúsupposed to be free‚Äù was uttered, according to a company analysis. One customer complained that Intuit charged him even though ‚Äúit says ‚Äòfree free free‚Äô on the commercial.‚Äù The TurboTax representative responded: ‚ÄúThat ad has been the bane of my existence.‚Äù</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="128.0">Even as TurboTax‚Äôs business thrived, 2019 has been a rocky year for Intuit‚Äôs long-running war against government encroachment. In April, the company was close to finally succeeding in its long-held goal to make Free File permanent. A bill called the Taxpayer First Act was sailing toward almost unanimous approval in Congress. But after ProPublica published a <a href="https://www.propublica.org/series/the-turbotax-trap">series</a> of stories about the program, including a story showing that <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-military-discount-trick-troops-paying-to-file-taxes">military families</a> and <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-tax-law-threatened-turbotax-profits-started-charging-disabled-unemployed-and-students">students</a> were particularly affected by Intuit‚Äôs business tactics, the bill stalled. Congress ultimately <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/congress-scraps-provision-to-restrict-irs-from-competing-with-turbotax">removed</a> the provision that would have enshrined Free File in law.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="129.0">After having enabled Intuit for so long, the IRS finally responded to the pressure. It hired a contractor to review the Free File program. But the contractor had <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/irs-funded-review-confirms-turbotax-hid-free-filing-from-search-engines-but-says-theres-no-need-for-major-changes">previously argued</a> against the IRS offering its own tax prep option, and the review did not recommend major changes. The agency has not yet announced its plans for the future of the program.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="130.0">The agency‚Äôs inspector general also launched an audit, which is ongoing. Other investigations and litigation followed, ranging from class-action complaints, alleging that consumers had been deceived by Intuit‚Äôs tactics, to investigations and lawsuits by regulators and prosecutors in New York and California. Intuit has denied wrongdoing, saying it ‚Äúhas at all times been clear and fair with its customers.‚Äù</p>
            
    
                        
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="132.0">Despite the scrutiny, Wall Street has continued to embrace the company‚Äôs business model. The company recently announced it made $1.5 billion in profits for its fiscal year. It expects its TurboTax unit to grow by 10% next year. Last year the CEO was paid $20 million. The share price hit an all-time record.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="133.0">The company has returned to its old strategy: stay the course and take its case directly to the IRS and Congress. Its allies in the Senate have again advanced an appropriations bill that would bar the IRS from developing its own tax filing system. In the spring, Sasan Goodarzi, a former head of the TurboTax unit who took over as CEO of the entire company in January, sought to reassure employees.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="134.0">‚ÄúOur view is this will be in the press until there is a resolution with the IRS,‚Äù he said, according to the video obtained by ProPublica. ‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôre working with them and we feel very good about where this will end.‚Äù</p>

   <p>One of the pillars of modern medicine is showing its cracks, according to a new report from the World Health Organization.</p>   <p>Antibiotics have turned once-deadly infections into minor inconveniences. They make lifesaving interventions, from surgery to chemotherapy, safer. But every time this powerful tool gets used, there's a risk ‚Äî antibiotic resistance.</p>   <p>Out of the billions of bacteria causing an infection in an individual, some small fraction may be naturally resistant to a given drug. Taking an antibiotic can clear the field for those resistant bacteria to spread.</p>   <p>"Antimicrobial resistance is just basic evolution," says <a href="https://profiles.ucla.edu/kevin.ikuta" target="_blank">Kevin Ikuta</a>, an infectious disease physician and researcher at UCLA. He says we need antibiotics, but "we are in this battle we're trying to lose as slowly as possible anytime we treat an infection."</p>   
   <p>Humans are losing that battle faster than previously thought. In 2023, roughly <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/B09585" target="_blank">1 in 6 infections</a> tested by labs worldwide were resistant to antibiotic treatment, according to WHO. The report says nearly 40% of antibiotics used to treat common urinary, gut, blood and sexually transmitted infections have lost effectiveness over the past five years.</p>   <p>"Frankly, it's quite concerning," says <a href="https://onehealthtrust.org/researchers/ramanan_laxminarayan/" target="_blank">Ramanan Laxminarayan</a>, president of One Health Trust, a nonprofit. "We do see increases in resistance every year, but here we see a pretty sharp increase."</p>   <p>Antimicrobial resistance is already directly responsible for about <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance" target="_blank">1.2 million deaths</a> a year and contributes to nearly 5 million, according to WHO. That toll could grow, says Laxminarayan.</p>   <p>"We're sleepwalking into a disaster," he says. "I shouldn't say we are ‚Äî we already have sleepwalked into a disaster."</p>   <h3><strong>Hot spots of resistance&nbsp;</strong></h3>   <p>The jump in resistance was sharpest in low- and middle-income countries with weaker health systems, the report found. Countries with less-robust systems to track <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/05/14/853984869/antibiotic-resistance-is-still-a-top-health-worry-its-a-pandemic-worry-too" target="_blank">antibiotic resistance</a> tended to report higher levels, too.</p>   <p>"For some of the most common infections that afflict tropical countries, nearly 50 to 60% of the infections are now drug resistant," says Laxminarayan.</p>   <p>These higher numbers could reflect biased data, where weak surveillance systems only pick up the worst infections that are more likely to be resistant to antibiotics. But they could also reflect genuinely higher levels of resistance.</p>   
   <p>"It's probably both," says Laxminarayan.</p>   <p>Weak surveillance systems tend to be coupled with weaker health systems. That means "you probably have less infection prevention and control, less vaccination, weaker water and sanitation system," he says, which can breed resistance.</p>   <p>Easier access to basic antibiotics could be playing a role too.</p>   <p>"You don't necessarily need a prescription to get an antibiotic in a lot of countries," says Ikuta. That can lead to misuse, for instance <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/05/29/g-s1-1647/covid-pandemic-superbugs-antibiotic-resistance" target="_blank">treating a viral infection with antibiotics</a>, which could give resistant bacteria a leg up without providing any therapeutic benefit.</p>   <h3><strong>Less access, more resistance</strong></h3>   <p>While misuse is a problem in lower-income countries, the bigger problem is that effective antibiotics ‚Äî especially those that wealthier countries use when more basic ones fail ‚Äî are often out of reach for those who need them most.</p>   <p>"In the U.S., if the first two drugs didn't work for you, likely you could afford the third drug," says Laxminarayan. "That option is not available to someone living in Cote d'Ivoire or The Gambia." That can leave infections insufficiently treated, ultimately fueling the fire of resistance.</p>   <p>Those dynamics are part of what's driving <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2023/11/07/1209109088/antibiotics-that-fight-deadly-infections-in-babies-are-losing-their-power" target="_blank">increased resistance</a> among the most commonly prescribed antibiotics ‚Äî especially carbapenems and fluoroquinolones ‚Äî that target a wide range of bacteria.</p>   <p>As resistance to those first-choice antibiotics grows, physicians are left with older and more potentially toxic medications, or newer drugs that aren't widely available, especially in lower-income countries, says Ikuta. "So we're either left with an untreatable infection or with a treatment where the side effects may be as toxic as the infection itself," he says. "It's quite the pickle, clinically."</p>   <p>Getting out of that pickle won't be easy.</p>   <p>For one, it'll require a clearer global picture of resistance. While more countries are submitting data to WHO to help track global resistance levels, there are still major gaps.</p>   
   <p>Last year, 48% of countries didn't report any resistance data to WHO. Among the countries that did, nearly half still lack robust surveillance systems, the WHO says.</p>   <p>Better surveillance data can help physicians narrow down which antibiotics to use, ensuring more effective treatments that minimize resistance.</p>   <p>Physicians also need newer, better antibiotics. Developing drugs that target bacteria in novel ways can help humans get ahead of resistance, but <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/02-10-2025-who-releases-new-reports-on-new-tests-and-treatments-in-development-for-bacterial-infections" target="_blank">WHO says</a> the global pipeline of new treatments isn't flowing fast enough to meet the need.</p>   <p>The clock is ticking, says Ikuta. If progress isn't made and resistance continues to grow, medical care we take for granted could be at risk.</p>   <p>"It's not just the treatment of acute infections and sepsis, it's making sure surgery is safe and effective, and chemotherapy is available," he says. "These advancements in medicine are on the back of antibiotics, so when we lose antibiotics, we risk losing those."<br></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-windows-move-towards-surveillance/">https://www.scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-windows-move-towards-surveillance/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45600338">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
        

<p>Recently, the Secure Resilient Future Foundation released a <a href="https://fighttorepair.substack.com/p/the-windows-10-zombie-apocalypse" target="_blank">newsletter</a> calling for Microsoft to extend Windows 10 support past the October 14th deadline.</p>

<p>With the release of Windows 11, the threat to data privacy is the worst it‚Äôs ever been. In my recent article, ‚Äú<a href="https://www.scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-looking-back-windows-to-linux/" target="_blank">Looking back at my transition from Windows to Linux in an anti-customer age</a>‚Äù, I wrote about my switch to Linux and how it saved me from having to sacrifice my freedom in the name of convenience.</p>

<p>Whether you‚Äôre a business or a home user, I‚Äôm here to tell you that in many cases, Linux is a real alternative to Windows. So instead of pushing the goal post back from the brink of an Orwellian nightmare. I‚Äôm suggesting all of us consider switching Linux now.</p>

<p>Microsoft‚Äôs design of Windows 11 is a concern because:</p>

<ol>
<li>Computer manufacturers, due to pressure from Microsoft, are designing new computers with artificial limitations like TPM and Secure Boot. These unnecessary add-ins push consumers to unnecessary hardware upgrades<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</li>
<li>In the setup of newly purchased consumer-grade computers, there is obfuscation in the installation language. Many of the default choices are aimed at confusing customers into selecting options that share data with vendors:

<ul>
<li>The process of setting up OneDrive to act as a backup of data. Without consent, the setup of this configuration moves all customers‚Äô data to the cloud service, re-points all the user folders to a cloud-specific OneDrive folder that‚Äôs very difficult to revert.</li>
<li>The process of selecting a browser is obfuscated by Microsoft‚Äôs Edge Browser setup</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The AI tool Co-pilot is installed and enabled without consent. Removal is difficult or nonexistent.</li>
<li>The history tracking tool ‚ÄúRecall‚Äù that is due to be released, sometime in the future, saves snapshots of your user experience into Microsoft‚Äôs OneDrive cloud. It looks great on paper, but in reality, this feature, along with others, will be used to move forward a surveillance state.</li>
<li>Windows 11 prevents the complete uninstall of many of its built-in features. They can be removed from one user account, but they can be reinstalled during an update, or if you upgrade your computer, without your consent.</li>
<li>Microsoft Edge is forced on users as a replacement by obfuscating choice in various ways.<br></li>
</ol>

<p>Due to these concerns, I will be recommending Linux as a replacement for new computers I build for my customers. You can still request Windows if Linux doesn‚Äôt work for you.</p>

<p>Linux Distribution Replacements for Windows
1. Zorin OS: A Windows-like Linux experience, requires modern hardware
2. PopOS: Built for gamers out of the box
3. Ubuntu: All-around desktop, requires modern hardware
4. Elementary OS: For minimalist users
5. MX Linux: For 10+ years, hardware</p>

<p>If you currently have a computer with Windows installed that you are unhappy with, <a href="https://www.scottrlarson.com/#contact">contact</a> me about migrating to Linux. It‚Äôs never been a better time for freedom in Linux.</p>

<h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>

<p>Linux is a different desktop environment from Windows, which requires different programs to make use of your data.  Please note that if you are a power user or a gamer, due to the way developers use vendor lock-in with their software products, certain software or games might not work, or will need to be replaced by alternatives. Below is an incomplete list of typical situations that will not work at this time. If you have any questions about these concerns, <a href="https://www.scottrlarson.com/#contact">contact</a> me to schedule a consultation to further talk about your specific use-case and the costs involved:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adobe Cloud Products - See some <a href="https://itsfoss.com/adobe-alternatives-linux/" target="_blank">alternatives</a></li>
<li>Most anti-cheat specific games</li>
<li>Microsoft Office and Outlook - Alternative for Microsoft Office: LibreOffice, Alternative for Outlook: Thunderbird (Does not handle Office 365 services very well; in this case, I suggest migrating your contacts, calendars, and email to an IMAP-hosted mail provider)</li>
<li>QuickBooks - Requires an Online Hosted alternative</li>
<li>Turbotax - Requires an Online Hosted alternative</li>
</ul>

    <p>This post wraps up my notes on chapter 5 of <a href="https://sebastianraschka.com/">Sebastian Raschka</a>'s book
"<a href="https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch">Build a Large Language Model (from Scratch)</a>".
Understanding <a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2025/10/llm-from-scratch-20-starting-training-cross-entropy-loss">cross entropy loss</a> and
<a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2025/10/llm-from-scratch-21-perplexed-by-perplexity">perplexity</a> were the hard bits for
me in this chapter -- the remaining 28 pages were more a case of plugging bits together and
running the code, to see what happens.</p>

<p>The shortness of this post almost feels like a damp squib.  After writing so much
in the last 22 posts, there's really not all that much to say -- but that hides the fact that
this part of the book is probably the most exciting to work through.  All these pieces
developed with such care, and with so much to learn, over the preceding 140 pages,
with not all that much to show -- and suddenly, we have a codebase that we can let
rip on a training set -- and our model starts talking to us!</p>

<p>I trained my model on the sample dataset that we use in the book, the 20,000
characters of "The Verdict" by Edith Wharton, and then ran it to predict next tokens after "Every effort
moves you".  I got:</p>

<pre><code>Every effort moves you in," was down surprise a was one of lo "I quote.
</code></pre>

<p>Not bad for a model trained on such a small amount of data (in just over ten seconds).</p>

<p>The next step was to download the weights for the original 124M-parameter version of
GPT-2 from OpenAI, following the instructions in the book, and then to load them
into my model.  With those weights, against the same prompt, I got this:</p>

<pre><code>Every effort moves you as far as the hand can go until the end of your turn unless something interrupts your control flow. As you may observe I
</code></pre>

<p>That's amazingly cool.  Coherent enough that you could believe it's part of the instructions for a game.</p>

<p>Now, I won't go through the remainder of the chapter in detail -- as I said, it's essentially
just plugging together the various bits that we've gone through so far, even though the results
are brilliant.  In this post I'm
just going to make a few brief notes on the things that I found interesting.</p>


    
        <h3 id="randomness-and-seeding">Randomness and seeding</h3>

<p>One thing I really do recommend to anyone working through the book is that you type
in all of the code, and run it yourself -- it really will help you remember
how stuff fits together.</p>

<p>There is one slight issue I found with that, however:
the book has a number of examples where you get output from code that uses randomness -- for
example, where you take a look at the loss it has on some sample text before you
start training, or make it generate samples during the train.</p>

<p>Now, in theory, because Raschka puts <code>torch.manual_seed</code> calls before all of these,
the results you get should be exactly the same as the outputs in the book.  However,
the amount of code we're working with at this stage is quite large -- we have various
helper functions that were created in earlier sections, for example.  And some of these
use randomness.</p>

<p>That means that to get the same results as the ones in the book, you would need to ensure
that all of the code that uses randomness was running in exactly the same order as it was
when Raschka did it for the book.  That turns out to be surprisingly hard!</p>

<p>My instinct is that it doesn't actually matter all that much.  So long as the loss numbers
that you see are in the same ballpark as the ones in the book, and the outputs you see
are roughly equally incoherent (before training) and become more coherent at what feels like
the same kind of rate, you're fine.  Probably the most important one to look out for
is when the training run starts -- you should see loss on the training set decreasing steadily,
just like in the book, and likewise as in the book, the validation loss should plateau out pretty early.</p>

<h3 id="optimisers">Optimisers</h3>

<p>When I have built simple backpropagation through neural networks in the past, I've
generally updated parameters by multiplying the gradients by a small number, the
<em>learning rate</em>, and then subtracting them from their respective parameters to get
updated ones -- classic <em>stochastic gradient descent</em>.</p>

<p>Non-trivial ML uses optimisers; I'd come across them while <a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/fine-tuning">fine-tuning LLMs</a>,
and also used one in the RNN code I wrote <a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2025/10/revisiting-karpathy-unreasonable-effectiveness-rnns">last week</a>.
Instead of updating the parameters yourself, you ask the optimiser to do it for you, by
calling its <code>step</code> function.  <a href="https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.AdamW.html">AdamW</a> appears to be the default optimiser in most textbooks,
though <a href="https://kellerjordan.github.io/posts/muon/">Muon</a> seems to be the most popular
in use, if my AI X/Twitter feed is to be believed.</p>

<p>I don't understand how optimisers work in any detail, and I'm going to have to dig into that in the future.  However, my
high-level simplified picture right now is that they dynamically adjust the learning
rate over time, so that it's easier to take big "jumps" downwards on the gradients when
you start, and then smaller ones later.  I believe they can also sometimes avoid local
minima in the loss landscape -- a nice metaphor I read somewhere (lost the source, sadly)
was that simple gradient descent was like rolling a ball down a hill, but (some?) optimisers give the ball a bit
of momentum so that it can coast over a small uphill portion, so long as the general
slope is downwards.</p>

<p>Anyway, more investigation needed later.</p>

<p>In practice, with AdamW, you initialise it at the start of your training loop,
with a learning rate (which I imagine is similar to the one my older code used, a
scaling factor for gradients) and a weight decay (:shrug:).  You also provide it with the parameters
it's going to be managing.</p>

<p>In the training loop, at the start of each input batch, you tell it to zero out the gradients it's managing
with <code>optimizer.zero_grad()</code>, run the data through your model and calculate your loss, and then after
calling <code>loss.backward()</code> to get your gradients,
you just call <code>optimizer.step()</code>, and that does the parameter update.</p>

<p>Again, I want to dig into how optimisers work in more detail in the future.  But
for now, I think that's all I need to know.</p>

<h3 id="speed-and-the-cost-of-training">Speed, and the cost of training</h3>

<p>The book tells you how to train on a public domain book, "The Verdict" by Edith Wharton.
Full training on the hardware that people are likely to have to hand would be extremely
expensive, so we just train on that short example, then later on learn how to download
and use the weights that OpenAI made available for their GPT-2 models.</p>

<p>But there was something that surprised me a little.  When talking about the training
run on "The Verdict", Raschka says that it takes "about 5 minutes to complete on a MacBook
Air".</p>

<p>On my machine using CUDA on an RTX 3090, it took just less than eleven seconds.</p>

<p>This makes perfect sense, of course -- there's a really good reason why AI training
is normally done on GPUs or custom hardware, and the MacBook Air would presumably
be training on the CPU.  But I was a little surprised at how huge the difference was
in this simple example!</p>

<p>Now, while the book mentions that Llama 2 probably cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to train,
I must admit that I do wonder how much it really would cost to train a 124M parameter
model on my own hardware -- or, indeed, on the machines with 8x 80GiB A100 GPUs that I rented
from Lambda Labs during my fine-tuning experiments.</p>

<p>Andrej Karpathy was able to <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/discussions/481">train a 124M GPT-2 model for $20</a>,
using his hand-written C/CUDA LLM system <code>llm.c</code>.  That is undoubtedly more efficient than the
PyTorch code that we're working on in this book.  But it really would be interesting
to find out whether it would be doable for me at all!  The training data he used
is the 10B-token version of the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb">FineWeb</a> collection, which
is freely available. <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I think I have a good candidate for a next project when I've finished the book;
see how many tokens/second I can train on locally -- that will allow me to estimate
how long it would take to train one epoch over the whole training set.  I imagine
that will be longer than I'm willing to leave my desktop machine tied up doing this,
but then I can try mixing in the lessons I learned doing fine-tuning, and see if I can
get it up and running on Lambda Labs.  If the cost is in the tens of dollars, or even a hundred or so, I really
think it would be worthwhile!</p>

<h3 id="memorisation-temperature-and-top-k-sampling">"Memorisation", temperature and top-k sampling</h3>

<p>One thing I found a little confusing in this chapter -- and this is very much a nit -- was the section on preventing
"memorisation"; I think this was due to a mismatch in the meaning I attach to the word,
and the way it's used here.</p>

<p>To me, memorisation is something that the model does during training -- if you keep
training a 124M-parameter model on a 20,000-character file, as we're doing here, then whatever
happens the model is going to memorise it -- it's unavoidable.  The only way to reduce
memorisation in this sense would be to increase the amount of training data (and even
then, as the findings in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html">lawsuit</a>
by the New York Times against OpenAI show, some stuff would be memorised).</p>

<p>In the book, "memorisation" is being used to mean something more like what I'd call "parroting" --
issues with the model just repeating the stuff that it has memorised, because it was always
choosing the most-probable next word.  Avoiding this is super-important, of course!  It's
just the framing that confused me a little.</p>

<p>The techniques are nifty, anyway.  The first cut -- just use the softmaxed logits
as a probability distribution and sample from it -- is obvious enough.  Temperature
is a clever trick on top of that -- just divide the logits by some number greater than
one before softmax, and you can make the distribution that comes out flatter (or you can
make it more "pointy" by dividing by a number less than 1).  The
graphs in the book showing how that works are great, but I asked Claude to knock together a
<a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/post-assets/llm-from-scratch-22-finally-training-our-llm/temperature-playground.html">temperature playground</a>
website, which I found made things even clearer to me.</p>

<p>And finally, the top-k technique -- only consider the <em>k</em> most probable tokens, and
then do the temperature/softmax calculations -- was a sensible addition to add on top
of that.  The code is clever: identify the top k logits, get the value of the lowest one
of them, and then replace every logit less than that with minus infinity.  When you
run that through softmax, you get zeros for the ones that were replaced, and the probability
distribution is based on the remainder.</p>

<p>So: excellent stuff, and very well explained in the book -- it just didn't feel like
preventing "memorisation" specifically was what it was doing, at least based on what I
take the word to mean.</p>

<h3 id="downloading-the-openai-weights">Downloading the OpenAI weights</h3>

<p>At the end of the chapter, we download the weights for the original GPT-2 model
that OpenAI produced from their site, and load them into our own model.</p>

<p>The code to download weights is (thankfully) something that you don't need to type
in, as it's downloadable from GitHub.  And in one specific related case, I'll also contradict what I said earlier
about typing stuff in yourself -- I definitely recommend that you copy the
<code>load_weights_into_gpt</code> that copies the downloaded weights into our own model
from GitHub too.  I did actually type it all in and I don't think I gained anything
from doing that.</p>

<p>One thing I did notice while going through that section was that I'd been making a
mistake as I wrote up this series; I'd thought that all GPT-2 models had 768 embedding
dimensions.  It turns out that this is only true of the 124M model in that series, and
the larger ones have more.  That makes a lot of sense -- and I've updated the older
posts to reflect it.</p>

<h3 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h3>

<p>That's all I really have to add to what is in the rest of chapter 5.  Like I said at
the start, it feels almost like a let-down to be writing so little about a section
of the book that has such amazing results!  But now we have a working LLM, and
at least the foundations that might allow us to train our own from scratch if we had
the resources.</p>

<p>Next up: using it to classify text.  Will this be quick and easy?  Or will it lead down
another fascinating rabbit hole?  Time will tell...</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>ImapGoose is a small program to keep local mailboxes in sync with an IMAP
server. The wording ‚Äúkeep [‚Ä¶] in sync‚Äù implies that it does so continuously,
rather than a one-time sync. ImapGoose is designed as a daemon, monitoring both
the IMAP server and the local filesystem, and immediately synchronising changes.
When the IMAP server receives an email, it shows up in the filesystem within a
second. When an email is deleted on another email client, it is removed<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
from the filesystem within a second.</p><p>ImapGoose is highly optimised to reduce the amount of network traffic and tasks
performed. To do so, it relies on a few modern IMAP extensions and only supports
modern email servers. ‚ÄúModern servers‚Äù in the context of email means <em>servers
which support extensions which were standardised between 2005 and 2009</em>.</p><p>ImapGoose uses the CONDSTORE extension (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4551">standardised in 2006</a>),
which basically allows it to tell the server ‚ÄúI last saw this mailbox when it
was in state XYZ, please tell me what‚Äôs new‚Äù. This avoids the need to download
an entire message list (which can be tens of thousands of emails), making
incremental syncs much more efficient. It also uses the QRESYNC extension
(<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5162">standardised in 2008</a>) so that the server includes a list of deleted
messages too (i.e. <code>VANISHED</code>). Finally, ImapGoose uses the NOTIFY extension
(<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5465">standardised in 2009</a>), which allows an IMAP client to tell the server
‚Äúplease let me know when there are changes to these mailboxes‚Äù, and then leave a
connection open. <code>NOTIFY</code> has two nice consequences: (1) the client doesn‚Äôt need
to ask the server if there have been any changes at regular intervals, and (2)
the client is informed of any changes immediately, so they can be processed
without delay. Unlike the older IDLE extension (from 1996), NOTIFY (from 2009)
allows monitoring multiple mailboxes per connection, rather than just one.</p><p>In this article, I‚Äôll cover some of the general design details, inner workings
and other development details.</p><h2 id="general-mode-of-operation">General mode of operation<p>[<a href="#general-mode-of-operation">permalink</a>]</p></h2><p>First off, ImapGoose keeps a small status database with some minor metadata
about the last-seen status of both the server and local Maildirs. This includes
the mapping between server UIDs and filesystem filenames. Its general design is
strongly inspired by <a href="https://blog.ezyang.com/2012/08/how-offlineimap-works/">how OfflineIMAP works</a>.</p><p>At start-up, ImapGoose lists all mailboxes in the server and in the local
filesystem. It then starts monitoring them (the server via NOTIFY, the client
via inotify/kqueue), so we receive notifications of any changes that may happen
after our initial listing. This ensures that, for example, if we receive a new
email while performing the initial sync, we get a notification for it.</p><p>Once monitoring is set up, ImapGoose queues a task to perform a full sync of
each mailbox. Initially, we determine if this is the first time we see this
mailbox by its absence in the status database. If this mailbox has not been seen
before, then we request all messages. The server returns all of these along with
a <code>HIGHESTMODSEQ</code>, which we store in the status database. This <code>HIGHESTMODSEQ</code>
is a numeric property of each mailbox and increases every time a change occurs
inside that mailbox. If a mailbox has been seen before, then we can ask the
server for changes since that <code>HIGHESTMODSEQ</code>, which delivers only the minimal
amount of data which we need, and nothing else about all the other thousands of
unchanged messages.</p><p>When a message is present in the server and absent in the filesystem (or vice
versa), we need to determine whether it is a new message, or if it is a message
that was previously present in both and deleted from the local filesystem. To
determine this, we use the status database and apply the exact same algorithm as
offlineimap. It‚Äôs simple and well tested.</p><p>At times, ImapGoose may disconnect from the server (for example, due to a laptop
disconnecting from Wi-Fi, or going into sleep mode). It will try to re-connect
automatically using an exponential back-off: after 1 second, then after 2
seconds, 4 seconds, 8 seconds, 16 seconds, 32 seconds,‚Ä¶ all the way up to 17
minutes. Then it will continue retrying every 17 minutes. This means users don‚Äôt
really have to worry about ImapGoose‚Äôs current state, whether it‚Äôs still
working, etc. It knows how to back-off when there‚Äôs no network and how to get
back to work when it is feasible again.</p><p>As mentioned above, ImapGoose ‚Äúqueues‚Äù sync tasks. Internally, it uses a task
queue; when changes are detected on the server, a task to sync that entire
mailbox is queued. A worker picks this up from the queue, asks for changes in
that mailbox, and synchronises them. When changes are detected in the
filesystem, a task to sync that particular message is queued. It may happen that
multiple messages arrive in quick succession for the same mailbox. In this case,
we don‚Äôt want to trigger multiple syncs of the same mailbox, and we especially
don‚Äôt want two workers to sync the same mailbox concurrently: this would quickly
lead to duplicate emails.</p><p>To work around concurrent syncs and redundant mailbox updates, ImapGoose uses a
‚Äúdispatcher‚Äù, which hands off sync tasks to workers. When a task to sync a
specific mailbox is handed to a worker, that mailbox is marked as ‚Äúbusy‚Äù, and we
don‚Äôt process other tasks for that queue until that worker notifies that it has
finished its work on that mailbox. While a worker is synchronising a mailbox, we
may receive several notifications that changes have happened to that mailbox.
These changes could be the result of the changes made by the worker, or they
could be new emails being delivered, so we have to queue another task to sync
that mailbox. These tasks are kept in queue until the worker frees up the
mailbox, and the dispatcher additionally de-duplicates them: synchronising a
mailbox just once after the last change notification is enough to synchronise
the changes in all the notifications.</p><p>When a message changes in the filesystem, ImapGoose receives an inotify event.
This doesn‚Äôt trigger a sync of the full mailbox, but instead a ‚Äútargeted‚Äù sync,
which focuses only on that email message. We know that a single message has
changed, so there‚Äôs no point in re-scanning the thousands of messages in the
mailbox. These targeted syncs are taken into account in deduplication; they only
get de-duplicated if the path for them is the same.</p><p>While the connection which is listening for changes from the server is kept
alive by sending periodic NOOP commands, the connections for workers are allowed
to time out. If no activity is happening, these connections simply time out, but
a connection is re-established once a worker needs it again. Great care has been
taken to avoid unnecessary churn in all possible aspects.</p><h2 id="prior-art">Prior art<p>[<a href="#prior-art">permalink</a>]</p></h2><p>Before developing ImapGoose, I studied prior art in the field. In particular,
offlineimap does a great job at synchronising mailboxes. However, it doesn‚Äôt
‚Äúkeep in sync‚Äù in the same way; offlineimap needs to execute periodic syncs,
doesn‚Äôt rely on modern extensions, and tends to ‚Äúhang‚Äù when there are network
time-outs. ImapGoose is new and has no existing users, so it can just require
modern extensions or declare other scenarios as unsupported. Existing tools have
to maintain compatibility for existing users, which might rely on some legacy
email server. If I couldn‚Äôt rely on NOTIFY, implementing ImapGoose in such a
clean efficient way would not have been possible. If I couldn‚Äôt rely on
<code>CONDSTORE</code> and <code>QRESYNC</code>, I would have had to download lists of thousands of
emails each time even a single one changes. Thanks to <code>UIDPLUS</code>, the server
returns the UID of a newly uploaded message, and we don‚Äôt need any ugly
workarounds to retrieve it.</p><p>If someone needs to sync data from legacy servers, plenty of tools are still out
there, providing the best experience which those servers can offer.</p><h2 id="development">Development<p>[<a href="#development">permalink</a>]</p></h2><p>When working on ImapGoose, I focused exactly on my needs for my particular use
case: keep my local mailboxes in sync with an IMAP server. There‚Äôs no other
supported scenario, there‚Äôs no fallback for legacy servers, and there‚Äôs no
support for alternative email backends. All these constraints allowed me to
focus on making a tool that‚Äôs great for a single use case: it does one thing and
does it well.</p><p>I strongly believe that my keeping tight constraints (e.g.: focusing on just one
use case, ignoring support for legacy servers, keeping things as simple as
possible) helped develop this much faster and with much cleaner results.</p><p>I started with a very clear picture of how the whole thing would work. I was
also familiar with <a href="https://github.com/emersion/go-imap">go-imap</a>, and knew it to be a well designed and well
implemented IMAP library. My immense appreciation goes to <a href="https://emersion.fr/">emersion</a> and the
contributors who‚Äôve worked on it. I didn‚Äôt need to worry about the inner details
of talking to an IMAP server, parsing responses, tracking connection state, etc.
go-imap provides a simple idiomatic Go interface for IMAP commands and their
responses.</p><p>go-imap was lacking two features which I needed: support for the NOTIFY command
and for VANISHED (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5162#section-3.6">rfc5162</a>). While still standing on the shoulders of giants, I
implemented both of these and sent patches for both of them
(<a href="https://github.com/emersion/go-imap/pull/718">NOTIFY</a>, <a href="https://github.com/emersion/go-imap/pull/720">VANISHED</a>). Until those are merged, ImapGoose is built
using my own (temporary) fork which has those two patches applied.</p><h2 id="configuration">Configuration<p>[<a href="#configuration">permalink</a>]</p></h2><p>For configuration, I opted for the very simple and straightforward scfg
configuration format. The configuration file looks something like:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="txt"><span><span>account example {
</span></span><span><span>    server imap.example.com:993
</span></span><span><span>    username hugo@example.com
</span></span><span><span>    password-cmd pass show email/example
</span></span><span><span>    local-path ~/mail/example
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="naming">Naming<p>[<a href="#naming">permalink</a>]</p></h2><p>I wanted something easy to remember, easy to pronounce and that won‚Äôt yield
thousands of unrelated search engine results. There‚Äôs also room for an obvious
mascot/logo: a goose wearing a postman‚Äôs hat carrying an envelope, using the
colour palette from the Go ecosystem. Please reach out if you are an illustrator
willing to contribute with artwork.</p><h2 id="open-source">Open source<p>[<a href="#open-source">permalink</a>]</p></h2><p>ImapGoose is open source and distributed under the terms of <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~whynothugo/ImapGoose/tree/main/item/LICENCE">the ISC

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.vincentuden.xyz/blog/pdf-reader">https://www.vincentuden.xyz/blog/pdf-reader</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45598776">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>Acrobat is intrusive, slow and non-customizable.</p>
<p>Of course there are alternatives, specifically bad ones.</p>
<ul>
<li>FoxIt is slow and non-customizable.</li>
<li>Chrome/Firefox kinda works as a PDF reader, but is lacking in the feature department.</li>
</ul>
<p>On linux there is (at least) one non-bad PDF reader. Zathura is amazing with the MuPDF backend. However it only works on X11/Xorg and thus Linux. I use Wayland and Windows.</p>
<h2 id="zathura-2">Zathura-2?</h2>
<p>If I could just reach parity with the features from Zathura it would be the perfect program for me. And perhaps I could even create a more approachable program for others as well.</p>
<p>Zathura is keyboard focused, featuring a modal navigation system and command line, just like in Vim. I love that, but it‚Äôs not for everyone, and it‚Äôs not even always for me depending on what I‚Äôm doing. Mouse controls are great, when they are optional.</p>
<p>Hot reloading PDFs when they change on disk is a killer feature as well. But it can be pushed even further. What if you switch to another file in your editor? Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if the PDF reader could switch with the editor, automatically?</p>
<p>A config for customizing key bindings is a no-brainer. It also comes with a dark-mode, not just for the interface but also for the PDF itself.</p>
<p>Last but not least, it would be nice if the PDF reader could show PDFs.</p>
<p>If I could manage to implement this rather small set of features, where the last feature is the most difficult by far. Then I could go on reading PDFs as a happier man than before.</p>
<h2 id="pdf-rasterisation">PDF rasterisation</h2>
<p>I read somewhere once that problems should always be tackled in the order from most to least difficult if you‚Äôre serious about solving them. Makes enough sense to me. Climb the mountain first and coast downhill afterwards, ticking off features with increasing speed and decreasing effort as you grow tired of the project.</p>
<p>Parsing the gigantic PDF specification and transforming decades worth of revisions into a bunch of pixels is certainly that most difficult task.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this herculean task has already been tackled by others. Once again I took inspiration from Zathura. It has a backend for rendering which uses <a href="https://mupdf.com/">MuPDF</a> for rasterisation and other PDF-parsing uses. Since I already enjoyed the performance and look of PDFs in Zathura, I might as well base my solution on the same set of giant shoulders.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://mupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/c/index.html">official documentation</a> is pretty good, if you already understand how MuPDF works and just needs to refresh your memory on the API. But when you are just starting to dip your toes into this massive library, some additional structure is greatly appreciated. For this purpose, I read parts of <a href="https://casper.mupdf.com/docs/mupdf_explored.pdf">MuPDF Explored</a>, an online-book by <a href="https://pdfa.org/people/robin-watts/">Robin Watts</a>.</p>
<p>If rasterising PDFs is a passion of yours, I highly recommend the book. It contains everything from the simplest of PDF-to-PNG examples, to cached workflows that achieve hundreds of renders per second.</p>
<h2 id="user-interface">User interface</h2>
<p>Writing a cross-platform native GUI has always seemed way harder than it has any right to be. On one hand you have the giants, Qt and GTK which expose enormous API surfaces and might require several books of their own to understand properly. Not to mention <em>interesting</em> licensing in the case of Qt.</p>
<p>One the other hand you have the Raylib/OpenGL/etc. style of creating user interfaces. Nothing is included, if it is, it isn‚Äôt customizable at all.</p>
<p>Usually, I am quite partial to the second approach. This time however, I wanted to find something in between the extremes. After rummaging through everything from <em>Slint</em> to <em>Dear Imgui</em> I finally settled on giving <a href="https://iced.rs/">iced</a> a shot. As mentioned in <a href="https://www.vincentuden.xyz/blog/pcb_management">Open source bom management</a>, I have actually used iced before for smaller programs. Now it was time for something more complex.</p>
<p>Design-wise, there isn‚Äôt a whole lot to mention. I settled on a pretty standard layout of a main window with a sidebar containing bookmarks and a document outline.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of the PDF reader" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" sizes="(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw" data-astro-image="constrained" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.vincentuden.xyz/_astro/miro.BRlS3Rfq_1fj9Uw.webp" srcset="https://www.vincentuden.xyz/_astro/miro.BRlS3Rfq_1aVF6T.webp 640w, https://www.vincentuden.xyz/_astro/miro.BRlS3Rfq_Z21XU9d.webp 750w, https://www.vincentuden.xyz/_astro/miro.BRlS3Rfq_Z2unSH3.webp 828w, https://www.vincentuden.xyz/_astro/miro.BRlS3Rfq_1fj9Uw.webp 1024w"></p>
<p>The interface can of course turn dark. And so can the PDF!</p>

<p>In the grand scheme of things, I‚Äôm very happy with the performance of the reader. Specifically I like that it is fast enough to be <em>simple</em>. As mentioned by the likes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9_bK_WjuYY">Ryan Fleury</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUOOaXf9qIM">Vjekoslav Krajaƒçiƒá</a> among many other: <em>speed is a feature in itself</em>.</p>
<p>Zathura with the muPDF backend is unable to zoom smoothly while maintaining a clear rasterisation of the PDF. It zooms optimistically by upscaling the current bitmap which results in a pop-in a fraction of a second later when a crisp rendition replaces the blurred one.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/vincent-uden/miro">Miro</a> on the other hand leverages a feature called <code>DisplayList</code> to cache some data internally in muPDF to achieve several hundred, crisp renders per second if needed.</p>
<p>Before discovering <code>DisplayList</code>s, I had a complex and multi threaded system that rendered the PDF in tiles. This was awful to work with. Bugs arose from the asynchronous nature of rendering on a background thread and pixel-perfect rendering was near impossible to get right at tile borders.</p>
<p>Optimizing and probing mupdf for more advanced features led me to a simple solution, over a thousand lines of code shorter than the multi-threaded solution.</p>
<p>The only point where my PDF reader struggles is on pages using embedded svgs (or other PDFs) with several thousand entities contained, such as un-optimized graphs in scientific papers. I would love to resolve this some day.</p>
<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<p>To me, basic configuration is a must-have for any program I use. As long as I can change the keybindings of common features I‚Äôm happy.</p>
<p>Since a PDF <strong>reader</strong> doesn‚Äôt imply any editing I could avoid implementing a modal keybinding system. Miro uses a simple config file:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span><span># Vim-like movement keys</span></span>
<span><span>Bind j      MoveDown</span></span>
<span><span>Bind k      MoveUp</span></span>
<span><span>Bind h      MoveLeft</span></span>
<span><span>Bind l      MoveRight</span></span>
<span><span>Bind J      NextPage</span></span>
<span><span>Bind K      PreviousPage</span></span>
<span><span>Bind H      PreviousTab</span></span>
<span><span>Bind L      NextTab</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span># ...</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span># RPC server settings</span></span>
<span><span>Set Rpc False</span></span>
<span><span>Set RpcPort 7890</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span># Display scaling factor for high-DPI displays</span></span>
<span><span># Use 1.0 for normal displays, 1.5 for 150% scaling, 2.0 for 200% scaling, etc.</span></span>
<span><span>Set ScaleFactor 1.0</span></span></code></pre>
<p>In fact the default bindings are bound via a <code>default.conf</code>, not hard-coded in the source code.</p>
<h2 id="remote-procedure-calls">Remote procedure calls</h2>
<p>Like Zathura, Miro automatically watches all open PDF files to reload them as soon as they change on disk. However we can take that one step further.</p>
<p>If enabled in the config file, Miro can run a server in the background which listens for remote calls from other programs. The RPC server can open PDFs, close them and toggle the dark mode. In the future it could also allow for switching pages.</p>
<p>This implies a possible coupling between your preferred editor (for example Neovim) and the PDF reader. Perhaps you‚Äôd want to sync the light/dark color scheme between your editor or desktop environment and Miro. Or you could auto-open PDF files as soon as they are opened in the editor.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to implement a Latex, Typst or Markdown editor, this approach allows for the integrated editing and preview environment you‚Äôre used to from web development but for any sort of file that is possible to compile to PDF.</p>
<h2 id="where-do-i-get-it">Where do I get it?</h2>
<p>Do you want to compile from source?</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="sh"><code><span><span>cargo</span><span> install</span><span> miro-pdf</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Are you fine with a pre-compiled binary, are on Windows (compiling this sucks on Windows) or prefer a faster install?</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="sh"><code><span><span>cargo</span><span> binstall</span><span> miro-pdf</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Do you want a pre-compiled binary but don‚Äôt have cargo installed? Check out the <a href="https://github.com/vincent-uden/miro/releases">release page</a>.</p>
<p>Want to check out the source code or report an issue? Check out the project on <a href="https://github.com/vincent-uden/miro">Github</a>.</p>
<h2 id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding thoughts</h2>
<p>I am not done with this project, eventually I want to entirely replace the UI layer with a home-cooked GUI library I am working on. Additionally I‚Äôd love some light editing features, such as comments or annotations.</p>
<p>Still, I am very satisfied with the outcome. This is my current, best attempt at bringing the Unix philosophy to the process of writing documents that compile to PDFs. Finally I have the reader that fills my needs.</p>  </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
              <p><strong>tldr:</strong> I won‚Äôt personally see <em>all</em> comments/issues/PRs anymore; maintainer team is being granted tag+release privileges; community will be more involved with leadership; increase current bus factor of 1; unblock the project where I am the bottleneck; help the project scale better.</p>
<hr>
<p>Caddy is now about 11 years old, and the project has changed a lot over that time, and grown hugely popular! To shed some perspective‚Ä¶</p>
<h2><a name="p-106854-what-it-used-to-be-like-1" href="#p-106854-what-it-used-to-be-like-1"></a>What it used to be like</h2>
<p>For years, my daily-ish routine involved checking my GitHub notifications ‚Äì usually around 1-3 ‚Äì triaging them and responding to each one of them personally. Most issues were obvious: bugs that needed urgent fixing, features that were a clear yes/no for the project, or questions that had easy answers.</p>
<p>Even after the launch of v2, the project was still new and developing, most other people didn‚Äôt have a lot of experience with it, and my vision was clear, so it was pretty easy to answer questions, make decisions, review the trickle of pull requests, etc. I wrote most of the code and was familiar with it.</p>
<p>My notification inbox essentially became my TODO list, and it was fairly easy to keep under 1 page (or about 25 notifications). At any given time, Caddy almost never had more than 100 open issues or 25 open PRs.</p>
<p>Later, we set up a forum, which I‚Äôd check multiple times per day and reply to questions there. Usually about 1-3 posts per day. No problem keeping up with it all. I read <em>every single topic</em> for years, and answered many of them myself to help educate others and be aware of user experiences, etc.</p>
<p>I tagged and published every single release. Sometimes multiple per day (oops). Over 100 now.</p>
<h2><a name="p-106854-how-it-changed-over-time-2" href="#p-106854-how-it-changed-over-time-2"></a>How it changed over time</h2>
<p>As the project grew, the docs improved substantially via contributions. More nits and edge cases were covered. Examples were added (and more to come, I‚Äôm sure).</p>
<p>Knowledge began to accumulate in the community, meaning that people could answer more questions by search results, and help others find answers to their questions, which tended to grow more niche since the general questions were answered. (This is precisely the outcome I‚Äôd hoped for over years with a public forum.)</p>
<p>You may recognize some of these people who stuck around as they gained experience, and have helped others in our community and with code maintenance (in no particular order): <a href="https://caddy.community/u/whitestrake">@Whitestrake</a> , <a href="https://caddy.community/u/francislavoie">@francislavoie</a> , <a href="https://caddy.community/u/elcore">@elcore</a> , <a href="https://caddy.community/u/abiosoft">@abiosoft</a> , <a href="https://caddy.community/u/mohammed90">@Mohammed90</a> , <a href="https://caddy.community/u/weidideng">@WeidiDeng</a> , <a href="https://caddy.community/u/tobya">@tobya</a> , <a href="https://caddy.community/u/timelordx">@timelordx</a> , <a href="https://caddy.community/u/elee">@elee</a> , <a href="https://caddy.community/u/hairyhenderson">@hairyhenderson</a> , and many others who have contributed their time and skills to help out. I am very appreciative! As are thousands of lurkers. <img src="https://caddy.community/images/emoji/apple/slight_smile.png?v=14" title=":slight_smile:" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<h2><a name="p-106854-what-its-like-now-3" href="#p-106854-what-its-like-now-3"></a>What it‚Äôs like now</h2>
<p>Forum activity is up about 2-5x. Where we used to get 1 topic per day, sometimes it‚Äôs up to 10 (it fluctuates, but the average is about 3-5). And posts average around 5-15. It can be higher when there‚Äôs people actively helping answer questions. This is not huge, but it‚Äôs a lot for just myself and our little community. Our forum gets about 50,000 page views per day!</p>
<p>Many of the questions now are either so niche that I don‚Äôt have the skills/expertise to answer them (many, many questions are less about Caddy specifically these days, and more about external system configurations, third-party software integrations, etc.), OR they are trivial/routine enough that others who have a bit of experience can easily answer them (i.e. I don‚Äôt have to be the one to respond, since the knowledge is shared by many now).</p>
<p>On GitHub, my notification inbox is almost out of control: I have just under 200 in the inbox, or about 8 pages ‚Äì and that‚Äôs my TODO list that I work through each day. Caddy has almost 200 open issues and over 50 open PRs. I wake up to about 10-25 new notifications per day now, instead of 1-3. Again, this is still quite good for a project of our size, but it‚Äôs more than just the backlog‚Ä¶</p>
<p>The issues are also more obscure and less obvious. For example, bugs used to be pretty obvious and easy to reproduce. Most could be fixed in a few minutes or a day. Now, the project is so stable and mature that most bugs require extensive explaining and troubleshooting, and very specific configurations, to reproduce. Many are related to subtle interactions with the Go standard library or upstream dependencies, or even OS kernels. They take longer, and require more specific expertise, than <em>Ye Olde Bugs of Yore</em>. And most of them are very edge-casey anyway. Few people hit these bugs, and rarely. (This is right where we want to be!) Special thank-you to <a href="https://caddy.community/u/weidideng">@WeidiDeng</a> for taking care of so many transport-related issues (weird quirks with different HTTP versions), and <a href="https://caddy.community/u/hairyhenderson">@hairyhenderson</a> with metrics, and <a href="https://caddy.community/u/mohammed90">@Mohammed90</a> for CI issues, and <a href="https://caddy.community/u/francislavoie">@francislavoie</a> for a lot of the Caddyfile and config things. I cannot imagine having to figure out all that stuff myself.</p>
<p>Feature requests are also more nuanced than before. Caddy 2 has more or less achieved my vision of the web server I started in 2014. To clarify, it‚Äôs not <em>done</em>‚Ä¶ there is plenty more to do; we will continue to evolve and adapt the project to a changing Internet landscape. But many of the big and obvious features have mostly shipped. And the plugin architecture is powerful enough that nearly all new features can be implemented as separate plugins before being added to our code base. (Plugins can be added to our repository, but these days most need to be proven outside of it first.)</p>
<p>All this means that I have started falling behind, for the last couple years, to personally keep up with every single:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comment</li>
<li>New issue</li>
<li>New PR</li>
<li>Code review</li>
<li>Requested review</li>
<li>Dependency update</li>
<li>Forum topic</li>
<li>Forum reply</li>
</ul>
<p>in the Caddy org on GitHub, and these forums. I can‚Äôt close issues, answer questions, and merge PRs as quickly and easily now because the nature of their complexity is changing. I have started to become a bottleneck in the project‚Äôs growth and development.</p>
<h2><a name="p-106854-next-steps-4" href="#p-106854-next-steps-4"></a>Next steps</h2>
<p>The stress of such a huge and growing backlog ‚Äì combined with the increasing nuance/specificity of issues, feature requests, and questions ‚Äì has strained my mental health and work habits, and added strain on my family life. So after talking with my wise and wonderful wife, I am making the decision to turn off most notifications on GitHub and the forum, so that I can prioritize work that only I can do (or am the most qualified to do), and my family.</p>
<p>In other words, new activity of all kinds (listed above <img src="https://caddy.community/images/emoji/apple/point_up.png?v=14" title=":point_up:" alt=":point_up:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">) won‚Äôt <em>automatically</em> add itself to my TODO list. I won‚Äôt see <em>every</em> comment and issue like I do today. I don‚Äôt need to, either, it‚Äôs kind of getting bad for my mental health to try to keep track of the <em>hundreds</em> of discussions.</p>
<p>To clarify, I‚Äôll still be very actively engaged with the project. I‚Äôll still be notified of specific events, and I will still be checking GitHub and the forums ~daily, and replying to issues and questions as I have time for them.</p>
<p>I will also be clearing out my existing TODO list. It will be manually curated instead. 200 issues in my backlog‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a disservice to everyone who is contributing. You‚Äôll get lost in there. It‚Äôs time for me to let the community take another step up as a mature project.</p>
<p>All this time, I have been the only one with the key to tag and publish releases. I will be granting privileges to our maintainer team to tag new releases going forward. Any new release should require approval from at least 2 maintainers.</p>
<p>We‚Äôll also be looking to grow our maintainer team. The best way to join is to start reviewing PRs and submit patches for reported bugs. You can also help improve our documentation/website, help with CI/dependencies, etc. We‚Äôll send out maintainer invites to people who show consistent patterns of making valuable contributions and an understanding of our project‚Äôs values.</p>
<p>We may also add more collaborators to the project, to help get PRs merged, but with less privileges than maintainers. Again, to be invited, get involved and demonstrate patterns of valuable contributions.</p>
<p>A consensus from the maintainer team will be sufficient to add new maintainers and collaborators, and two or more can remove those who are inactive for an extended period of time. We‚Äôll strive to enforce best security practices when it comes to access to the project. (We already require 2FA, for example.)</p>
<p>This should help increase the current bus factor of 1, and unblock the project where I‚Äôve been the bottleneck. And lower my stress and improve my mental health and ability to deliver quality work.</p>
<h2><a name="p-106854-big-thank-you-5" href="#p-106854-big-thank-you-5"></a>Big thank you</h2>
<p>Huge thank you to everyone who contributes and helps in any way ‚Äì we value your participation, and hope you will continue to do so, and if interested, become a collaborator or maintainer with our project!</p>
<p>Also, the only reason this project has survived so long is because of our sponsors ‚Äì thank you for making it what it is! Without you I would have had to pack up shop years ago and let the project kind of‚Ä¶ I dunno, mold? Whatever stale open source projects do. So thank you for continuing to sponsor. I look forward to continuing to serve and support you for years to come.</p>
