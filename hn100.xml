<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="BodyComponentRenderer"><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The government of Canada has its sights set on banning the Flipper Zero, an adorable handheld hacking device that is cherished by security researchers and hobbyist hackers and has gained <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-flipper-zero-tiktok/" target="_blank"><span>a sizable following on TikTok</span></a>.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The device is modeled and named after the virtual dolphin from the movie <em>Johnny Mnemonic</em>, and it’s essentially <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvxyjm/meet-flipper-the-tamagotchi-you-feed-by-hacking-stuff"><span>a Tamagotchi you can use to hack stuff</span></a>. Flipper can scan radio frequencies and clone key fobs, control infrared-based devices, and is generally a kind of Swiss Army knife for security researchers, who actually <a href="https://www.packetlabs.net/posts/flipper-zero/" target="_blank"><span>use it to improve device security</span></a>. It’s also used by hobbyists who like playing around with computers,&nbsp; and more generally it’s just really adorable. But there's a lot of <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/flipper-zero-can-you-really-hack-wi-fi-networks-and-other-questions-answered/" target="_blank"><span>misinformation floating around</span></a> about its capabilities due to bombastic—and often staged—videos on TikTok and other social media platforms.</p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Flipper’s popularity has resulted in the device being named as a target in an upcoming National Summit on Combating Auto Theft, where the Canadian government claims, without any evidence, that the device is being used to steal cars.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“Criminals have been using sophisticated tools to steal cars. And Canadians are rightfully worried,” wrote François-Philippe Champagne, the Canadian Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, in a tweet. “Today, I announced we are banning the importation, sale and use of consumer hacking devices, like flippers, used to commit these crimes.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Canada <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kxdmx/one-regulation-could-have-stopped-a-nationwide-car-theft-wave-why-dont-we-have-it"><span>does have a problem with car thefts</span></a> at the moment tied to organized crime networks, but there's no evidence that Flipper Zero is playing a major role in these thefts. The Flipper Zero scans frequencies and records signals that can be replayed. While the Flipper Zero can do this for a car key fob, allowing a user to open a car with the device, it only works once due to the rolling codes that have been implemented by car makers for 30 years, and only if the key fob is first activated out of range of the car. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGpMF_H0bUg" target="_blank"><span>More effective approaches</span></a> used by criminals involve actually plugging a device into a car with a cable or employing a "relay" (not replay) attack that involves two devices—one by the car and one near the fob, which tricks the car into thinking the owner is nearby.&nbsp;</p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Champagne linked a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-safety-canada/news/2024/02/government-of-canada-hosts-national-summit-on-combatting-auto-theft.html" target="_blank"><span>press release for an upcoming national summit</span></a> where government will be “Pursuing all avenues to ban devices used to steal vehicles by copying the wireless signals for remote keyless entry, such as the Flipper Zero, which would allow for the removal of those devices from the Canadian marketplace through collaboration with law enforcement agencies,” according to one the conference’s agenda items. The press release does not include any evidence that the device is being used for auto theft.</p></span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Naturally, this has riled digital rights groups and sections of the hacker and cybersecurity community, who are both upset and unsurprised that the Canadian government has their beloved Flipper in its crosshairs.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>"We shouldn't be blaming manufacturers of radio transmitters for security lapses in the wireless unlock mechanisms of cars," Bill Budington, Senior Staff Technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said in a statement to Motherboard. "Flipper Zero devices, because of their ease of use, are convenient scapegoats to blame for gaping security holes in fob implementations by car manufacturers. Banning Flipper Zero devices is tantamount to banning a multi-tool because it can be used for vandalism, or banning markers because they can be used for graffiti. Moreover, tools like the Flipper Zero are used by security researchers involved in researching and hardening the security of systems like car fobs—banning them will result in tangible harms."</p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Canadian digital rights group OpenMedia concurred that banning the Flipper Zero would do more harm than good.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>"A ban on sale of general purpose tools like the Flipper Zero will do more to hurt than help Canadian cybersecurity," said OpenMedia Executive Director Matt Hatfield. "The core problem here is the vulnerability of the keyless entry systems cars are using, not the fact that ordinary technology can reveal this vulnerability. By blocking the lawful sale of these devices, Canada will make it harder for cybersecurity researchers to do their work of testing vulnerabilities and informing the Canadian public, while doing little to prevent motivated car thieves from acquiring tools and exploiting these vulnerabilities."</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>When reached for comment, Flipper Devices COO Alex Kugalin reiterated that modern cars are largely protected from the simple attacks the device is capable of. “Flipper Zero can’t be used to hijack any car, specifically the ones produced after the 1990s, since their security systems have rolling codes. Also, it’d require actively blocking the signal from the owner to catch the original signal, which Flipper Zero’s hardware is incapable of doing”, said Alex Kulagin, COO of Flipper Devices. “Flipper Zero is intended for security testing and development and we have taken necessary precautions to ensure the device can’t be used for nefarious purposes."</p></span><span></span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The company pointed Motherboard to <a href="https://www.cyber.nj.gov/alerts-advisories/flipper-zero" target="_blank"><span>a January 2023 alert</span></a> from the New Jersey Cybersecurity &amp; Communications Integration Cell, a state organization. The alert stated that "most modern wireless devices are not vulnerable to simple replay attacks" and added that the Flipper Zero is unable to make purchases using signals captured from contactless credit cards. The alert also pointed to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-flipper-zero-tiktok/" target="_blank"><span>reporting from Wired</span></a> that stated most of the dramatic videos on TikTok showing a Flipper Zero being used to steal a car are likely staged.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The proposed ban prompted bemused reactions from cybersecurity professionals on social media. “The only thing that can stop a bad guy with a Flipper Zero is a good guy with a Flipper Zero. I have a right to protect my family and community,” wrote security researcher Wesley McGrew, in a cheeky tweet referencing the frequently-used pro-gun rhetoric. McGrew also responded to Champagne’s post with a “Come And Take It” meme spinning off the popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Come_and_take_it" target="_blank"><span>libertarian slogan</span></a>.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Security experts lined up to lambaste the Canadian government and its insistence that the device is enabling crime. “Instant reactive thought… Isn’t stealing a car already a crime - that the criminal is ok breaking?” wrote security consultant Josh Corman.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Others mocked the government’s belief that devices like Flipper Zero are dangerous and all-powerful hacking tools. “I don’t find the Flipper to be that useful. Its built-in radio frequency support is barely more than you get from a good rooted phone. And I was unable to purchase the RF frequency modules because they were sold out. But imagine that *this* is considered a threat!” <a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/1755984810915385545" target="_blank"><span>wrote Matthew Green</span></a>, a professor of cryptography at Johns Hopkins University.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p><em>Jordan Pearson contributed reporting to this article.&nbsp;</em></p></span></p></div><div><p><h3>ORIGINAL REPORTING ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IN YOUR INBOX.</h3></p><p>By signing up, you agree to the<!-- --> <a href="https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/terms-of-use.html">Terms of Use</a> <!-- -->and<!-- --> <a href="https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> <!-- -->&amp; to receive electronic communications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions, advertisements and sponsored content.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>10.0 Cheetah &amp; 10.1 Puma</h2>
<p>The first two releases of Mac OS X shared the same wallpaper. The sweeping blue arcs and curves helped set the tone of the new Aqua interface.</p>

<h2>10.2 Jaguar</h2>
<p>Jaguar took the same Aqua-inspired theme but added some depth and motion to things. In my head, the trails streaking across the screen were from a set of comets.</p>

<h2>10.5 Leopard</h2>
<p>Complete with a revised, unified user interface and shiny new Dock, 10.5 broke the Aqua mold. As such, Leopard was the first version of OS X to break from the Aqua-themed wallpaper. It ushered in the “space era” of OS X wallpapers, which was used heavily in the new Time Machine interface as well.</p>

<h2>10.15 Catalina</h2>
<p>macOS Catalina brought big changes to the Mac, including the ability to run iPad apps natively, opening the platform up to a much larger number of developers than ever before.

<p>For around three years now, the team of independent developers behind the Asahi Linux project has worked to support Linux on Apple Silicon Macs, despite Apple's total lack of involvement. Over the years, the project has gone from a "highly unstable experiment" to a "surprisingly functional and usable desktop operating system." Even Linus Torvalds has used it to run Linux on Apple's hardware.</p>
<p>The team has been steadily improving its open source, standards-conformant GPU driver for the M1 and M2 since releasing them <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/asahi-gpu-part-7.html">in December 2022</a>, and today, the team crossed an important symbolic milestone: The Asahi driver's support for the OpenGL and OpenGL ES graphics have officially passed what Apple offers in macOS. The team's latest graphics driver fully conforms with OpenGL version 4.6 and OpenGL ES version 3.2, the most recent version of either API. Apple's support in macOS tops out at OpenGL 4.1, announced in July 2010.</p>
<p>Developer Alyssa Rosenzweig wrote <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/conformant-gl46-on-the-m1.html">a detailed blog post</a> that announced the new driver, which had to pass "over 100,000 tests" to be deemed officially conformant. The team achieved this milestone despite the fact that Apple's GPUs don't support some features that would have made implementing these APIs more straightforward.</p>
<p>"Regrettably, the M1 doesn’t map well to any graphics standard newer than OpenGL ES 3.1," writes Rosenzweig. "While Vulkan makes some of these features optional, the missing features are required to layer DirectX and OpenGL on top. No existing solution on M1 gets past the OpenGL 4.1 feature set... Without hardware support, new features need new tricks. Geometry shaders, tessellation, and transform feedback become compute shaders. Cull distance becomes a transformed interpolated value. Clip control becomes a vertex shader epilogue. The list goes on."</p>                                            
                                                        

<p>Now that the Asahi GPU driver supports the latest OpenGL and OpenGL ES standards—released in 2017 and 2015, respectively—the work turns to supporting the low-overhead Vulkan API on Apple's hardware. Vulkan support in macOS is limited to translation layers like MoltenVK, which translates Vulkan API calls to Metal ones that the hardware and OS can understand.</p>
<p>Apple's OpenGL support has been stuck at the 4.1 level since macOS 10.9 Mavericks was released in 2013. Since then, the company has shifted its focus to its proprietary Metal graphics API, which, like DirectX 12 and Vulkan, is a "low-overhead" API meant to reduce the performance overhead sometimes associated with older APIs like OpenGL. But despite declaring OpenGL <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/06/the-end-of-opengl-support-other-updates-apple-didnt-share-at-the-keynote/">officially deprecated</a> in 2018, Apple has left its existing OpenGL implementation alone since then, never updating it but also maintaining support even as it has transitioned from Intel's processors to its own CPUs and GPUs.</p>
<p>Rosenzweig's blog post didn't give any specific updates on Vulkan except to say that the team was "well on the road" to supporting it. In addition to supporting native Linux apps, supporting more graphics APIs in Asahi will allow the operating system to take better advantage of software like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/proton-update-gets-18-more-windows-games-running-on-linux-including-chex-quest-hd/">Valve's Proton</a>, which already has a few games written for x86-based Windows PCs running on Arm-based Apple hardware.</p>
<p>Though there are still things that don't work, Fedora Asahi Remix is surprisingly polished and supports a lot of the hardware available in most M1 and M2 Macs—including the webcam, speakers, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and graphics acceleration. Other features, like Thunderbolt, running displays over USB-C, the system's built-in microphone, and the Touch ID fingerprint sensors, remain non-functional. Asahi's most recent update blog post, <a href="https://asahilinux.org/2024/01/fedora-asahi-new/">published in mid-January</a>, highlighted HDMI support, support for DRM-protected websites via Google's proprietary Widevine package, Touchbar support for the handful of Apple Silicon Macs that use one, and more.</p>
<p>As for the newest wave of M3 Macs, Asahi developer Hector Martin said in October 2023 that basic support for the newest chips would take "at least six months." Among other things, the team will need time to support the M3 GPU in their drivers; the team also relies primarily on Mac mini models for development, and the M3 Mac mini doesn't exist yet.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://observablehq.com/blog/observable-2-0">https://observablehq.com/blog/observable-2-0</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39383386">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today we’re launching <a href="https://observablehq.com/product">Observable 2.0</a> with a bold new vision: an open-source static site generator for building fast, beautiful data apps, dashboards, and reports.</p><p>Our mission is to help teams communicate more effectively with data. Effective presentation of data is critical for deep insight, nuanced understanding, and informed decisions. Observable notebooks are great for ephemeral, <i>ad hoc</i> data exploration. But notebooks aren’t well-suited for polished dashboards and apps.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://observablehq.com/framework/">Observable Framework</a>.</p><div><figure><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/uklh5xrq1p2j/26cJydaf6IQXGPmS7i13Gr/d4db342f8088003c3a4f004c13990940/1_-_Framework_Preview__1_.png" alt="Framework preview"></figure></div><p>With Framework, you can build the best data apps your team has ever seen. Framework combines the power of <b>JavaScript on the front-end</b> for interactive graphics, with <b>any language on the back-end</b> for data preparation and analysis. SQL, Python, R, Rust, Go… you name it. It’s the polyglot programmer’s dream. Everything you need is at your fingertips: interactive charts and inputs, responsive grids, themes, dark mode, keyboard-friendly navigation, and more. And because it’s code, there’s no limit to customization!</p><p>Framework is free and <a href="https://github.com/observablehq/framework">open-source</a>. Projects are just local files. Use your favorite editor, preview locally, check it all into git, write unit tests, add CI/CD, even work offline. You can host projects anywhere or deploy instantly to Observable to share them securely with your team.</p><p>Observable Framework solves the “last mile” problem of data apps: loading data. Conventional dashboards are slow because they run queries on view while the user waits; Framework’s data loaders run <i>on build</i> so that pages load instantly. And because data loaders run on your servers, you control privacy and security.
If you’re ready to dive in, visit our <a href="https://observablehq.com/framework/getting-started">Getting started tutorial</a>, or open a terminal and run:
</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;npm init @observablehq</span>
</p><p>If you’d like to hear more about why we built Framework, please read on.</p><h3>Beyond notebooks <b>📓</b></h3><p>This moment — Observable 2.0 — reflects lessons learned over many years.</p><p>We believe the lightweight, collaborative nature of computational notebooks makes them ideal for exploring data and answering <i>ad hoc</i> questions. We founded Observable in 2016, pioneering a <a href="https://medium.com/@mbostock/a-better-way-to-code-2b1d2876a3a0">reactive, web-first approach</a> to notebooks and seeking to make data visualization easier, more practicable, and more social. We dreamed that notebooks might be the “one ring to rule them all” — powering not just notes, but apps, dashboards, and reports.</p><p>Yet no single interface can excel at every task. As cool as reactive notebooks are, a notebook can’t compete with a custom web app in terms of user experience. Notebooks are constrained by:</p><ul><li><p>A single-column, narrow layout</p></li><li><p>Low visual information density</p></li><li><p>Always-visible editor chrome</p></li></ul><p>These same limitations make notebooks great for tinkering and learning — the code is always at your fingertips, adjacent to the output — but not so great for presentation. To fill that latter role, we need better data apps.</p><p>A good data app embodies an empirical perspective; it fosters a shared understanding. Whereas notebooks tend to be for individuals, data apps are more often for a team. And whereas notebooks tend to be transient byproducts of point-in-time exploration, data apps often sustain value over time as people return to see how things change.</p><p>The differences between notebooks and data apps extend to development. A notebook editor desires speed: jotting down thoughts, running a query, sketching a chart. A data app developer prioritizes correctness, performance, and maintainability: making careful, deliberate changes that others depend on, favoring code review and testing before publishing.</p><p>We had three goals in mind when we set out to reimagine data app development:</p><ol><li><p><b>A better developer workflow</b> — meeting the needs of developers</p></li><li><p><b>A better user experience</b> — the “proof is in the pudding”</p></li><li><p><b>A better data architecture</b> — solving the “last mile” problem</p></li></ol><div><figure><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/uklh5xrq1p2j/5D9MHFW8goDgB7Fuczy9s4/28dec57555f601daaaee374d2d2c5347/2_-_Workflow.png" alt="Workflow"></figure></div><h3>A better developer workflow <b>👩‍💻</b></h3><p>Modern development is built on <a href="https://stephango.com/file-over-app">files</a>. Files have myriad strengths, but the strongest is interoperability. When every tool uses files, it’s far easier to incorporate a new tool — and now Observable — into your workflow.</p><p>This isn’t just about using your preferred text editor. Now you can bring your own source control and code review system, too. You can write unit tests and run linters. You can automate builds with continuous integration or deployment. You can work offline. You can self-host. You can generate or edit content programmatically, say to format code or to find-and-replace across files.</p><p>As we break new ground with Observable Framework, we’re further improving interoperability by adopting vanilla JavaScript syntax. And we’re deprecating <span>require</span> in favor of modern ES <span>import</span>. These changes make Observable easier to learn, and to share code with other applications. (We’ll port these improvements back to Observable notebooks in the future.)</p><div><figure><a href="https://github.com/observablehq/framework/tree/main/examples"><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/uklh5xrq1p2j/7EKYLd7vJn0TRcBoQZWRvV/d4976632216f1e072746e4910d827cc1/3_-_Examples.png" alt="Examples"></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><h3><b>A better user experience 😍</b></h3><p>A toolmaker can’t care only about the developer experience — what does the developer experience matter if the resulting app is not demonstrably better? The merit of a creative tool should be judged by the quality of its creations, not its process. Or: “the proof of the pudding is in the eating.”</p><p>We believe that well-designed tools help developers build more efficiently by focusing their efforts on high-value work. We favor opinionated tools, with defaults and conveniences that foster a good user experience. We nudge you into <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/">the pit of success</a>.</p><p>Framework’s lightweight Markdown syntax — with light and dark mode, thoughtful colors, responsive grids, and built-in navigation — gives you beautiful pages from the start. It’s highly customizable if you need it, but it’s quick to get started with batteries included.</p><p>Most importantly, Framework’s data architecture practically forces your app to be <i>fast</i> because data is precomputed. Performance is critical for dashboards: users don’t like to wait, and dashboards only create value if users look at them. Slow dashboards waste time. (And you certainly don’t want your database and dashboard falling over under load!)</p><div><figure><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/uklh5xrq1p2j/6ATQajSu9ZLRVmgR0YIiYs/12f2da04080e37ef88f82f001c566107/4_-_Architecture.png" alt="Architecture"></figure></div><h3>A better data architecture</h3><p>Every data visualization requires data. Obviously. But less obviously, each data visualization requires highly-specific data prepared with that visualization in mind. In fact, most of the work of visualization isn’t choosing visual encodings or laying out axes or visualizing <i>per se</i> — it’s preparing data. As I wrote <a href="https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/10-years-of-open-source-visualization">previously</a>,</p><div><figure><blockquote><p>working with data should be 80% of the work of visualization. Visualization is the end result of analysis — the visible manifestation of data, to be seen, shared, and appreciated by experts and non-experts alike — and as such it sometimes gets too much credit. To produce a visualization, one must first find data, clean it, transform, join, model, etc. Working with data is sometimes needlessly denigrated as “janitorial” when it represents the critical step of understanding the data as it is, warts and all.</p></blockquote></figure></div><p>Given how much work goes into preparing data, it follows that developers want</p><ul><li><p>to use any language (say Python or R or SQL),</p></li><li><p>to use any library (say NumPy or dplyr),</p></li><li><p>to use any data source (database, data warehouse, API, files, <i>etc</i>.), and</p></li><li><p>to crunch data ahead of time (offline)</p></li></ul><p>while still leveraging JavaScript in the browser for interactive graphics.</p><p>Framework’s data loaders solve this “last mile” problem by computing static data snapshots at build time. These snapshots can be highly-optimized (and aggregated and anonymized), minimizing the data you send to the client. And since a data loader is just a fancy way of generating a file on-demand (with clever caching and routing), loaders can be written in any language and use any library. This flexibility is not unlike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface">CGI</a> from 30 years ago, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)">Unix pipes</a>. And since data loaders run on your servers, viewers don’t need direct access to the underlying data sources, and your dashboards are more secure and robust.</p><p>The speed of modern data warehouses is astonishing. But far too often something is missing for new analysis — some untapped data source, some not-yet-materialized view for a query to run at interactive speeds. Framework’s data loaders let you bypass these hurdles and produce a fast dashboard without “heavy lifting” in your data warehouse. And once your analysis demonstrates value, you can shift work to your data warehouse and simplify your data loaders. Framework lets you build faster and quickly validate your ideas.</p><p>We believe Framework will change how you think about data, and effect a better user experience. And by securely hosting apps alongside notebooks, Observable now offers an end-to-end solution for data analysis and presentation.</p><h3>Thank you <b>🙏</b></h3><p>We wouldn’t be here without the support, feedback, and encouragement from you — our community. Thank you for using Observable notebooks, Observable Plot, and D3. We’re thrilled to share Observable Framework with you now, and can’t wait to hear what you think.</p><p>To learn more about Framework, <a href="https://observablehq.com/framework/">read the docs</a>.</p><p>To share your questions or feedback, please <a href="https://talk.observablehq.com/latest">visit our forum</a>.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://consciousdigital.org/deceptive-design-patterns/">https://consciousdigital.org/deceptive-design-patterns/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39382264">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-6826">
  
  <div data-hide-featured-media="1">
<p>Today, we’re releasing a new <a href="https://consciousdigital.org/deceptive-patterns/">guide</a> explaining how to compel companies employing deceptive design to dodge data protection requests—like those for data deletion or access—to comply. It encapsulates five years of experience from operating <a href="http://yourdigitalrights.org/">YourDigitalRights.org</a> and <a href="http://databrokerswatch.org/">DataBrokersWatch.org</a>, alongside a unique experiment and extensive research. Here’s the story behind it.</p>



<p>Deceptive design, also known as deceptive patterns or dark patterns, refers to the tactics companies employ through design to manipulate individuals into actions they wouldn’t normally take. For example, websites sometimes use deceptive patterns to manipulate people to purchase expensive products or subscriptions by concealing free or more affordable alternatives:</p>



<div>




<p>For a cheaper Google Workspaces subscription, first subscribe to the expensive option and then downgrade (Source: <a href="http://deceptive.design/">deceptive.design</a>)</p>
</div>



<p>Similarly, companies employ deceptive tactics to avoid complying with data protection requests. These are legal rights that allow individuals to ask a company to delete or share a copy of their personal data. The encouraging news is that more than five years since the GDPR—the legal framework in the EU that gives individuals the right to access or delete their data—was introduced, most companies now adhere to these data protection requests.</p>



<p>The downside, however, is that some companies continue to resist compliance. Specifically, data-centric enterprises, whose business models hinge on gathering personal data—like data brokers and social networks—resort to deceptive design practices to skirt data protection requests. This is particularly concerning because these entities hold vast amounts of personal data and often use it in the most objectionable ways. As a result, they are the primary targets from whom we seek to erase our data.</p>



<p>In 2022, we embarked on an unconventional experiment. We sent a data deletion request to each of the 600 data brokers listed on <a href="http://databrokerswatch.org/">DataBrokersWatch.org</a> to observe their reactions. This experiment allowed us to uncover numerous deceptive patterns and formulate effective countermeasures – strategies to bypass these dark patterns. Often, our countermeasures persuaded the companies to honor our deletion requests. When they didn’t, we escalated the issue to a government regulator (a process <a href="http://yourdigitalrights.org/">YourDigitalRights.org</a> can handle for you). Looking back, the effort was worthwhile. We’ve noticed a trend towards better compliance among data-centric businesses. We detailed our findings in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SY_YAZEJPjc&amp;t=1s">presentation</a> at the 2022 Good Tech Fest for those interested in learning more.</p>



<p>We hope you find the guide useful and would appreciate your feedback.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.lambdafunctions.com/articles/elixir-and-rust">https://www.lambdafunctions.com/articles/elixir-and-rust</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39382227">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<h2>
Managing mutable data in Elixir with Rust</h2>
<p>
One of Elixir’s core benefits, and the secret to its robustness and scalability,
is its foundation on immutable data.  Sometimes, though, immutability is just
not a great fit for a particular task—but that task is only one part of a large
project.  Is it possible to enjoy the benefits of Elixir’s data model everywhere
else, but carve out a little mutable exception for one area?</p>
<p>
Yes!</p>
<p>
A long-running Elixir project I’m involved in has just this problem.  The
project is delivered over the web, so moving away from Elixir as a whole is not
on the cards because <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a> is quite
simply a cheat code for web development.  We <em>could</em> hive off the mutable
section into a microservice, but that would require significant architectural
and management overhead.  All we really need is a little escape hatch for a
limited chunk of code, while still being within the same VM and able to interact
normally with the rest of the service.</p>
<p>
This is just what <a href="https://github.com/rusterlium/rustler">Rustler</a> offers.</p>
<p>
Rustler is “a library for writing Erlang NIFs in safe Rust code”—in other
words, you can write code that looks like standard Elixir functions, but behind
the scenes is actually implemented in Rust.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/docs/17/tutorial/nif">NIFs</a> have been a feature of the
Erlang VM since long before either Elixir or Rust arrived on the scene.  What
Rust and Rustler add is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
safety—this is critical since a crash in a NIF will bring down the
whole VM    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
a lot of polish and interface glue that makes it feasible to write
more ambitious integrations that you might be inclined to attempt with
C and Erlang’s standard NIF support    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
access to all of Rust’s libraries    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Unfortunately, most of the Rustler examples on the web focus on the speed
benefits and show the implementation of a trivial <code>add</code> function and then stop
there.  While that’s fine for demonstrating the bare minimum integration
required, for me the interesting part of Rustler is the chance to escape in a
controlled way from the immutable world—I want to explore how to manage a
little mutable chunk of memory in a safe way.  Although Rustler is certainly
capable of this, there’s very little available in the way of tutorials or
examples.</p>
<p>
Hopefully this article will help.</p>
<h2>
Goal</h2>
<p>
As mentioned above, I want to explore memory management.  More specifically, I
want to be able to hold a chunk of data in the Rust world that persists between
multiple calls to different “Elixir” (Rustler) functions.  These functions
should allow the Elixir world to pass data into the Rust world, mutate the data
held there, and then retrieve results.</p>
<p>
To give us something substantial to play with and avoid having to implement our
own data store for this demo, I’ll use Oxigraph.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/oxigraph">Oxigraph</a> is a Rust graph database library
implementing the SPARQL standard.  Let’s suppose that we want to wrap it, so
that we can have access to a fast graph database from within Elixir.  We’ll call
our wrapper <code>FeGraph</code>.</p>
<p>
We want to be able to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
Make a new in-memory database    </p>
    <pre><code>db = FeGraph.new()</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
Add data to it    </p>
    <pre><code>FeGraph.set(db, "http://foo.bar.com")
FeGraph.set(db, "http://foo.baz.com")</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
Export the database as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(syntax)">Turtle</a> string:    </p>
    <pre><code>FeGraph.dump_db(db) |&gt; IO.puts()</code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
To keep this to a reasonable length, we’re not going to implement everything
that would be required to expose all the capabilities of Oxigraph; just enough
to demonstrate holding data on the Rust side and acting on it from Elixir.</p>
<h2>
Implementation</h2>
<p>
(If you want to follow along, I recommend working through one of the many
Rustler <code>add</code> tutorials I mentioned before getting into the code, so that you
have a basic project up and running and have worked through how Rust and Elixir
functions link together.  Everything below here assumes you’re already at that
point.)</p>
<p>
The key to this whole approach is the ability to pass a
<a href="https://erlang.org/doc/man/erl_nif.html#resource_objects">Resource</a> between the
two worlds.  This acts as a handle to a piece of memory; it can be returned from
a NIF and then passed back into another call.  Exactly what we need.</p>
<p>
A BEAM <code>Resource</code> is represented in Rustler by a
<code>rustler::resource::ResourceArc&lt;T&gt;</code> struct.  To get started with our
implementation, let’s define a new type that we can use as a handle to represent
the state of our graph store.</p>
<p>
In a production scenario we’re likely to want to manage more state than this,
but for now it will suffice to define a <code>MyGraph</code> struct that just contains (via
a mutex) the Oxigraph data store; this represents the mutable data we want to
manage outside Elixir.  In the future, more fields could be added to <code>MyGraph</code>
as necessary.</p>
<p>
To turn this into something that can be passed back and forth between Elixir and
Rust, we need to wrap it in a <code>ResourceArc</code>.  In order to make our function
signatures a bit more readable we’ll define a new type of <code>GraphArc</code> to
represent a <code>MyGraph</code> struct in a <code>ResourceArc</code>.</p>
<p>
In <code>lib.rs</code>:</p>
<pre><code>use std::sync::Mutex;
use oxigraph::store::Store;
use rustler::resource::ResourceArc;
use rustler::OwnedBinary;
use rustler::{Env, Term};

struct MyGraph { store: Mutex&lt;Store&gt; }

type GraphArc = ResourceArc&lt;MyGraph&gt;;</code></pre>
<p>
A bit of additional plumbing is required to tell Rustler that a <code>MyGraph</code> is
something that can be used as a <code>Resource</code>:</p>
<pre><code>fn on_load(env: Env, _info: Term) -&gt; bool {
    rustler::resource!(MyGraph, env);
    true
}</code></pre>
<p>
With these definitions in place, we can write a <code>new</code> function that allocates a
new data store and returns a handle to it:</p>
<pre><code>#[rustler::nif]
fn new() -&gt; GraphArc {
    ResourceArc::new(
        MyGraph {
            store: Mutex::new(Store::new().unwrap()),
        }
    )
}</code></pre>
<p>
And on the Elixir side, in <code>fe_graph.ex</code>:</p>
<pre><code>defmodule FeGraph do
  use Rustler, otp_app: :myapp, crate: "fegraph"

  def new(), do: :erlang.nif_error(:nif_not_loaded)
end</code></pre>
<p>
At this point we can test in <code>iex</code>, and see that the Elixir stub above has been
replaced by the Rust NIF we defined, which we can run and which gives us back a
reference:</p>
<pre><code>iex(1)&gt; FeGraph.new
#Reference&lt;0.2659174309.2607677441.115195&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Granted we can’t yet <em>do</em> anything with it, but we’re already defining a data
store in Rust and seeing evidence of it in Elixir; and behind the scenes the
BEAM and Rustler are taking care of all of the heavy lifting for us.</p>
<p>
How about a simple function to add some data to our new store?  In a way that
will feel very familiar to Elixir code, it will need to both take and return a
<code>GraphArc</code> handle.  We’ll also have it accept a single string to use for all
three parts of the triple to store (normally of course we’d take different
strings for the subject, predicate, and object parts of the triple, but our
focus here isn’t on SPARQL—we just want some data to store.)</p>
<pre><code>#[rustler::nif]
fn set(state: GraphArc, iri: &amp;str) -&gt; GraphArc {
    let store = state.store.lock().unwrap();

    let ex = NamedNode::new(iri).unwrap();
    let quad =
        Quad::new(ex.clone(), ex.clone(), ex.clone(), GraphName::DefaultGraph);
    (*store).insert(&amp;quad).unwrap();

    drop(store);

    state
}</code></pre>
<p>
Within the function we can use our <code>GraphArc</code> state argument to get a hold of
the Oxigraph store that we created back in the <code>new</code> function.  Once we’ve got
it we can add some test data to the graph as normal, then return the unchanged
<code>state</code>.</p>
<p>
The final piece of the puzzle is to retrieve some data from our store.  Rather
than running a query (which would require getting into more SPARQL) we’ll just
dump the whole database and return it as a string.  As before, our new function
will need to accept a <code>GraphArc</code>, but this time we’ll return an <code>OwnedBinary</code>,
which allows us to send a binary back to the BEAM and then wash our hands of it.</p>
<pre><code>#[rustler::nif]
fn dump_db(state: GraphArc) -&gt; OwnedBinary {
    let store = state.store.lock().unwrap();

    let mut buffer = Vec::new();
    (*store)
        .dump_graph(
            &amp;mut buffer,
            GraphFormat::Turtle,
            GraphNameRef::DefaultGraph,
        )
        .unwrap();

    let mut result = OwnedBinary::new(buffer.len()).unwrap();
    result.as_mut_slice().copy_from_slice(&amp;buffer);

    result
}</code></pre>
<p>
The majority of this function turns out to be messing around getting the data
out of Oxigraph into a buffer, and then from the buffer into the <code>OwnedBinary</code>;
the Rustler wrapper has become mostly invisible which is what I was originally
hoping for.</p>
<p>
With this in place we can now demonstrate allocating some memory in Rust,
returning a handle to that memory, then using it to store data outside the BEAM
memory model and finally fetch the data back into the Elixir world:</p>
<pre><code>iex(1)&gt; db = FeGraph.new
#Reference&lt;0.2749498138.3684302852.140448&gt;
iex(2)&gt; FeGraph.set(db, "http://foo.com")
#Reference&lt;0.2749498138.3684302852.140448&gt;
iex(3)&gt; FeGraph.dump_db(db)
"&lt;http://foo.com&gt; &lt;http://foo.com&gt; &lt;http://foo.com&gt; .\n"</code></pre>
<p>
Note the important part; the reference is the same both times despite the data
changing and we are <em>not</em> storing it after the <code>set</code> call; normally we’d need to
do something like <code>db = FeGraph.set(db, "http://foo.com")</code> instead.  The only
reason <code>set</code> returns the reference is for convenient use with the pipe operator
or similar.</p>
<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
<p>
While the code shown above does skip past most of the error handling, hopefully
it’s clear just how accessible Rustler makes it to link Rust code into Elixir
projects in a way that allows you to combine the strengths of both.</p>
<p>
Rustler is a tremendous addition to the Elixir ecosystem, and it opens up far
more opportunities than just calculating things more quickly.  Being able to opt
out of the standard BEAM memory model for specific sections of code can open the
doors to custom data stores and other features that would not generally be a
good fit for Elixir, while still allowing you to use the power of Phoenix for
the majority of your application… all with virtually seamless integration.</p>

Oil, gas, and coal operations are thought to account for 40% of global methane emissions from human activities.

A satellite can meet that demand.</p><p>Maguire said the same AI technology that Google used to detect trees, crosswalks, and intersections from satellite imagery would be applied to oil and gas infrastructure.

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-3">What you need to know</h2><ul><li>The Indian government's Information Technology ministry issued an order to block ProtonMail in the region.</li><li>The move comes after a bomb threat was sent to schools in Chennai via a ProtonMail account.</li><li>ProtonMail is still active in the country as of writing, but it remains to be seen if that will continue to be the case.</li></ul><hr><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-privacy-apps-android" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-privacy-apps-android">ProtonMail</a> is the best choice if you want an end-to-end encrypted email platform, and the nature of the service means it is inevitably used by bad actors. On February 8, a bomb threat was sent to 13 schools in Chennai, a city in the state of Tamil Nadu in southern India. The threat turned out to be a hoax, and the Tamil Nadu police found that the email was sent via a ProtonMail account.</p><p>Unable to trace the IP address of the sender and failing to get assistance from Interpol, the Tamil Nadu police put in a request to India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to block access to ProtonMail within the country, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-ministry-looks-to-block-proton-mail-on-request-of-tamil-nadu-police-101707938167006.html" data-url="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-ministry-looks-to-block-proton-mail-on-request-of-tamil-nadu-police-101707938167006.html">according to </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-ministry-looks-to-block-proton-mail-on-request-of-tamil-nadu-police-101707938167006.html" data-url="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-ministry-looks-to-block-proton-mail-on-request-of-tamil-nadu-police-101707938167006.html">Hindustan Times</a>. That request was granted today, with the government authority issuing an order to block the service in the region.</p><p>The enforcement will be carried out by the Department of Telecommunications, which will likely entail delisting ProtonMail from the App Store and Play Store. That said, the website is still working as of writing, and the app is listed on both storefronts. This isn't the first instance where the Indian government went after the Swiss-based Proton AG.

"We are currently working to resolve this situation and are investigating how we can best work together with the Indian authorities to do so. We understand the urgency of the situation and are completely clear that our services are not to be used for illegal purposes. We routinely remove users who are found to be doing so and are willing to cooperate wherever possible within international cooperation agreements."</p><p>The government's move is in line with a recent policy that has targeted services with end-to-end encryption. A host of encrypted apps were blocked at the start of last year — including the likes of Threema, Element, Wickrme, and Safeswiss — and the government is going after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/technology/gadgets/govt-may-enforce-it-rules-on-whatsapp-to-reveal-id-of-fake-video-spreader-2728346" data-url="https://www.deccanherald.com/technology/gadgets/govt-may-enforce-it-rules-on-whatsapp-to-reveal-id-of-fake-video-spreader-2728346">WhatsApp to disable end-to-end encryption</a>, although it isn't clear how that would even work.</p><p>Proton AG clearly agrees with that sentiment, as it said this to HT: "We condemn a potential block as a misguided measure that only serves to harm ordinary people. Blocking access to Proton is an ineffective and inappropriate response to the reported threats. It will not prevent cybercriminals from sending threats with another email service and will not be effective if the perpetrators are located outside of India."</p><p>I'll share an update once there are more details, but if you use ProtonMail in India, there's a good chance that the service may be inaccessible.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Last Thursday, I woke up to a pile of emails that I was, in truth, half expecting. They were all worded a bit differently and came from different senders but the message was the same:</p><blockquote><p>Today, Okta made the decision to eliminate a number of positions across multiple organizations.&nbsp;<strong>Unfortunately, your position has been eliminated as part of this reduction.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Things had been a little strange at work since the end of last year: unclear priorities for our group, an awkward reorganization, rumblings that <em>something</em> was going on. All of that contributed to a surge of professional anxiety and a sudden urge to make sure I had all my digital affairs in order.</p><p>And then it happened, I got the email. Slack didn't work. My laptop restarted and came back with accounts missing. It really, actually happened. And even though the writing seemed to be on the wall, I was still caught a bit off guard. What about that high-priority project I was helping to lead? What about the training I was scheduled to deliver? What about the offsite next month?</p><p>I wasn't totally sure what to do with myself so I tried to follow the instructions that were sent to me to log into the minimal number of apps I still had access to for the rest of the day. I found a few groups of former (or were they still current?) teammates collecting on Google Chat, Slack groups, and LinkedIn, everyone exchanging personal contact information and messages of support. I walked the dog and said "I can't believe it actually happened" to my wife several times.</p><p>By the end of the day, my phone was at record levels of screen time logged and I was exhausted from doing what probably looked like next to nothing but I felt ... OK. I had spent all day reading and responding to deluge of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joshcanhelp_i-joined-the-layoff-club-this-morning-after-activity-7158890419303444480-ueBL">support, kind words, and offers to help on LinkedIn</a> and was told that the severance offered would give me at least a few months free from acute financial stress. I already made plans to see some former teammates, friends, and family in the next week. Things were going to be just fine.</p><p>I don't think there's any reason for me to dwell on the how and why these layoffs happened. There were reasons, some I was told and some I can guess. What I want to remember as I move on from the last 6 years was how it all started, what Auth0 meant to me, and why I will proudly wear that shield for as long as the hats, shirts, and socks hold up.</p><img src="https://www.joshcanhelp.com/_images/2024/auth0_swag.jpg" alt="Auth0 swag"><figcaption><em><p>I'm sure I'm missing something ...</p></em></figcaption><p>My journey with Auth0 started in January of 2018 working on SDKs, open source libraries that customers use to make integrating their applications with Auth0, hopefully, a bit easier. I was sent the job listing by a fellow preschool dad who thought I would be a good fit. The company culture sounded good (but who can trust that stuff), working in open source sounded fun (but maybe it's just a slog of support requests), and the security/authentication space felt like the challenge I was looking for (but could I hack it). I applied, made it through the interview and take-home project, and got an offer. I accepted and started my first W2 job in 4 years.</p><p>The SDKs team was scrappy, totally overloaded, and somewhat of an island in Auth0 engineering. We were mostly left to our own devices to manage somewhere around <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/libraries">60 open source libraries</a> with only 4 engineers. I scrambled to learn about OpenID Connect and OAuth 2 while figuring out what, exactly, the WordPress setup wizard was doing. I learned Laravel for the 3rd time, tried to dig back up what I remembered about Drupal, and squinted my eyes at Symphony code over and over. I dove into Ruby because I had gone through a tutorial a few years ago and remembered liking it. All the while I was being exposed to engineering concepts that just weren't a thing in agency work: <a href="https://www.joshcanhelp.com/wordpress-unit-testing-techniques/">unit testing</a>, CI/CD, git hygiene, release management.</p><p><a href="https://www.joshcanhelp.com/pitfalls-of-being-a-wordpress-developer/">I wrote a post that year</a> that would have been confusing to me the year before. The amount of things I learned during my time there is hard to wrap my head around, even having been through it myself. I was surrounded by smart, talented people in a safe, growth-minded workplace. There was chaos and uncertainty but everywhere you looked there were people doing the best work of their career trying to get this cool thing off the ground.</p><p>That "Auth0 feeling" was made tangible on the first offsite I went to in Panama City. Everyone around me told me that it would be amazing and I would have a great time. I was, to be honest, a bit skeptical. I'm not typically a company kool-aid drinker and I was expecting a lot of eye roll moments. I was, thankfully, completely surprised.</p><img src="https://www.joshcanhelp.com/_images/2024/auth0_panama_2018.jpg" alt="Auth0 Panama offsite 2018"><p>There was something truly special about what happened during that offsite. You felt like a part of something, like you were contributing to something singular and unique. There was talk of growth and ARR and everything else but the passion that everyone had to do this to the best of their abilities was clear in almost every conversation you had. And it wasn't obsession or fanaticism, it was confidence and excitement combined with camaraderie and just genuine good vibes. You were accepted here, regardless of where you came from in your career and in the world. Just give us your best and we'll use it.</p><p>I was caught up in the feeling but my own internal stuff was looming large. I wrote this journal entry while I was there:</p><blockquote><p>I'm in Panama, building a raspberry pi to pull data from secure internal sources and display to everyone in the company. Imposer syndrome in full effect at the moment ... right up until I stop thinking about it and just collaborate with someone. If I lose myself in the work at hand, that's where I become valuable, focused, and productive.</p></blockquote><p>I can remember this precise feeling, trying to write Node.js code in vim in a terminal connected to this misbehaving little gadget. I was quaking inside, feeling like someone would call me out. But that never happened and I doubled down on learning and growing from that point on. The excitement I felt leaving Panama was like nothing I had ever felt in my professional life.</p><p>After a year (that felt like 3), I was approached to be a part of the technical onboarding program that happened monthly in Bellevue. <a href="https://www.joshcanhelp.com/vittorio/">I wrote about that experience recently</a> and, when I look back on that time, I remember being so humbled and proud of where I worked as I met all the incredible people that came through. Once I got my footing as an instructor, I felt like a critical part of creating the culture at Auth0. I got to meet about half of all the new hires for a year or so and was a part of them learning the product and digital identity. Everyone would work through 4 technical labs, each one hour long, and it was so rewarding to see folks try and fail and try something else and ask a neighbor and ask me and then get it working. We gave them a safe space to try something totally new right away and just about everyone walked away with something positive. Just writing these words gives me warm, fuzzy feelings ...</p><img src="https://www.joshcanhelp.com/_images/2024/auth0_bellevue_shark.jpg" alt="Auth0 shark"><figcaption><em><p>My son called the Bellevue office "Dad's Bellevue" and both kids loved the snacks that came back with me.</p></em></figcaption><p>The offsite that year in Los Cabos was just like the one the year before but even better. I knew many more people because of the onboarding and we were larger and more established. We also heard the news that Auth0 had completed a funding round and was now, based on factors I only partially understood, worth over a billion dollars. And this was all well and good but it meant so much more to everyone that was had been a part of it. We had put in our best work, side-by-side with wonderful people from around the world, led by two kind and brilliant Argentinians, <strong>and it was working</strong>! There was no pressure to work long hours (even though some of us did because we felt like it) and there was no manufactured pressure around launch dates. We figured out what worked for us, it was paying off, and it felt like we were just getting started.</p><p>In the beginning of 2020, <a href="https://www.joshcanhelp.com/moment-in-time-during-pandemic/">something huge happened in the world</a> but, being a "modern" adult with kids, I worked right on through it. I helped convert the onboarding to virtual instead of in-person, transitioned out of the SDKs team, and onboarded as the second person on the <a href="https://marketplace.auth0.com/">Marketplace</a> team. As a part of transition, I worked on a <a href="https://github.com/auth0/wordpress/security/advisories/GHSA-59vf-cgfw-6h6v">high-severity CVE</a> that resulted in a <a href="https://github.com/auth0/wordpress/releases/tag/4.0.0">huge major release for a popular SDK</a> that I maintained. If this happened anywhere else, I might have been too embarrassed to link to that here and, at the time, I was mortified to be a part of such a critical issue caused by a misconfigured code analyzer. At every point during the process, though, the security team was so kind, so gracious, and made it clear that issues like these were the result of process failures, not individuals. Just when I felt like I should have been hauled into involuntary security training for a month, I was surrounded by supportive folks who helped get the fixes out as soon as possible and <em>even praised me for my work</em> during that release. I learned something about a blame-free culture that I will carry with me to the end of my professional life.</p><p>That Auth0 spirit, the feeling that you were a part of something, was on full display throughout the pandemic. Our family had some <a href="https://www.joshcanhelp.com/how-we-are-teaching-right-now/">major challenges</a> with two young kids at home and two working parents. My wife and I would switch off on shifts: one person worked from 6AM to noon and the other noon to 6PM, with the other handling the house and the kids. Both of us, exhausted, would convene on the couch at night with our laptops, trying to eke out another hour of productivity, breath held that it would all be over soon.</p><img src="https://www.joshcanhelp.com/_images/2024/pandemic_yolo.jpg" alt="Pandemic YOLO"><figcaption><em><p>Not actually, no.</p></em></figcaption><p>But, once it was clear that we were in it for the long haul, the message at Auth0 was, sincerely, don't make life harder by trying to do more than you can do. The message was clear from the CEO down: take care of your family, do what you can do, don't burn yourself out. We adjusted due dates, spent time on meetings checking in with each other, and just made it through. I've said to many people since then: I would have been voluntarily unemployed very quickly without that support.</p><p>We were <s>12 years</s> 18 months into the pandemic and my tenure on the Marketplace team when I got the shocking news about <a href="https://www.okta.com/press-room/press-releases/okta-signs-agreement-to-acquire-auth0/">The Acquisition</a>. One of our main competitors, Okta, had acquired us for $6.5B dollars and we would trade in our fiery Auth0 orange for the more staid Okta blue. I wasn't sure exactly what to think. I was happy that my stock options would be worth something but that meant less than the thought of the Auth0 spirit fading away. We've all heard the stories about the small and spunky startup being acquired and slowly being dissolved into the larger entity.</p><p>But, the fact is, I didn't want to leave right away and I had faith that Auth0 would still live on, in some form, even under the umbrella of larger corporate entity. I had faith in the people that started the company and the people that were a part of building it to what it had become.</p><p>I spent another 18 months on Marketplace working with my teammates and partners to design and build integrations into our platform. We were flying by the seat of our pants a lot of the time but, as always, the people around me and the work we were doing kept me motivated. In the summer of 2022, however, <a href="https://www.joshcanhelp.com/stroke/">another catastrophe struck my family</a> and I was, yet again, unable to do much beyond handle the situation in front of me. I was, once again, surrounded by teammates, a new manager, and a new director, all of whom told me in no uncertain terms: take care of your people and we'll handle it at work. This was over a year after The Acquisition and that support was the same as it had always been. I returned after several months of family leave and jumped right back in, truly excited to have a distraction in the form of writing code.</p><p>At the beginning of last year, I made what would be my last team change at the company. I was working with some true veterans with as many or more years in the company than I had. I loved the team and liked the work but something was missing and it didn’t really occur to me until I wrote the bulk of this post: the Auth0 story had been told, the ending was revealed, the future was written. The question of whether we would IPO or stay private forever or get acquired and by what company was no longer a question. We were “Auth0 by Okta,” soon to be known only as “Okta CIC.” There was work to be done and still big hills to climb but the original book is closed and on the shelf. In a world full of companies, we were one of the few that made it and it happened because of the heart and soul and blood and sweat we put into it.</p><p>I will forever be grateful to the two incredible individuals who started Auth0, Eugenio Pace and Matias Woloski, along with all the impossibly talented humans I worked with and learned from over the last 6 years.

And fairly late -- to the marketplace. We had lots of issues with them. [...] Sometimes the elegant solution isn't the best solution.</b>" -- Dave House, digressing to the 8271 during "Oral History Panel on the Development and Promotion of the Intel 8080 Microprocessor" [<a href="http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Oral_History/Intel_8080/102658123.05.01.pdf" target="_blank">link</a>], April 26th 2007, Computer History Museum, Mountain View, California.</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Around 1977, Intel released a floppy disc controller (FDC) chip called the 8271. This controller isn't particularly well known. It was mainly used in business computers and storage solutions, but its one breakthrough into the consumer space was with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro" target="_blank">BBC Micro</a>, a UK-centric computer released in 1981.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Nc7F7ELiKcg/X6tty3pLYaI/AAAAAAAAzOM/gAxepoBzq3ANNtsZPbgm7mhWZ--cUEA4gCLcBGAsYHQ/s267/i8271.png"><img data-original-height="267" data-original-width="234" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Nc7F7ELiKcg/X6tty3pLYaI/AAAAAAAAzOM/gAxepoBzq3ANNtsZPbgm7mhWZ--cUEA4gCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/i8271.png"></a></td></tr><tr><td>Intel 8271 (left) in an issue 3 BBC Micro model B</td></tr></tbody></table><p>There are very few easily discovered details about this chip online, aside from the useful <a href="http://www.nj7p.org/Manuals/PDFs/Intel/AFN-00223B.pdf" target="_blank">datasheet</a>. This, combined with increasing observations of strange behavior, make the chip a bit of an enigma. My interest in the chip was piqued when I accidentally triggered a wild test mode that managed to corrupt one of my floppy discs even though the write protect tab was present! You can read about that here:</p><p><a href="https://scarybeastsecurity.blogspot.com/2020/06/a-wild-bug-1970s-intel-8271-disc-chip.html" target="_blank">A wild bug: 1970s Intel 8271 disc chip ate my data!</a></p><p>Can we reverse engineer a detailed understanding of how it works? What wonders will we find?</p><h2>Credits</h2><p>The work described here represents the efforts of a virtual team that came together in an impromptu way to investigate the chip. There are many critical players, and special thanks go to:</p><ul><li><b>Nigel Barnes</b>.

These range from the crazy test mode we found above, to the fact the data sheet hints at a large number of internal registers, with only a few documented.</p><p>And, to decap:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zP3yJ1Fyrag/X6iQ3qpDr7I/AAAAAAAAzNI/Gv7Bfc5Y3L8hrUK9S-zJAGM8FZCBsuoQACLcBGAsYHQ/s1024/8271-6metal_1024px.jpg"><img data-original-height="914" data-original-width="1024" height="573" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zP3yJ1Fyrag/X6iQ3qpDr7I/AAAAAAAAzNI/Gv7Bfc5Y3L8hrUK9S-zJAGM8FZCBsuoQACLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h573/8271-6metal_1024px.jpg" width="640"></a></td></tr><tr><td>(See references at the end for very high resolution shots)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This a complicated chip for an FDC! There are a large number of large structures present, densely packed. To illustrate the point, we can compare this chip with the heart of the BBC Micro -- a venerable, legendary 6502, as used in iconic 80s machines and consoles such as the Apple ][, Commodore 64 and NES:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-w4_B4zG9xas/X6svWXOnACI/AAAAAAAAzNo/0hVy9qt_YZ8Uln1GyVbRg8p0Lp_YrWh7ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1024/8271_and_6502.png"><img data-original-height="457" data-original-width="1024" height="286" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-w4_B4zG9xas/X6svWXOnACI/AAAAAAAAzNo/0hVy9qt_YZ8Uln1GyVbRg8p0Lp_YrWh7ACLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h286/8271_and_6502.png" width="640"></a></td></tr><tr><td>8271 left, 6502 right</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Not only is the 8271 larger than the main CPU by a significant amount, it also cost more by all accounts:</p><blockquote><p><i>"In Acorn's wisdom, they had chosen the Intel 8271 disk controller for the BBC Micro - this controller was probably obsolete even before the BBC Micro was launched. The Acorn disk upgrade comprised the 8271, a handful of standard TTL ICs, an Acorn DFS ROM, and the disk manual. The ICs plugged into unpopulated sockets on the motherboard.</i></p><p><i>A few hardy folks tried sourcing the parts separately - which was fine, except that an 8271 tended to cost about £109 on its own, </i>if<i> you could find one..."</i>&nbsp;-- [<a href="http://www.adsb.co.uk/bbc/disk_controllers/" target="_blank">source link</a>]</p></blockquote><p>By contrast, the 6502 <a href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/2760/how-much-did-the-6502-and-z80-cost" target="_blank">allegedly cost around $7.45 in 1981</a>, which is a huge difference factor.</p><h3>Getting the ROM bits</h3><p>From a quick eyeball of the 8271 die, there are plenty of PLA-like structures, but perhaps most promisingly, a large rectangle of ROM in the lower left. Right away, we're thinking that this <i>could indeed</i>&nbsp;be a general purpose microcontroller CPU if there's a ROM program. Initial focus fell immediately to extracting the ROM.</p><p>ZXGuesser and Diminished put in a Herculean effort, transcribing the ROM bits first by hand and later with some tooling assist and cross-checking. In case you're wondering what transcribing ROM bits by hand looks like, it looks a little like this:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9Ub0YUPQ-Zk/X6s95IqdlOI/AAAAAAAAzN0/lXgPhiDKKpQmTXTwVmSCp4enXfiILQcigCLcBGAsYHQ/s1024/8271_partial_annotated_rom.png"><img data-original-height="768" data-original-width="1024" height="480" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9Ub0YUPQ-Zk/X6s95IqdlOI/AAAAAAAAzN0/lXgPhiDKKpQmTXTwVmSCp4enXfiILQcigCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h480/8271_partial_annotated_rom.png" width="640"></a></td></tr><tr><td>Look closely; those cyan annotations are 0s and 1s!</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The ROM matrix is 64x108 bit cells, for a ROM size of 864 bytes.</p><p>Once you've gotten the ROM bits, you still have the challenge of assembling them together into a correctly sequenced byte stream. This isn't always as easy as you might think, and is particularly rough when you don't have a reliable way of telling if the extracted bytes are ok, as is the case here. During my research, I found:</p><ul><li><a href="http://adamsblog.rfidiot.org/2013/01/fun-with-masked-roms.html" target="_blank">Two 8-bit bytes interleaved</a>.</li><li><a href="https://seanriddle.com/psu.html" target="_blank">Bits and bytes heavily interleaved in a Channel F game cartridge</a>.</li><li><a href="http://caps0ff.blogspot.com/2020/11/the-elusive-tms32010-mask-rom.html" target="_blank">Byte ordering permuted fairly arbitrarily -- obfuscation?</a></li></ul><p>Fortunately, the ROM reversers also looked at the row and column circuitry connecting the ROM, and gave a fairly robust opinion that the ROM bits / bytes are:</p><ul><li>Left-to-right, top-to-bottom.</li><li>Bits inverted relative to the initial decode in the image above.</li><li>Bits MSB first.</li><li>Bytes build from 1 bit per linear 8 bit group.</li></ul><p>This gives the first bytes of the ROM as the following:</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LOclFa5WPl8/X6tamrsG8dI/AAAAAAAAzOA/Thts9MEvrOkYOrjdJ3JjW8TyarKijpJKgCLcBGAsYHQ/s482/8271_rom_first_bytes.png"><img data-original-height="16" data-original-width="482" height="22" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LOclFa5WPl8/X6tamrsG8dI/AAAAAAAAzOA/Thts9MEvrOkYOrjdJ3JjW8TyarKijpJKgCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h22/8271_rom_first_bytes.png" width="640"></a></p><p>This happens to be a correct decode, although we couldn't be sure for some time.</p><h3>Architecture hints</h3><p>As Rich and myself engaged in efforts to try and disassemble the ROM, without any prior knowledge of the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), I was fortunate enough to have a conversation with Ken Shirriff (<a href="http://righto.com/">righto.com</a>) about this interesting chip. Against all odds, he found a detailed conference presentation abstract from 1977 [<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B2gUpavFpVP_s45A4cH6JKaI1A3O3t7T/view" target="_blank">link to copy of full abstract</a>].</p><p>This image from the abstract, will look familiar (imagine +90 degrees rotated).</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ATqW73uACls/X6uJuQXQ63I/AAAAAAAAzOY/OBNhopVpNDgJEn2sgs8qCD-DFqh2AK0wQCLcBGAsYHQ/s642/8271_photomicrograph.png"><img data-original-height="642" data-original-width="576" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ATqW73uACls/X6uJuQXQ63I/AAAAAAAAzOY/OBNhopVpNDgJEn2sgs8qCD-DFqh2AK0wQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/8271_photomicrograph.png"></a></p><p>The rest of the abstract is a gold mine. The presentation was titled "A Dual Processor Serial Data Controller Chip" and begins:</p><blockquote><p><i>"A DUAL PROCESSOR microprogrammable chip that implements a specialized architecture for high-speed serial data controllers will be described. The chip measures 218 mils by 244 mils and contains 22,000 transistors..."</i></p></blockquote><p><b>22,000 transistors</b>!! We knew this was a bit of a chonker, but for reference, the 6502 has 3,218 transistors; the 8080 6,000 transistors and the 8086 29,000 transistors. Yes, the 8271 is not that far off an 8086 in terms of transistor count.</p><p>This instructive table and diagram are also from the abstract:</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-e-V92zQW5w8/X6uOwAizXPI/AAAAAAAAzOk/NgDJ13X_NE0rdlyyZBAhKjeo1bqUtNUxQCLcBGAsYHQ/s728/8271_bit_byte_summary.png"><img data-original-height="244" data-original-width="728" height="214" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-e-V92zQW5w8/X6uOwAizXPI/AAAAAAAAzOk/NgDJ13X_NE0rdlyyZBAhKjeo1bqUtNUxQCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h214/8271_bit_byte_summary.png" width="640"></a></p><p>This confirms our suspicions that we <i>are</i> dealing with a general purpose CPU, coupled with some acceleration for I/O. The general purpose CPU has the features you'd expect, including a PC, stack, ALU, accumulator, registers, and access to a bus. Further detail in the abstract includes "32 eight-bit registers" and "four-level stack".</p><p>The presence of a a bit processor (a co-processor if you like) with 250ns cycle time resolves the elephant in the room with the "general CPU" theory. A general CPU of the era probably wouldn't be fast enough to calculate CRC16 at the disc data rate. However, a specialized PLA-driven bit engine bolted on to the side will do just fine.</p><div><p>Finally on this abstract, we see that it states "To date, two distinct controllers have been microprogrammed: a floppy disk controller and a synchronous data link controller (SDLC)". Well, we've found the FDC, the 8271. Intel's SDLC from the era was the 8273. Enter Sean Riddle once more -- what a star -- and another sacrificed chip or two later, we have our result:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-G9mwTNwiKdM/X6uSSexg3eI/AAAAAAAAzOw/wgCiIwdSRp88t36gyBXf8DBtm76id5HiQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1024/8271_and_8273.jpg"><img data-original-height="457" data-original-width="1024" height="286" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-G9mwTNwiKdM/X6uSSexg3eI/AAAAAAAAzOw/wgCiIwdSRp88t36gyBXf8DBtm76id5HiQCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h286/8271_and_8273.jpg" width="640"></a></td></tr><tr><td>8271 left, 8273 right</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Ken also found a patent relating to this dual core design! It's <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US4152761A/" target="_blank">US4152761</a>. [<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bnR9p-fwb82HZeQvJAIr_JM3Oebc8xrs/view" target="_blank">link to a more complete version</a>]. There's a lot of useful architectural detail in the patent, including this interesting summary of key components.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DEWAzrvaRDU/X6uUYhi67JI/AAAAAAAAzO8/9AtRcmLVm5QeavKH3MlZd2iyQbN09wzwACLcBGAsYHQ/s728/patent_8271_diag.png"><img data-original-height="506" data-original-width="728" height="444" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DEWAzrvaRDU/X6uUYhi67JI/AAAAAAAAzO8/9AtRcmLVm5QeavKH3MlZd2iyQbN09wzwACLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h444/patent_8271_diag.png" width="640"></a></td></tr><tr><td>From US4,152,761</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As can be seen, there's additional complexity described here that falls outside what we'd expect from a traditional CPU. There's dispatcher requests, priority resolution, a "case" and an "address" register in addition to the program counter and instruction register. This relates to some form of scheduling, which we'll encounter later.</p><p>Finally, here's a diagram (courtesy of Ken). It's an early estimation of how the architecture we've seen in the the documents so far might map to the silicon. As a dual processor behemoth, note how there's two ALUs, two sets of registers, lots of PLAs (including a couple to the left and right of the "control" label), and plenty of patches of silicon with unknown function.</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-S8ZcdDBfcGc/X6uhKQ6CHKI/AAAAAAAAzPI/i5zleRTOnmM5_7lO5uy7WnYaWqlK035hwCLcBGAsYHQ/s924/image%2B%25283%2529.png"><img data-original-height="855" data-original-width="924" height="592" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-S8ZcdDBfcGc/X6uhKQ6CHKI/AAAAAAAAzPI/i5zleRTOnmM5_7lO5uy7WnYaWqlK035hwCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h592/image%2B%25283%2529.png" width="640"></a></p><h3>From bits to bytes to an Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)</h3><p>With an overview of the architecture, we have a better idea of what sort of opcodes we might find in the instruction set. The more pieces of the puzzle we have in our heads, the better chance we have of making abstract connections in our attempt to solve a problem with a lot of moving parts.</p><p>Initial attempts to disassemble the ROM centered around the theory that the CPU core might be based on the Intel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_MCS-48" target="_blank">MCS-48</a> microcontroller series. This series includes the well-known 8048 and has several variants such as the slightly cut-down 8020 (less I/O lines). And why wouldn't this core be based on a further cut-down 8020? It just fits too well: 1K ROM, 64 registers, 13 I/O lines. The timing works well too: the MCS-48 series first launched in 1976, making the core available before the release of the 8271. So the theory went, you'd be crazy as an 1970s Intel employee to not just walk down the corridor and raid the parts bin of your colleagues in order to get a headstart.</p><p>The MCS-48 theory turned out to fit extremely well.... but be false. No amount of ROM bit / byte wrangling led to sensible MCS-48 disassemblies.</p><p>Back to the drawing board, we looked again at our "probably correct" ROM decode and analyzed it for patterns we'd expect to find in an 8271 ROM, based on our understanding of how the controller works, and how disc recording works in general. Here's a section we found enlightening:</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9rMUfFP7_QE/X6zWgUz8b5I/AAAAAAAAzPs/ADcU0WUZSHsVHMdPRkODzyhrtj57ulFjQCLcBGAsYHQ/s485/rom_hex_red_boxed.png"><img data-original-height="70" data-original-width="485" height="92" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9rMUfFP7_QE/X6zWgUz8b5I/AAAAAAAAzPs/ADcU0WUZSHsVHMdPRkODzyhrtj57ulFjQCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h92/rom_hex_red_boxed.png" width="640"></a></p><p>Most significant is the appearance of the constants $FE + $C7 (middle box), then $E5 + $FF (lower box) in a the same context. These constants are the data byte + clocks byte we'd expect to see in the format routine for FM (single density) formatted discs. $FE + $C7 is the sector header marker, and $E5 + $FF is the default fill byte for freshly formatted sectors. As a bonus, we speculated that $E9 (appearing four times in a row) could be a shift left or right opcode, with $FD perhaps being RET. All in all, some strong circumstantial evidence for a correct decode.</p><p>After the MCS-48 opcode list failed to match our ROM, we spent a long time trying to derive an alternate instruction set.</p><p><b>But it's hard; it's a bit like one of those jigsaw puzzles where every piece is the exact same color. It's very hard to find a start as there are so many different possibilities to try. Research is too often presented as a neatly packaged result, with no mention of the struggle. I think this contributes to discouraging newcomers. So make no mistake: this was a struggle; it went on for some time; there was swearing; and the characteristics leading to success were perseverance and grit as opposed to any particular technical ability.</b></p><p>The breakthrough was catalyzed when the hardware investigations got a good read on the wiring and content of one of the instruction PLAs associated with the byte processor. The PLA in question is actually the darker rectangular block to the left of the "control" label in the image above. It is populated like this:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OsJtpbF68Ns/X6zfr6L18EI/AAAAAAAAzP4/SIgoMLXyvwU3C_jqi80L2BA7fwTGMTXpACLcBGAsYHQ/s557/left_instruction_table.jpg"><img data-original-height="202" data-original-width="557" height="145" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OsJtpbF68Ns/X6zfr6L18EI/AAAAAAAAzP4/SIgoMLXyvwU3C_jqi80L2BA7fwTGMTXpACLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h145/left_instruction_table.jpg" width="400"></a></td></tr><tr><td>Thanks to Diminished!</td></tr></tbody></table><p>With the instruction PLAs decoded, it would be possible to trace the effects of each 8-bit opcode by following activation lines to the registers, stack, ALU, etc. However, we were able to hit our breakthrough with only opcode ranges, provided by this PLA. Of specific interest is these ranges from Rich:</p></div><blockquote></blockquote><p>The specialized $FC and $FD match our theory of CALL and RET, but more pivotal is the range of $20-$3F, split into 2x 16 wide blocks. Immediately, I speculated this could be "move register to accumulator" and "move accumulator to register". This would turn out to be correct. Furthermore, I noted that opcode $0? was common before $2? or $3?, e.g.</p><blockquote><p><span>05D:&nbsp; &nbsp;04 22 03 35</span></p></blockquote><div><p>This led to the theory that these are register bank selection opcodes. Similar to the MCS-48, the theory is that there aren't enough opcodes for all operations to be able to reference all 32 registers, so there must be a bank select. This also would turn out to be correct. In fact, with these pieces, the jigsaw started to fall in place, and fall into place faster and faster.</p><h3>Some ROM code examples</h3><p>For these code examples, bear in mind that the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) presented here hasn't seen public light of day as far as we know. We've had to invent our own assembly mnemonics, although they're designed to be familiar to anyone familiar with assembly languages in general. Some specific notes:</p><ul><li>SEL RB is SELect Register Bank, and provides the base index for register access (multiply by 8 to get actual index).</li><li>Note that all register references are by index, not register number. A register number can be calculated with the index and register bank.</li></ul><p><b>1) READ SPECIAL REGISTER</b></p><p><span>.command_READ_SPECIAL_REGISTER<br>32E&nbsp; &nbsp;00<span>	</span>SEL RB 0<br>32F&nbsp; &nbsp;27<span>	</span>MOV A, I7<span>		</span>; R7 ($07) (param 1)<br>330&nbsp; &nbsp;30<span>	</span>MOV I0, A<span>		</span>; R0 ($00) = register index<br>331&nbsp; &nbsp;F8<span>	</span>MOV A, [I0]<span>		</span>; read special register value to A<br>332&nbsp; &nbsp;02<span>	</span>SEL RB 2<br>333&nbsp; &nbsp;36<span>	</span>MOV I6, A<span>		</span>; R22 ($16) (ext RESULT) = A<br>334&nbsp; &nbsp;0E<span>	</span>SEL RB 14<br>335&nbsp; &nbsp;EE<span>	</span>SYS 2, RB<span>		</span>; JMP (2,E,0) =&gt; $288, .post_command_tidy_up</span></p><p>The READ SPECIAL REGISTER command is one of the simplest. As suspected, "special register" externally is just "index into the 32 registers" internally. We can also note plenty of interesting things:</p><ul><li>The command setup code, which we'll see in a bit, writes parameters to R7 downwards.</li><li>Indirect reads and writes are done via special opcodes that indirect through I0 (typically but not always R0), as per the MCS-48 architecture.</li><li>Some of the internal registers interact with the external bus registers used to interact with the host CPU. R22 is where you write values for them to appear in "ext RESULT", which is read with BBC Micro's 6502 at memory location $FE81.</li><li>The "register bank" concept appears to be re-used to provide a lookup index to the SYS 2, RB opcode. You might consider this a minor kludge.</li><li>In order to jump from page 3 ($3??) to page 2 ($2??) at the end, a special SYS opcode is required. Normal JMP / CALL instructions only have an 8-bit operand and can only jump to the current page. SYS opcodes look up a 10-bit PC from a hard coded table.</li><li>The command exits by jumping to a common exit routine, <span>.post_command_tidy_up</span>. This routine disables most of the chip, including the bit processor, and events. This will be important later.</li></ul><p><b>2) SPECIFY</b></p><p><span>.command_SPECIFY<br>066&nbsp; &nbsp;00<span>	</span>SEL RB 0<br>067&nbsp; &nbsp;27<span>	</span>MOV A, I7<span>		</span>; R7 ($07) (param 1)<br>068&nbsp; &nbsp;30<span>	</span>MOV I0, A<span>		</span>; R0 ($00) = destination index<br>069&nbsp; &nbsp;F1 03<span>	</span>MOV I1, #$03<span>		</span>; R1 ($01) = count of 3 extra parameters<br>06B&nbsp; &nbsp;14<span>	</span>YIELDTO 4<span>		</span>; seems to set PARAM callback to<br><span>					</span>; .wakeup_PARAM_4_SPECIFY, then YIELD<br>; ** entry point (3, segment 9, routine 4 5 6 7 C D E F)<br>.wakeup_PARAM_4_SPECIFY<br>06C&nbsp; &nbsp;03<span>	</span>SEL RB 3<br>06D&nbsp; &nbsp;2E<span>	</span>MOV A, IE<span>		</span>; R30 ($1E) (ext PARAM)<br>06E&nbsp; &nbsp;00<span>	</span>SEL RB 0<br>06F&nbsp; &nbsp;E8<span>	</span>MOV [I0], A<br>070&nbsp; &nbsp;00<span>	</span>SEL RB 0<br>071&nbsp; &nbsp;80<span>	</span>INC I0<br>072&nbsp; &nbsp;A1<span>	</span>DEC I1<span>			</span>; R1 ($01), decrement count<br>073&nbsp; &nbsp;8A 8C<span>	</span>BZ $08C<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>; branch if done<br><span>					</span>; lands at SEL RB 14, JMP RB<br><span>					</span>; which jumps to .post_command_tidy_up<br>075&nbsp; &nbsp;FF<span>	</span>YIELD</span></p><p>SPECIFY is also a simple command. It's not strictly a necessary command because it has the same effect as 3 WRITE SPECIAL REGISTER commands to sequential register numbers. It's unclear why it exists, given the space crunch in the ROM and on the silicon, but the datasheet does describe initializing the 8271 using a few of calls to this. Other items of note:</p><div><ul><li>SPECIFY accepts and applies the register writes immediately, YIELDing (sleeping / idling) between writes and waiting for the host CPU to supply the next register. This means the SPECIFY command might be partially completed for some time, and never fully completed, depending on how we program the chip. This will be significant later.</li><li>SPECIFY internally uses R0 as a destination index to write register values, and R1 as a count to complete. This makes it an ideal candidate to do some black box testing to confirm the chip behaves the same as our source code disassembly. Specifically, I tried and confirmed:</li><ul><li>Pass the first parameter to SPECIFY as 0, indicating we are writing register values starting at R0. Note that as per the code, R0 is used internally by SPECIFY.</li><li>Pass the second parameter as $22. This will get written to R0 (because R0 currently points to R0) and incremented, leaving $23 in R0. This has "corrupted" R0.</li><li>Pass the third parameter as $48. This will get written to MMIO register R35 ($23), and should turn on the drive motor.</li><li>Do not pass a fourth parameter. Despite not “completing” the full four parameters of the command, we expect the writing of the third parameter to have the effect as just described. <b>It does on real hardware</b>.</li></ul></ul></div><p><b>3) External command register handling</b></p><div><p><span>.wakeup_COMMAND</span></p><p><span>014&nbsp; &nbsp;02<span>	</span>SEL RB 2</span></p><p><span>015&nbsp; &nbsp;F6 00<span>	</span>MOV I6, #$00<span>		</span>; R22 ($16) = $00 (ext RESULT)</span></p><p><span>017&nbsp; &nbsp;CF BF<span>	</span>AND I7, #$BF<span>		</span>; R23 ($17) (ext STATUS) !CMD_FULL</span></p><p><span>019&nbsp; &nbsp;00<span>	</span>SEL RB 0</span></p><p><span>01A&nbsp; &nbsp;F5 01<span>	</span>MOV I5, #$01<span>		</span>; R5 ($05) = $01 (param 3 default $01)</span></p><p><span><span>					</span>; That’s 1x 128 byte sector in many cases.</span></p><p><span>01C&nbsp; &nbsp;F4 01<span>	</span>MOV I4, #$01<span>		</span>; R4 ($04) = $01 (param 4 default $01)</span></p><p><span>01E&nbsp; &nbsp;03<span>	</span>SEL RB 3</span></p><p><span>01F&nbsp; &nbsp;98 05<span>	</span>MOV A, #$05<span>		</span>; 5 parameters expected</span></p><p><span>021&nbsp; &nbsp;6F 18 27<span>	</span>TBZ IF, #$18, $027<span>	</span>; R31 ($1F) (ext CMD), jump if 5 param <span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span><span>;&nbsp;</span>command</span></p><p><span><span>					</span>; matches SCAN, FORMAT</span></p><p><span>024&nbsp; &nbsp;2F<span>	</span>MOV A, IF<span>		</span>; R31 ($1F) (ext CMD)</span></p><p><span>025&nbsp; &nbsp;9C 03<span>	</span>AND A, #$03<span>		</span>; (CMD &amp; 3) parameters expected</span></p><p><span>027&nbsp; &nbsp;00<span>	</span>SEL RB 0</span></p><p><span>028&nbsp; &nbsp;31<span>	</span>MOV I1, A<span>		</span>; R1 ($01) = A = parameters expected</span></p><p><span>029&nbsp; &nbsp;8A 3D<span>	</span>BZ $03D<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>		</span>; if no parameters, start command</span></p><p><span>02B&nbsp; &nbsp;F0 07<span>	</span>MOV I0, #$07<span>		</span>; R0 ($00) = $07 (put parameters at $07 down)</span></p><p><span>02D&nbsp; &nbsp;BC 01<span>	</span>TASK 4, 1<span>		</span>; select .wakeup_PARAM_1_accept</span></p><p><span><span>					</span>; 3 9 (1, 3, 9, B) = $035</span></p><p><span>02F&nbsp; &nbsp;FF<span>	</span>YIELD</span></p><p>This is where to start reading if you want to trace the main entry point into the ROM.

These are used in the commands the datasheet calls "128 Byte Single Record Format".

This copy will remain static. It's mostly complete, and all of the "main" paths are fully traced, including SEEK, READ DATA, WRITE DATA and FORMAT TRACK.</p><p><h3>Javascript on a (1970s!) chip</h3></p><p>It is time to look at some of the unusual sounding instructions in the ISA:</p><div><ul><li><b>YIELD</b>. $FF. This instruction tells the processor to switch to running the highest priority dispatcher request, or (more likely) go idle if there's no dispatcher request active.</li><li><b>TASK t, r</b>. $B8-$BF, 2 bytes. This instruction changes the callback routine for the specified task. Callback routines are specified as an integer that form part of a lookup key into a table of ROM addresses.</li><li><b>YIELDTO r</b>. $10-$1F. Change the callback routine for the currently executing task and yield.</li><li><b>SYS 0, RB, A</b>. $EC. Jump to the ROM address at key (0, RB, A) in the address PLA. RB is the current register bank from the SEL RB instruction, and A is the accumulator value.</li><li><b>SYS 1, RB, R</b>. $ED. Jump to the ROM address at key (1, RB, R) in the address PLA. RB is the current register bank from the SEL RB instruction, and R is current routine value.</li><li><b>SYS 2, RB</b>. $EE. Jump to the ROM address at key (2, RB, 0) in the address PLA. RB is the current register bank.</li></ul><p>There are quite a few concepts introduced here. If you find them somewhat jumbled, you are not alone. A lot of things about the non-traditional parts of the byte processor CPU appear very ad-hoc to me. Let's look at a concrete example: the handler for the SPECIFY command. This is the <span>.command_SPECIFY</span>&nbsp;code in example chunk 2) above.</p></div><p>To get <span>.command_SPECIFY</span> to run, the host CPU provides the command $35 to the external command register, then 1 initial expected parameter to the external parameter register. The byte processor CPU wakes up at&nbsp;<span>.wakeup_PARAM_1_accept</span>. The context here is:</p><div><ul><li>PC == $035</li><li>TASK == 4</li><li>SEGMENT == 9, ROUTINE == 1</li></ul></div><p>The fact that writes to the external parameter register wake up task 4 is <b>hardcoded</b>. The PC executed is determined by the routine selected for this task, which was 1 at the time. This is used to create the key (3,9,1), which looks up the address $035 in the address PLA. The address PLA is <b>hardcoded</b>. The fact that task 4 keys lookups as (3,9,x) is <b>hardcoded</b>.</p><p><span>.command_SPECIFY</span> ends with this, because it is the one command that gets executed and then decides it wants to yield to wait for 3 more parameters:</p><div><p><span>06B&nbsp; &nbsp;14<span>	</span>YIELDTO 4<span>		</span>; seems to set PARAM callback to</span></p><p><span><span>					</span>; .wakeup_PARAM_4_SPECIFY, then YIELD</span></p></div><p>This unusual instruction sets the callback routine for the <i>current</i>&nbsp;task to be 4. This means that the callback code for the next external parameter register write will be keyed (3,9,4) in the address PLA. That's PC $06C, aka. <span>.wakeup_PARAM_4_SPECIFY</span>.</p><p><b>A good mental model for this is Javascript</b>. All execution is event based; the handler for a given event can be changed (by the handler itself, or an unrelated handler); there is no pre-emption until an explicit yield.</p><p>The known events wired in to the byte processor are:</p><div><ul><li>0: Not reversed at all. Appears to be related to the SCAN command, which isn't enabled on the BBC Micro due to lack of DMA.</li><li>1: Bit processor event, e.g. found sync, lost sync, CRC error.</li><li>2: Bit processor, read byte ready.</li><li>3: Bit processor, write byte needed.</li><li>4: External parmeter register written.</li><li>5: appears unused. (Could be permanently connected to external command register?)</li><li>6: Disc drive index pulse.</li><li>7: appears unused.</li></ul></div><p>On top of the "normal" Javascript model, there's also the concept of task priorities. These are not visible in the ISA and are presumably hardcoded. One instance this might come in handy in a floppy disc controller is when a disc drive index pulse (once per disc revolution) fires at the same time the bit processor needs a write byte. (It's not common to write across the index, but it could happen.) In this instance, providing the bit processor a data byte is a much more real-time task than handling an index pulse, so it should be handled first.</p><p>Yes, this is quite some complexity in addition to the complexity typical in a general purpose CPU. In particular, it provides many additional ways to slice and dice control flow handling beyond the standard JMP / CALL / RET. In fact -- and somewhat painfully -- the different control flow possibilities are mixed together! To briefly get a taste of the horrors, here's the command handler for many of the sector read operations:</p><div><p><span>.command_READ_DATA</span></p><p><span>.command_READ_DATA_AND_DEL_DATA</span></p><p><span>.command_VERIFY_DATA_AND_DEL_DATA</span></p><p><span>0A7&nbsp; &nbsp;FC C9<span>	</span>CALL $0C9<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>; .do_common_path_from_seek</span></p><p><span><span>			<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span>; very gnarly because this CALL does a YIELD</span></p><p><span><span>			<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span></span>; context on RET is from</span></p><p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>; .wakeup_BITPROC_EVENT_1_check_header_crc</span></p><p><span><span>		<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span>; if we get a matching sector header,</span></p><p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>; the RET at $255 fires</span></p><p><span><span>0A9&nbsp; &nbsp;BA 0B<span>	</span>TASK 2, 11<span>	</span>; select&nbsp;</span><span>.wakeup_BITPROC_READ_10_11_count_GAP2</span></span></p><p><span><span>			<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span>; (3,5,(10,11)) = $1B8</span></p><p><span>0AB&nbsp; &nbsp;12<span>	</span>YIELDTO 2<span>	</span>; select</span></p><p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>; .wakeup_BITPROC_EVENT_2_check_for_data_marker</span></p><p><span><span>				</span>; (3,4,2) = $2D0</span></p><p><span><span>				</span>; and YIELD</span></p></div><p>As can be seen, a CALL subroutine is doing a YIELD without unwinding the stack. This should probably be considered an anti-pattern? The stack is a shared resource across all tasks, so you'd better hope that two different tasks can't trip over each by doing this at the same time. There's also the complexity that when a CALL returns, various aspects of the execution environment (task, routine, RB, etc.) may well have changed.</p><p>All this makes the ROM very hard to follow for the read and write paths, even with a fully disassembled and commented ROM!</p><h3>Unusual features of the ISA</h3></div><p><b>1) Lack of symmetry</b></p><p>These are the opcodes we found relating to incrementing, decrementing, adding and subtracting:</p><div><p><span>$80-$83:<span>	</span>INC Ix</span></p><p><span>$84-$87:<span>	</span>ADC A, Ix</span></p><p><span>[...]</span></p><p><span>$A0-$A7:<span>	</span>DEC Ix</span></p><p><span>[...]</span></p><p><span>$90-$93:<span>	</span>ADC Ix<span>			</span>does INC Ix if carry</span></p><p><span>$94-$97:<span>	</span>SBB A, Ix</span></p></div><p>This is interesting because there is an asymmetry between which registers can be incremented vs. decremented. Some registers cannot be incremented at all, even with register banking, because banking operates in multiples of 8 and there are only 4 increment opcodes.</p><p>One theory is that the chip designers were short on silicon space, and trying to get away without add and subtract support in the ALU. There's only circumstantial evidence to support this, such as the hacked-out ranges in the opcode space; the code generally being add / subtract free except for the code implementing disc drive seek; no compare instruction found (yet -- there are unknowns); the use of XOR to do equality checks at $240 and $24F; and the presence of only direct equality checking or mask based checking for the most common branch opcodes (see item 2) directly below). But it's fun to speculate wildly isn't it?</p><p><b>2) 3-byte opcodes</b></p><p>An entire quarter(!) of the opcode space is devoted to four conditional branch instructions:</p><div><p><span>$40-$4F:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>BEQ Ix, #imm, abs<span>	</span>branch if Ix == imm</span></p><p><span>$50-$5F: <span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BNE Ix, #imm, abs<span>	</span>branch if Ix != imm</span></p><p><span>$60-$6F:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>TBZ Ix, #imm, abs<span>	</span>test and branch if zero</span></p><p><span>$70-$7F:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>TBNZ Ix, #imm, abs<span>	</span>test and branch if not zero</span></p></div><p>These opcodes are all three bytes, which is a departure from Intel's other microcontrollers of the era. It's a lot of opcode space, but they can do a lot with a little, for example this piece of code from <span>.do_seek</span>.</p><div><p><span>13E&nbsp; &nbsp;62 01 3E<span>	</span>TBZ I2, #$01, $13E<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>; MMIO R34 ($22) (drive in), wait until CNT/OPI</span></p><p><span>141&nbsp; &nbsp;72 01 41<span>	</span>TBNZ I2, #$01, $141<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>; MMIO R34 ($22) (drive in), wait until !CNT/OPI</span></p></div><p>For a certain (less common) seek mode, these 6 bytes are sufficient to busy loop while waiting for the drive to start the seek, then acknowledge finishing it.</p><p>These three byte opcodes were found by the previously mentioned "jigsaw" analogy. Once the command entry function was fully disassembled apart from just three bytes at $021, there was only one clean possibility that fitted the required behavior.</p><p><b>3) No timers, port I/O or IRQs</b></p><p>Presumably to save silicon, the byte processor CPU has done away with timers, dedicated port I/O instructions and IRQs. The MCS-48 has all of those.</p><p>They're not needed, though. Delays, such as the millisecond range delays for seek steps, are simply timed via busy loops.</p><p><b>4) Decide your own adventure</b></p><p>At time of writing, our opcode list is here: [<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EIg6utXQKTEYf9x6fcpJ0Sht1Pj_r9WW/view" target="_blank">link</a>]. It is not complete. The one part of the 8271 ROM we have not disassembled, SCAN handling, uses at least opcodes $9A, $9B and $8C. (We've ignored SCAN because it needs DMA wired up, which is not the case in the BBC Micro application.) Furthermore, the PLAs suggest that other opcode ranges <i>not</i>&nbsp;seen in the 8271 ROM might do something. This includes $A8-$AF and $B0-$B7. Feel free to go and have a look!</p><h3>Interface to the bit processor</h3><p>Now that we've got the byte processor understood and disassembled, it's time to turn our attention to interface to the bit processor and its behavior. After all, it's the bit processor that is wired to the disc drive control and data lines!</p><p>Our initial assumption was that the byte processor CPU would, like the MCS-48, have some form of port I/O instructions. This turned out to be false. The reality is simpler: it uses MMIO (Memory Mapped Input/Output). This means that access to certain register indexes change registers in the bit processor instead of the byte processor. It's quite simple: 0-31 references the byte processor registers. And the range 32-39 references bit processor registers. For simplicity of decoding, the bit processor's 8 register references are mirrored 4 times across the range 32-63. The entire 0-63 range is then mirrored 4 times in the entire addressable range of 0-255.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kWVhh-q4_28/X68AB39pVNI/AAAAAAAAzQE/WGoqlH0cQ2Arrw3u0abrTyLAtzacKeIeACLcBGAsYHQ/s547/8271init.jpg"><img data-original-height="410" data-original-width="547" height="300" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kWVhh-q4_28/X68AB39pVNI/AAAAAAAAzQE/WGoqlH0cQ2Arrw3u0abrTyLAtzacKeIeACLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h300/8271init.jpg" width="400"></a></td></tr><tr><td>Registers 0-63, read on a real BBC Micro, illustrating mirroring of the bit processor registers</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Furthermore, the context of bit processor references in the byte processor code makes it clear that the bit processor interface is very simple. It is so simple we didn't feel the need to reverse engineer the bit processor further. The bit processor register assignments are as follows:</p><div><ul><li>0: control register, 4 bits</li><ul><li>Bit 0 (0x01) =&gt; gather CRC (?)</li><li>Bit 1 (0x02) =&gt; finish CRC (?)</li><li>Bit 2 (0x04) =&gt; 1 for read, 0 for write</li><li>Bit 3 (0x08) =&gt; idle state</li></ul><li>1: status register, indicates sync data byte type, CRC error, etc.</li><li>2: drive input, read for drive status</li><li>3: drive output, controls step / write / etc. lines</li><li>4: clocks output byte</li><li>5: data output byte</li><li>6: data input byte</li><li>7: unused? (returns 0xFF, and byte processor ROM relies on this!)</li></ul><p>The astute reader might ask: does this mean the bit processor can be programmed directly with the WRITE SPECIAL REGISTER command, since the bit processor registers are MMIO? And the answer is yes! There are severe caveats however:</p></div><div><ul><li>The generic command entry code corrupts bit processor state on entry.</li><li>The generic command exit code resets the bit processor and associated callbacks on exit (but strangely and usefully not for WRITE SPECIAL REGISTER).</li><li><b>The latency of WRITE SPECIAL REGISTER is terrible</b>.</li></ul></div><p>That last bullet, the poor latency, is unfortunate. It's about 211us, which means there's zero chance for tricks like writing data to the disc a clocks + data byte at a time. The latency is large because the byte processor executes a large number of instructions on the command entry path, doing things like checking and caching drive status, as well as reading parameters one at a time, checking if the selected drive changed, etc.</p><p>Writing the drive output register directly is useful, though. I did this for my trick to write "weak bits" directly using the 8271! See my blog post about weak bits for more details.

Can we make the chip do things it is "not supposed" to be able to do? Of course we can, and as usual, it involves disobeying the datasheet:</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KMR4QIEpLqU/X68czifdgoI/AAAAAAAAzQQ/ycPvt_HbOy4riVZSjHUSrYF-ppLie7N2gCLcBGAsYHQ/s490/datasheet_illegal.png"><img data-original-height="325" data-original-width="490" height="424" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KMR4QIEpLqU/X68czifdgoI/AAAAAAAAzQQ/ycPvt_HbOy4riVZSjHUSrYF-ppLie7N2gCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h424/datasheet_illegal.png" width="640"></a></p><p>We are specifically going to disobey the sentence that states "Issuing a command while another command is in progress is illegal." We are now equipped to see exactly what happens if we do this, by reading and reasoning about the code. The callback called when the external command register is written gets on with its job without regard for whether a command is in progress, so side effects will be:</p><div><ul><li>The internal command register itself is corrupted, i.e. mismatched with the currently executing command. It is referenced from time to time so this may be useful to us.</li><li>The illegal command will change internal register values, which may impact the execution of the current command.</li><li>The illegal command may change or disable callbacks, or reset or reconfigure the bit processor.</li></ul></div><p>Taking these things into consideration, we are going to <b>try and write an arbitrary FM bit stream</b>. Achieving this will enable us to recreate copy protected disc surfaces that are not supposed to be writeable with the 8271. Remember, kids:</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3ctTtZams3E/X68nLNJWuNI/AAAAAAAAzQc/8LJkQY2eu64dWHkw8HTxW_wrAQTkPhkvwCLcBGAsYHQ/s364/Dontcopythatfloppy.jpg"><img data-original-height="274" data-original-width="364" height="301" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3ctTtZams3E/X68nLNJWuNI/AAAAAAAAzQc/8LJkQY2eu64dWHkw8HTxW_wrAQTkPhkvwCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h301/Dontcopythatfloppy.jpg" width="400"></a></p><p>We're going to attempt this by separating out how we write the data bytes and how we write the special sector mark clock bytes. Writing a full track of data bytes is easy, but useless on its own. We can do this by:</p><div><ul><li>Formatting a track with a single sector header.</li><li>Issue a WRITE DATA command for that sector, of size 8192 bytes. A track is only 3125 bytes (with a perfectly calibrated drive), so:</li><ul><li>At the first wrap around, start writing the track of bytes we want.</li><li>3125 or so bytes later, at the second wrap around, abort the command by resetting the controller.</li></ul></ul><p>This track of data bytes alone will be useless. If you try to read a sector from it, you will get error $18, aka. "sector not found". The special clock byte markers required to identify sector headers and sector data will be missing.</p><p>The way FM encoding works is very simple: it alternates clock bit, data bit, clock bit, data bit, ... every 4us. Normally all the clock bits are 1, to maintain timing and keep the drive electronics happy. But for a sector header or data marker, a few clock bits are left out so that the floppy disc controller can locate things in a bitstream where it is not sure where it is.</p></div><p>So, while the WRITE DATA command is running, we're going to sneak in some parallel SPECIFY commands to "corrupt" registers for the running WRITE DATA command, without disturbing it. Specifically, we're only going to corrupt the clocks byte register (MMIO R36) at the precise times necessary to write clocks byte values other than 0xFF. The overall operation looks like this:</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-w6c6LiMbVac/X68vo7RomKI/AAAAAAAAzQs/7pfFc4fAWYUEK75UzIOIqU-6hlvGFW-wACLcBGAsYHQ/s960/Reverse%2Bengineering%2Bthe%2BIntel%2B8271%2B%25281%2529.png"><img data-original-height="540" data-original-width="960" height="360" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-w6c6LiMbVac/X68vo7RomKI/AAAAAAAAzQs/7pfFc4fAWYUEK75UzIOIqU-6hlvGFW-wACLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h360/Reverse%2Bengineering%2Bthe%2BIntel%2B8271%2B%25281%2529.png" width="640"></a></p><p>By some miracle, this scheme does work, and it easily replicates discs that no BBC Micro copier back in the day could come close to. One example of a tough disc, for some reason, is The Sentinel [<a href="http://bbcmicro.co.uk/game.php?id=609" target="_blank">link</a>]. The disc has a pretty label and packaging so of course, time for a gratuitous image:</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5LsJkBNKXgo/X68w3a82qdI/AAAAAAAAzQ0/xt_qUUf2CsEoqMuD90xdqAtmqnzkmP7YACLcBGAsYHQ/s800/sentinel_disc.jpeg"><img data-original-height="600" data-original-width="800" height="300" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5LsJkBNKXgo/X68w3a82qdI/AAAAAAAAzQ0/xt_qUUf2CsEoqMuD90xdqAtmqnzkmP7YACLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h300/sentinel_disc.jpeg" width="400"></a></p><p>There are plenty of quirks and caveats to get this working. To briefly note them for completeness:</p><div><ul><li>The SPECIFY command was used instead of WRITE SPECIAL REGISTER to help with latency concerns. The SPECIFY command can be "primed" by passing the command and the first parameter, such that the second parameter (first register value to write) executes the write and executes with low latency at just the right moment.</li><li>The WRITE SPECIAL REGISTER command exits without resetting the bit processor or clearing all the I/O callbacks. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for SPECIFY. Fortunately, we don't have to exit the SPECIFY command! It starts having the useful side effect of writing internal registers before it is complete. And then you can later restart it again and again, never completing it.</li><li>The act of command dispatch corrupts the MMIO clocks byte register! This is very unexpected but it uses MMIO R36 as a temporary storage location while it is calculating which disc drive (0 or 1) is selected, and whether it changed. It is worth looking at:</li></ul><div><p><span>.parameters_complete_launch_command</span></p><p><span>03D&nbsp; &nbsp;FC 5D<span>	</span>CALL $05D<span>	</span>; .read_drive_status</span></p><p><span>03F&nbsp; &nbsp;BC 00<span>	</span>TASK 4, 0<span>	</span>; select .wakeup_PARAM_0_no_action</span></p><p><span><span>				</span>; (3,9,(0,2,8,A)) =&gt; $030</span></p><p><span>041&nbsp; &nbsp;03<span>	</span>SEL RB 3</span></p><p><span>042&nbsp; &nbsp;2F<span>	</span>MOV A, IF<span>	</span>; R31 ($1F) (ext CMD)</span></p><p><span>043&nbsp; &nbsp;CF 3C<span>	</span>AND I7, #$3C<span>	</span>; R31 ($1F) (select bits + param&nbsp;</span><span>count masked out)</span></p><p><span>045&nbsp; &nbsp;9C C0<span>	</span>AND A, #$C0<span>	</span>; A now contains drive select bits</span></p><p><span>047&nbsp; &nbsp;04<span>	</span>SEL RB 4</span></p><p><span>048&nbsp; &nbsp;34<span>	</span>MOV I4, A<span>	</span>; MMIO R36 ($24) (???)

I annotated it as iffy with ??? when I first disassembled it as it looked wacky. But, it's correct and a real machine exhibits the corrupted clocks precisely as described by the code. The corrupt clocks value, $40 if writing to drive 0, is shown in orange in the above diagram. Once you know it's there, and why, the easiest way to navigate around it is to arrange for the clocks corruption to land where it doesn't case problems. When paired with a $FF data byte, it doesn't create weak bits on the disc surface, and the controller actually seems to skip over it on read.</p></div></blockquote><div><div><div><ul><li>The write I/O path, by some stroke of good fortune, resets the clocks byte to $FF on every write I/O callback.

There's a pipeline of bytes from the external data register to the internal bit processor data byte register to the actual output pulse machinery. This needs to be accounted for.</li></ul><p>Combined, these quirks convince me that I'd have never gotten this going, or gotten close, without a thoroughly reverse engineered and disassembled ROM.</p></div><h3>Other successes and failures</h3><p>Other things enabled or demonstrated based on careful reading of the ROM code:</p><div><ul><li>beebjit now has a much more accurate 8271 driver.</li><li>Unexplained weirdness trying to read a sector with logical track id $FF has been explained as an integer overflow in the bad tracks handling.</li><li>Sectors on a non-zero physical track, but with a zero logical track id, were believed "impossible" to read. I'm able to read them by using the "command within command" trick. Once a READ DATA command is safely underway, including having processed the seek request and gone idle, it's possible to use WRITE SPECIAL REGISTER to change R7 (command param 1, which is the requested track) to zero, and have the sector read fine. The issue is that references to logical track 0 in the seek code are always treated as a mandate to find physical track 0. You need to bypass that.</li></ul><p>Things not achieved:</p></div><div><ul><li>Reading or writing MFM (double density) -- looks fundamentally impossible. Does not appear to be a capability in the hard-wired bit processor.</li><li>Executing arbitrary code on the chip. This is a shame, as the byte processor is a capable CPU! Who knows what we could use a little co-processor for? Things making this hard include:</li><ul><li>Separation of code and data in separate address spaces.</li><li>No references to the stack possible outside of CALL and RET.</li><li>Indirect jump targets stored in a read-only PLA. (Microsoft CFG? :)</li><li>... and yes, curiously, these accidental defenses all sound similar to defensive technologies investigated or deployed since year 2000. So, the 1970s called and...</li></ul></ul></div><h3>Summary</h3><div><p>The 8271 has exceeded our expectations! Where to start? It's a massive chip, encompassing dual cores and a Javascript like execution model. Remember, this was the mid-1970s. Its general purpose CPU runs an Intel instruction set architecture that I don't believe has been publicly documented until now. It's not every day we get the treat of a new Intel ISA.</p><p>We never got to the bottom of the crazy test mode that started this whole investigation. There's no trace of it in the byte processor ROM, so it must be handled by some other component on the silicon. Something to investigate for another day perhaps.</p><p>Having seen the complexity of the chip, I must confess to a feeling of surprise every time my BBC Micro successfully loads a disc.</p></div><h3>Epilogue</h3></div><p>Given the 8271 issues with cost, heat, supply chain, complexity, and lack of MFM, it wouldn't be surprising if Intel had had enough with the architecture behind the 8271 and 8273. Intel staggered bravely forward with the 8272, which introduced MFM support and... hang on, let's have a look at a decapitated one of those...</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bLL4fL5BMLc/X6-ChZErYDI/AAAAAAAAzRE/StqRSrHBHyUeP4ggl-9EdGZi9cNFKoL8gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1622/8271_nec_8272.jpg"><img data-original-height="537" data-original-width="1622" height="212" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bLL4fL5BMLc/X6-ChZErYDI/AAAAAAAAzRE/StqRSrHBHyUeP4ggl-9EdGZi9cNFKoL8gCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h212/8271_nec_8272.jpg" width="640"></a></td></tr><tr><td>Left to right: Intel 8271, NEC D765, Intel 8272</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This is very cheeky!

<p>It’s Nobel Prize week, and the work behind mRNA COVID-19 vaccines has just <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2023/press-release/">earned the physiology or medicine prize</a>. But this is Retraction Watch, so that’s not what this post is about.</p>



<p>A Nobel prize-winning researcher whose publications have come under scrutiny has retracted his <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dSemenza%252c%2bGregg%2bL">10th paper</a> for issues with the data and images.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/gregg-semenza">Gregg Semenza</a>, a professor of genetic medicine and director of the vascular program at Johns Hopkins’ Institute for Cell Engineering in Baltimore, shared the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2019/semenza/facts/">2019 Nobel prize</a> in physiology or medicine for “discoveries of how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pseudonymous sleuth Claire Francis had flagged possibly duplicated or manipulated images in Semenza’s publications on <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=gregg+l+semenza">PubPeer</a> before 2019, and other sleuths posted more beginning in October 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last September, Semenza and his co-authors <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/03/nobel-prize-winner-gregg-semenza-retracts-four-papers/">pulled four papers</a> from <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. Another <em>PNAS</em> paper, one in <em>Oncogene</em>, and two from the <em>Journal of Biological Chemistry</em> were retracted over the past year, with each notice stating that Semenza requested or agreed to the retractions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, <em>Molecular Cancer Research</em> has retracted another of the Nobelist’s articles,&nbsp; “<a href="https://aacrjournals.org/mcr/article/11/5/456/89397/Procollagen-Lysyl-Hydroxylase-2-Is-Essential-for">Procollagen Lysyl Hydroxylase 2 Is Essential for Hypoxia-Induced Breast Cancer Metastasis</a>,” which appeared in 2013. The article has been cited 181 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a 2011 retraction for a paper co-authored with <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?s=Naoki+Mori">Naoki Mori</a> – who with <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dNaoki%2bMori">31 retractions</a> sits at No. 24 on our <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/">leaderboard</a> – today’s retraction makes 10 for Semenza. More <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03032-9">may be on the way</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/mcr/article/21/10/1120/729213/Retraction-Procollagen-Lysyl-Hydroxylase-2-Is">notice</a> states:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This article (1) has been retracted at the request of the authors. The authors found that lanes 4, 5, and 6 of the HIF-1α immunoblot in Fig. 3A are identical images. An internal review corroborated the authors’ claim, and the editors agreed with the authors’ retraction request. The authors apologize to the scientific community and deeply regret any inconveniences or challenges resulting from the publication and subsequent retraction of this article.</p>



<p>A copy of this Retraction Notice was sent to the last known email addresses for all authors. Four authors (Denis Wirtz, Carmen C. Wong, Daniele M. Gilkes, and Gregg L. Semenza) agreed to the retraction; the 3 remaining authors could not be located.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Semenza did not immediately respond to our request for comment. Johns Hopkins would not comment on whether they were investigating the matter when a reporter from <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/health/bs-hs-gregg-semenza-retractions-20230801-2wv7kspmq5awfes3omkacb4bpy-story.html"><em>The Baltimore Sun</em> asked this summer</a>.</p>



<p>In October 2020, a PubPeer user <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/23FCB85FEAF061E1677BF705DFC91D#1">commented</a> that the lanes of the figure identified in the retraction notice were “much more similar than expected.” The first author, Daniele M. Gilkes, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/23FCB85FEAF061E1677BF705DFC91D#3">responded</a> by posting an image of the “original uncropped version.” Another commenter raised more concerns about the image, but Gilkes did not respond again.&nbsp;</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.glyph.im/2024/02/let-me-tell-you-a-secret.html">https://blog.glyph.im/2024/02/let-me-tell-you-a-secret.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39378342">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>I do consulting<sup id="fnref:1:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2"><a href="#fn:1:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2" id="fnref:1">1</a></sup> on software architecture, network protocol development,
python software infrastructure, streamlined cloud deployment, and open source
strategy, among other nerdy things.  I enjoy solving challenging, complex
technical problems or contributing to the open source commons. On the best
jobs, I get to do both.</p>
<p>Today I would like to share with you a secret of the software technology
consulting trade.</p>
<p>I should note that this secret is not specific to me. I have several colleagues
who have also done software consulting and have reflected versions of this
experience back to me.<sup id="fnref:2:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2"><a href="#fn:2:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2" id="fnref:2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>We’ll get to the secret itself in a moment, but first, some background.</p>
<hr>
<p>Companies do not go looking for consulting when things are going great.  This
is particularly true when looking for high-level consulting on things like
system architecture or strategy.  Almost by definition, there’s a problem that
I have been brought in to solve.  Ideally, that problem is a technical
challenge.</p>
<p>In the software industry, your team probably already has some software
professionals with a variety of technical skills, and thus they know what to do
with technical challenges.  Which means that, as often as not, the problem is
to do with <em>people</em> rather than technology, even it appears otherwise.</p>
<p>When you hire a staff-level professional like myself to address your software
team’s general problems, that consultant will need to gather some information.
If I am that consultant and I start to suspect that the purported technology
problem that you’ve got is in fact a people problem, here is what I am going to
do.</p>
<p>I am going to go get a pen and a pad of paper, then schedule a 90-minute
meeting with the most senior IC<sup id="fnref:3:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2"><a href="#fn:3:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2" id="fnref:3">3</a></sup> engineer that you have on your team. I will
bring that pen and paper to the meeting.  I will then ask one question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is fucked up about this place?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will then write down their response in as much detail as I can manage.  If I
have begun to suspect that this meeting is necessary, 90 minutes is typically
not enough time, and I will struggle to keep up.  Even so, I will usually
manage to capture the highlights.</p>
<p>One week later, I will schedule a meeting with executive leadership, and during
that meeting, I will read back a <em>very</em> lightly edited<sup id="fnref:4:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2"><a href="#fn:4:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2" id="fnref:4">4</a></sup> version of the
transcript of the previous meeting.  This is then routinely praised as a keen
strategic insight.</p>
<hr>
<p>I should pause here to explicitly note that — obviously, I hope — this is not
an oblique reference to any current or even recent client; if I’d had this
meeting recently it would be pretty awkward to answer that “so, I read your
blog…” email.<sup id="fnref:5:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2"><a href="#fn:5:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2" id="fnref:5">5</a></sup> But talking about clients in this way, no matter how
obfuscated and vague the description, is always a bit professionally risky.  So
why risk it?</p>
<p>The thing is, I’m not a people manager.  While I <em>can</em> do this kind of work,
and I do not begrudge doing it if it is the thing that needs doing, I find it
stressful and unfulfilling. I am a technology guy, not a people person.  This
is generally true of people who elect to go into technology consulting; we know
where the management track is, and we didn’t pick it.</p>
<p>If you are going to hire me for my highly specialized technical expertise, I
want you to get the maximum value out of it.  I know my value; my rates are not
low, and I do not want clients to come away with the sense that I only had a
couple of “obvious” meetings.</p>
<p>So the intended audience for this piece is potential clients, leaders of teams
(or organizations, or companies) who have a general technology problem and are
wondering if they need a consultant with my skill-set to help them fix it.
Before you decide that your issue is the need to implement a complex
distributed system consensus algorithm, check if that is really what’s at
issue.  Talk to your ICs, and — taking care to make sure they understand that
you want honest feedback and that they are safe to offer it — ask them what
problems your organization has.</p>
<p>During this meeting it is important to <em>only listen</em>.  Especially if you’re at
a small company and you are regularly involved in the day-to-day operations,
you might feel immediately defensive.  Sit with that feeling, and process it
later.  Don’t unload your emotional state on an employee you have power
over.<sup id="fnref:6:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2"><a href="#fn:6:let-me-tell-you-a-secret-2024-2" id="fnref:6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>“Only listening” doesn’t exclusively mean “don’t push back”.  You also
shouldn’t be committing to fixing anything.  While the information you are
gathering in these meetings is extremely valuable, and you should probably act
on more of it than you will initially want to, your ICs won’t have the full
picture.  They really may not understand why certain priorities are set the way
they are.  You’ll need to take <em>that</em> as feedback for improving internal comms
rather than “fixing” the perceived problem, and you certainly don’t want to
make empty promises.</p>
<p>If you have these conversations directly, you can get something from it that no
consultant can offer you: credibility.  If you can actively listen, the
conversation alone can improve morale.  People like having their concerns
heard.  If, better still, you manage to make meaningful changes to <em>address</em>
the concerns you’ve heard about, you can inspire true respect.</p>
<p>As a consultant, I’m going to be seen as some random guy wasting their time
with a meeting.  Even if you make the changes I recommend, it won’t resonate
the same way as someone remembering that they <em>personally</em> told you what was
wrong, and you took it seriously and fixed it.</p>
<p>Once you know what the problems are with your organization, and you’ve got
solid technical understanding that you really <em>do</em> need that event-driven
distributed systems consensus algorithm implemented using Twisted, I’m
absolutely your guy.  Feel free to <a href="mailto:consulting@glyph.im">get in touch</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
     
    <p>
	Air Canada has been ordered to compensate a B.C. man because its chatbot gave him inaccurate information.</p>
<p>
	The Civil Resolution Tribunal's decision on the dispute was <a href="https://decisions.civilresolutionbc.ca/crt/crtd/en/item/525448/index.do" target="_blank">posted online Wednesday</a>, finding in favour of a man who relied on information provided by the bot about fares when he was booking a flight to attend his grandmother's funeral.</p>
<p>
	"I find Air Canada did not take reasonable care to ensure its chatbot was accurate," tribunal member Christopher C. Rivers wrote, awarding $650.88 in damages for negligent misrepresentation.</p>
<p>
	"Negligent misrepresentation can arise when a seller does not exercise reasonable care to ensure its representations are accurate and not misleading," the decision explains.</p>
<p>
	Jake Moffatt was booking a flight to Toronto and asked the bot about the airline's bereavement rates – reduced fares provided in the event someone needs to travel due to the death of an immediate family member.</p>
<p>
	Moffatt said he was told that these fares could be claimed retroactively by completing a refund application within 90 days of the date the ticket was issued, and submitted a screenshot of his conversation with the bot as evidence supporting this claim.</p>
<p>
	He submitted his request, accompanied by his grandmother's death certificate, in November of 2022 – less than a week after he purchased his ticket. But his application was denied and the tribunal decision said emails submitted as evidence showed that Moffatt's attempts to receive a partial refund continued for another two-and-a-half months.</p>
<p>
	The airline refused the refund because it said its policy was that bereavement fare could not, in fact, be claimed retroactively.</p>
<p>
	In February of 2023, Moffatt sent the airline a screenshot of his conversation with the chatbot and received a response in which Air Canada "admitted the chatbot had provided 'misleading words.'"</p>
<p>
	But Moffatt was still unable to get a partial refund, prompting him to file the claim with the tribunal.</p>
<p>
	Air Canada, for its part, argued that it could not be held liable for information provided by the bot.</p>
<p>
	"In effect, Air Canada suggests the chatbot is a separate legal entity that is responsible for its own actions. This is a remarkable submission. While a chatbot has an interactive component, it is still just a part of Air Canada’s website," Rivers wrote.</p>
<p>
	"It should be obvious to Air Canada that it is responsible for all the information on its website. It makes no difference whether the information comes from a static page or a chatbot."</p>
<p>
	The airline also argued that the chatbot's response to Moffatt's inquiry included a link to a section of its website that outlined the company's policy and said that requests for a discounted fare are not allowed after someone has travelled.</p>
<p>
	Rivers rejected this argument as well.</p>
<p>
	"While Air Canada argues Mr. Moffatt could find the correct information on another part of its website, it does not explain why the webpage titled 'Bereavement travel' was inherently more trustworthy than its chatbot. It also does not explain why customers should have to double-check information found in one part of its website on another part of its website," he wrote.</p>
<p>
	"Mr. Moffatt says, and I accept, that they relied upon the chatbot to provide accurate information. I find that was reasonable in the circumstances. There is no reason why Mr. Moffatt should know that one section of Air Canada’s webpage is accurate, and another is not."</p>
<p>
	The compensation the tribunal awarded was the equivalent of the difference between what Moffatt paid for his flight and a discounted bereavement fare.</p>
<p>
	In addition, the airline was ordered to pay $36.14 in pre-judgment interest and $125 in fees.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Copying a file across devices is painful. You’re on your phone, but you want to access a file that’s on your laptop. How do you do it? What about the other way around? What about copying any file between any of your devices? I asked my dad how he copies a file from his phone to his computer, and he replied with: “through mail attachments, or I use WeTransfer if it’s too big.”. If you had asked me 5 years ago, I would’ve said: “through Dropbox”. Obviously, all fair solutions to this common problem, but I want to make it a little harder. Instead, I’ll be looking for the easiest and laziest way, to copy a file between devices. On top of that, I’ll add a couple of rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I can’t use an account from an existing online service (like Dropbox, Google Drive, WeTransfer, email drafts, etc.).</li>
  <li>It needs to be useable for a non-technical person</li>
  <li>Its flow has to be consistent across platforms</li>
</ol>

<p>Relevant XKCD:</p>

<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/file_transfer.png" alt="img"></p>

<h3 id="impossible">“Impossible”</h3>
<p>Now, you’re looking at the ruleset and think to yourself: “this is impossible”. If I however search online for my predicament - specifically “how do I copy a file from my <em>phone</em> to my laptop” - a Google Support page comes up which reads: “through a USB-cable” [1]. Fair enough, but what about copying it from phone to phone, or laptop to laptop. I can’t use a USB cable in that case; I would have to use an SD-card or a USB-stick.</p>

<p>Another route is Bluetooth, that feature you accidentally turn on from the Android top menu that drains batteries really fast. It might make sense, but the whole pairing feels complex, and unusable for the normal day-to-day user.</p>

<p>If I made an overview of some of the most popular file-sharing technologies out there, and other tools which I’ve used in the past, and test if they match the rules, this would be the list:</p>

* WeTransfer has an anonymous upload function, so it does scratch that itch.</p>

<p>** Whatsapp up until recently had the ability to send messages to yourself. Practically allowing file uploads to yourself. However, for some reason this doesn’t work anymore.</p>

<h3 id="in-an-ideal-world-">In an ideal world …</h3>
<p>… I would’ve been able to open op my phone, tap on a file from the file explorer, and hit share. A device from within my own network would show up, to which I can copy said file. In my personal situation this means: opening up the “Files” app from an Android phone. This “Files” app is actually opening up “Google Files”, and naturally that app wants you to use Google Drive, which breaks rule number 1. Besides, if I start out from my Ubuntu laptop there’s no share button, and no Google Drive.</p>

<p>I could obviously suck it up and install Google Drive, but for this particular use case I don’t want to. Which brings me to the following issue:</p>

<h3 id="no-junk-in-the-middle">No junk in the middle</h3>
<p>Another rule I want to add is: “no junk in the middle”. The problem with most file sharing services is that they leave junk behind. Especially the online services like Dropbox, WeTransfer and Google Drive. All of them use storage servers to temporarily or permanently store files. For a use-case which merely revolves around sharing files from one of <em>your</em> devices to another one of your devices, it feels redundant to also have that file stored in the “middle”. Or in other words: leave junk behind.</p>

<p>F.e.: if I were to use Dropbox, the flow would be as such:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open up Dropbox (either through a file explorer, or the app).</li>
  <li>Add a file and wait for it to sync.</li>
  <li>Open up Dropbox on the other device and see the file appear.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s take a look at another flow, like using mail attachments:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open up a mail provider and sign-in on device 1.</li>
  <li>Create a draft, and add an attachment.</li>
  <li>Open up that same mail provider on device 2, and download the file from the drafts.</li>
</ol>

<p>Psychologically speaking, a user has successfully achieved its goal after the file arrives at the other device. Cleaning it up afterwards feels like an extra step, and in some cases it is kind of a hard step. In both cases, the file that’s uploaded will either be stuck forever in Dropbox’s folder (or until the user becomes inactive for over quite some time) or it will be stuck in the drafts folder of somebody’s mail service, until they decide to delete it.</p>

<p>Considering that nowadays in The Netherlands huge data parks are required for storing files either permanently or temporarily, which in their turn create all sorts of energy and political problems, I think we do need to take this behavior into account.</p>

<p>If we update the original list above with “4. No junk in the middle”, we get:</p>

<p><br>
For some of these services like WhatsApp or Apple’s Airdrop I’m not sure if there’s a storage provider in the middle. In the case of WeTransfer’s anonymous file transfer, a file persists for seven days. This is not ideal, but it’s slightly better than the alternatives.</p>

<h3 id="a-solution">A solution</h3>
<p>I would like to start out that this merely solves a problem I personally face in my day-to-day life. So, considering the solution needs to be cross-platform the easiest way to get something up and running would be through a web browser.</p>

<p>From the browser there are a couple of things that I can try. Let me say that one of the rules isn’t file size, and neither does it have to be efficient. The dumbest thing I can come up with is the URL itself. A GET-request has an upper limit of 8 kB (or 8192 bytes). This is not a lot, but I could turn a file into a binary-octet stream and read it from the URL. A simple example link would look like such: <a download="file.txt" href="data:application/octet-stream;charset=utf-8;base64,Zm9vIGJhcg==">text file</a>, or in code:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&lt;a</span> <span>download=</span><span>"file.txt"</span> <span>href=</span><span>"data:application/octet-stream;charset=utf-8;base64,Zm9vIGJhcg=="</span><span>&gt;</span>
  text file
<span>&lt;/a&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>All we would have to do here is create a simple HTML page with an upload input, add a file below 7 kB, turn it into a base64 string and copy it over to the receiving end through the URL. On the receiving end, it has to dynamically create a link element, parse the URL and put whatever is in there to the ‘href’ attribute. It’s cross-platform, it’s dumb and easy to use, but the 8 kB is a bit of a restriction. What if my file is bigger than 8 kB?</p>

<p>If I ignore the idiocy of using links to share small files, what this does teach me is that you can turn a file into text, and specifically into a downloadable link. Writing the most minimum of JavaScript, this seems to work as well:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>fileBytes</span> <span>=</span> <span>"</span><span>foo bar</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>file</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>File</span><span>([</span><span>fileBytes</span><span>],</span> <span>{</span> <span>type</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>octet/stream</span><span>"</span> <span>});</span>
<span>const</span> <span>url</span> <span>=</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>URL</span><span>.</span><span>createObjectURL</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>);</span>
<span>const</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>a</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
<span>a</span><span>.</span><span>href</span> <span>=</span> <span>url</span><span>;</span>
<span>a</span><span>.</span><span>download</span> <span>=</span> <span>"</span><span>file.txt</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
<span>a</span><span>.</span><span>innerHTML</span> <span>=</span> <span>"</span><span>text file</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
<span>// TODO: add 'a' to the DOM.</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Demo: </strong></p>





<p>All I would have to solve next is a way to send a lot of bytes from one client to the other, without leaving a mess in the middle. A way out could be websockets; it would allow me to stream more than 8 kB of data between clients, but it does require an entire websocket handler. In other words; a server that manages the websocket connections.</p>

<h3 id="websockets-a-love-story">Websockets, a love story</h3>
<p>Web browsers these days have websocket [3] functionality. For this to work, I’ll need to host a socket handler somewhere within my own network. Each websocket client will be able to connect to the websocket server from their respected devices, and are able to communicate to each other. In other words, send bytes from one to the other. A socket handler in Go looks roughly like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> <span>(</span>
	<span>static</span> <span>"github.com/gin-contrib/static"</span>
	<span>"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"</span>
	<span>"gopkg.in/olahol/melody.v1"</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>r</span> <span>:=</span> <span>gin</span><span>.</span><span>Default</span><span>()</span>
	<span>m</span> <span>:=</span> <span>melody</span><span>.</span><span>New</span><span>()</span>

	<span>r</span><span>.</span><span>Use</span><span>(</span><span>static</span><span>.</span><span>Serve</span><span>(</span><span>"/"</span><span>,</span> <span>static</span><span>.</span><span>LocalFile</span><span>(</span><span>"./public"</span><span>,</span> <span>true</span><span>)))</span>

	<span>r</span><span>.</span><span>GET</span><span>(</span><span>"/ws"</span><span>,</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>c</span> <span>*</span><span>gin</span><span>.</span><span>Context</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>m</span><span>.</span><span>HandleRequest</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>.</span><span>Writer</span><span>,</span> <span>c</span><span>.</span><span>Request</span><span>)</span>
	<span>})</span>

	<span>m</span><span>.</span><span>HandleMessage</span><span>(</span><span>func</span><span>(</span><span>s</span> <span>*</span><span>melody</span><span>.</span><span>Session</span><span>,</span> <span>msg</span> <span>[]</span><span>byte</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>m</span><span>.</span><span>BroadcastOthers</span><span>(</span><span>msg</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span>
	<span>})</span>

	<span>r</span><span>.</span><span>Run</span><span>(</span><span>":8080"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I’m using two frameworks in the example above, Gin and Melody, meaning I’ve officially been cancelled from the Go community. In my defense, I didn’t want to be going through the whole pain of implementing a websocket server from scratch, purely for trying something out. There are tons of other websocket servers out there, but because I’m currently learning Go, this is the one I picked.</p>

<p>The client-side code is where it gets rather complicated, because to make this work a couple of things need to be kept in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I can’t send a lot of data over the websocket server above, so each file needs to be sliced into pieces.</li>
  <li>The file pieces need to be stitched back together on the receiving end.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sending-files"><em>Sending files</em></h3>
<p>Sending a file over a websocket is not that complicated if we have to stick to the aforementioned rules. JavaScript has introduced the <code>slice()</code> function to <code>File</code>, and there’s a <code>FileReader()</code> API I can make use of. Firstly, I need to make sure to chunk the file into pieces:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// Assuming there's a multipart input element in the html body:</span>
<span>const</span> <span>chunkSize</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span> <span>*</span> <span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>1024</span><span>;</span>

<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>file</span> <span>of</span> <span>input</span><span>.</span><span>files</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>pointer</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>pointer</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>file</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>const</span> <span>slice</span> <span>=</span> <span>file</span><span>.</span><span>slice</span><span>(</span><span>pointer</span><span>,</span> <span>pointer</span> <span>+</span> <span>chunkSize</span><span>);</span>

        <span>pointer</span> <span>+=</span> <span>chunkSize</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If I have, for example, a file that’s 7 MB, this code will chunk it into slices of 5 MB and 2 MB. The slice method will try to take 5 MB of the end for the 2nd part, but it will read until the end (there’s no need to recalculate the offset).</p>

<p>Secondly, I can read the slice into memory like such:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>readChunk</span><span>(</span><span>blob</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>fr</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>FileReader</span><span>();</span>

    <span>fr</span><span>.</span><span>readAsArrayBuffer</span><span>(</span><span>blob</span><span>);</span>
    <span>fr</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>load</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>const</span> <span>buffer</span> <span>=</span> <span>fr</span><span>.</span><span>result</span><span>;</span>
        <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>Array</span><span>.</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Uint8Array</span><span>(</span><span>buffer</span><span>)));</span>
    <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The reason why I’m converting it into an array is because I’ll be sending it over a websocket later on, and this makes it a bit easier when converting it to JSON, and reading it back.</p>

<p>In the demo below I’m combining both the code snippets from above (feel free to inspect the source).</p>



<pre id="demo1-result"></pre>



<p>You can add some files and see the result of the chunking. As you can see, it reads the chunks randomly (unless you added a file that’s below 5 MB).</p>

<h3 id="receiving-files"><em>Receiving files</em></h3>
<p>Receiving files and stitching them back together is a bit strange in JavaScript. As you can see from the demo above, file parts are chunked randomly. Because of this, when stitching the parts back together, you have to retain the order, else the file ends up corrupted on the other side. The next demo is going to look a bit odd, but all this does is echo a file you upload back to yourself, all from within JavaScript.</p>

<p>See it as a really expensive way of doing:</p>





<pre id="demo2-result"></pre>



<p>Magical? Isn’t it. Technically, what is happening here is the following: files are being added to a form, they’re chunked and read into memory. Every chunk is being added to a ‘files’ object, and when all the chunks have been read, it reassembles the file back together and turns the file into a URL which can be downloaded by the browser. The full code for the demo looks as follows:</p>

<p>Now, all that is left is including some WebSocket functionality to send and receive the bytes. I need to increase the size of the buffers in the websocket server to make sure it can fit 5 MB parts, or stick to the default buffer sizes and instead make tiny 128 kB parts. I’m not sure what the best way is, but I went with the former.</p>

<p>After some tweaking I ended up with a solution that works for me, but how does it exactly hold up if I test it against my own rules? The following table appears:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Tool</th>
      <th>1</th>
      <th>2</th>
      <th>3</th>
      <th>4</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Custom websocket solution</td>
      <td>✓</td>
      <td>❌</td>
      <td>~</td>
      <td>✓</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


<p>At this point, it is impossible to use for a non-technical person. I can spend quite some time on designing a really nice interface, but the key issue here is that the backend needs to be self-hosted, which are solutions normal users never ever want to think about. I can however think about using a tool like Socketsbay [4] or Postman Websockets [5] to act as the socket server. Likewise, there are probably other paid and non-paid alternatives out there.</p>

<h3 id="concluding">Concluding</h3>
<p>Copying a file across your own personal devices is still painful. The flow is inconsistent between devices, some tools are available on one device and not the other, and most of them leave junk behind. Web browsers become like cross-platform Swiss army knives, and the file API’s I explored that are available are honestly fascinating. Websockets proved a good enough solution for my own personal pain. However, time-wise it might have been faster to rummage through that one kitchen drawer to find a USB-stick, SD-card or USB-cable.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p> Tagged as <a href="https://daninus14.github.io/tag/lisp.html">lisp</a>, <a href="https://daninus14.github.io/tag/common-lisp.html">common-lisp</a>, <a href="https://daninus14.github.io/tag/conference.html">conference</a> </p> <p> Written on 2024-02-13 14:08:59 </p> <p>This question is always asked. My thoughts are a little bit different than what I've read online.</p>

<p>I think the real reason may be because of the fact that <strong>there is</strong> a standard. Yes, you read that correctly.</p>

<p>The great benefit of a standard is that no matter what implementation you use, if they follow the standard, and your code follows the standard, you should have portable code between implementations. Further, and probably the greatest benefit, is that we don't have to worry about backwards compatibility. Code from about 40 years ago (yeah, even before the standard!) still runs today (I don't have a link at hand, but it was one of those popular lisp posts that I'm sure you can easily find) by simply importing a package. </p>

<p>However, a standard comes with a cost. The cost is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility">diffusion of responsibility</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The diffusion of responsibility refers to the decreased responsibility of action each member of a group feels when they are part of a group.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What we are lacking is a body or organization who will take on the responsibility of promoting common lisp.</p>

<p>Take a look at the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf-landing/">Python Foundation</a> for example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Python Software Foundation is an organization devoted to advancing open source technology related to the Python programming language.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And where do they get their <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/sponsorship/">money from</a>?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>PyCon US typically generates over 65% of the PSF’s revenue. With PyCon US 2020 and 2021 happening virtually, the PSF may lose $1.2 million USD of expected revenue for those two years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if there are different groups or individuals trying to promote CL, what we really need is one person who will lead a main CL only conference which is not just an <a href="https://www.european-lisp-symposium.org/">academic conference</a>. The purpose of the conference is both in itself to promote CL and serve as a place for CL companies, users, and implementors to get together, and <em>also</em> for fundraising for the organization.</p>

<p>Those funds can then be used to address the biggest issues plaguing CL, it seems from time immemorial, namely documentation and marketing. Marketing includes presenting the documentation in both an easy to understand and pleasant way, and also producing thorough and detailed references.</p>

<p>Further, the funds can be used to address anything lacking in the ecosystem for which there has not been a serious enough effort to provide a solution, and for which a solution could be provided with a given financial investment. I am sure there are <em>many</em> common lisp developers out there who would be thrilled to create common lisp projects that are robust and for the benefit of the community, if they had the financial support to be able to do it.</p>

<p>As an example of this, take a look at a new language: Julia. They have what looks like a <a href="https://juliacon.org/2024/">popular conference</a>, and a <a href="https://julialang.org/research/#sponsors">bunch of sponsors</a>. The Sloan Foundation by itself <a href="https://sloan.org/grant-detail/7999">gave almost 1 million USD in 2017</a>.</p>

<p>Another example is Racket, which is also covered in the academic conference mentioned above, and they even have two conferences! An <a href="https://con.racket-lang.org/">official one</a>, and <a href="https://racketfest.com/">another</a> one from the users.</p>

<p>So in conclusion, we need an organization which will aggressively work to fundraise for Common Lisp in order to promote the usage of the language by providing solutions to ecosystem issues that no one is taking care of in a robust enough way.</p>
