<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>We recently gave Claude Opus 4 and 4.1 the ability to end conversations in our consumer chat interfaces. This ability is intended for use in rare, extreme cases of persistently harmful or abusive user interactions. This feature was developed primarily as part of our exploratory work on potential AI welfare, though it has broader relevance to model alignment and safeguards.</p><p>We remain highly uncertain about the potential moral status of Claude and other LLMs, now or in the future. However, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/exploring-model-welfare">we take the issue seriously</a>, and alongside our research program we’re working to identify and implement low-cost interventions to mitigate risks to model welfare, in case such welfare is possible. Allowing models to end or exit potentially distressing interactions is one such intervention.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude-4-model-card">pre-deployment testing of Claude Opus 4</a>, we included a preliminary model welfare assessment. As part of that assessment, we investigated Claude’s self-reported and behavioral preferences, and found a robust and consistent aversion to harm. This included, for example, requests from users for sexual content involving minors and attempts to solicit information that would enable large-scale violence or acts of terror. Claude Opus 4 showed:</p><ul><li>A strong preference against engaging with harmful tasks;</li><li>A pattern of apparent distress when engaging with real-world users seeking harmful content; and</li><li>A tendency to end harmful conversations when given the ability to do so in simulated user interactions.</li></ul><p>These behaviors primarily arose in cases where users <em>persisted</em> with harmful requests and/or abuse despite Claude repeatedly refusing to comply and attempting to productively redirect the interactions.</p><p>Our implementation of Claude’s ability to end chats reflects these findings while continuing to prioritize user wellbeing. Claude is directed not to use this ability in cases where users might be at imminent risk of harming themselves or others.</p><p>In all cases, Claude is only to use its conversation-ending ability as a last resort when multiple attempts at redirection have failed and hope of a productive interaction has been exhausted, or when a user explicitly asks Claude to end a chat (the latter scenario is illustrated in the figure below). The scenarios where this will occur are extreme edge cases—the vast majority of users will not notice or be affected by this feature in any normal product use, even when discussing highly controversial issues with Claude.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1940" height="1304" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F77f187335e1266bffc59353c064f1d9c6de51cfa-1940x1304.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 1x, https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F77f187335e1266bffc59353c064f1d9c6de51cfa-1940x1304.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F77f187335e1266bffc59353c064f1d9c6de51cfa-1940x1304.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Claude demonstrating the ending of a conversation in response to a user’s request. When Claude ends a conversation, the user can start a new chat, give feedback, or edit and retry previous messages.</figcaption></figure></div><p>When Claude chooses to end a conversation, the user will no longer be able to send new messages in that conversation. However, this will not affect other conversations on their account, and they will be able to start a new chat immediately. To address the potential loss of important long-running conversations, users will still be able to edit and retry previous messages to create new branches of ended conversations.</p><p>We’re treating this feature as an ongoing experiment and will continue refining our approach. If users encounter a surprising use of the conversation-ending ability, we encourage them to submit feedback by reacting to Claude’s message with Thumbs or using the dedicated “Give feedback” button.</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

It's not a temporary bug, but another consequence of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/visa-mastercard-steam-censorship-valve-itchio-gta/?" target="_blank">Steam's ongoing battle</a> with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/615910/itchio-steam-sex-adult-games-delisting-pulled-vice-controversy/" target="_blank">payment processors like Visa and Mastercard</a>.</p>    <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! --><!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! --><p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-explain-why-using-paypal-for-steam-purchases-isnt-currently-an-option-in-a-whole-bunch-of-countries" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">In a quote provided to Rock Paper Shotgun</a>, Valve clarified that the disappearance of PayPal is related to offering specific types of "content on Steam," much like the issue "surrounding Mastercard."</p>    <p>"In this case, one of PayPal’s acquiring banks decided to stop processing any Steam transactions, which cut off PayPal on Steam for a number of currencies," a rep said.</p>    <p>PayPal isn't gone for everyone; I just tried checking out a game, and could log into PayPal just fine. As of early July, the currencies that can still use PayPal on Steam include EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD and USD. While this means many major currencies still have the option, this change will likely affect a lot of people around the world.</p>    <p>PayPal has also pulled out of some parts of Steam despite the platform's decision to delist a wide swath of adult-oriented games. That crackdown was due to pressure from payment processors and an anti-violence against women group called Collective Shout, which has organized campaigns to limit the sales of series like Grand Theft Auto. Amid all of these actions, payment processors insist that if the product is legal, they do not tell vendors what they can or cannot sell. Valve, however, has said that the encouragement to reconsider what types of games it sells has come from intermediaries like banks, seemingly speaking on behalf of payment processors. Whatever the case, Valve's rules for platforming a game now vaguely state that the content must follow rules set forth by payment processors. The snafu has also affected other platforms like Itchio, as well as games that merely include mature themes. Steam's acquiescence to these external pressures has also led to<a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/616835/visa-mastercard-steam-itchio-campaign-adult-games/" target="_blank"> a gamer-led movement to harass payment processors</a>, if not a widespread sense of unease over the wider ramifications of the censorship.</p>    <p>The increased scrutiny around adult games also coincides with a wider push for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/youtubes-new-ai-age-verification-system-goes-into-effect-today-in-the-united-states" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">age verification measures on websites like YouTube</a> and Pornhub. If the internet at large continues to tamp down on the full spectrum of "adult content" and a person's actual identity becomes fully tied to your online presence, the possibilities for complications could become exponential.</p>    <p>Valve's hoping to restore PayPal for everyone, but cannot say when it might be back. "We are also evaluating adding additional payment methods on Steam for the customers affected by this," the Valve rep said. "In the meantime, please use one of our other current payment methods during checkout. If you can't use any of the available options, you can consider using a Steam Wallet code to add funds to your account."</p>    </div>

<p>In 2018 we brought you some <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2017/12/3500-occult-manuscripts-will-be-digitized-made-freely-available-online.html">excit­ing news</a>. Thanks to a gen­er­ous dona­tion from <em>Da Vin­ci Code</em> author Dan Brown, Amsterdam’s Rit­man Library—a siz­able col­lec­tion of pre-1900 books on alche­my, astrol­o­gy, mag­ic, and oth­er occult subjects—has been dig­i­tiz­ing thou­sands of its rare texts under a dig­i­tal edu­ca­tion project cheek­i­ly called “Her­met­i­cal­ly Open.” We are now pleased to report that <a href="http://embassyofthefreemind.com/en/library/online-catalogue/?mode=gallery&amp;view=horizontal&amp;sort=random%7B1517048201764%7D%20asc&amp;page=1&amp;fq%5B%5D=search_s_digitized_publication:%22Ja%22&amp;reverse=0&amp;filterAction">the first 2,178 books from the Rit­man project have come avail­able in their online read­ing room</a>.</p>

<p>Vis­i­tors should be aware that these books are writ­ten in sev­er­al dif­fer­ent Euro­pean lan­guages. Latin, the schol­ar­ly lan­guage of Europe through­out the Medieval and Ear­ly Mod­ern peri­ods, pre­dom­i­nates, and it’s a pecu­liar Latin at that, laden with jar­gon and alchem­i­cal ter­mi­nol­o­gy. Oth­er books appear in Ger­man, Dutch, and French. Read­ers of some or all of these lan­guages will of course have an eas­i­er time than mono­lin­gual Eng­lish speak­ers, but there is still much to offer those vis­i­tors as well.</p>


<p>In addi­tion to the plea­sure of pag­ing through an old rare book, even vir­tu­al­ly, Eng­lish speak­ers can quick­ly find a col­lec­tion of read­able books by click­ing on the “Place of Pub­li­ca­tion” search fil­ter and select­ing Cam­bridge or Lon­don, from which come such notable works as <em>The Man-Mouse Takin in a Trap, and tortur’d to death for gnaw­ing the Mar­gins of Euge­nius Phi­lalethes</em>, by Thomas Vaugh­an, pub­lished in 1650.</p>

<p>The lan­guage is archaic—full of quirky spellings and uses of the “long s”—and the con­tent is bizarre. Those famil­iar with this type of writ­ing, whether through his­tor­i­cal study or the work of more recent inter­preters like <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2025/07/an-introduction-to-aleister-crowley-historys-most-infamous-occultist.html">Aleis­ter Crow­ley</a> or Madame Blavatsky, will rec­og­nize the many for­mu­las: The trac­ing of mag­i­cal cor­re­spon­dences between flo­ra, fau­na, and astro­nom­i­cal phe­nom­e­na; the care­ful pars­ing of names; astrol­o­gy and lengthy lin­guis­tic ety­molo­gies; numero­log­i­cal dis­cours­es and philo­soph­i­cal poet­ry; ear­ly psy­chol­o­gy and per­son­al­i­ty typ­ing; cryp­tic, cod­ed mythol­o­gy and med­ical pro­ce­dures. Although we’ve grown accus­tomed through pop­u­lar media to think­ing of mag­i­cal books as cook­books, full of recipes and incan­ta­tions, the real­i­ty is far dif­fer­ent.</p>

              <p data-block-key="ojykg">We were walking to watch the sunset when a dog started barking at us from a porch. From inside, a voice called out: "Don't worry, he won't leave the porch. The electric fence hasn't worked in years, but he still won't go past it."</p><p data-block-key="ern7i">I stopped mid-step.</p><p data-block-key="6h3kl">A dog, imprisoned by a fence that only exists in his memory.</p><p data-block-key="5tkfb">The next question changed how I see everything: <b><i>What electric fences do we have in our lives?</i></b></p><h2 data-block-key="buf82">The Invisible Barrier</h2><p data-block-key="5chlk">Electric fences train dogs through graduated discomfort, first a warning beep, then a shock. Eventually, the dog learns the boundaries so well that even when the fence stops working, the memory of pain keeps them trapped. Most dogs stay placidly within their invisible prison for life.</p><p data-block-key="5gqre">But some dogs discover the secret: three seconds of discomfort leads to lasting freedom. Once they realize the fence is just an illusion maintained by memory, they never go back.</p><h2 data-block-key="26vlu">The Fences Between Us</h2><p data-block-key="1cn28">Here's what I've realized: Some of our strongest electric fences aren't keeping us from freedom, they're keeping us from each other.</p><p data-block-key="4lnf2">That voice in your head saying "Don't text them, you'll seem needy." The one whispering "They haven't reached out, so they must not care." The fear that being the one who always initiates makes you weak.</p><p data-block-key="3jsvj">These are electric fences that stopped working years ago, but we still won't cross them.

Twenty seconds to be the one who cares out loud.</p><p data-block-key="7a40v">The fence isn't there. It never was.

</span><p><span size="2" face="verdana">
July 2013<p>One of the most common types of advice we give at Y Combinator is
to do things that don't scale.  A lot of would-be founders believe
that startups either take off or don't.  You build something, make
it available, and if you've made a better mousetrap, people beat a
path to your door as promised.  Or they don't, in which case the
market must not exist.
</p><span color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><span color="#999999">1</span></a>]</span><p>Actually startups take off because the founders make them take off.
There may be a handful that just grew by themselves, but usually
it takes some sort of push to get them going.  A good metaphor would
be the cranks that car engines had before they got electric starters.
Once the engine was going, it would keep going, but there was a
separate and laborious process to get it going.</p><p><b>Recruit</b></p><p>The most common unscalable thing founders have to do at the start
is to recruit users manually.  Nearly all startups have to.  You
can't wait for users to come to you.  You have to go out and get
them.</p><p>Stripe is one of the most successful startups we've funded, and the
problem they solved was an urgent one.   If anyone could have sat
back and waited for users, it was Stripe.  But in fact they're
famous within YC for aggressive early user acquisition.</p><p>Startups building things for other startups have a big pool of
potential users in the other companies we've funded, and none took
better advantage of it than Stripe.  At YC we use the term "Collison
installation" for the technique they invented.  More diffident
founders ask "Will you try our beta?" and if the answer is yes,
they say "Great, we'll send you a link."  But the Collison brothers
weren't going to wait. When anyone agreed to try Stripe they'd say
"Right then, give me your laptop" and set them up on the spot.</p><p>There are two reasons founders resist going out and recruiting users
individually.  One is a combination of shyness and laziness.  They'd
rather sit at home writing code than go out and talk to a bunch of
strangers and probably be rejected by most of them.  But for a
startup to succeed, at least one founder (usually the CEO) will
have to spend a lot of time on sales and marketing.
</p><span color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><span color="#999999">2</span></a>]</span><p>The other reason founders ignore this path is that the absolute
numbers seem so small at first.  This can't be how the big, famous
startups got started, they think. The mistake they make is to
underestimate the power of compound growth.  We encourage every
startup to measure their progress by weekly <a href="https://paulgraham.com/growth.html">growth
rate</a>.  If you have 100 users, you need to get 10 more next week
to grow 10% a week.  And while 110 may not seem much better than
100, if you keep growing at 10% a week you'll be surprised how big
the numbers get.  After a year you'll have 14,000 users, and after
2 years you'll have 2 million.</p><p>You'll be doing different things when you're acquiring users a
thousand at a time, and growth has to slow down eventually.  But
if the market exists you can usually start by recruiting users
manually and then gradually switch to less manual methods. 
</p><span color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><span color="#999999">3</span></a>]</span><p>Airbnb is a classic example of this technique.  Marketplaces are
so hard to get rolling that you should expect to take heroic measures
at first. In Airbnb's case, these consisted of going door to door
in New York, recruiting new users and helping existing ones improve
their listings.  When I remember the Airbnbs during YC, I picture
them with rolly bags, because when they showed up for tuesday dinners
they'd always just flown back from somewhere.</p><p><b>Fragile</b></p><p>Airbnb now seems like an unstoppable juggernaut, but early on it
was so fragile that about 30 days of going out and engaging in
person with users made the difference between success and failure.</p><p>That initial fragility was not a unique feature of Airbnb.  Almost
all startups are fragile initially.  And that's one of the biggest
things inexperienced founders and investors (and reporters and
know-it-alls on forums) get wrong about them.  They unconsciously
judge larval startups by the standards of established ones.  They're
like someone looking at a newborn baby and concluding "there's no
way this tiny creature could ever accomplish anything."</p><p>It's harmless if reporters and know-it-alls dismiss your startup.
They always get things wrong.   It's even ok if investors dismiss
your startup; they'll change their minds when they see growth.  The
big danger is that you'll dismiss your startup yourself.  I've seen
it happen.  I often have to encourage founders who don't see the
full potential of what they're building.  Even Bill Gates made that
mistake.  He returned to Harvard for the fall semester after starting
Microsoft.  He didn't stay long, but he wouldn't have returned at
all if he'd realized Microsoft was going to be even a fraction of
the size it turned out to be. 
</p><span color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><span color="#999999">4</span></a>]</span><p>The question to ask about an early stage startup is not "is this
company taking over the world?"  but "how big could this company
get if the founders did the right things?"  And the right things
often seem both laborious and inconsequential at the time. Microsoft
can't have seemed very impressive when it was just a couple guys
in Albuquerque writing Basic interpreters for a market of a few
thousand hobbyists (as they were then called), but in retrospect
that was the optimal path to dominating microcomputer software.
And I know Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia didn't feel like they were
en route to the big time as they were taking "professional" photos
of their first hosts' apartments.  They were just trying to survive.
But in retrospect that too was the optimal path to dominating a big
market.</p><p>How do you find users to recruit manually?  If you build something
to solve <a href="https://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">your own problems</a>, then
you only have to find your peers, which is usually straightforward.
Otherwise you'll have to make a more deliberate effort to locate
the most promising vein of users.  The usual way to do that is to
get some initial set of users by doing a comparatively untargeted
launch, and then to observe which kind seem most enthusiastic, and
seek out more like them.  For example, Ben Silbermann noticed that
a lot of the earliest Pinterest users were interested in design,
so he went to a conference of design bloggers to recruit users, and
that worked well. 
</p><span color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><span color="#999999">5</span></a>]</span><p><b>Delight</b></p><p>You should take extraordinary measures not just to acquire users,
but also to make them happy.  For as long as they could (which
turned out to be surprisingly long), Wufoo sent each new user a
hand-written thank you note.  Your first users should feel that
signing up with you was one of the best choices they ever made.
And you in turn should be racking your brains to think of new ways
to delight them.</p><p>Why do we have to teach startups this?  Why is it counterintuitive
for founders?  Three reasons, I think.</p><p>One is that a lot of startup founders are trained as engineers,
and customer service is not part of the training of engineers.
You're supposed to build things that are robust and elegant, not
be slavishly attentive to individual users like some kind of
salesperson.  Ironically, part of the reason engineering is
traditionally averse to handholding is that its traditions date
from a time when engineers were less powerful — when they were
only in charge of their narrow domain of building things, rather
than running the whole show.  You can be ornery when you're Scotty,
but not when you're Kirk.</p><p>Another reason founders don't focus enough on individual customers
is that they worry it won't scale.  But when founders of larval
startups worry about this, I point out that in their current state
they have nothing to lose.  Maybe if they go out of their way to
make existing users super happy, they'll one day have too many to
do so much for.  That would be a great problem to have.  See if you
can make it happen.  And incidentally, when it does, you'll find
that delighting customers scales better than you expected.  Partly
because you can usually find ways to make anything scale more than
you would have predicted, and partly because delighting customers
will by then have permeated your culture.</p><p>I have never once seen a startup lured down a blind alley by trying
too hard to make their initial users happy.</p><p>But perhaps the biggest thing preventing founders from realizing
how attentive they could be to their users is that they've never
experienced such attention themselves.  Their standards for customer
service have been set by the companies they've been customers of,
which are mostly big ones.  Tim Cook doesn't send you a hand-written
note after you buy a laptop.  He can't.  But you can.  That's one
advantage of being small: you can provide a level of service no big
company can. 
</p><span color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><span color="#999999">6</span></a>]</span><p>Once you realize that existing conventions are not the upper bound
on user experience, it's interesting in a very pleasant way to think
about how far you could go to delight your users.</p><p><b>Experience</b></p><p>I was trying to think of a phrase to convey how extreme your attention
to users should be, and I realized Steve Jobs had already done it:
insanely great.  Steve wasn't just using "insanely" as a synonym
for "very."  He meant it more literally — that one should focus
on quality of execution to a degree that in everyday life would be
considered pathological.</p><p>All the most successful startups we've funded have, and that probably
doesn't surprise would-be founders.  What novice founders don't get
is what insanely great translates to in a larval startup.  When
Steve Jobs started using that phrase, Apple was already an established
company.  He meant the Mac (and its documentation and even
packaging — such is the nature of obsession) should be insanely
well designed and manufactured.  That's not hard for engineers to
grasp.  It's just a more extreme version of designing a robust and
elegant product.</p><p>What founders have a hard time grasping (and Steve himself might
have had a hard time grasping) is what insanely great morphs into
as you roll the time slider back to the first couple months of a
startup's life.  It's not the product that should be insanely great,
but the experience of being your user.  The product is just one
component of that.  For a big company it's necessarily the dominant
one.  But you can and should give users an insanely great experience
with an early, incomplete, buggy product, if you make up the
difference with attentiveness.</p><p>Can, perhaps, but should?  Yes.  Over-engaging with early users is
not just a permissible technique for getting growth rolling.  For
most successful startups it's a necessary part of the feedback loop
that makes the product good.  Making a better mousetrap is not an
atomic operation.  Even if you start the way most successful startups
have, by building something you yourself need, the first thing you
build is never quite right.  And except in domains with big penalties
for making mistakes, it's often better not to aim for perfection
initially.  In software, especially, it usually works best to get
something in front of users as soon as it has a quantum of utility,
and then see what they do with it.  Perfectionism is often an excuse
for procrastination, and in any case your initial model of users
is always inaccurate, even if you're one of them. 
</p><span color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><span color="#999999">7</span></a>]</span><p>The feedback you get from engaging directly with your earliest users
will be the best you ever get.  When you're so big you have to
resort to focus groups, you'll wish you could go over to your users'
homes and offices and watch them use your stuff like you did when
there were only a handful of them.</p><p><b>Fire</b></p><p>Sometimes the right unscalable trick is to focus on a deliberately
narrow market.  It's like keeping a fire contained at first to get
it really hot before adding more logs.</p><p>That's what Facebook did.  At first it was just for Harvard students.
In that form it only had a potential market of a few thousand people,
but because they felt it was really for them, a critical mass of
them signed up.  After Facebook stopped being for Harvard students,
it remained for students at specific colleges for quite a while.
When I interviewed Mark Zuckerberg at Startup School, he said that
while it was a lot of work creating course lists for each school,
doing that made students feel the site was their natural home.</p><p>Any startup that could be described as a marketplace usually has
to start in a subset of the market, but this can work for other
startups as well.  It's always worth asking if there's a subset of
the market in which you can get a critical mass of users quickly.
</p><span color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><span color="#999999">8</span></a>]</span><p>Most startups that use the contained fire strategy do it unconsciously.
They build something for themselves and their friends, who happen
to be the early adopters, and only realize later that they could
offer it to a broader market.  The strategy works just as well if
you do it unconsciously.  The biggest danger of not being consciously
aware of this pattern is for those who naively discard part of it.
E.g. if you don't build something for yourself and your friends,
or even if you do, but you come from the corporate world and your
friends are not early adopters, you'll no longer have a perfect
initial market handed to you on a platter.</p><p>Among companies, the best early adopters are usually other startups.
They're more open to new things both by nature and because, having
just been started, they haven't made all their choices yet.  Plus
when they succeed they grow fast, and you with them.  It was one
of many unforeseen advantages of the YC model (and specifically of
making YC big) that B2B startups now have an instant market of
hundreds of other startups ready at hand.</p><p><b>Meraki</b></p><p>For <a href="https://paulgraham.com/hw.html">hardware startups</a> there's a variant of
doing things that don't scale that we call "pulling a Meraki."
Although we didn't fund Meraki, the founders were Robert Morris's
grad students, so we know their history.  They got started by doing
something that really doesn't scale: assembling their routers
themselves.</p><p>Hardware startups face an obstacle that software startups don't.
The minimum order for a factory production run is usually several
hundred thousand dollars.  Which can put you in a catch-22: without
a product you can't generate the growth you need to raise the money
to manufacture your product.  Back when hardware startups had to
rely on investors for money, you had to be pretty convincing to
overcome this.  The arrival of crowdfunding (or more precisely,
preorders) has helped a lot.  But even so I'd advise startups to
pull a Meraki initially if they can.  That's what Pebble did.  The
Pebbles 
<a href="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/eric.jpg?t=1730199416&amp;">assembled</a>
 the first several hundred watches themselves. If
they hadn't gone through that phase, they probably wouldn't have
sold $10 million worth of watches when they did go on Kickstarter.</p><p>Like paying excessive attention to early customers, fabricating
things yourself turns out to be valuable for hardware startups.
You can tweak the design faster when you're the factory, and you
learn things you'd never have known otherwise.  Eric Migicovsky of
Pebble said one of the things he learned was "how valuable it was to
source good screws."   Who knew?</p><p><b>Consult</b></p><p>Sometimes we advise founders of B2B startups to take over-engagement
to an extreme, and to pick a single user and act as if they were
consultants building something just for that one user.   The initial
user serves as the form for your mold; keep tweaking till you fit
their needs perfectly, and you'll usually find you've made something
other users want too.  Even if there aren't many of them, there are
probably adjacent territories that have more.  As long as you can
find just one user who really needs something and can act on that
need, you've got a toehold in making something people want, and
that's as much as any startup needs initially. 
</p><span color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><span color="#999999">9</span></a>]</span><p>Consulting is the canonical example of work that doesn't scale.
But (like other ways of bestowing one's favors liberally) it's safe
to do it so long as you're not being paid to.  That's where companies
cross the line.  So long as you're a product company that's merely
being extra attentive to a customer, they're very grateful even if
you don't solve all their problems.  But when they start paying you
specifically for that attentiveness — when they start paying
you by the hour — they expect you to do everything.</p><p>Another consulting-like technique for recruiting initially lukewarm
users is to use your software yourselves on their behalf.  We
did that at Viaweb.  When we approached merchants asking if they
wanted to use our software to make online stores, some said no, but
they'd let us make one for them.  Since we would do anything to get
users, we did.  We felt pretty lame at the time.  Instead of
organizing big strategic e-commerce partnerships, we were trying
to sell luggage and pens and men's shirts.  But in retrospect it
was exactly the right thing to do, because it taught us how it would
feel to merchants to use our software.  Sometimes the feedback loop
was near instantaneous: in the middle of building some merchant's
site I'd find I needed a feature we didn't have, so I'd spend a
couple hours implementing it and then resume building the site.</p><p><b>Manual</b></p><p>There's a more extreme variant where you don't just use your software,
but are your software.  When you only have a small number of users,
you can sometimes get away with doing by hand things that you plan
to automate later.  This lets you launch faster, and when you do
finally automate yourself out of the loop, you'll know exactly what
to build because you'll have muscle memory from doing it yourself.</p><p>When manual components look to the user like software, this technique
starts to have aspects of a practical joke.  For example, the way
Stripe delivered "instant" merchant accounts to its first users was
that the founders manually signed them up for traditional merchant
accounts behind the scenes.</p><p>Some startups could be entirely manual at first. If you can find
someone with a problem that needs solving and you can solve it
manually, go ahead and do that for as long as you can, and then
gradually automate the bottlenecks.  It would be a little frightening
to be solving users' problems in a way that wasn't yet automatic,
but less frightening than the far more common case of having something
automatic that doesn't yet solve anyone's problems.</p><p><b>Big</b></p><p>I should mention one sort of initial tactic that usually doesn't
work: the Big Launch.  I occasionally meet founders who seem to
believe startups are projectiles rather than powered aircraft, and
that they'll make it big if and only if they're launched with
sufficient initial velocity.  They want to launch simultaneously
in 8 different publications, with embargoes.  And on a tuesday, of
course, since they read somewhere that's the optimum day to launch
something.</p><p>It's easy to see how little launches matter.  Think of some successful
startups.  How many of their launches do you remember?
All you need from a launch is some initial core of users.  How well
you're doing a few months later will depend more on how happy you
made those users than how many there were of them.
</p><span color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><span color="#999999">10</span></a>]</span><p>So why do founders think launches matter?  A combination of solipsism
and laziness.  They think what they're building is so great that
everyone who hears about it will immediately sign up.  Plus it would
be so much less work if you could get users merely by broadcasting
your existence, rather than recruiting them one at a time.  But
even if what you're building really is great, getting users will
always be a gradual process — partly because great things
are usually also novel, but mainly because users have other things
to think about.</p><p>Partnerships too usually don't work.  They don't work for startups
in general, but they especially don't work as a way to get growth
started.  It's a common mistake among inexperienced founders to
believe that a partnership with a big company will be their big
break.  Six months later they're all saying the same thing: that
was way more work than we expected, and we ended up getting practically
nothing out of it. 
</p><span color="#999999">[<a href="#f11n"><span color="#999999">11</span></a>]</span><p>It's not enough just to do something extraordinary initially.  You
have to make an extraordinary <i>effort</i> initially.  Any strategy
that omits the effort — whether it's expecting a big launch to
get you users, or a big partner — is ipso facto suspect.</p><p><b>Vector</b></p><p>The need to do something unscalably laborious to get started is so
nearly universal that it might be a good idea to stop thinking of
startup ideas as scalars.  Instead we should try thinking of them
as pairs of what you're going to build, plus the unscalable thing(s)
you're going to do initially to get the company going.</p><p>It could be interesting to start viewing startup ideas this way,
because now that there are two components you can try to be imaginative
about the second as well as the first.  But in most cases the second
component will be what it usually is — recruit users manually
and give them an overwhelmingly good experience — and the main
benefit of treating startups as vectors will be to remind founders
they need to work hard in two dimensions.
</p><span color="#999999">[<a href="#f12n"><span color="#999999">12</span></a>]</span><p>In the best case, both components of the vector contribute to your
company's DNA: the unscalable things you have to do to get started
are not merely a necessary evil, but change the company permanently
for the better.  If you have to be aggressive about user acquisition
when you're small, you'll probably still be aggressive when you're
big.  If you have to manufacture your own hardware, or use your
software on users's behalf, you'll learn things you couldn't have
learned otherwise.  And most importantly, if you have to work hard
to delight users when you only have a handful of them, you'll keep
doing it when you have a lot.</p><p><b>Notes</b></p><p>[</p><a name="f1n"><span color="#000000">1</span></a>]
Actually Emerson never mentioned mousetraps specifically.  He
wrote "If a man has good corn or wood, or boards, or pigs, to sell,
or can make better chairs or knives, crucibles or church organs,
than anybody else, you will find a broad hard-beaten road to his
house, though it be in the woods."<p>[</p><a name="f2n"><span color="#000000">2</span></a>]
Thanks to Sam Altman for suggesting I make this explicit.
And no, you can't avoid doing sales by hiring someone to do it for
you.  You have to do sales yourself initially.  Later you can hire
a real salesperson to replace you.<p>[</p><a name="f3n"><span color="#000000">3</span></a>]
The reason this works is that as you get bigger, your size
helps you grow.  Patrick Collison wrote "At some point, there was
a very noticeable change in how Stripe felt. It tipped from being
this boulder we had to push to being a train car that in fact had
its own momentum."<p>[</p><a name="f4n"><span color="#000000">4</span></a>]
One of the more subtle ways in which YC can help founders
is by calibrating their ambitions, because we know exactly how a
lot of successful startups looked when they were just getting
started.<p>[</p><a name="f5n"><span color="#000000">5</span></a>]
If you're building something for which you can't easily get
a small set of users to observe — e.g. enterprise software — and
in a domain where you have no connections, you'll have to rely on
cold calls and introductions.  But should you even be working on
such an idea?<p>[</p><a name="f6n"><span color="#000000">6</span></a>]
Garry Tan pointed out an interesting trap founders fall into
in the beginning.  They want so much to seem big that they imitate
even the flaws of big companies, like indifference to individual
users.  This seems to them more "professional."  Actually it's
better to embrace the fact that you're small and use whatever
advantages that brings.<p>[</p><a name="f7n"><span color="#000000">7</span></a>]
Your user model almost couldn't be perfectly accurate, because
users' needs often change in response to what you build for them.
Build them a microcomputer, and suddenly they need to run spreadsheets
on it, because the arrival of your new microcomputer causes someone
to invent the spreadsheet.<p>[</p><a name="f8n"><span color="#000000">8</span></a>]
If you have to choose between the subset that will sign up
quickest and those that will pay the most, it's usually best to
pick the former, because those are probably the early adopters.
They'll have a better influence on your product, and they won't
make you expend as much effort on sales.  And though they have less
money, you don't need that much to maintain your target growth rate
early on.<p>[</p><a name="f9n"><span color="#000000">9</span></a>]
Yes, I can imagine cases where you could end up making
something that was really only useful for one user.  But those are
usually obvious, even to inexperienced founders.  So if it's not
obvious you'd be making something for a market of one, don't worry
about that danger.<p>[</p><a name="f10n"><span color="#000000">10</span></a>]
There may even be an inverse correlation between launch
magnitude and success.  The only launches I remember are famous
flops like the Segway and Google Wave.  Wave is a particularly
alarming example, because I think it was actually a great idea that
was killed partly by its overdone launch.<p>[</p><a name="f11n"><span color="#000000">11</span></a>]
Google grew big on the back of Yahoo, but that wasn't a
partnership.  Yahoo was their customer.<p>[</p><a name="f12n"><span color="#000000">12</span></a>]
It will also remind founders that an idea where the second
component is empty — an idea where there is nothing you can do
to get going, e.g. because you have no way to find users to recruit
manually — is probably a bad idea, at least for those founders.<p><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Patrick Collison, Kevin

    <p>There's something I love about opening a text-only webpage.</p>
<p>They're a refuge from the GDPR cookie banners, the trashy ads, the email opt-ins, and the god-forsaken auto-play video.</p>
<p>A text-only webpage is clean. It's readable. It's fast and it's simple.</p>
<p>The page is just made of text, so it's infinitely reproducible.</p>
<p>You can paste the whole thing into an email to a friend. You can put it in ChatGPT to ask questions.</p>
<p><em>Hell—you can post the whole thing on X and pretend you wrote it!</em></p>
<p>You can read it right there, or you can send it to Kindle, save it to Matter, or print it on real-life paper.</p>
<p>It's going to work everywhere because it's just text.</p>
<p>If you click on a link, it loads lightning fast. It doesn't need a CDN or to pre-load on hover.</p>
<p>Hosting text is so cheap it often doesn't have to be monetized. The entire website could be running off a Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>When you're reading, you can skim if you're bored, and then slow down to a crawl when you want to savor the words. You never ever come out of a haze, guilty after reading text for hours.</p>
<p>So thank you to everybody who writes and publishes text-only webpages.</p>
<p>You've probably lost some engagement by keeping things so clean, <strong>but you're contributing to a simple, calm, and happier internet.</strong></p>
<p>And I love it.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="page"><main id="primary" role="main"><article id="post-1374"><section><p>This is Part 2 of my LLM series. <a href="https://jenson.org/hype">In Part 1</a>, I discussed how in just a few short years, we went from the childlike joy of creating “Pirate Poetry” to the despair that our jobs would disappear. My main message was to relax a bit, as companies abuse the hype cycle to distort what is actually happening.</p><p>In this post I want to talk about how we fall prey to this distortion: we perceive LLMs as intelligent when they aren’t. <a href="https://jeppestricker.substack.com/p/the-synthetic-knowledge-crisis">A recent post</a> from Jeppe Stricker put me on this path. He wrote, “AI produces fluent coherency, texts that follow the rules of argument and structures so well, it bypasses skepticism altogether.”</p><p>He’s right. LLMs are language models, and their superpower is fluency. It’s this fluency that hacks our brains, trapping us into seeing them as something they aren’t.</p><p>This is best seen when people claim that ChatGPT has “passed the Turing test.” The circular argument is that if we can’t tell an LLM from a human, it is effectively human. This just makes me shake my head, as it profoundly misunderstands what is happening.</p><div><figure><img decoding="async" width="700" height="559" src="https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Turing-test-700x559.png" alt="" srcset="https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Turing-test-700x559.png 700w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Turing-test-120x96.png 120w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Turing-test-768x613.png 768w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Turing-test-720x575.png 720w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Turing-test.png 1090w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Turing-test-700x559.png"></figure></div><p>First, let me be a bit pedantic. The original Turing Test was designed to compare two participants chatting through a text-only interface: one AI and one human. The goal was to spot the imposter. Today, the test is simplified from three participants to just two: a human and an LLM. This changes the test from a comparison to a judgment.</p><p>The problem? We really, really, really want to find the humanity in almost anything. This is a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02136/full">well-studied tendency</a> called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism">anthropomorphism</a>, and this one-on-one test is basically setting us up to be hacked. This is why Stricker’s quote is so important. Since LLMs are trained to recombine text written by other humans, it bypasses our skepticism.</p><p>Back in the 1960s, Joseph Weizenbaum created a human-mimicking chatbot called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA">ELIZA</a>. It used no “AI”; it just relied on a long list of if-then-else clauses that recreated the questioning patterns of a Rogerian psychologist. The program was shockingly effective at convincing users they were talking to a real person. In fact, it was so effective that ELIZA actually <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/real-humans-appeared-human-63-of-the-time-in-recent-turing-test-ai-study/">outperformed ChatGPT 3.5</a>. So, what does it say about the power of LLMs when they can be beaten by a simple program from the 1960s?</p><p>Computers appear to be beating the Turing test but what’s actually happening is we are failing it as judges! We are so prone to anthropomorphizing that we desperately want to believe the machine is human.</p><p>This isn’t a flaw in humans, but a strength; it’s how we build community and reinforce social bonds. However, this strength can be hacked. After watching his creation fool so many people, Weizenbaum prophetically observed, “ELIZA shows how easy it is to create and maintain the illusion of understanding. A certain danger lurks here.”&nbsp;</p><h2>Enter Timmy</h2><p>When I speak on this topic, I bring out a standard yellow pencil with googly eyes stuck near the eraser end and a pipe cleaner wrapped around it for arms. I call him Timmy and, animating him like a puppet, have him say “hello” to the audience. Of course, they all say hello back. Timmy then describes how much he likes to draw with children and make them laugh. I ask what he wants to be when he grows up and he says, “To be A UX designer, just like you.”</p><div><figure><img decoding="async" width="2048" height="2048" src="https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Timmy.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Timmy.jpeg 2048w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Timmy-120x120.jpeg 120w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Timmy-700x700.jpeg 700w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Timmy-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Timmy-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Timmy-1536x1536.jpeg 1536w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Timmy-720x720.jpeg 720w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Timmy-1440x1440.jpeg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Timmy.jpeg"></figure></div><p>I reply, “Aww, that’s really too bad, Timmy.”</p><p>Then, I hold him up horizontally in front of my face and abruptly snap him in half.</p><p>The audience gasps.</p><p>It’s a shocking moment, and I’ve been told by many, it’s the most memorable part of the talk. The reason is simple: they felt a connection to Timmy. They had known him for only 15 seconds, yet they still perceived the act of snapping him in half as violent.</p><p>That’s why LLMs can fool us so easily. If we can form a human connection with a pencil in just 15 seconds, imagine how we’ll feel about an “AI system” we spend an hour with. We want them to be human. This is why we call their frequent mistakes “hallucinations,” a term that implies a temporary lapse. But it’s not a lapse; it’s a fundamental lack of human cognition.</p><p>We want connection to these systems.<br>We want to see ourselves in them.<br>We want to make excuses for them.</p><p>This makes us beautifully human, but unreliable judges.</p><h2>Summary vs Shortening</h2><p>We don’t just treat LLMs like they’re alive; we also see their actions as intelligent. For instance, we say they can “summarize” a document. But LLMs don’t summarize, they shorten, and this is a critical distinction. A true summary, the kind a human makes, requires outside context and reference points. Shortening just reworks the information already in the text.</p><p>Here is an example using the movie The Matrix:</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="700" height="467" src="https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/matrix-700x467.png" alt="" srcset="https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/matrix-700x467.png 700w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/matrix-120x80.png 120w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/matrix-768x512.png 768w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/matrix-720x480.png 720w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/matrix.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/matrix-700x467.png"></figure></div><p><strong>Summary</strong><strong><br></strong>A philosophical exploration of free will and reality disguised as a sci-fi action film about breaking free from systems of control.</p><p><strong>Shortening</strong><br>A computer hacker finds out reality is fake and learns Kung Fu.</p><p>There’s a key difference between summarizing and simply shortening. A summary enriches a text by providing context and external concepts, creating a broader framework for understanding. Shortening, in contrast, only reduces the original text; it removes information without adding any new perspective.</p><p>Now, I have to admit something: this entire movie example came from ChatGPT. I asked it about the summarization/shortening issue with LLMs, and it agreed with me (so clearly it must be true!). When I asked for examples, it suggested the Matrix and even gave me the “Summary” and “Shortening” text, which I then used here word for word.</p><p>But wait, isn’t that self-defeating? How could ChatGPT comment on itself like this if it didn’t fully understand? Surely that implies it must have some level of intelligence? The explanation is simple: we almost always misunderstand a new technology, thinking it’s doing much more than it actually is.</p><p>The exact same thing happened in the 1990s when IBM’s Deep Blue beat Kasparov in chess. People assumed it was intelligent and that computers would soon surpass humanity. However, Deep Blue wasn’t intelligent. It simply predicted the next move by brute force, using an exhaustive search to find the best option. This created an illusion of intelligence because only really smart humans can play chess at that level.&nbsp;</p><p>LLMs operate in a similar way, trading what we would call intelligence for a vast memory of nearly everything humans have ever written. It’s nearly impossible to grasp how much context this gives them to play with.</p><p>ChatGPT didn’t summarize The Matrix; it shortened the commentaries other people wrote about it online. In the same way, when I asked about the issues with LLMs shortening instead of summarizing, it just collected and shortened other articles on that topic. It’s just a more serious version of Pirate Poetry.</p><p>This is why LLMs appear to summarize well-known books, papers, and movies so well. They aren’t summarizing the source material. Instead, they are synthesizing an answer from hundreds of articles written by other humans.</p><p>But this is why they perform so poorly when summarizing unknown or academic PDFs. With no web articles for support, an LLM can ONLY look at the text within the document itself, which results in the equivalent of “a computer hacker finds out reality is fake and learns kung fu.”</p><p>This crucial difference between genuine summarizing and mechanical shortening isn’t just a semantic game. It exposes our confusion. When we mistake shortening for summarizing, we are making a fundamental error how we think about intelligence.</p><h2>What is intelligence?</h2><p>We throw the term around far too glibly. Many in the tech space think of intelligence as a simple collection of facts: ask a question, get an answer, pass a test. If an LLM gets really fancy, it might break a problem up, ask different sub-experts, and collate the replies. It’s information retrieval all the way down.</p><p>For decades, intelligence has been debated by psychologists, philosophers, sociologists, and anthropologists. It’s a slippery topic and there still is no clear answer but they all come to roughly the same insight: intelligence is far from being a universal property. It is just as much based on cultural context, language, and social factors. Intelligence is not a solo act but a social one, rooted in shared beliefs and values. To think is to be social. Intelligence is what we do collectively.</p><p>The mistake people make in assuming an LLM will have general intelligence isn’t that they think too highly of the tech; <strong>it’s that they completely misunderstand what it means to be human.</strong></p><p>This helps explain why ELIZA ‘beat’ ChatGPT in the Turing test. By mimicking a psychologist, it drew from a shared set of social conventions that we interpret as being more “intelligent.” This is what makes discussing LLMs so difficult. Just as we are horrible judges in the Turing test, we are also horrible at understanding intelligence itself. We throw the word around with little real understanding. And, as I wrote in my post about hype, this lack of precision prevents us from seeing LLMs clearly.</p><h2>Escaping the Timmy Trap</h2><p>LLMs mimic intelligence, but they aren’t intelligent. Just as when Deep Blue beat Kasparov, we are misunderstanding how the tech works. This doesn’t mean we can’t do amazing things with LLMs. They are very powerful tools, but we won’t properly unlock their potential until we understand what they’re good at and, more importantly, what they aren’t.</p><p>We have to learn to see the pencil and not get distracted by the googly eyes. Escaping the Timmy Trap means recognizing fluent mimicry as an impressive technical feat, not a kindred spirit. This insight helps us lean into what they do well and avoid wasting time on what they can’t. I’ll discuss that topic in Part 3.</p></section></article></main></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
  
<article id="post-2494">
  

  <div>
    <p>Across the internet, users rely on browsers and extensions to shape how they experience the web: to protect their privacy, improve accessibility, block harmful or intrusive content, and take control over what they see. But a recent ruling from Germany’s Federal Supreme Court risks turning one of these essential tools, the ad blocker, into a copyright liability — and in doing so, threatens the broader principle of user choice online.</p>
<p>Imagine you are watching television and you go to the kitchen for a snack during an ad break. Or you press the fast-forward button to skip some ads while listening to a podcast. Or perhaps you get a newspaper delivered to your house, and you see that it includes a special section made up of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/20/nx-s1-5405022/fake-summer-reading-list-ai">hallucinated AI content</a>, so you drop the inset into the trash before taking the rest of the paper inside. Were these acts of copyright infringement? Of course not. But if you do something like this with a browser extension, <a href="https://www.heise.de/en/news/Copyright-Springer-vs-Adblock-Plus-enters-another-round-10505898.html">a recent decision from the German Federal Supreme Court</a> suggests that maybe you did infringe copyright. This misguided logic risks user freedom, privacy, and security.</p>
<p>There are many reasons, in addition to ad blocking, that users might want their browser or a browser extension to alter a webpage. These include changes to <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/accessibility-features-firefox">improve</a> <a href="https://www.boia.org/blog/how-browser-reader-modes-improve-the-experiences-of-people-with-disabilities">accessibility</a>, to <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wave-accessibility-tool/">evaluate accessibility</a>, or to <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-privacy-and-security-features">protect</a> <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/tag/privacy/">privacy</a>. Indeed, the risks of browsing range from phishing, to malicious code execution, to invasive tracking, to fingerprinting, to more mundane harms like inefficient website elements that waste processing resources. Users should be equipped with browsers and browser extensions that give them both protection and choice in the face of these risks. <b>A browser that inflexibly ran any code served to the user would be an extraordinarily dangerous piece of software. </b>Ad blockers are just one piece of this puzzle, but they are an important way that users <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/blog/whats-the-best-ad-blocker-for-you/">can customize their experience</a> and lower <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-nsa-and-cia-use-ad-blockers-because-online-advertising-is-so-dangerous/">risks to their security</a> and privacy.</p>
<p>The recent court ruling is the latest development in a legal battle between publisher Axel Springer and Eyeo (the maker of Adblock Plus) that has been winding its way around the German legal system for more than a decade. The litigation has included both competition and copyright claims. Until now Eyeo has largely prevailed and the legality of ad blockers has been upheld. Most significantly, in 2022, the Hamburg appeal court <a href="https://dejure.org/dienste/vernetzung/rechtsprechung?Gericht=LG%20Hamburg&amp;Datum=14.01.2022&amp;Aktenzeichen=308%20O%20130/19">ruled</a> that Adblock Plus did not infringe the copyright of websites but rather was merely facilitating a choice by users about <i>how</i> they wished their browser to render the page.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, on July 31, the German Federal Supreme Court partially overturned the decision of the Hamburg court and remanded the case for further proceedings. The BGH (as the Federal Supreme Court is known) <a href="https://www.tcilaw.de/en/ad%E2%80%91blockers-infringing-cheat-software-not/">called for a new hearing</a> so that the Hamburg court can provide more detail regarding which part of the website (such as bytecode or object code) is altered by ad blockers, whether this code is protected by copyright, and under what conditions the interference might be justified.</p>
<p>The full impact of this latest development is still unclear. The BGH will issue a more detailed written ruling explaining its decision. Meanwhile, the case has now returned to the lower court for additional fact-finding. It could be a couple more years until we have a clear answer. We hope that the courts ultimately reach the same sensible conclusion and allow users to install ad blockers.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that Germany does not become the second jurisdiction (<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=zh-CN&amp;user=8VqyTHcAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=8VqyTHcAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C">after China</a>) to ban ad blockers. This will significantly limit users’ ability to control their online environment and potentially open the door to similar restrictions elsewhere. Such a precedent could embolden legal challenges against other extensions that protect privacy, enhance accessibility, or improve security. Over time, this could deter innovation in these areas, pressure browser vendors to limit extension functionality, and shift the internet away from its <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/webvision/full/#agency">open, user-driven nature</a> toward one with reduced flexibility, innovation, and control for users.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <main id="main" class="page" tabindex="&quot;1&quot;"> <article> <header id="article-header">     </header> <div>  <h2 id="hello-hacker-news">Hello Hacker News 🚀🚀🚀</h2>
<p><strong>I’ve done a little update on social since publishing of the article, let me copy paste it here.</strong></p>
<p>Since I posted my “Open Hardware is dead” article, you’ve been asking me about “that patent” 🤔 I didn’t want you to miss the forest (thousands of filings since 2020) just because of one tree. But let’s take a look now. In this case: the MMU multiplexer (we open sourced it 9 years ago). Anycubic (another IDG Capital-backed company) used the tactic of filing in China for an easy initial grant: <strong>CN 222407171 U</strong> ➡️ <strong>DE 20 2024 100 001 U1</strong> ➡️ <strong>US 2025/0144881 A1</strong>. The playbook: file a Chinese utility model (10-year patent, same protections, lower examination, already granted) ➡️ claim that priority in Germany (again as a utility model, already granted) ➡️ file in the US. Cheap to file, but expensive and time-consuming to fight. I already wrote why prior art isn’t a magic wand that solves it immediately in my article ⤵️ And there are many more, we just found a new juicy one 🔥</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44911976" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">I am in the comments on hacker news here!</a></p>
<h2 id="original-article-️">Original article ⤵️</h2>
<p>Hi, FAB 2025 is still happening in Prague and it has been a wonderful event. It’s been great to meet so many people from our community at home, in Czechia! But during my chats with the attendee’s, there was one topic which was emerging time and time again, and that is the state of open hardware. I cannot talk about all of the open hardware, but I can share experience from 3D printing. And it is not good! Open hardware in 3D printing is dead - you just don’t know it yet. This is an opinion piece, imagine we are talking about this topic over a cold Pilsner …</p>
<h2 id="what-happened">What happened?</h2>
<p>Well, if you are in 3D printing a little bit longer, you must have noticed that over the last 5 years, a huge number of vibrant brands died. Basically every country in Europe and many states in the USA had a couple of their own machines and the industry was very very creative in that regard. Somebody brought an innovation, others adopted it and shared it back.</p>
<p>But around the year 2020 we registered the first mention of 3D printing as a strategic industry by the Chinese government. We know that now, after a few years of research. We first realized something is off when the price of the parts is higher than the sale price of a complete machine in some cases. That is what sparked our interest and research into the subsidies. They exist, and are very efficient <a href="https://rhg.com/research/far-from-normal-an-augmented-assessment-of-chinas-state-support/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">https://rhg.com/research/far-from-normal-an-augmented-assessment-of-chinas-state-support/</a>. Our industry, desktop 3D printing, faces a bleak future. Comparable to the automotive sector as if only one high volume car brand, say Audi, remained outside of China. That’s it. An inch away from complete dependency on China in an vital piece of tech, the one absolutely critical for creation of new IP.</p>
<h2 id="patent-minefield">Patent minefield</h2>
<p>When looking into the data we were wondering why there is suddenly a multiple fold increase in 3D printing patent applications in China just around the year 2020, take a look yourself.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.josefprusa.com/articles/death-of-ohw/patents.png" alt="Patent applications">
<em>(Data from Espacenet International Database by European Patent Organization, March 2025)</em></p>
<p>Just 4 household names went from filing 40 total applications in 2019 to 650 in 2022. WTF has happened, right? Did so much new innovation suddenly happen in desktop 3D printing? Are these patents bogus? Are they dangerous? Isn’t there prior art for everything in 3D printing? So many questions…</p>
<h3 id="wtf-has-happened">WTF has happened?</h3>
<p>3D printing became a strategic industry and things like “Super deduction” became applicable to it. It is quite normal that R&amp;D costs are tax deductible around the world. But definitely not 200% as in this case. From our understanding you have to prove the true innovations to qualify and of course a patent application is clear proof! It doesn’t even have to be granted! Perfect!</p>
<p>So even in industries where a lot of the low-hanging fruit is gone, and the true innovations are now really rare - like 3D printing, you just patent spam every little variation of the stuff out there. And that is why open hardware is very disadvantaged because it’s just so easy to file the stuff which is out there already or do minimal modifications to it. From what we’ve seen the validity checks are not stringent at all and prior art doesn’t seem to matter much.</p>
<h4 id="are-these-patents-bogus">Are these patents bogus?</h4>
<p>Mostly, but when hunting with a shotgun you don’t need to hit with all the pellets. With the sheer number just statistically some have to land.</p>
<h4 id="are-they-dangerous">Are they dangerous?</h4>
<p>There are already some patents on our watch that could hamper the industry if they slip through and get granted in the EU or USA.</p>
<h4 id="isnt-there-prior-art-for-everything-in-3d-printing">Isn’t there prior art for everything in 3D printing?</h4>
<p>There is a huge discrepancy at the cost of filing the patent and then striking it down. 125 USD to file it in China. It is almost unrealistic for an open source project to even monitor these, let alone try to strike them in the application stage if not local to China. Proactively striking down the application when brought to EU/USA roughly 12,000 USD in really straightforward cases and multiple times that in other cases. When already granted it is 75,000 USD just to start and it is not a short run.</p>
<p>The fact you hold a prior art in your hand, doesn’t mean much. The patent will still prevent you from importing/selling etc of the “infringing” stuff. And you will have to battle the thing in the court to use the prior art card you hold. That can be a nice million dollar bill all while not being able to do your thing for years …</p>
<p>Open hardware has a huge disadvantage as it has to be manufactured/transported/sold and even if you do not want to manufacture and sell your own product, you want someone else to do it. And they will always try to avoid the risk.</p>
<p>Once the patent is awarded, there is a priority period for filing in other IP markets when you can ask for the protection and you have a good head-start compared to fresh filing.</p>
<p>All in all I think this super deduction is a great exploitation of the global IP law treaties but as always the small innovators and businesses outside are hurt the most.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>True impact is still not here “you just don’t know it yet” because of the timescale IP protections take, it can be well over 5 years from first filing in China to having someone’s project killed.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-we-doing">What are we doing</h2>
<p>Because of this reality, we’ve had to build an early warning team to monitor this and prepare the prior art. And we will welcome everyone who wants to join us in these efforts. Boutique, small, hobby, desktop, industrial - anyone who wants 3D printing out of IP clusterfuck!</p>
<p>I mean our MMU1 multiplexer (from 2016!) has been patented as an exact copy. This is already granted as utility model (sometimes called small patent - exactly the same protection but for shorter period) in Germany and China and filed as full utility patent application in USA 🤦‍♂️</p>
<p><img src="https://www.josefprusa.com/articles/death-of-ohw/mmu1.png" alt="MMU1"></p>
<p>We are working on a new community license so we are feeling more comfortable sharing as much as we used to share again with minimal risk of exploitation.</p>
<p>We are actively looking at the critical points which should be protected from the patent wall being erected and ways to do it. A possible option is to start an organization which would take care of this, to even out the skew happening now.</p>
<p>It is so bizarre to me, that we got to a stage where you need to think about protecting your designs and inventions in order to share them with the community …</p>
<h2 id="takeaway">Takeaway</h2>
<p>This is a story from 3D printing, but all the areas with heavy open hardware development are in Made in China 2025 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made_in_China_2025" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made_in_China_2025</a> and its successors. Make sure you keep an eye on the filings around your expertise, it is incomparably much easier to do something now than later.</p>  </div>    </article> </main> </div></div>]]></description>

    </div><p>The willingness of those in power to act fairly depends on how easily others can collectively push back against unfair treatment, psychologists have found.</p>


										      
																																	<p>A <a href="https://doi.org/10.32872/spb.11607" target="_blank">newly published study</a> by Dr. David Gordon at University of Staffordshire (UK) and Dr. Mikael Puurtinen at the University of Jyväskylä (Finland), investigated the impact of collective action against those in positions of power, using a multiplayer version of a classic psychological experiment called the Ultimatum Game. The findings are published in the journal <i>Social Psychological Bulletin</i>.</p>
<p>Results suggest that the ease of collective action induces more egalitarian behavior by individuals in a position of power and makes those without power less willing to accept unfairness.</p>
<p>Lead researcher Dr. David Gordon said, "From <a href="https://phys.org/tags/hunter-gatherers/" rel="tag">hunter-gatherers</a> to modern large-scale societies, the threat of collective action by others has been a key tool in ensuring that <a href="https://phys.org/tags/powerful+people/" rel="tag">powerful people</a> don't keep everything for themselves. Despite this, it is a surprisingly understudied area within psychology.</p>
<p>"We wanted to answer the question, is our individual idea of what is 'fair' just what we think we can get away with? So, we designed an experiment to test whether the behavior and beliefs of those with and without power changed depending on how easy or difficulty it is for those without power to act collectively.</p>
<p>"Our study shows that 'fairness' is probably less impacted by internal values, but by external pressures. The ease with which people can challenge authority significantly shapes how those in power behave."</p>

																																						
																																			<p>The Ultimatum Game usually has two players: a Proposer and Responder. The Proposer is given an allocation of points (e.g., 100) and is asked whether they would like to send any amount the Responder. If the Responder accepts the offer, that is how the points are distributed. If they 'reject' the offer made, then neither player gets anything. In these games, points reflect real money that is paid to participants at the end of the experiment.</p>
<p>The new study made two changes to the Ultimatum Game. First, there were three Responders per group rather than one. Second, to 'reject' the Proposer offer, all three had to pool some of their points collectively. If that pool reached a certain level, the offer was rejected.</p>
<p>"We had three conditions: Easy, Medium and Hard collective action. In the "Easy' condition, responders did not need to invest a great deal of points to have a good chance of rejection," Dr. Gordon explained. "However, in the "Hard' condition, rejection was only likely to succeed if all Responders pooled all their points."</p>
<p>The study found that when potential rejection was easier, Proposers divided resources more equally and, because of this, the money earned between both roles was more equal. When rejection was harder (or impossible), Proposers were less generous and there was a large difference in earnings between the roles.</p>
<p>For responders, ease did not affect their willingness to contribute points to the rejection pool, but when <a href="https://phys.org/tags/rejection/" rel="tag">rejection</a> was harder, responders became more accepting of unequal offers as the game progressed.</p>

																									
																																			<p>Once finished, participants were also asked about their motivations. Dr. Gordon commented, "Interestingly, when questioned afterwards, Proposers in the easy condition indicated that they believed it was their duty to be fair. Which is curious, as they didn't really have a choice given how easy an unfair decision was to reject."</p>
<p>He added, however, that it is important to remember the limitations of such studies: "We used point/money to represent the real-life costs associated with actions like campaigning or going on a protest march. Experiments like these are only meant to simulate aspects of the real world, not perfectly represent its complexity."</p>
<p>Behavior may be different if participants had earned their points rather than simply received them, or both Proposers and Responder shared a common identity or wider goal.</p>
<p>"Still," Dr. Gordon continues, "it is a reminder that we should be mindful of attempts to limit the ability to hold power to account. For example, through anti-protest, anti-strike, and voter suppression laws. In an era marked by growing global inequality, this study offers critical insights into the psychology of power, and the mechanisms that can promote more equitable societies."</p>

<p>A <a href="https://smokinggun.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gov.uscourts.ctd_.150506.202.1_UNREDACTED.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">court exhibit</a> recently published online summarizes Sig Sauer’s internal P320 testing and shows that the gun maker and U.S. Army were both aware of serious safety risks with the pistol since at least 2017, years before it was fielded to soldiers as the full-size M17 and compact M18. The document — prepared as a part of Sig Sauer’s contracting process with the U.S. Army — outlines multiple ways the pistol could fire without an intentional trigger pull.</p>



<p>A redacted version of the court document was originally filed on May 14 in a case between attorney Jeffrey Bagnell and Sig Sauer. On July 24, a <a href="https://practicalshootinginsights.com/the-document-sig-sauer-doesnt-want-you-to-see-about-the-p320/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gun blogger</a> was able to delete the purported redactions and post an unredacted version of the document. On July 28, Sig Sauer filed a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ctd.150506/gov.uscourts.ctd.150506.213.0_1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">motion</a> requesting the court to remove the exhibit from public access,<sup data-mfn="1" data-mfn-post-scope="00000000000005170000000000000000_3523">1</sup><span id="mfn-content-00000000000005170000000000000000_3523-1" role="tooltip" tabindex="0" data-mfn="1">As of the time of publication, this motion appears to be still pending before the court.</span> but guntubers and social media users reposted it before the court ruled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an August 6 interview, Sig Sauer’s senior vice president of consumer affairs, Phil Strader, acknowledged that the company created the document in response to a request by the U.S. military, and claimed that is being used to “confuse the issue.”<sup data-mfn="2" data-mfn-post-scope="00000000000005170000000000000000_3523">2</sup><span id="mfn-content-00000000000005170000000000000000_3523-2" role="tooltip" tabindex="0" data-mfn="2">Practical Shooting Insights, “Sig Sauer VP of Consumer Affairs Discusses the P320/MHS Program ‘Highly Confidential’ FMECA Document,” YouTube, August 6, 2025, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkLqAJ2x5kU&amp;t=3s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkLqAJ2x5kU&amp;t=3s</a>, at 0:28.</span> Strader also described the contents of the document and the various risks analyzed by Sig Sauer engineers. With respect to its confidentiality, Strader stated, “Now that it is out there, we don’t mind. We’ll discuss exactly…I’ll go line by line if you wanted me to.”<sup data-mfn="3" data-mfn-post-scope="00000000000005170000000000000000_3523">3</sup><span id="mfn-content-00000000000005170000000000000000_3523-3" role="tooltip" tabindex="0" data-mfn="3"><em>Ibid</em>, at 4:42.</span></p>



<p>Despite the risks identified in the exhibit, Sig Sauer has consistently defended the safety of the P320 and continued to market and sell the pistol to civilians, law enforcement, and the military.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-p320-s-deadly-risks">THE P320<strong>’</strong>s DEADLY RISKS</h2>



<p>The unredacted <a href="https://smokinggun.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gov.uscourts.ctd_.150506.202.1_UNREDACTED.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">document</a>, titled “Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis” (FMECA), appears to have been prepared by Sig Sauer for the Army as part of the Modular Handgun System (MHS) procurement process in February 2017, roughly a <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2017/01/19/army-picks-sig-sauer-replace-m9-service-pistol.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">month</a> after the Army officially adopted the P320. According to the document, the pistol passed two drop safety tests but “failed customer drop testing,” and the gun had a “high” risk of firing unintentionally upon impact — after being dropped or bumped, or sustaining vibrations — with the potential to “kill [a] person unintentionally.”</p>



<p>Sig Sauer’s own analysis identified 13 different situations where P320s could fire unintentionally, but many were left unresolved. While seven were “eliminated” according to Sig Sauer, six were still designated as posing a “medium” risk to users. Notably, many of the “recommended actions” to address the issues, either partially or fully, involved user training — not a design modification.</p>



<p>In total, the FMECA identified 17 hazards that could result in a person being killed unintentionally by a P320. Even after Sig Sauer’s proposed mitigations, nine of those remained at a “medium” risk level. Of the eight initially rated as “high” risk, only three were fully eliminated, leaving five at a “medium” risk. Four of the six hazards initially classified as “serious” also remained at a “medium” risk.</p>



<p>Sig Sauer also stated that the manual safeties on M17 and M18 pistols would resolve some of the issues, but the <a href="https://smokinggun.org/sig-sauer-defends-the-p320-pistol-as-more-police-ban-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vast majority</a> of P320s sold to civilians do not feature such safeties.</p>







<h2 id="h-putting-soldiers-in-danger">putting soldiers in danger</h2>



<p>The FMECA, combined with a fiscal year 2017 Department of Defense <a href="https://www.dote.osd.mil/Portals/97/pub/reports/FY2017/army/2017mhs.pdf?ver=2019-08-19-113850-680" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> referencing failed drop tests, demonstrates that Army officials were aware of the dangers yet moved forward in issuing the M17 and M18 to soldiers, and subsequently other branches of the military.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since then, multiple unintentional discharges have been reported across the military, with some causing serious injuries. In June 2024, New Hampshire Public Radio <a href="https://www.nhpr.org/nh-news/2024-06-25/documents-detail-u-s-soldiers-shot-by-their-own-sig-sauer-guns-military-says-no-reason-for-concern" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that it identified nine service-related incidents, at least some of which involved injuries, where “pistols fired without a trigger pull.” The Army denied that the guns involved in these incidents showed any “material flaws,” and said the guns were rigorously tested and would remain in “service with all [branches] at this time without restrictions.”</p>



<p>But just last month, the U.S. Air Force <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/07/23/air-force-command-pauses-use-of-m18-handguns-after-security-airmans-death.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Global Strike Command</a> announced that it had temporarily removed the M18 from service “[o]ut of an abundance of caution and to ensure the safety and security of our personnel” after the death of an airman on July 20. Days later, some units within the Air Force’s <a href="https://www.twz.com/land/sig-m18-pistol-restrictions-expand-to-usaf-air-combat-command-units" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Air Combat Command</a> also temporarily restricted use of the M18.</p>



<h2 id="h-undercutting-sig-sauer-s-claims">undercutting sig sauer<strong>’</strong>s claims</h2>



<p>Despite these findings — and dozens of lawsuits filed by plaintiffs alleging that their P320s fired without intentional trigger pulls — Sig Sauer has repeatedly <a href="https://smokinggun.org/sig-sauer-ceo-defends-p320-pistols-despite-unintentional-shootings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">denied</a> that the P320 is defective. On July 29, 2025, the company published a <a href="https://www.sigsauer.com/blog/p320-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> promising customers “full, complete, and accurate information” regarding the P320, but reiterated that the gun “is one of the safest, most advanced pistols in the world -meeting and exceeding all industry safety standards.”</p>



<p>The company also said that the P320 “CANNOT, under any circumstances, discharge without the trigger first being moved to the rear.” This phrasing is slightly different from what Sig Sauer <a href="https://www.sigsauer.com/blog/the-truth-about-the-p320" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> in March after the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission (WSCJTC) <a href="https://smokinggun.org/sig-sauer-defends-the-p320-pistol-as-more-police-ban-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">banned the gun</a> from its properties and courses, stating that the P320 “CANNOT, under any circumstances, discharge without a trigger pull.” In that statement, the company also blamed the “anti-gun mob” for attacks on the P320.</p>



<p>Sig Sauer later <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/sig-sauer-sues-washington-training-224600560.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued</a> the WSCJTC, but a judge recently <a href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/investigations/investigators/judge-denies-gunmakers-request-to-reverse-police-academy-ban/281-68002edd-532d-4834-90fb-474b81607343" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">denied</a> the company’s petition to reverse the academy’s P320 ban.</p>



<p>In its July 29 <a href="https://www.sigsauer.com/blog/p320-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a>, Sig Sauer also refuted an FBI report — which <a href="https://www.outdoorlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MSP-M18-Pistol-Evaluation_FINAL_Redacted_Outdoor_Life.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concluded</a> that “movements representing those common to a law enforcement officer” could disengage a safety mechanism inside the P320 — and instead pointed to a later report that “resulted in zero instances of failures.” The company also denied reports that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had removed the P320 from duty. Instead, Sig Sauer said that it “is honored to continue aiding ICE in their mission to protect America.”</p>



<p>Nonetheless, multiple law enforcement agencies have <a href="https://smokinggun.org/air-force-command-pulls-sig-sauer-m18-after-deadly-shooting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulled the P320</a> from duty over safety concerns, including police departments in Chicago, Dallas, Denver and, most recently, <a href="https://www.unionleader.com/news/courts/houston-police-ban-use-of-sig-sauer-p320-pistol-after-officer-injured/article_a1b7dc0d-df97-471d-b25c-7fddef5f0bea.amp.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Houston</a>. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GunsiteAcademy/posts/gunsite-academy-has-always-placed-firearms-safety-as-paramount-currently-there-a/716175687711619/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gunsite Academy</a> and the <a href="https://www.idpa.com/important-announcement-from-idpa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">International Defensive Pistol Association</a>, a competitive shooting program, have banned the pistol as well.</p>



<p>The unredacted FMECA undercuts Sig Sauer’s claims that the P320, M17, and M18 are among the safest pistols in the world. It raises pressing questions about how known design flaws were allowed to persist, and why the responsibility for mitigating them was shifted onto the people ordered to carry the weapon. In an August 2023 <a href="https://www.qaoutdoors.com/archives/2023-08-04" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview</a>, Tom Taylor, Sig Sauer’s chief marketing officer and executive vice president of commercial sales, said, “If someone can just show us how to replicate [these uncommanded discharges] we will absolutely look at this from all aspects to make sure there isn’t any truth to this. In a company of our size, would anyone ever believe that there was a real issue going on, and we wouldn’t address it?”</p>



<p>As claims that P320s can fire without an intentional trigger pull continue to emerge, it appears that Sig Sauer documented the potentially deadly issues with the pistol years ago as part of its Army contract.</p>

  <p>Have you listened to the BBC's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m002fv89" target="_blank"><em>Derailed: The Story of HS2</em></a><em>&nbsp;yet?</em>&nbsp;If not, you must.&nbsp;</p><p>Like so many of us, I have spent much of the last two decades watching the unfolding car crash&nbsp;(pardon the multimodal metaphor) of HS2 with horror and fascination.</p><p>But a simple, honest account of what went wrong has been lacking: there's been too much confirmation bias and too many fixed agendas. The BBC has - again - proved the value of the licence fee with a thorough and detailed account.</p><p>To listen to the story, HS2 is a parable of Britain: a larger-than-life demonstrator of how we build slowly, expensively and often without delivering the benefit.</p><p>And that's all true.</p><p>But there are also important&nbsp;lessons for rail specifically. To help bring these to life, allow me to talk you through how we'd have built HS2 if we were Swiss.</p><h4>Swiss long-term funding</h4><p>Let’s imagine, just for a moment, that in 2008 the UK had decided to adopt the Swiss approach.</p><p>In Switzerland, there’s a very different system. Capital investment in railways comes from the infrastructure fund, written into law. You can <a href="https://www.freewheeling.info/blog/how-to-fund-transport" target="_blank">read more about that here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s long-term, it’s guaranteed and it comes with a specific obligation: capital investment in new infrastructure has to happen every year. </p><p>In addition to long-term planning, the other big difference between Switzerland and the UK is they don't start with a project (e.g. HS2), they start with a timetable.&nbsp;</p><p>They pick a year in the future - 2045, say - and ask: what should the national train timetable look like then, if we want to meet our national objectives as a country? </p><p>They work out what a good timetable looks like in that future. Then they build backwards from there.</p><p>It sounds simple - even obvious - but it leads you to&nbsp;a very&nbsp;different way of working.</p>
</div><div data-sqsp-text-block-content="" data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" data-sqsp-block="text" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1753451932693_46440">
  <h4>Start with the timetable</h4><p>So, let’s imagine the UK had done this in 2008. What might the planners have noticed?</p><p>Well, first up, they'd have spotted that our major cities need more frequent and faster rail connections from suburbs to centres and that these are prevented at the moment by insufficient platform capacity in stations like Leeds, Manchester Piccadilly and Birmingham New Street. So we need more station capacity in our city centres.&nbsp;</p><p>They'd have identified that many suburban lines into city centres have drastically inadequate services due to slow trains having to share tracks with fast trains: for example, Coventry to Birmingham or Stoke to Manchester through stations like Poynton. So there needs to be new suburban capacity for fast trains so that places like Poynton can have more trains.</p><p>They'd have identified core intercity links that are far too slow: typically not to/from London, but some of the second-tier city connections that are extraordinarily slow: e.g. Birmingham to Manchester, Leeds to Nottingham or Sheffield to Birmingham. So there needs to be new faster connections between these cities, missing out many of the smaller stations.&nbsp;</p><p>Given wider Government priorities, they'd identify the need for more housing in the Oxford to Cambridge arc, and identify that this requires faster, more frequent stopping trains on the West Coast mainline to places like Milton Keynes, which means the fast tracks need to be used by slower trains, so the fastest trains need to run somewhere else.&nbsp;</p><p>Our carbon commitments mean they'd identify the need for more freight capacity, which means our existing mainlines need to have core speeds slower than they are at the moment so freight trains can be fitted amongst passenger trains.&nbsp;</p><p>And they'd identify that we just need more capacity on the core West Coast mainline, which connects almost all the UK's major cities.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, the Swiss wouldn’t stop there. They’d take all of those needs, and build a proper timetable — an actual train-by-train plan — that solves those problems. And then they’d ask: what infrastructure do we need to make this timetable possible?</p><p>As you've probably realised, this leads you to something that looks - in some ways - rather like HS2.</p><p>However, because they know&nbsp;<em>exactly</em>&nbsp;what they can afford, every year, forever, they could immediately identify that it's too expensive.</p><p>This is one of the most important points.</p><p>Because they know what they can afford, they can now value-engineer a version that fits. In the UK, no one really knows how much money the Treasury will be willing to release, or when. In Switzerland, there’s a budget envelope. It’s predictable.&nbsp;</p><p>So having come up with an unaffordable infrastructure plan to deliver a perfect timetable, they'd go back, iterate the timetable, tweak the infrastructure plan and adjust things until it all fits. And then they’d start building.</p><h4>Not a megaproject.</h4><p>But the things they’d start building wouldn’t be “HS2”.</p><p>That name wouldn’t exist. There’d be no glossy brand or separate company: no HS2 Ltd with its own culture and operating model and interface challenges. Just a series of connected but self-contained projects, each delivered by Network Rail as part of normal business.</p><p>They might start with new capacity between Coventry and Birmingham, as this is an acute&nbsp;pinchpoint, plus a new station in Manchester Piccadilly. Because the new track between Coventry and Birmingham needs to connect with the West Coast mainline somewhere between Coventry and Rugby, it can't be the arrow-straight alignment of HS2. So the trains will be slower than HS2 but that's ok - getting to Birmingham in 49 minutes isn't crucial: what's crucial is enabling better suburban connectivity in the West Midlands and creating new West Coast capacity. The new stretch of track would be designed in such a way that the trains can join from the West Coast initially (realising the West Midlands suburban benefits early) but also extended to London in future.</p><p>At the same time, they’d begin work on a new through-station at Manchester Piccadilly, to unlock suburban capacity into Manchester.</p><p>Neither project requires huge new technology or radical change - just good design and integration with the wider network.</p><p>Both the new line in Coventry and the new station in Manchester would have seen work start within years of 2007, so both would have been open for years by now, with the early benefits already realised. The suburban trains in the West Midlands and Manchester would already be running today.&nbsp;</p><p>From there, they’d keep going. One project after another, each one designed to deliver a real, usable benefit: but also slotting into a wider national timetable that’s slowly coming into view. Not as one big bang, but a rolling programme of cumulative upgrades, each one moving us closer to the timetable they envisaged at the start.</p>

  <h4>Better - and cheaper</h4><p>Now, why does this cost less? Partly because you're not building a perfect railway: you’re building a useful one. You work within constraints.&nbsp;</p><p>And partly&nbsp;because&nbsp;you sequence delivery in a way that creates early benefits and keeps the supply chain warm. Because the supply chain knows that new infrastructure is always going to be built every year, the supply chain is geared up and ready, and costs are low. There is no inexperienced delivery organisation as these projects are a core part of Network Rail's job. I can't promise every part will be delivered on-time and on-budget but it's much more likely. And if something isn't late, it doesn't mean that the whole shebang is late - just that one project.&nbsp;</p><p>This isn't the approach we took. </p><p>We stopped and started. We pulled funding. We created a new delivery body from scratch. Then we asked it to do something unprecedented under political conditions that changed every six months. 18 years in - we&nbsp;<strong><em>still don't have a design for Euston!&nbsp;</em></strong>And then we wondered why the cost ballooned.</p><h4>The absolutely crucial bit</h4><p>None of this - none of it! - works without long-term funding certainty. It’s the foundation that makes all of the rest of it possible. </p><p>It’s not the money itself, but the discipline it imposes. You must spend every year. You must plan ahead. You must deliver.</p><p>The Treasury, to its credit, is trying to be careful with public money. But by refusing to commit long-term, it creates exactly the conditions that make infrastructure expensive. It forces us into last-minute decisions, bespoke justifications, bespoke delivery structures, bespoke mistakes.</p><p>In trying to save money, the Treasury is, unintentionally, the biggest driver of waste and inefficiency in UK infrastructure.</p><p>And if this counterfactual doesn’t make that clear, I’m not sure what will.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>I completed a Computer Science degree at uni, and bundled a lot of maths subjects in as electives: partial differential equations, vector calculus, discrete maths, linear algebra. For some reason however I always avoided statistics subjects. Maybe there’s a story to be told about a young person finding uncertainty uncomfortable, because twenty years later I find statistics, particularly the Bayesian flavour, really interesting.</p><p>One problem with a self-directed journey is that there’s foundational knowledge that has come to me in dribs and drabs, and one of the most foundational is the <em>Central Limit Theorem</em> (CLT). In this post I want to interrogate and explore the CLT using simulation and visualisation in an attempt to understand how it works in practice, not in theory. This is predominantly a process to help me better understand the CLT; you’re just here for the ride. Hopefully that ride can help you get where you need to go as well.</p><p>It’s been awhile since I’ve included any code in a post, so where it makes sense I’ll show the generating R code, with a liberal sprinking of comments so it’s hopefully not too inscrutable.</p><h2 id="a-brief-recap">A Brief Recap</h2><p>I don’t want this to be like an online recipe with pages of back story before you get to the meat and bones, but a brief summary of the CLT before we begin is unavoidable. In plain English the CLT can be described as such:</p><blockquote><p>“If you take repeated samples of size <em>n</em> from a distribution and calculate the sample mean for each, as <em>n</em> gets approaches infinity, the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution.”</p></blockquote><p>For the classic CLT there’s a couple of assumptions about the source distribution:</p><ul><li>The sample is drawn independently (no autocorrelation like in a time series).</li><li>All the data points are drawn from the same distribution (“independent and identically distributed” or i.i.d).</li><li>The distribution has a finite mean and variance (e.g.&nbsp;no Cauchy or Pareto distributions).</li></ul><p>There are other versions of the CLT in which some of these assumptions are relaxed, but we’ll focus on the ‘classic’ version.</p><p>Putting it math terms:</p><p>$$
\frac{\bar{X}_n - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \overset{d}\longrightarrow \mathcal{N}(0, 1)

While you can <em>kind of</em> guess that they’re normal from a histogram, we can get a better sense quantile-quantile plot. The standard normal quantiles are on the x-axis, and our sample mean quantiles are on the y-axis.</p><p><img src="https://blog.foletta.net/post/2025-07-14-clt/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="672">
They all track pretty closely to a standard normal, however the chi-square and exponential do tend to diverge slightly at the ends. We’ll dive a bit deeper into that later in the post.</p><p>Let’s summarise: we took twenty-thousand sample means of size sixty from six wildly different distributions, and we were able to see that the distributions of these sample means approximately followed a normal distribution. This is the essence of the central limit theorem, which allows us to use statistical methods for normal distributions on problems that involve population distributions that aren’t normal.</p><h2 id="in-practice-with-mistakes">In Practice, With Mistakes</h2><p>That’s all well and good if you’ve got the population mean and standard deviation, but in most cases you’re not going to have that. You’re also likely not going to have the resources to take twenty-thousand different samples.</p><p>Let’s take a a pretty classic example of interviewing six people about about something (weight, height, voting intentions, etc) and take the average: your sample mean. What the CLT can give you is an interval around your sample mean that would give you the a confidence interval (we’ll use the classic 95%) that the <em>true mean</em> of the population is somewhere in the interval.</p><p>So you use a bit of algebra and move some terms around in the CLT formula and you get this:</p><p>$$
\bar{X} \pm z_.025 \cdot \ \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}<br>$$</p><p>where \(\bar{X}\) is your sample mean, \(z_.025\) is the critical value (aka <code>qnorm()</code> in R) and \(s\) is the sample standard deviation. The sample standard deviation over the square root n is more commonly known as the standard error.</p><p>More simply, we take the sample mean and add/subtract the 97.5 quantile from a normal distribution times the standard error to get our 95% interval. Some may have noted a small mistake I’ve made here, which I’’ll leave in but will soon come to light.</p><p>We’re in frequentist territory here, so while it’s tempting to say “there’s a 95% probability that the true mean is in the interval”, we shouldn’t. Why? Because to a frequentist, the true mean \(\mu\) is a fixed value. We can’t assign a probability to the population mean, it’s either in the interval or it’s not. What we should say is that if we were to repeat the sampling process many times, in the long run we should see the true mean within this confidence interval 95% of the time. We can simulate this to see if that is true.</p><p>We use a sample size of 6, taking the mean of these 6 samples from each of our population distributions 10,000 times.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="r"><span># Ten-thousand random sample means of size six</span>

You’ll see the distribution of sample means from the uniform distribution approaches a normal much faster than the expontential. It’s very subjective, but I think the uniform starts looking reasonably good at a sample size of 8. The exponential however takes much longer to converge to a normal.</p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>The central limit theorem is something I’ve read about many times and had a reasonable grasp on, but I was always wondering about how it behaved with different population distributions. Running simulations and visualising how it behaved in different scenarios has given me (and hopefully yourselves) a much clearer view on how it works, and probably more importantly where it doesn’t work well.</p></article></div>]]></description>
