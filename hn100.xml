<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="incArticle"><p>OpenAI's credibility — and the credibility of its CEO, Sam Altman — is crumbling.</p><p>Last week, amid a surprise string of high-profile executive and safety team departures, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/5/17/24158478/openai-departures-sam-altman-employees-chatgpt-release"><em>V</em><em>ox</em> revealed that</a> the ChatGPT creator had pressured employees into signing draconian non-disclosure and non-disparagement agreements by threatening to claw back exiting OpenAI employees' vested equity in the multibillion-dollar AI company.</p><p>Clawing back vested equity — in short, the amount of company ownership that an employee has gained through their months or years of working there — is a highly unusual practice to begin with. This is especially true in the startup-powered Silicon Valley, where tech workers often forgo high salaries in favor of equity agreements based on the hope that they'll get rich later when a successful startup like OpenAI eventually goes public. For OpenAI to play bizarre contractual take-backsies in exchange for narrative control over former employees would be an <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/openai-nda-criticism">awful look</a> for any company — let alone a supposedly "open" venture claiming it's the best one to build the imagined all-knowing AI that OpenAI's leaders say will power humanity's future.</p><p>In response to the <em>Vox</em> report, Altman apologetically took to X-formerly-Twitter to admit that yes, "there was a provision about potential equity cancellation in our previous exit docs." But according to the CEO, though the clause was there, the company never <em>actually&nbsp;</em>clawed anything back. Most importantly, he further <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/sam-altman-nda-superintelligent">claimed</a> that he had no knowledge of the provision.</p><p>"This is on me and one of the few times I've been genuinely embarrassed running OpenAI," Altman continued in a tone that can only be described as sheepish, "I did not know this was happening and I should have."</p><p>But <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/351132/openai-vested-equity-nda-sam-altman-documents-employees">according to <em>Vox's</em> latest follow-up</a>, Altman wasn't in the dark about the equity clauses, as he claimed in his tail-between-legs tweet.</p><p>Documentation reviewed by <em>Vox</em> reveals that several company leaders — including OpenAI chief strategy officer Jason Kwon, who reportedly told staffers following the initial <em>Vox </em>report that OpenAI leadership "caught" the provision "~month ago" — signed documents that plainly outlined the stifling clawback provision. The list of executives includes Altman, whose signature, according to <em>Vox</em>'s reporting, is on "incorporation documents" for the holding company that manages OpenAI equity; these documents contain "multiple passages with language that gives the company near-arbitrary authority to claw back equity from former employees" or, if employees choose not to actually return the equity, "block them from selling it" altogether.</p><p>In other words, unless someone forged the CEO's signature, he gave express permission for these clauses to exist. Outside of forgery, there are only two plausible reasons for Altman's alleged lack of knowledge: either he didn't fully read the employment contracts he was signing or he was lying.</p><p>Complicating the denials further is the way employees were reportedly treated on their way out. According to the <em>Vox</em> report, the equity provisions were no secret to OpenAI representatives handling departures, who in some cases gave outgoing employees just seven days to make the incredibly complicated decision about their future — all the while, in instances reviewed by <em>Vox</em>, emphasizing possible clawbacks.</p><p>"We want to make sure you understand that if you don't sign, it could impact your equity," one rep told an outgoing employee, according to <em>Vox</em>. "That's true for everyone, and we're just doing things by the book."</p><p>But again, as the report reiterates, this is <em>not </em>"by-the-book" behavior.</p><p>"For a company to threaten to claw back already-vested equity is egregious and unusual," Chambord Benton-Hayes, a California employment law attorney, told <em>Vox.</em></p><p>When <em>Vox</em> asked OpenAI to explain how the provisions could have possibly wound up in documents signed by Altman without Altman actually knowing about them, Kwon non-answered that "we are sorry for the distress this has caused great people who have worked hard for us."</p><p>"We have been working to fix this as quickly as possible," Kwon — who, again, also signed papers delineating this provision — continued in his statement. "We will work even harder to be better."</p><p>But that's getting harder and harder to believe. Last year, when Altman was briefly forced out of OpenAI in what was pretty much a corporate coup, those who voted to oust the CEO — many of whom departed after losing said coup — claimed that Altman had been "inconsistently candid" in his communications with the board. Altman and OpenAI are also caught up in a <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/law-experts-scarlett-johansson-strong-case-openai">brewing legal storm</a> with actress Scarlett Johansson, who claims that Altman copycatted her voice for OpenAI's new "Sky" AI assistant after she had explicitly turned Altman and OpenAI down. (Altman chalked Johansson's allegations up to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-scarlett-johansson-voice-defense-sam-altman-washington-post-chatgpt-2024-5">simple miscommunication</a>.)</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://futurism.com/openai-safety-worker-quit-confidence-agi">recent departures</a> have <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/openai-researcher-quits-criticism-superallignment">ground</a> OpenAI's "Superalignment" safety team — the ones tasked with making sure a killer AI doesn't obliterate humankind — <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/17/openai-superalignment-sutskever-leike.html">into dust</a>. Great stuff.</p><p>On its website, OpenAI features a "<a href="https://openai.com/charter/">charter</a>" declaring that "OpenAI's mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) — by which we mean highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work — benefits all of humanity."</p><p>"We will attempt to directly build safe and beneficial AGI," it continues, "but will also consider our mission fulfilled if our work aids others to achieve this outcome."</p><p>The document then lists a series of "principles," which the company claims it'll follow to achieve this mission. The word "transparency" is notably absent.</p><p><strong>More on OpenAI: </strong><a href="https://futurism.com/sam-altman-openai-scarlett-johansson"><em>Sam Altman Ignoring Scarlett Johansson's Lack of Consent Shows Us Exactly What Type of Person He Really Is</em></a></p><br></section></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>After many months of research, development and QA, Wasmi’s most significant update ever is finally ready for production use.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/wasmi-labs/wasmi">Wasmi</a> is an efficient and versatile <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> (Wasm) interpreter with a focus on embedded environments. It is an excellent choice for plugin systems, cloud hosts and as smart contract execution engine.</p><p>Wasmi intentionally mirrors the Wasmtime API on a best-effort basis, making it an ideal drop-in replacement or prototyping runtime.</p><blockquote><p>Install <a href="https://crates.io/crates/wasmi_cli">Wasmi’s CLI tool</a> via <code>cargo install wasmi_cli</code> or use it as library via the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/wasmi"><code>wasmi</code> crate</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Wasmi v0.32 comes with a new execution engine that utilizes register-based bytecode enhancing its execution performance by a factor of up to 5.
Additionally, its startup performance has been improved by several orders of magnitudes thanks to lazy compilation and other new techniques.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/wasmi-labs/wasmi/releases/tag/v0.32.0">changelog for v0.32</a> is huge and the following sections will present the most significant changes.</p><h2 id="startup-performance">Startup Performance</h2><p>Wasmi is a <em>rewriting interpreter</em>, meaning that it rewrites the incoming WebAssembly bytecode into Wasmi’s own internal bytecode that is geared towards efficient execution performance.</p><p>This re-writing is what we call <em>compilation</em> or <em>translation</em> in an interpreter. This is not to be confused with compiling the Wasmi interpreter itself.</p><h3 id="why-is-translation-speed-important-for-wasmi">Why is translation speed important for Wasmi?</h3><p>Fast translation enables a fast startup time which is the time spent until the first instruction is executed.</p><p>As an interpreter, Wasmi is naturally optimized for fast startup times, making it well-suited for translation-intensive workloads where the time required to translate a Wasm binary exceeds the time needed to execute it.<br>Conversely, compute-intensive workloads, where execution time surpasses translation time, are better handled by JIT-based Wasm runtimes such as <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime">Wasmtime</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime">WAMR</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer">Wasmer</a>. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><h3 id="lazy-translation">Lazy Translation</h3><p>Translation can be costly, especially with the new register-based bytecode. To address this, lazy translation has been implemented, translating only the parts of the Wasm binary necessary for execution.</p><p>Wasmi supports 3 different modes of translation:</p><ul><li><code>Eager</code>: Code is eagerly validated and eagerly translated ahead of time.<ul><li><strong>Note:</strong> This is the default mode for Wasmi v0.32.</li></ul></li><li><code>Lazy</code>: Code is lazily translated and lazily validated.<ul><li><strong>Note:</strong> One downside is that this allows for partially validated Wasm modules which are controversial within the wider Wasm community. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></li></ul></li><li><code>LazyTranslation</code>: Code is lazily translated but eagerly validated.<ul><li><strong>Note:</strong> While slower than <code>Lazy</code> this fixes the problem with partially validated Wasm modules.</li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="usage-as-library">Usage as Library</h4><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> c <span>=</span> wasmi::Config::default();

</span></span></code></pre></div><h4 id="usage-in-wasmis-cli">Usage in Wasmi’s CLI</h4><p>Wasmi CLI now supports the command-line option <code>--compilation-mode=&lt;mode&gt;</code> where <code>&lt;mode&gt;</code> is one of <code>eager</code>, <code>lazy</code>, or <code>lazy-translation</code>.</p><h3 id="unchecked-translation">Unchecked Translation</h3><p>Wasmi validates the Wasm binary which accounts for roughly 20-40% of the total time spent during the startup phase.
However, some users might want to skip Wasm validation altogether since they know ahead of time that used Wasm binaries are pre-validated. This is now possible via the <code>unsafe fn Module::new_unchecked</code> API.</p><h3 id="non-streaming-translation">Non-streaming Translation</h3><p>Wasmi v0.31 and earlier always used streaming translation to process their Wasm input. However, in practice most users never even made use of this, so in v0.32 Wasmi uses non-streaming translation by default which gives it yet another nice performance win.</p><blockquote><p>Users who actually want to use streaming translation simply can use the new <code>Module::new_streaming</code> API for their needs.</p></blockquote><h3 id="linker-caching">Linker Caching</h3><p>The Wasmi <code>Linker</code> is used to define the set of host functions that a Wasm binary can use to communicate with the host. Oftentimes, dozens of host functions are defined, which can quickly become costly.</p><p>To address this, Wasmi now offers a <code>LinkerBuilder</code>, which allows to efficiently instantiate new <code>Linker</code>s after the initial setup. <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p><p>Benchmarks with 50 defined host functions have demonstrated a 120x speedup using this approach.</p><h2 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h2><p>By combining all of the techniques above it is possible to speed up the startup time of Wasmi by several orders of magnitudes compared to the previous Wasmi v0.31.</p><p>The newest versions of all Wasm runtimes have been used at the time of writing this article. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p><blockquote><p>Currently, Winch only supports <code>x86_64</code> platforms and therefore was only tested on those systems.</p></blockquote><h3 id="erc-20---7kb">ERC-20 -

As expected, optimizing JIT-based Wasm runtimes like Wasmtime and Wasmer perform worse in this context. Single-pass JITs, which are designed for fast startup, such as <a href="https://crates.io/crates/wasmtime-winch">Winch</a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/wasmer-compiler-singlepass">Wasmer Singlepass</a>, are also significantly slower. Despite also using lazy translation, <a href="https://github.com/makepad/stitch">Stitch</a>’s translation performance is not ideal. However, it is important to note that both Winch and Stitch are still in an experimental phase of their development and improvements are to be expected.</p><h2 id="execution-speed">Execution Speed</h2><p>For an execution engine, the speed of computation is naturally of paramount importance. Unfortunately, the old Wasmi v0.31 left much to be desired in this regard.</p><h2 id="register-based-bytecode">Register-Based Bytecode</h2><p>The old Wasmi v0.31 internally uses a stack-based intermediate representation (IR) to drive execution. This IR is similar to WebAssembly bytecode and thus allows for fast translation times.</p><p>Stack-based IRs generally use more instructions to represent the same problem as register-based IRs. <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> However, the performance of interpreters is mostly dictated by the dispatch of instructions.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div class="page">
  <p>
    Published 27 May, 2024 by Louis Pilfold
  </p>
<p>Gleam is a type safe and scalable language for the Erlang virtual machine and
JavaScript runtimes. Today Gleam <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases/tag/v1.2.0">v1.2.0</a> has been published, a release
that focuses on improving the language server and developer experience. It’s a
big one both in terms of size and impact, so let’s take a look as what it
includes.</p>

<h2 id="fault-tolerant-compilation">Fault tolerant compilation</h2>

<p>Gleam’s compiler has traditionally halted immediately when a compile time error
was encountered, presenting the error to the programmer and requiring them to
fix it before compilation can be attempted again.</p>

<p>The main advantage of this is that the programmer has just the first and
most important error, rather than a mix of the real error and a bunch of
red-herring cascading errors. On the other hand, if there’s multiple genuine
errors the programmer can only see first the one, which may not be the one they
want to work on, or the most understandable.</p>

<p>Even worse, this halting behaviour causes major issues for the Gleam Language
Server (the engine that text editors like Neovim, Helix, Zed, and VS Code use to
get IDE features for Gleam). The language server internally uses the compiler to
build and analyse Gleam projects, so when the compiler halts with an error the
language server is left without up-to-date information about the code. Without a
successful build some language server features may not work, and the longer a
project goes without successful compilation (such as during a large refactoring)
the more drift there can be between the language server’s understanding of the
code and the reality.</p>

<p>With this release when the compiler encounters an error during analysis it will
move on to the next definition in the module, returning all of the errors along
with updated code information once the whole module has been analysed. This has
resulted in a dramatic improvement in the experience when using the Gleam
language server, it being much more responsive and accurate in its feedback.</p>

<p>In future releases we will continue to improve the granularity of the fault
tolerant compilation and we will also introduce fault tolerant parsing.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Acepie">Ameen Radwan</a> and myself for this feature!</p>

<h2 id="language-server-imports-improvements">Language server imports improvements</h2>

<p>This is a Gleam import statement:</p>
<pre><code>import gleam/option.{type Option, Some, None}
//     ^^^^^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
//      the module     unqualified imports
</code></pre>

<p>The language server could previously autocomplete module names, but now it can
also autocomplete types and values when importing them in the unqualified
fashion.</p>

<p>You can also hover types and values in an import statement to see their
documentation, and use go-to definition on them and the module itself to jump
to where they defined in your project or its dependencies.</p>

<h2 id="single-line-pipelines">Single line pipelines</h2>

<p>Gleam’s much loved <code>|&gt;</code> pipe operator can be used to pipe the output from one
function into the input of another, not dissimilar to <code>|</code> pipes in bash, etc.
Gleam’s code formatter would always put each function of a sequence of pipes on
individual lines, but now you can opt to put them all on one line, so long as
altogether they are short enough to fit.</p>
<pre><code>[1, 2, 3] |&gt; list.map(int.to_string) |&gt; string.join(with: "\n")
</code></pre>

<p>In addition you can also force the formatter to break a pipe on multiple lines
by adding a line break. This:</p>
<pre><code>[1, 2, 3] |&gt; list.map(int.to_string)
// By putting a newline here I'm telling the formatter to split the pipeline
|&gt; string.join(with: "\n")
</code></pre>

<p>Will turn into this:</p>
<pre><code>[1, 2, 3]
|&gt; list.map(int.to_string)
|&gt; string.join(with: "\n")
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you to our formatter wizard <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri">Giacomo Cavalieri</a>
for this feature!</p>

<h2 id="improved-error-messages-for-use-expressions">Improved error messages for <code>use</code> expressions</h2>

<p>Gleam’s <a href="https://tour.gleam.run/advanced-features/use-sugar/"><code>use</code> expressions</a>
are very powerful and can be used to replicate many built-in features of other
languages such as Go’s <code>defer</code>, procedural languages’ early returns, Haskell’s
do-notation, and more. As an unusual and powerful feature they can be confusing
at first, and that was made worse as any type errors from incorrect <code>use</code>
expressions would be generic ones rather than being specific to <code>use</code>.</p>

<p>These errors have been greatly refined and we hope this will help folks learning
the language and debugging their code. Here’s some specific examples:</p>

<p>This error message is used when the right-hand-side of <code>&lt;-</code> in a <code>use</code>
expression is not a function:</p>
<pre><code>error: Type mismatch
  ┌─ /src/one/two.gleam:2:8
  │
2 │ use &lt;- 123
  │        ^^^

In a use expression, there should be a function on the right hand side of
`&lt;-`, but this value has type:

    Int

See: https://tour.gleam.run/advanced-features/use/
</code></pre>

<p>This error message is used when the right-hand-side of <code>&lt;-</code> is a function,
but it takes no arguments:</p>
<pre><code>error: Incorrect arity
  ┌─ /src/one/two.gleam:3:8
  │
3 │ use &lt;- func
  │        ^^^^ Expected no arguments, got 1

The function on the right of `&lt;-` here takes no arguments.
But it has to take at least one argument, a callback function.

See: https://tour.gleam.run/advanced-features/use/
</code></pre>

<p>And this one is used when it takes arguments, but not the correct number of
arguments:</p>
<pre><code>error: Incorrect arity
  ┌─ /src/one/two.gleam:3:8
  │
3 │ use &lt;- f(1, 2)
  │        ^^^^^^^ Expected 2 arguments, got 3

The function on the right of `&lt;-` here takes 2 arguments.
All the arguments have already been supplied, so it cannot take the
`use` callback function as a final argument.

See: https://tour.gleam.run/advanced-features/use/
</code></pre>

<p>And more! Too many to list here. Thank you to <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri">Giacomo Cavalieri</a>
for these big improvements!</p>

<h2 id="typevalue-mix-up-feedback">Type/value mix up feedback</h2>

<p>One common mistake is to try and import a type as a value, or a value as a type.
When an imported item is found not to exist the compiler will now check to see
if there is a matching type or value and explain the mix-up.</p>
<pre><code>error: Unknown module field
  ┌─ /src/one/two.gleam:1:19
  │
1 │ import gleam/one.{One}
  │                   ^^^ Did you mean `type One`?

`One` is only a type, it cannot be imported as a value.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>error: Unknown module type
  ┌─ /src/one/two.gleam:1:19
  │
1 │ import gleam/two.{type Two}
  │                   ^^^^^^^^ Did you mean `Two`?

`Two` is only a value, it cannot be imported as a type.
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/Pi-Cla/">Pi-Cla</a> for this feature!</p>

<h2 id="assertion-exhaustiveness-checking">Assertion exhaustiveness checking</h2>

<p>Gleam has a <code>let assert</code> syntax to apply a pattern to a value, extracting values
contained within if the pattern matches, and crashing the program if it does
not.</p>

<p>The compiler now performs exhaustiveness checking on these assertions to find
patterns that are total and warn that the <code>assert</code> is redundant as a result.</p>
<pre><code>warning: Redundant assertion
  ┌─ /home/lucy/src/app/src/app.gleam:4:7
  │
4 │   let assert x = get_name()
  │       ^^^^^^ You can remove this

This assertion is redundant since the pattern covers all possibilities.
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri">Giacomo Cavalieri</a> for this feature.</p>

<h2 id="catching-common-crash-mistakes">Catching common crash mistakes</h2>

<p>Gleam has <code>todo</code> and <code>panic</code> expressions, both of which crash the program due to
it being incomplete or in an invalid state respectively. The syntax looks like
this:</p>
<pre><code>panic as "The session is no longer valid, this should never happen!"
</code></pre>

<p>A common mistake is to try and give the message string using the function call
syntax like so:</p>
<pre><code>panic("The session is no longer valid, this should never happen!")
</code></pre>

<p>This is valid Gleam code, but it is not using that string as a message for the
panic. The string unreachable as the program panics before it is evaluated. A
compiler warning is now emitted when code like this is found.</p>
<pre><code>warning: Todo used as a function
  ┌─ /src/warning/wrn.gleam:2:16
  │
2 │           todo(1)
  │                ^

`todo` is not a function and will crash before it can do anything with
this argument.

Hint: if you want to display an error message you should write
`todo as "my error message"`
See: https://tour.gleam.run/advanced-features/todo/
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri">Giacomo Cavalieri</a> for this feature!</p>

<h2 id="invalid-constant-error-message-improvement">Invalid constant error message improvement</h2>

<p>Gleam’s constants are limited to a subset of the language that be evaluated at
compile time, and as such arbitrary functions cannot be called within them.
Previously if you tried to call a function you would get a somewhat confusing
parse error, but with this version it’ll emit a much more helpful error message.</p>
<pre><code>error: Syntax error
  ┌─ /src/parse/error.gleam:3:18
  │
3 │ const wib: Int = wibble(1, "wobble")
  │                  ^^^^^^^ Functions can only be called within other functions
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/nino">Nino Annighoefer</a> for this improvement!</p>

<h2 id="unreachable-code-detection">Unreachable code detection</h2>

<p>Code that comes after a <code>panic</code> expression is unreachable and will never be
evaluated as the program will crash before it is reached. The compiler will now
warn in these situations to catch these mistakes.</p>

<p>For example, this code will emit this warning:</p>

<pre><code>pub fn main() {
  panic
  my_app.run()
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code>warning: Unreachable code
  ┌─ /src/warning/wrn.gleam:3:11
  │
3 │    my_app.run()
  │    ^^^^^^^^^^^^

This code is unreachable because it comes after a `panic`.
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri">Giacomo Cavalieri</a> for this feature!</p>

<h2 id="further-hex-integration">Further Hex integration</h2>

<p>Gleam is part of the Erlang ecosystem, and as such it uses the
<a href="https://hex.pm/">Hex package manager</a>.</p>

<p>The <code>gleam hex revert</code> has been added to the Gleam binary. It can be used to
unpublish a package release within the first 24 hours of it being published.
After 24 hours Hex package releases become immutable and cannot be removed.</p>

<p>Additionally the error message that is emitted when you attempt to publish a
package that has already been published has been improved:</p>
<pre><code>error: Version already published

Version v1.0.0 has already been published.
This release has been recently published so you can replace it
or you can publish it using a different version number

Hint: Please add the --replace flag if you want to replace the release.
</code></pre>

<h2 id="erlang-module-collision-prevention">Erlang module collision prevention</h2>

<p>The Erlang virtual machine supports loading new versions of existing module,
enabling an application to be upgraded while it is still running. One
unfortunate consequence of this is that if you accidentally reuse a module name
loading it into the VM will cause the application to be upgraded to the new
version, causing confusing errors as functions that no longer exist are called
and crash.</p>

<p>The Gleam build tool would return an error and refuse to compile Gleam modules
that would overwrite each other, but with this version it will also emit an
error if a Gleam module would overwrite a built-in Erlang/OTP module.</p>
<pre><code>error: Erlang module name collision

The module `src/code.gleam` compiles to an Erlang module named `code`.

By default Erlang includes a module with the same name so if we were to
compile and load your module it would overwrite the Erlang one, potentially
causing confusing errors and crashes.

Hint: Rename this module and try again.
</code></pre>



<p>A helpful error message is now shown if the <code>manifest.toml</code> file has become
invalid, perhaps due to a git rebase or accidental edit.</p>
<pre><code>error: Corrupt manifest.toml

The `manifest.toml` file is corrupt.

Hint: Please run `gleam update` to fix it.
</code></pre>

<p>Previously when no package versions could be found that satisfy the project’s
requirements a very cryptic message would printed that detailed all the
constraints from all the versions that were incompatible. This was overwhelming
and practically impossible to read, so it has been replaced with a much simpler
message.</p>
<pre><code>error: Dependency resolution failed

An error occurred while determining what dependency packages and
versions should be downloaded.
The error from the version resolver library was:

Unable to find compatible versions for the version constraints in your
gleam.toml. The conflicting packages are:

- hellogleam
- lustre_dev_tools
- glint

<h2 id="redundant-pattern-matching-warnings">Redundant pattern matching warnings</h2>

<p>Gleam’s case expressons support pattern matching on multiple values at the same
time. This is uncommon so people used to other languages may habitually wrap
multiple values in a tuple or a list to match on them. The compiler will now
warn when this is done:</p>
<pre><code>warning: Redundant list
  ┌─ /src/warning/wrn.gleam:2:14
  │
2 │         case [1, 2] {
  │              ^^^^^^ You can remove this list wrapper

Instead of building a list and matching on it, you can match on its
contents directly.
A case expression can take multiple subjects separated by commas like this:

    case one_subject, another_subject {
      _, _ -&gt; todo
    }

See: https://tour.gleam.run/flow-control/multiple-subjects/
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri">Giacomo Cavalieri</a> for this feature.</p>

<h2 id="redundant-pattern-matching-auto-fix">Redundant pattern matching auto-fix</h2>

<p>And further still, if you are using the Gleam language server then a code action
is offered to automatically fix redundant tuple wrappers. Place your cursor on
the tuple and select this language action and the language server will remove
the tuple from the values as well as from all patterns in the case expression.</p>
<pre><code>case #(x, y) {
  #(1, 2) -&gt; 0
  #(_, _) -&gt; 1
}
</code></pre>
<p>Is rewritten to:</p>
<pre><code>case x, y {
  1, 2 -&gt; 0
  _, _ -&gt; 1
}
</code></pre>
<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/nicklimmm">Nicky Lim</a> for this code action, and
for laying the foundation for other code actions like this in future!</p>

<h2 id="a-helping-hand-for-javascript-programmers">A helping hand for JavaScript programmers</h2>

<p>JavaScript programmers sometimes type <code>===</code> by mistake in their Gleam code. We
have an error message for that too now:</p>
<pre><code>error: Syntax error
  ┌─ /src/parse/error.gleam:4:37
  │
4 │   [1,2,3] |&gt; list.filter(fn (a) { a === 3 })
  │                                     ^^^ Did you mean `==`?

Gleam uses `==` to check for equality between two values.
See: https://tour.gleam.run/basics/equality

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>There are few things I think about more than the essays on
<a href="https://gwern.net/index">gwern.net</a>,
and there are few with as satisfying a theoretical payout
to contemplate in my orb as
<a href="https://gwern.net/note/pipeline">his essay on “leaky pipelines”</a>,
aka log-normal distributions.</p><p>The skulk: Say you’re working on a Laravel web app.
You’re about 90% sure you know how to start the app. You’re
80% sure you know how to handle the infra you’ll need to
get it online. And you’re 70% sure you know how to get your
first customer. What is your chance of successfully going
from zero to first customer? 0.9 * 0.8 * 0.7 = a little over
0.5. That’s … a lot less encouraging than any of the
previous numbers, if you buy my multi-step modelling.</p><p>Software estimation is such a mess in part because
it has trouble recognizing that, at least,
<a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/03/03/just-in-case-versus-just-in-time/">just-in-time</a>
learning is at least <em>non-normally distributed</em>.
Everything we know about traditional project management,
from Waterfall to Gantt charts to estimation practices,
are on some level based around the idea that each individual
step in the chain is bell-shaped: A process taking twice as
long as it normally does might be 2 standard deviations out,
aka in the bottom 2.5% of outcomes. But in a log-normal
distribution, processes taking two, three, or five times as
long are much more common, and this throws things into
disarray. Some things happen much faster than usual - but
doing one estimated week-long project in half the time,
and another estimated week-long project in twice the time,
still leaves you in the red for your time budget.</p><p>Needless to say, it is almost never the case that in
software development you know all or even most of the
technical hurdles you will face in the processs of development.
An
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis">efficient markets hypothesis</a>
fanboy might say “If anyone already knew how to do it, it would
already be done by now”. I’m not that optimistic, but
I do think this leaky-pipeline approach can shed light
on some more counterintuitive things about our industry.</p><p>Such as the relentless emphasis, not only on relevant experience,
but on <em>knowing your specific tooling</em> when you apply to a given
job. You and I might be hardcore enough computer geeks that we
can pick up any language and be productive in it within a few
weeks, but if that doesn’t hold for the <em>median</em> software
developer, then employers really are justified in deciding that
e.g. they only want to hire Java devs with previous experience
in… Java. If there’s a 20% chance it takes 1 month, 20% for
2 months, … 20% for 5 months before your non-Java-background
Java dev has enough experience to finally start contributing
to the Java codebase, then yeah, it makes a lot of sense not
to want to gamble on that. Not only do you face the possibility
of paying a five- or six-figure sum for someone who’s useless,
you have very little ability to estimate as an employer
yourself when they will become useful.</p><p>Now what’s really interesting about this theory is that
it suggests that <strong>business processes that are normally-distributed
are the exception, not the norm</strong>, in a sense.
<em>Every</em> new process a person has to undertake will have at
least some phase which is dominated by learning. That’s as
true of web dev as it is of learning to operate the drive-thru
at McDonald’s. It takes a special kind of rigor to transform
that into an activity routine and repeatable enough that you
get a long tail of normally-distributed, profitable activity.
Again, this makes sense: I’ve been building Django and Hugo
websites and web apps for a few years now, and I’ve been using
Python much longer than that, and I sort of have an intuitive
sense by now for how long either of them would take me.
That’s not because I’m some genius savant - it’s because I have
already flowed through the leaky pipeline enough times
to know how I like to approach most things. The instant I’m
in new territory, we’re back to the leaky pipeline.</p><p>It may be the case that academic,
<a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/03/03/just-in-case-versus-just-in-time/">just-in-case</a>
learning is less this way, because
the actual things you need to learn is carefully plotted
ahead of time for you. This would explain the popularity of
tutorials online, as ways to tamp down on the worst-case
scenario where that thing you thought would take you a week
to do ends up taking you a year. That being said, I definitely
had some classes in college that unexpectedly took way less
time to me (wireless communication, DSP) and some that
unexpectedly took way more (Maxwellian electromagnetism).</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

            <span>Abstract:</span>The poor performance of transformers on arithmetic tasks seems to stem in large part from their inability to keep track of the exact position of each digit inside of a large span of digits. We mend this problem by adding an embedding to each digit that encodes its position relative to the start of the number. In addition to the boost these embeddings provide on their own, we show that this fix enables architectural modifications such as input injection and recurrent layers to improve performance even further.
<br>With positions resolved, we can study the logical extrapolation ability of transformers. Can they solve arithmetic problems that are larger and more complex than those in their training data? We find that training on only 20 digit numbers with a single GPU for one day, we can reach state-of-the-art performance, achieving up to 99% accuracy on 100 digit addition problems. Finally, we show that these gains in numeracy also unlock improvements on other multi-step reasoning tasks including sorting and multiplication.

			<p><span>T</span>he act of naming is always a form of propaganda. When you name something, you are never perfectly describing what it is, but are instead influencing how it is perceived.</p>
<p>Marketers know this better than anyone. Prior to 1977, there was no such thing as the Chilean sea bass; the fish was called, instead, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patagonian_toothfish">the Pata­gonian toothfish</a>. The Chilean sea bass <a href="https://priceonomics.com/the-invention-of-the-chilean-sea-bass/">isn’t a type of bass at all</a>, and most of them do not come from Chile. It was purely a marketing invention: an entrepreneur named Lee Lantz intuited that the American market might enjoy the <em>taste</em> of the Patagonian toothfish, but would never buy it under its given name. First, he chose to falsely call it a “bass” because Americans were comfortable with that type of fish. He then rejected the names “Pacific sea bass” and “South American sea bass,” on the grounds that they were too generic, and eventually settled on “Chilean sea bass” as a more exotic alternative.</p>
<p>The name of one of the most popular fish in the world therefore has nothing to do with what the fish really is. A type of cod that is primarily farmed near Antarctica became the Chilean sea bass as a Goldilocks branding compromise. The familiarity of the bass was married to the perceived exoticism of Chile so that an American entrepreneur could sell a fish nobody had ever heard of to high-end restaurants in the United States. This ploy worked so well that today nobody has ever heard of the Patagonian toothfish, while the Chilean sea bass has a secure and inalienable position on restaurant menus from sea to shining sea.</p>
<p>So its name is propaganda, but nobody cares. A lie that makes money will always be preferable to a truth that does not. Once you realize that <em>every name is propaganda</em>, it becomes readily apparent how much misconduct, greed, and corruption can be concealed behind an innocuously disingenuous name, especially a name that successfully evokes positive emotions in the general public.</p>
<p>Consider the word “nonprofit.” Whoever came up with the idea of calling these organizations “nonprofits” was a marketing genius on the level of Steve Jobs. When someone hears the word nonprofit, they assume that such an organization is working for the public good; that it serves the homeless, protects the weak, exists for the benefit and the betterment of society at large. Hearing that something is a “nonprofit” immediately gives a sense that the organization is trustworthy and the people running it are driven by a charitable agenda. It’s a word that shuts down the critical faculties and grants an instantaneous moral stature to any organization to which it is applied. Consequently, non­profits receive a benefit of the doubt that would not be granted to any other form of private corporation.</p>
<p>Yet nonprofit organizations are frequently the exact opposite of what they appear to be. As a consequence of the benefit of the doubt provided to nonprofits, there is rarely enough oversight to guarantee that they are doing what we pay them to do. In some cities, upwards of a billion dollars of public funds are paid to nonprofit organizations every year with glaringly insufficient safeguards to ensure that the money is used in a manner likely to serve the public interest.</p>
<p>This money is then spent in ways that would shock the taxpayers whose hard-earned dollars are being effectively stolen from them. Non­profits that self-righteously declare themselves providers of homeless services actively lobby to make homelessness worse in order to increase their own funding; nonprofit organizations hire convicted <span>felons—including</span> murderers, gang leaders, sex offenders, and <span>rapists—who</span> go on to commit more felonies while receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in government contracts; and the executives of nonprofits, the very people in charge of institutions whose stated purpose is not to make money, earn millions of dollars while catastrophically failing to deliver the public services we are paying them to provide.</p>
<p>And as all of that is going on, the nonprofits in question receive tax breaks from the IRS, ensuring that the incompetent organizations wors­ening your city’s homelessness crisis exert their corrupting influence all the way to the halls of power in Washington, D.C.</p>
<h3><span><strong>Money for Nothing</strong></span></h3>
<p>There is a notorious nonprofit in San Francisco called the Tenants and Owners Development Corporation, or <span>todco</span> for short. The Tenants and Owners Development Corporation, despite containing the word “development” in its name, has not developed a single property <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/He-s-been-blamed-for-killing-housing-but-16630332.php">in approximately twenty years</a>. More and more, <span>todco</span> isn’t spending its money to help its current tenants, either. The <em>San Francisco Standard</em> found that <span>todco</span>’s spending on resident services declined from 62 percent of revenue in 2012 <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2023/03/09/sf-housing-nonprofit-todco-politics-tenants-infestations-drug-overdose/">to only 45 percent eight years later</a>. The Standard interviewed tenants in one of <span>todco</span>’s buildings and was deluged with complaints about decaying accommodations and rodent infestations. A woman told them bluntly that there were rats in the walls and complaints to management went nowhere; the tap water tasted foul and she sometimes found roaches in her food. One man felt a bite on his neck and assumed at first that he’d been bitten by one of the multitude of vermin that crawled through the building’s light fixtures; in fact, he’d been accidentally shot and the bullet hole was still visible in his wall when reporters interviewed him several months after the fact.</p>
<p>It turned out that instead of spending money on housing development and tenant support, <span>todco</span> boosted executive pay and funneled millions into lobbying. As <span>todco</span>’s spending on its tenants declined by 17 percentage points, executive pay quadrupled. Meanwhile, <span>todco</span>’s president, John Elberling, launched the Yerba Buena Neighborhood Consortium, a political lobbying organization. Between 2012 and 2020, <span>todco</span>’s direct lobbying of legislative bodies increased <em>95 times</em>, from $5,000 to $470,000. The Yerba Buena Neighborhood Consortium spent another $1.35 million on ballot referenda between 2016 and 2021, and within the small pond of municipal politics, that much money, if strategically deployed, can buy a shocking amount of influence.</p>
<p>Here’s where the story gets strange. Although <span>todco</span>’s nonprofit status is predicated on helping poor people afford housing, <span>todco</span> lobbies incessantly to prevent the construction of affordable units in some of San Francisco’s most expensive neighborhoods. In 2018, <span>todco</span> sued to prevent the construction of a mixed-use building on the grounds <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2023/03/09/sf-housing-nonprofit-todco-politics-tenants-infestations-drug-overdose/">that it would cast “new shadows”</a> on a community garden; <span>todco</span> then agreed to drop this lawsuit after the building’s developer paid them $98,000, raising questions as to whether <span>todco</span> was merely using San Francisco’s byzantine permitting process to extract a bribe from another developer. In another case, <span>todco</span> lobbied to block a <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2021/10/28/supervisors-under-fire-vote-against-proposed-soma-apartment-building-sparks-furor-may-violate-state-law/">495-unit housing development</a> that would have included over a hundred affordable units. In other words, an affordable housing nonprofit has repeatedly sued other developers to prevent the construction of the same affordable units that it is supposed to be working to provide.</p>
<p>And then, in July of 2020, the strangest of <span>todco</span>’s fiascos took place. That year, <span>todco</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/bayarea/heatherknight/article/san-francisco-housing-17408816.php">prevented the construction</a> of over one thousand new apartments, including 350 affordable units, so it could run a “racial equity study,” which it then never bothered to conduct. San Francisco Supervisor Dean <span>Preston—a</span> <span>todco</span> political <span>ally—convinced</span> the land use committee to put off the development for six months, during which time <span>todco</span> would supposedly analyze the development’s impact on minority residents in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>By August 2022, <span>todco</span> had not even begun the study that was supposed to have been completed eighteen months earlier. When asked by reporters from the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> why the study had never been done, <span>todco</span>’s president told the <em>Chronicle</em> that Covid interfered with their plans and a consulting group they’d been relying on had dropped out. Both of these excuses are highly dubious. When <span>todco</span> lobbied to delay the housing development so it could run its mythic study, Covid had already been rampaging through the United States for six months, meaning that <span>todco</span> was not blindsided by Covid and cannot use it as an excuse for failure. Furthermore, one consulting group dropping out should not indefinitely delay a study when the organization running it has millions of dollars in annual revenue, tens of millions of dollars in total assets, and a bevy of political connections. If <span>todco</span> wanted to run the study they could have done so, but they have exhibited no sense of urgency despite the fact that their failure to conduct the promised study has indefinitely prevented the existence of 350 units of affordable housing.</p>
<p><span>Todco</span> is a nonprofit whose mandate is to provide affordable housing. Over the last twenty years, however, <span>todco</span> has produced no additional units of affordable housing, has allowed the units it already owns to decay, and has spent millions of dollars preventing other developers from building thousands of apartments and hundreds of affordable units. Paradoxically, a nonprofit meant to provide affordable housing is spending taxpayer money to prevent affordable housing from being built; an organization that exists with the explicit mandate to help alleviate San Francisco’s housing crisis is instead working tirelessly to make that crisis worse. How can this be explained?</p>
<p>To understand <span>todco</span>’s behavior, you need to know something about the business model of affordable housing nonprofits. An afford­able housing NGO makes more money as rents rise in the area where its buildings are located. Government subsidies make up the difference between what the NGO’s tenants are paying and what they <em>could be paying</em> if the building charged them the market rate. This means that a nonprofit, despite its name, has the <em>same profit incentive</em> as any other landlord, in that a lack of housing construction increases its profit margins by driving up rents. The only difference is that a nonprofit benefits from high rents through government subsidies instead of from directly charging its tenants.</p>
<p>And that is an obvious conflict of interest. Nonprofit housing providers <em>benefit financially</em> if less housing gets built because high rents increase their subsidies. Affordable housing nonprofits are therefore incentivized to work against housing affordability if they want to increase the amount their executives get paid. Everything <span>todco</span> is doing is a natural consequence of the nonprofit industrial complex. T<span>odco</span>’s subsidies rise in concert with rents; it then funnels the money it receives from the government back into lobbying the same politicians responsible for funding it; those politicians prevent the construction of housing on <span>todco</span>’s behalf, thereby ensuring that rents remain high and <span>todco</span> rakes in millions of additional dollars in government subsidies; and <span>todco</span>’s executives receive enormous boosts to personal compensation and buy million-dollar houses in the suburbs. It is a kickback scheme so ingenious it would make Al Capone green with envy.</p>
<p>This propensity for nonprofits to privilege their own finances over the needs of the poor is not unique to San Francisco. Last year, an initiative to establish a public social housing developer in Seattle <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220713083723/https:/www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/a-new-tool-or-a-distraction-seattle-social-housing-initiative-faces-early-opposition/">was opposed by the Housing Development Consortium</a>, a lobbying organ­ization for affordable housing nonprofits. The <em>Seattle Times’</em> reporting on this initiative is revealing:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Housing Development Consortium, a lobbying group whose members include King County’s major low-income housing de­velopers, financial institutions and governmental development agencies, <em>doesn’t want to compete with a new organization for funding</em>.</p>
<p>The Housing Development Consortium argues that Seattle should focus its resources on the existing system . . . <em>which in­volves a collaboration between the largely federally funded Seattle Housing Authority, local public development agencies and other nonprofit organizations</em> [emphasis added].</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, a lobbying organization for affordable housing nonprofits advocated against a social housing initiative on the grounds that it would direct funds away from its members. Many of the people involved in these affordable housing nonprofits would describe them­selves as socialists, and yet they argued <em>against</em> a more socialist form of public housing development and in favor of the privatized, complex, and inefficient system that just so happens to financially benefit themselves.</p>
<p>In the event that America tried to dramatically increase the amount of public housing, a policy advocated by many progressives, it is likely that some of the fiercest opponents would be nonprofit landlords who would be outraged at the prospect of direct competition from government-owned housing. This is normal behavior for a private organization that relies on the government as its primary revenue source, but it is directly contrary to what the term “nonprofit” would seem to imply. Despite their trustworthy name, nonprofits are not <span>now—nor</span> have they ever <span>been—the</span> uncorrupted agents of the public good that their defend­ers would have us believe.</p>
<h3><span><strong>Crime Inc.</strong></span></h3>
<p>Exacerbating the profound conflicts of interest created by outsourcing government services to private nonprofits is the near total lack of oversight of these nonprofits, particularly with respect to how their money is spent and whom they hire to provide their services. It is a regular occurrence that money given to nonprofits is misdirected in a way ruinously contrary to the public interest. In especially egregious cases, money given to nonprofits finds its way into the pockets of people who never would have been hired by a government agency due to either a lack of competence or a disqualifying criminal history.</p>
<p>For instance, San Francisco gave tens of millions of dollars to a nonprofit called the United Council of Human Services over the course of two decades; <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2023/02/10/sf-homeless-nonprofit-ceo-lavish-lifestyle-illegal-activity-lawsuit/">their CEO proceeded to spend large sums of money in a totally illegal manner</a>, buying at least five vehicles for herself and family members and driving around with a trunk full of expensive jewelry. She also allowed twenty of her friends, family, and employees to occupy government-subsidized apartments which were meant to be used as housing for low-income San Franciscans.</p>
<p>There is always going to be <em>some</em> level of malfeasance when large sums of money are involved, but what makes the United Council’s criminality inexcusable is that Gwendolyn Westbrook, the CEO who stole taxpayer dollars and spent them on herself, <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/port-official-to-be-arraigned-in-embezzling-3109308.php">pleaded guilty in 1997 to stealing thousands of dollars in parking lot collections</a> while working for the Port of San Francisco. A nonprofit run by a woman with a proven history of stealing from government agencies was given tens of millions of dollars to provide affordable housing services, and San Francisco’s political class was somehow surprised when, true to her previous track record, she stole that money, too.</p>
<p>Following Westbrook’s fall from grace, a <em>San Francisco Standard</em> investigation discovered that the city had paid <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2023/01/12/san-francisco-nonprofits-revoked-suspended-delinquent-millions/">tens of millions of dollars to nonprofits that were ineligible for government funding</a>: $25 million went to charities that were either delinquent or suspended and another $65 million went to nonprofits that were later declared ineligible. At the time of the <em>Standard</em>’s investigation, San Francisco had another $300 million of future contractual obligations to NGOs it was not legally allowed to fund.</p>
<p>Although San Francisco is one of the worst cities when it comes to nonprofits behaving badly, these same problems exist in every city that makes excessive use of the nonprofit sector. Seattle, in particular, has a rather distressing tendency to give exorbitant sums of taxpayer money to convicted felons, up to and including violent criminals and registered sex offenders. In 2001, a man named Khalid Adams was convicted of first degree theft in an incident in which he allegedly <a href="https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=20010329&amp;slug=mardigras29m1">groped his victim while shouting racial slurs</a>; two years later Adams was convicted again, this time of first degree robbery and unlawful possession of a firearm. Adams’s <span>third—but</span> not <span>final—conviction</span> came in 2021 when he pled guilty to unlawful possession of a firearm by a previously convicted felon.</p>
<p>Only a year after Adams’s third conviction, however, he was hired to work as a “violence interrupter” by a government-funded Seattle-area nonprofit called Community Passageways. In November 2022, while receiving a salary from King County taxpayers to prevent gun violence, <a href="https://www.kuow.org/stories/king-county-gave-millions-to-no-new-youth-jail-activists-to-help-kids-then-they-looked-away">Adams broke into his ex-girlfriend’s apartment, held her new boyfriend at gunpoint, and was subsequently shot by the ex’s eighteen-year-old cousin</a>. Adding a surreal element to this already incredible story, Savior Wheeler, the young cousin who shot Khalid Adams, <em>was a client of Community Passageways</em>, one of the same at-risk young people that Adams was supposed to keep away from gun violence. A Seattle nonprofit therefore hired a three-time convicted felon who was fresh out of prison to work as a mentor for at-risk youths, and he was subsequently shot by one of those very at-risk youths while threatening an ex-girlfriend at gunpoint.</p>
<p>This is a surprisingly common occurrence in Seattle. In 2022, the city <a href="https://www.kuow.org/stories/renegades-for-life">gave $260,000 dollars to a registered sex offender who was operating under a fake name and credentials</a> to mentor at-risk young people. In 2020, they gave a $3 million no-bid <span>contract—one</span> of the largest grants in city <span>history—to</span> a nonprofit called Freedom Project <a href="https://sccinsight.com/2021/03/08/black-brilliance-research-project-wraps-up-with-allegations-recriminations-but-no-city-investigation/">to run a “racial equity study.”</a> Freedom Project’s executive director at the time <a href="https://sccinsight.com/2021/07/29/the-black-brilliance-research-project-beginning-to-end-part-2/">was David Heppard</a> who was convicted as a teenager <a href="https://washington.lexroll.com/in-re-personal-restraint-of-heppard-25154-0-ii-wash-app-2-9-2001/">for taking part in the gang rape of a pregnant seventeen-year-old</a>. Freedom Project’s finance director, <a href="https://freedomprojectwa.org/staff/">Quddafi Howell</a>, <a href="https://casetext.com/case/state-v-howell-57/#f33e5844-49ea-4a7e-a9aa-8d5835fe0078-fn1">once shot up a man’s house as an intimidation tactic to prevent him from snitching on Howell’s drug dealing</a>.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, the $3 million Seattle handed over to a bunch of convicted felons was somehow mismanaged. A local political blog called <em>Seattle City Council Insight</em> looked into the paperwork behind this contract and discovered that <a href="https://sccinsight.com/2021/07/29/the-black-brilliance-research-project-beginning-to-end-part-3/">hundreds of thousands of dollars were handed out to subcontractors for minimal work</a> and the project’s lead was paid <em>$300 per hour</em> while publicly claiming to be a volunteer.</p>
<p>In another case, a homelessness nonprofit called share (the Seattle Housing and Resource Effort) <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/seattle-weighs-charges-over-homeless-nonprofits-use-of-unlicensed-accountant/">turned out to employ an unlicensed accountant</a> at the same time they were handling millions of dollars in government funds. Share claimed that they were the victim in this case, as they were unknowingly defrauded by a man who held himself out as a legitimate accountant. Fair enough. Share, however, might have noticed that their accountant was unlicensed were it not for the fact that share’s <em>treasurer</em>, the man presumably responsible for handling all their money, <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/display_990/911577965/12_2017_prefixes_84-91%2F911577965_201612_990_2017121215021639">was Lantz Rowland</a>, <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/tent-city-dispute-sends-homeless-packing/">an unqualified homeless man who lived in a tent</a>. This nonprofit <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/911577965">had total annual revenue of approximately a million dollars in 2016</a>, which included grants from King County and the City of Seattle, and the people responsible for handling that money were an illegal accountant and a sixty-year-old homeless tent dweller with no discernible qualifications.</p>
<p>Leaving the West Coast for a moment, one finds similar outcomes arising from the overuse of nonprofits in the Windy City. In Chicago, an anti-violence nonprofit called CeaseFire has had a shocking number of its “violence interrupters” <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2018/4/10/18328589/ceasefire-worker-gets-27-months-in-prison-for-federal-gun-conviction">arrested for serious crimes since its incep­tion</a>. This ought to surprise nobody given that these “violence interrupters” are almost universally convicted felons. Ceasefire workers convicted of crimes while employed by the organization include <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2018/4/10/18328589/ceasefire-worker-gets-27-months-in-prison-for-federal-gun-conviction">a fifty-one-year-old arrested for illegal gun possession</a>, whom authorities alleged was also moonlighting as a national gang leader; a convicted felon <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/01/13/chicago-police-arrest-jerel-taylor-for-guns-and-drugs/">caught naked under his bed with $50,000, an illegal firearm, crack cocaine, and heroin</a>; and a woman who was hired despite four prior felony convictions and <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/ceasefire-worker-charged-in-diamond-theft/64106/">subsequently stole $10,000 worth of diamonds</a>.</p>
<p>Chicago also has a state-funded <a href="https://www.illinois.gov/news/press-release.26485.html#:~:text=CHICAGO%E2%80%94Ahead%20of%20Memorial%20Day,in%20the%20City%20of%20Chicago.">“Peacekeepers” program</a> in which “community-based organizations” deploy former convicts to act as vio­lence interrupters during times when tensions are expected to be high. Last Memorial Day, a “Peacekeeper” named Oscar Montes <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/man-in-peacekeepers-vest-charged-with-robbing-beating-man-in-little-village/3150581/">assaulted a motorist while on duty</a>, leaving the man with potentially permanent eye damage. Montes was hired by the Peacekeepers program only a year after serving a ten-year prison sentence for shooting a rival gang member.</p>
<p>What is instantly noticeable about the above examples is that none of these people could draw a government paycheck <em>unless it was laundered through a nonprofit</em>. A police department could never hire a convicted felon with long-term ties to street gangs, but a private nonprofit has looser standards regarding who is allowed access to public funds. This not only squanders money on people who are not capable of performing the roles they’re assigned, but is an active threat to public safety in circumstances where the state uses convict-staffed nonprofits for duties that ought to be reserved for the police.</p>
<h3><span><strong>The Progressive Doom Loop</strong></span></h3>
<p>At the start of this piece, I said that “the act of naming is a form of propaganda,” an aphorism which applies to nonprofits because the name they’ve been given is a marketing device, rather than an objective representation of their conduct and behavior. It’s important to recognize, though, that nonprofits aren’t the only group relevant to this story that has been given an inaccurate name as a marketing ploy. The political ideology that supports the nonprofit industrial complex is generally referred to as “progressivism,” which calls to mind the socialist-leaning Progressive movement of the early twentieth century. In spite of sharing a common name, however, today’s “progressivism” has nothing in common with the Progressive movements of the last century, is not socialist in any real sense, and is, if anything, an extremist libertarian movement that destroys the ability of the government to function, rather than using state power for the betterment of the poor.</p>
<p>Once you start digging into the evidence, you find that the places where “progressives” wield the most power are some of the <em>least</em> socialist governments in the country. In 2022, San Francisco <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230327233844/https:/www.sfchronicle.com/projects/2023/san-francisco-contracts/">spent $5.8 billion on private contracts</a>, over 40 percent of all city government spending, while the entire budget of Houston, a city 2.5 times as large, <a href="https://communityimpact.com/houston/heights-river-oaks-montrose/government/2022/06/02/houston-city-council-approves-fiscal-year-2022-23-budget/">was only $5.7 billion</a>. It is a strange form of socialism that runs more than two-fifths of its government through private contractors, instead of using publicly owned developers and social housing.</p>
<p>Portland, Oregon, meanwhile, has been suffering from a serious trash crisis for the past several years, due both to the city’s soaring homeless population and the government’s refusal to enforce antidumping laws. Portland’s response to the festering trash piles now blighting a once-beautiful city has not been to dramatically increase the government’s capacity to pick up and process garbage; instead, Portland, in conjunction with the state of Oregon, <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2023/06/15/oregon-multnomah-county-fund-portland-trash-clean-up-program/">has paid millions of dollars to </a><a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2023/06/15/oregon-multnomah-county-fund-portland-trash-clean-up-program/">nonprofits</a><a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2023/06/15/oregon-multnomah-county-fund-portland-trash-clean-up-program/"> to deal with the trash problem</a>.</p>
<p>As Portland outsourced trash collection to private nonprofit organi­zations, the ability of the <em>government</em> to collect trash has been gutted by budget cuts and a lack of resources. According to <a href="https://www.kgw.com/article/news/local/the-story/portland-task-force-trash-garbage-cleanup-downtown-central-city/283-2d09202c-837c-4147-b47d-69da51dfdd32">local activist Frank Moscow</a>, Portland used to sweep every street as a matter of course, but currently only has one functioning street sweeper in the entire city. Not that it matters much, <a href="https://www.portland.gov/transportation/maintenance/street-sweeping#:~:text=street%20cleaning%20pilot-,Overview,street%20sweeping%20June%2030%2C%202023.">since Portland’s Bureau of Transportation sus­pended all street sweeping activities last June after another series of budget cuts</a>.</p>
<p>Adding to Portland’s trash-addled misery is the city’s inability to stop anyone from dumping their trash where it is not legally allowed to do so. In 2016, <a href="https://www.oregonmetro.gov/news/illegal-dumping-year-numbers">the city issued thirty-one citations for illegal dumping</a>; in 2021, <a href="https://kpic.com/news/local/homeless-not-only-ones-contributing-to-portlands-trash-problem">they issued a grand total of one citation</a>, for a measly $154. <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2022/03/opinion-volunteers-alone-cant-clean-up-portlands-trash.html">An opinion column published in the <em>Oregonian</em> in 2022</a> asserted confidently that “you could dump 10 large bags of garbage in Pioneer Square tonight and drive off without fear of being caught or penalized,” before going on to complain that Portland picks up trash from residential units <em>every two weeks,</em> instead of offering weekly trash pickup like almost every other city of comparable size.</p>
<p>This is the state of affairs in almost every city where “progressives” have a large impact on local politics. Progressives claim to support government spending programs, but <em>also</em> have an anarchistic, anti-governmental attitude that can be seen in their support for policies like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/opinion/sunday/floyd-abolish-defund-police.html">police abolition in 2020</a>. Although progressives want the government to <em>fund</em> public programs, their opposition to centralized state power means they often don’t want the government to <em>run</em> the programs being funded.</p>
<p>The cities progressives control therefore tend to underfund core government agencies in favor of “community-based organizations,” by which they mean NGOs and nonprofits. Once the government can no longer meet its responsibilities, progressive cities outsource those ser­vices to nonprofit organizations, effectively privatizing the government.</p>
<p>A serious problem then occurs. Using several nonprofits instead of one government agency is inherently inefficient due to weak oversight and an inability to take advantage of economies of scale. That’s why cities on the West Coast spend so much on homelessness to no end whatsoever. San Francisco’s spending on homeless services increased from <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/2022/san-francisco-sros/">$200 million in 2016 to an astronomical $1.1 billion in 2021</a>. Despite this incredible investment, on an average night <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2022/05/sf-homeless-drop-pit-count-sip-hotels/">there were a thousand more homeless San Franciscans in 2022 than there were in 2015</a>. In fairness, there was a decline in the city’s homeless population between 2019 and 2022, leading the deputy director at the San Francisco Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing to declare that “investment works.” Yet San Francisco’s population <a href="https://datacommons.org/tools/timeline#&amp;place=geoId/0667000&amp;statsVar=Count_Person">fell by seventy thousand resi­dents between 2019 and 2022</a>, meaning the miniscule re­duction in homelessness was likely a mere by-product of massive population loss.</p>
<p>Nor are the problems that cities like San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle have with falling population unrelated. By funding inefficient nonprofits instead of more centralized, accountable government initia­tives, progressive cities have high <em>taxes</em> but poor <em>services</em>; residents receive nothing in return for the taxes they pay. <a href="https://www.koin.com/news/portland/report-high-tax-rates-could-be-driving-people-out-of-portland/#:~:text=According%20to%20their%20data%2C%20Portland's,have%20to%20make%20%2425%20million.">Portland has one of the highest municipal income tax burdens in the country</a>, <a href="https://www.wweek.com/news/2022/09/28/portland-ranks-48th-among-50-big-cities-for-cops-per-capita/">but is forty-eighth out of the fifty largest cities in police staffing</a>, has piles of festering, uncollected garbage littering its streets, and only has two thousand shelter beds <a href="https://www.portland.gov/wheeler/homelessness#:~:text=The%20complexity%20of%20the%20homelessness,from%201%2C887%20to%206%2C297%20individu">for a homeless population of 6,300</a>, requiring four thousand homeless Portlanders to sleep outside even if every one of them wanted a bed.</p>
<p>Contrary to the conservative assumption that high taxes are an inherent evil, people are often fine with higher taxes provided that the taxes are utilized to improve local living standards. What is taking place in America’s most performatively socialist urban areas is that taxes are constantly raised in order to fund public services, resulting in some of the most heavily taxed populations in the country. But this tax revenue is then squandered on private contracts to unaccountable nonprofit organizations whose activities do little to rectify the problems they are nominally being funded to address.</p>
<p>Taxes soar in concert with the collapse in local living standards and the decay in public services. Public parks where children used to play fill up with homeless drug addicts who leave used needles near jungle gyms; a six-year-old girl in California mistook a syringe for a thermometer <a href="https://abc7news.com/needles-found-in-sf-left-on-streets-report-study-san-francisco/2226877/">and put it in her mouth</a>, and an eleven-year-old stepped on a needle while swimming in Santa Cruz. The streets grow increasingly unsanitary due to spiraling homelessness, reintroducing diseases once considered eradi­cated by civilized living. Los Angeles <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/03/health/fleaborne-typhus-la-county-cdc-wellness/index.html">had three deaths from flea-borne typhus in 2022</a>, the first such deaths in three decades; a reverend who works on Skid Row <a href="https://www.dailynews.com/2016/12/10/homeless-advocate-who-lost-leg-walking-skid-row-returns-to-the-streets/">lost both legs to an infection he contracted simply walking the neighborhood’s streets</a>; and Portland’s Old Town recently experienced an outbreak of Shigella, a disease mostly seen in developing countries that <a href="https://www.kgw.com/article/news/local/homeless/contagious-illness-spreads-old-town-hospital/283-c5856d2a-c962-4270-b5b9-4d111abe9697">spreads through fecal matter</a>.</p>
<p>The inability of nonprofits to properly manage services results in European taxes for third-world state capacity. Residents don’t know what the problem is: they don’t know that their taxes go to “violence interrupters” who are convicted felons; they don’t know affordable housing nonprofits use taxpayer money to lobby against affordable housing; and they don’t know money is being misallocated due to insuf­ficient oversight of nonprofits.</p>
<p>All they know is they pay high taxes for no reason. And so they leave. Oregon’s largest county <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2023/03/multnomah-county-lost-residents-faster-than-any-other-oregon-county-census-bureau-says.html#:~:text=a%20million%20people.-,Oregon's%20largest%20county%20shed%202.5%25%20of%20its%20population%20from%20April,lost%20more%20than%2010%2C500%20residents.">lost 2.5 percent of its population between 2020 and 2022</a>. As the population declines, the tax base shrinks. San Francisco’s sales tax revenue <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/downtown-sf-retail-18076696.php">fell 22 percent between 2019 and 2022</a>, with the worst decline seen downtown, where office buildings <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2023/04/05/downtown-san-francisco-vacancies-hit-record-high-as-city-nears-breaking-point/">now have record-high vacancy rates</a>.</p>
<p>Many articles have been written recently about the threat such cities face <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/06/the-urban-doom-loop-threatening-cities-like-new-york-and-san-francisco.html">of an “urban doom loop,”</a> in which a falling population guts tax revenue, which forces cuts to city services, thus reducing livability and causing an accelerating population exodus in a vicious cycle. To my knowledge, however, nobody has ever argued that a major contributor to this death spiral is outsourcing government services to unaccountable nonprofit organizations, rather than increasing state capacity and im­proving the government’s ability to solve problems itself. In this contrarian narrative, American cities are not failing because they’re too socialist; they’re failing because they aren’t socialist enough.</p>
<p>And that, alas, is the state of the great American city in the early twenty-first century, where nothing is as it seems. Ours is a country where “progressivism” has nothing in common with the movement from which it takes its name; where “socialists” privatize government services at every opportunity; and where countless “nonprofits” exist solely for the misbegotten profit of the people who run them. Again and again, the names we use to explain the realities of modern urban politics are propagandistic marketing terms and not an accurate representation of what is taking place.</p>
<p>Just like with the invention of the Chilean Sea Bass, <span>however—which</span> is neither Chilean nor a <span>bass—many</span> people are making money off the scheme. Who cares if it’s all a lie?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>On Sunday, May 5th, I received an email from a person claiming to have access to a massive leak of API documentation from inside Google’s Search division. The email further claimed that these leaked documents were confirmed as authentic by ex-Google employees, and that those ex-employees and others had shared additional, private information about Google’s search operations.</p>
<p>Many of their claims directly contradict <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-ctr-search-rankings-27157.html">public statements</a> made by Googlers over the years, in particular the company’s <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-ctr-dwell-time-signals-myths-27083.html">repeated denial</a> that <a href="https://www.blindfiveyearold.com/is-click-through-rate-a-ranking-signal">click-centric user signals</a> are employed, <a href="https://iloveseo.com/seo/google-says-subdomains-vs-subfolders-doesnt-matter/">denial</a> that subdomains are considered separately in rankings, <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-sandbox-nope-28082.html">denials</a> of a sandbox for newer websites, <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-domain-age-23697.html">denials</a> that a domain’s age is collected or considered, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naturally, I was skeptical. The claims made by this source (who asked to remain anonymous) seemed extraordinary–claims like:</p>
<ul>
<li>In their early years, Google’s search team recognized a need for full clickstream data (every URL visited by a browser) for a large percent of web users to improve their search engine’s result quality.</li>
<li>A system called “NavBoost” (cited by VP of Search, Pandu Nayak, in his <a href="https://thecapitolforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/101823-USA-v-Google-PM.pdf">DOJ case testimony</a>) initially gathered data from Google’s <a href="https://moz.com/blog/what-is-googles-pagerank-good-for-whiteboard-friday">Toolbar PageRank</a>, and desire for more clickstream data served as the key motivation for creation of the Chrome browser (<a href="https://www.npr.org/2008/09/05/94299337/google-launches-chrome-web-browser">launched</a> in 2008).</li>
<li>NavBoost uses the number of searches for a given keyword to identify trending search demand, the number of clicks on a search result (I ran <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/queries-clicks-influence-googles-results/">several</a> <a href="https://x.com/randfish/status/1704722903550644430">experiments</a> on this from 2013-2015), and long clicks versus short clicks (which I <a href="https://moz.com/blog/impact-of-queries-and-clicks-on-googles-rankings-whiteboard-friday">presented theories about in this 2015 video</a>).</li>
<li>Google utilizes cookie history, logged-in Chrome data, and pattern detection (referred to in the leak as “unsquashed” clicks versus “squashed” clicks) as effective means for fighting manual &amp; automated click spam.</li>
<li>NavBoost also scores queries for user intent. For example, certain thresholds of attention and clicks on videos or images will trigger video or image features for that query and related, NavBoost-associated queries.</li>
<li>Google examines clicks and engagement on searches both during and after the main query (referred to as a “NavBoost query”). For instance, if many users search for “Rand Fishkin,” don’t find SparkToro, and immediately change their query to “SparkToro” and click SparkToro.com in the search result, SparkToro.com (and websites mentioning “SparkToro”) will receive a boost in the search results for the “Rand Fishkin” keyword.</li>
<li>NavBoost’s data is used at the host level for evaluating a site’s overall quality (my anonymous source speculated that this could be what Google and SEOs called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k06ezwACeNM">Panda</a>”). This evaluation can result in a boost or a demotion.</li>
<li>Other minor factors such as penalties for domain names that exactly match unbranded search queries (e.g. mens-luxury-watches.com or milwaukee-homes-for-sale.net), a newer “BabyPanda” score, and spam signals are also considered during the quality evaluation process.</li>
<li>NavBoost geo-fences click data, taking into account country and state/province levels, as well as mobile versus desktop usage. However, if Google lacks data for certain regions or user-agents, they may apply the process universally to the query results.</li>
<li>During the Covid-19 pandemic, Google employed whitelists for websites that could appear high in the results for Covid-related searches</li>
<li>Similarly, during democratic elections, Google employed whitelists for sites that should be shown (or demoted) for election-related information</li>
</ul>
<p>And these are only the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. And while some of these overlap with information revealed during the Google/DOJ case (some of which <a href="https://x.com/randfish/status/1288980563219513345">you can read about on this thread from 2020</a>), many are novel and suggest insider knowledge.</p>
<p>So, this past Friday, May 24th (following several emails), I had a video call with the anonymous source.</p>

<p>Prior to the email and call, I had neither met nor heard of the person who emailed me about this leak. They asked that their identity remain veiled, and that I merely include the quote below:</p>
<p><em>An eagle uses the storm to reach unimaginable heights.</em><br>– Matshona Dhliwayo</p>
<p>After the call I was able to confirm details of their work history, mutual people we both know from the marketing world, and several of their claims about being at particular events with industry insiders (including Googlers), though I cannot confirm details of the meetings nor the content of discussions they claim to have had.</p>
<p>During our call, this contact showed me the leak itself: more than 2,500 pages of API documentation containing 14,014 attributes (API features) that appear to come from Google’s internal “Content API Warehouse.” Based on the document’s commit history, this code was uploaded to GitHub on Mar 27, 2024th and not removed until May 7, 2024th.</p>
<p>This documentation doesn’t show things like the weight of particular elements in the search ranking algorithm, nor does it prove which elements are used in the ranking systems. But, it does show incredible details about data Google collects. Here’s an example of the document format:</p>

<p>After walking me through a handful of these API modules, the source explained their motivations (around transparency, holding Google to account, etc.) and their hope: that I would publish an article sharing this leak, revealing some of the many interesting pieces of data it contained, and refuting some “lies” Googlers “had been spreading for years.”</p>

<h2>Is this API Leak Authentic? Can We Trust It?</h2>
<p>A critical next step in the process was verifying the authenticity of the API Content Warehouse documents.&nbsp; So, I reached out to some ex-Googler friends, shared the leaked docs, and asked for their thoughts. Three ex-Googlers wrote back: one said they didn’t feel comfortable looking at or commenting on it. The other two shared the following (off the record and anonymously):</p>
<ul>
<li>“I didn’t have access to this code when I worked there. But this certainly looks legit. “</li>
<li>“It has all the hallmarks of an internal Google API.”</li>
<li>“It’s a Java-based API. And someone spent a lot of time adhering to Google’s own internal standards for documentation and naming.”</li>
<li>“I’d need more time to be sure, but this matches internal documentation I’m familiar with.”</li>
<li>“Nothing I saw in a brief review suggests this is anything but legit.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, I needed help analyzing and deciphering the naming conventions and more technical aspects of the documentation. I’ve worked with APIs a bit, but it’s been 20 years since I wrote code and 6 years since I practiced SEO professionally. So, I reached out to one of the world’s foremost technical SEOs: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelkingphilly/">Mike King</a>, founder of <a href="https://ipullrank.com/">iPullRank</a>.</p>
<p>During a 40-minute phone call on Friday afternoon, Mike reviewed the leak and confirmed my suspicions: <strong>this appears to be a legitimate set of documents from inside Google’s Search division</strong>, and contains an extraordinary amount of previously-unconfirmed information about Google’s inner workings.</p>
<p>2,500 technical documents is an unreasonable amount of material to ask one man (a dad, husband, and entrepreneur, no less) to review in a single weekend. But, that didn’t stop Mike from doing his best.<br>He’s put together an <strong><a href="https://ipullrank.com/google-algo-leak">exceptionally detailed initial review of the Google API leak here</a></strong>, which I’ll reference more in the findings below. And he’s also agreed to join us at <a href="https://sparktoro.com/sparktogether">SparkTogether 2024</a> in Seattle, WA on Oct. 8, where he’ll present the fully transparent story of this leak in far greater detail, and with the benefit of the next few months of analysis.</p>

<h2>Qualifications and Motivations for this Post</h2>
<p>Before we go further, a few disclaimers: I no longer work in the SEO field. My knowledge of and experience with SEO is 6+ years out of date. I don’t have the technical expertise or knowledge of Google’s internal operations to analyze an API documentation leak and confirm with certainty whether it’s authentic (hence getting Mike’s help and the input of ex-Googlers).</p>
<p>So why publish on this topic?</p>
<p>Because when I spoke to the party that sent me this information, I found them credible, thoughtful, and deeply knowledgeable. Despite going into the conversation deeply skeptical, I could identify no red flags, nor any malicious motivation. This person’s sole aim appeared quite aligned with my own: to hold Google accountable for public statements that conflict with private conversations and leaked documentation, and to bring greater transparency to the field of search marketing. And they believed that, despite my years removed from SEO, I was the best person to share this publicly.</p>
<p>These are goals I cared about deeply for almost two decades. And while my professional life has moved on (I now run two companies: <a href="https://sparktoro.com/">SparkToro</a>, which makes audience research software and <a href="https://snackbarstudio.com/">Snackbar Studio</a>, an indie video game developer), my interest in and connections to the world of Search Engine Optimization remain strong. I feel a deep obligation to share information about how the world’s dominant search engine works, especially information Google would prefer to keep quiet. And sadly, I’m not sure where else to send something this potentially groundbreaking.</p>
<p>Years ago, before he left journalism to become Google’s Search Liaison, <a href="https://dannysullivan.com/">Danny Sullivan</a>, would have been my go-to source for a leak of this magnitude. He had the gravitas, resume, knowledge, and experience to examine a claim like this and present it fairly in the court of public opinion. There have been so many times in the last few years I’ve wished for Danny’s calm, even-handed, tough-but-fair-on-Google approach to newsworthy pieces like this–pieces that could reach as far as the company’s statements on the witness stand (e.g. <a href="https://martech.org/dark-google-search-terms-not-provided-one-year-later/">his eloquent writing on Google’s indefensible privacy claims about organic keyword data</a>).</p>
<p>Whatever Google’s paying him, it isn’t nearly enough.</p>
<p>Apologies that instead of Danny, dear reader, you’re stuck with me. But since you are, I’m going to assume you may not be familiar with my background or credentials, and briefly share those.</p>

<p>OK. Back to the Google leak.</p>

<h2>What is the Google API Content Warehouse?</h2>
<p>When looking through the massive trove of API documentation, the first reasonable set of questions might be: “What is this? What is it used for? Why does it exist in the first place?”</p>
<div>
<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/images.sparktoro.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/google-api-content-warehouse-reference-anchors.png&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;aligncenter size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-8950&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:1180,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:794,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="689" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-api-content-warehouse-reference-anchors-1024x689.png" alt="" srcset="https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-api-content-warehouse-reference-anchors-1024x689.png 1024w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-api-content-warehouse-reference-anchors-300x202.png 300w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-api-content-warehouse-reference-anchors-768x517.png 768w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-api-content-warehouse-reference-anchors.png 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>
<p>The leak appears to come from <a href="https://github.com/googleapis/">GitHub</a>, and the most credible explanation for its exposure matches what my anonymous source told me on our call: these documents were inadvertently and briefly made public (many links in the documentation point to <a href="https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-nodejs-client/issues/1884">private GitHub repositories</a> and <a href="https://g3doc.corp.google.com/repository/webref/preprocessing/names/tnc_classifier/README.md">internal pages on Google’s corporate site</a> that require specific, Google-credentialed logins). During this probably-accidental, public period between March and May of 2024, the API documentation was spread to Hexdocs (which indexes public GitHub repos) and found/circulated by other sources (I’m certain that others have a copy, though it’s odd that I could find no public discourse until now).</p>
<p>According to my ex-Googler sources, documentation like this exists on almost every Google team, explaining various API attributes and modules to help familiarize those working on a project with the data elements available. This leak matches others in public GitHub repositories and on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/overview">Google’s Cloud API documentation</a>, using the same notation style, formatting, and even process/module/feature names and references.</p>
<p>If that all sounds like a technical mouthful, think of this as instructions for members of Google’s search engine team. It’s like an inventory of books in a library, a card catalogue of sorts, telling those employees who need to know what’s available and how they can get it.</p>
<p>But, whereas libraries are public, Google search is one of the most secretive, closely-guarded black boxes in the world. <strong>In the last quarter century, no leak of this magnitude or detail has ever been reported from Google’s search division</strong>.</p>
<h2>How certain can we be that Google’s search engine uses everything detailed in these API docs?</h2>
<p>That’s open to interpretation. Google could have retired some of these, used others exclusively for testing or internal projects, or may even have made API features available that were never employed.</p>
<p>However, there are references in the documentation to deprecated features and specific notes on others indicating they should no longer be used. That strongly suggests those not marked with such details were still in active use as of the March, 2024 leak.</p>
<p>We also can’t say for certain whether the March leak is of the most recent version of this documentation. The most recent date I can find referenced in the API docs is August of 2023:</p>

<p>The relevant text reads:</p>
<p><em>“The domain-level display name of the website, such as “Google” for google.com. See go/site-display-name for more details. <strong>As of Aug 2023, this field is being deprecated</strong> in favor of info.[AlternativeTitlesResponse].site_display_name_response field, which also contains host-level site display names with additional information.”</em></p>
<p>A reasonable reader would conclude that the documentation was up-to-date as of last summer (references to other changes in 2023 and earlier years, all the way back to 2005, are also present), and possibly even up-to-date as of the March 2024 date of disclosure.</p>
<p>Google search obviously changes massively from year to year, and recent introductions like their <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/shut-down-google-ai-overview-3446038/">much-maligned AI Overviews</a>, do not make an appearance in this leak. Which of the items mentioned are actively used today in Google’s ranking systems? That’s open to speculation. This trove contains fascinating references, many that will be entirely new to non-Google-search-engineers.</p>
<p>But,<strong> I would urge readers not to point to a particular API feature in this leak and say: “SEE! That’s proof Google uses XYZ in their rankings.”</strong> It’s not quite proof. It’s a strong indication, stronger than patent applications or public statements from Googlers, but still no guarantee.</p>
<p>That said, it’s as close to a smoking gun as anything since <a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-11/418021.pdf">Google’s execs testified in the DOJ trial</a> last year. And, speaking of that testimony, much of it is corroborated and expanded on in the document leak, as Mike <a href="https://ipullrank.com/google-algo-leak">details in his post</a>. 👀</p>
<h2><strong>What can we learn from the Data Warehouse Leak?</strong></h2>
<p>I expect that interesting and marketing-applicable insights will be mined from this massive file set for years to come. It’s simply too big and too dense to think that a weekend of browsing could unearth a comprehensive set of takeaways, or even come close.</p>
<p>However, I will share five of the most interesting, early discoveries in my perusal, some that shed new light on things Google has long been assumed to be doing, and others that suggest the company’s public statements (especially those on what they “collect”) have been erroneous. Because doing so would be tedious and could be perceived as personal grievances (given Google’s historic attacks on my work), I won’t bother showing side-by-sides of what Googlers said vs. what this document insinuates. Besides, Mike did a great job of that in his post.</p>
<p>Instead, I’ll focus on interesting and/or useful takeaways, and my conclusions from the whole of the modules I’ve been able to review, <a href="https://ipullrank.com/google-algo-leak">Mike’s piece</a> on the leak, and how this combines with other things we know to be true of Google.</p>
<h2>#1: Navboost and the use of clicks, CTR, long vs. short clicks, and user data</h2>

<p>A handful of modules in the documentation make reference to features like “goodClicks,” “badClicks,” “lastLongestClicks,” impressions, squashed, unsquashed, and unicorn clicks. These are tied to Navboost and Glue, two words that may be familiar to folks who reviewed <a href="https://thecapitolforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/101823-USA-v-Google-PM.pdf">Google’s DOJ testimony</a>. Here’s a relevant excerpt from DOJ attorney Kenneth Dintzer’s cross-examination of Pandu Nayak, VP of Search on the Search Quality team:</p>
<p>Q. So remind me, is navboost all the way back to 2005?<br>A. It’s somewhere in that range. It might even be before that.</p>
<p>Q. And it’s been updated. It’s not the same old navboost that it was back then?<br>A. No.</p>
<p>Q. And another one is glue, right?<br>A. Glue is just another name for navboost that includes all of the other features on the page.</p>
<p>Q. Right. I was going to get there later, but we can do that now. Navboost does web results, just like we discussed, right?<br>A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. And glue does everything else that’s on the page that’s not web results, right?<br>A. That is correct.</p>
<p>Q. Together they help find the stuff and rank the stuff that ultimately shows up on our SERP?<br>A. That is true. They’re both signals into that, yes.</p>
<p>A savvy reader of these API documents would find they support Mr. Nayak’s testimony (and align with Google’s <a href="https://thecapitolforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/101823-USA-v-Google-PM.pdf">patent on site quality</a>):</p>

</ul>
<p>Google appears to have ways to filter out clicks they don’t want to count in their ranking systems, and include ones they do. They also seem to measure length of clicks (i.e. <a href="https://moz.com/blog/seo-satisfaction">pogo-sticking</a> – when a searcher clicks a result and then quickly clicks the back button, unsatisfied by the answer they found) and impressions.</p>
<p>Plenty has already been written about Google’s use of click data, so I won’t belabor the point. What matters is that Google has named and described features for that measurement, adding even more evidence to the pile.</p>
<h2>#2: Use of Chrome browser clickstreams to power Google Search</h2>
<div>

<p>My anonymous source claimed that way back in 2005, Google wanted the full clickstream of billions of Internet users, and with Chrome, they’ve now got it. The API documents suggest Google calculates several types of metrics that can be called using Chrome views related to both individual pages and entire domains.</p>
<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/google_api_content_warehouse/0.4.0/GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.QualitySitemapTargetGroup.html#module-attributes">This document</a>, describing the features around how Google creates Sitelinks, is particularly interesting. It showcases a call named topUrl, which is “A list of top urls with highest two_level_score, i.e., chrome_trans_clicks.” My read is that Google likely uses the number of clicks on pages in Chrome browsers and uses that to determine the most popular/important URLs on a site, which go into the calculation of which to include in the sitelinks feature.</p>
<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="608" height="505" src="https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-13.png" alt="" srcset="https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-13.png 608w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-13-300x249.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px"></figure></div>
<p>E.G. In the above screenshot from Google’s results, pages like “Pricing,” the “Blog,” and the “Login” pages are our most-visited, and Google knows this through their tracking of billions of Chrome users’ clickstreams.</p>

<h2>#3: Whitelists in Travel, Covid, and Politics</h2>
<p>A module on “Good Quality Travel Sites” would lead reasonable readers to conclude that a whitelist exists for Google in the travel sector (unclear if this is exclusively for Google’s “Travel” search tab, or web search more broadly). References in several places to flags for “isCovidLocalAuthority” and “isElectionAuthority” further suggests that Google is whitelisting particular domains that are appropriate to show for highly controversial of potentially problematic queries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, following the 2020 US Presidential election, one candidate claimed (without evidence) that the election had been stolen, and encouraged their followers to storm the Capital and take potentially violent action against lawmakers, i.e. commit an insurrection.</p>
<p>Google would almost certainly be one of the first places people turned to for information about this event, and if their search engine returned propaganda websites that inaccurately portrayed the election evidence, that could directly lead to more contention, violence, or even the end of US democracy. Those of us who want free and fair elections to continue should be very grateful Google’s engineers are employing whitelists in this case.</p>

<h2>#4: Employing Quality Rater Feedback</h2>
<div>

<p>Google has long had a quality rating platform called EWOK (Cyrus Shepard, a notable leader in the SEO space, spent several years contributing to this and <a href="https://zyppy.com/seo/google-search-quality-rater/">wrote about it here</a>). We now have evidence that some elements from the quality raters are used in the search systems.</p>
<p>How influential these rater-based signals are, and what precisely they’re used for is unclear to me in an initial read, but I suspect some thoughtful SEO detectives will dig into the leak, learn, and publish more about it. What I find fascinating is that scores and data generated by EWOK’s quality raters may be <strong>directly involved</strong> in Google’s search system, rather than simply a training set for experiments. Of course, it’s possible these are “just for testing,” but as you browse through the leaked documents, you’ll find that when that’s true, it’s specifically called out in the notes and module details.</p>
<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/google_api_content_warehouse/0.3.0/GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.RepositoryWebrefDocLevelRelevanceRatings.html">This one</a> calls out a “per document relevance rating” sourced from evaluations done via EWOK. There’s no detailed notation, but it’s not much of a logic-leap to imagine how important those human evaluations of websites really are.</p>
<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="450" src="https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/humanratings-entities-google-api-warehouse-leak-1024x450.gif" alt="" srcset="https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/humanratings-entities-google-api-warehouse-leak-1024x450.gif 1024w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/humanratings-entities-google-api-warehouse-leak-300x132.gif 300w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/humanratings-entities-google-api-warehouse-leak-768x338.gif 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>
<p>This one calls out “Human Ratings (e.g. ratings from EWOK)” and notes that they’re “typically only populated in the evaluation pipelines,” which suggests they may be primarily training data in this module (I’d argue that’s still a hugely important role, and marketers shouldn’t dismiss how important it is that quality raters perceive and rate their websites well).</p>

<h2>#5: Google Uses Click Data to Determine How to Weight Links in Rankings</h2>
<p>This one’s fascinating, and comes directly from the anonymous source who first shared the leak. In their words: “Google has three buckets/tiers for classifying their link indexes (low, medium, high quality). Click data is used to determine which link graph index tier a document belongs to. See <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/google_api_content_warehouse/0.4.0/GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.AnchorsAnchor.html">SourceType here</a>, and <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/google_api_content_warehouse/0.4.0/GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.RepositoryWebrefDocumentMetadata.html">TotalClicks here</a>.” In summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>If Forbes.com/Cats/ has no clicks it goes into the low-quality index and the link is ignored</li>
<li>If Forbes.com/Dogs/ has a high volume of clicks from verifiable devices (all the Chrome-related data discussed previously), it goes into the high-quality index and the link passes ranking signals</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the link becomes “trusted” because it belongs to a higher tier index, it can flow PageRank and anchors, or be filtered/demoted by link spam systems. Links from the low-quality link index won’t hurt a site’s ranking; they are merely <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/google_api_content_warehouse/0.4.0/GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.IndexingDocjoinerAnchorSpamInfo.html">ignored</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Big Picture Takeaways for Marketers who Care About Organic Search Traffic</h2>
<p>If you care strategically about the value of organic search traffic, but don’t have much use for the technical details of how Google works, this section’s for you. It’s my attempt to sum up much of Google’s evolution from the period this leak covers: 2005 – 2023, and I won’t limit myself exclusively to confirmed elements of the leak.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Brand matters more than anything else<br></strong>Google has numerous ways to identify entities, sort, rank, filter, and employ them. Entities include brands (brand names, their official websites, associated social accounts, etc.), and as we’ve <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/who-sends-traffic-on-the-web-and-how-much-new-research-from-datos-sparktoro/">seen in our clickstream research with Datos</a>, they’ve been on an inexorable path toward exclusively ranking and sending traffic to big, powerful brands that dominate the web &gt; small, independent sites and businesses.<p>If there was one universal piece of advice I had for marketers seeking to broadly improve their organic search rankings and traffic, it would be: “Build a notable, popular, well-recognized brand in your space, outside of Google search.”</p></li>
<li><strong>Experience, expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness </strong>(“E-E-A-T”)<strong> might not matter as directly as some SEOs think.</strong><br>The only mention of topical expertise in the leak we’ve found so far is a brief <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/google_api_content_warehouse/0.3.0/GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.AppsPeopleOzExternalMergedpeopleapiMapsExtendedData.html#module-attributes">notation</a> about Google Maps review contributions. The other aspects of E-E-A-T are either buried, indirect, labeled in hard-to-identify ways, or, more likely (in my opinion) correlated with things Google uses and cares about, but not specific elements of the ranking systems.<p>As Mike <a href="https://ipullrank.com/google-algo-leak">noted</a> in his article, there is documentation in the leak suggesting Google can identify authors and treats them as entities in the system. Building up one’s influence as an author online may indeed lead to ranking benefits in Google. But what exactly in the ranking systems makes up “E-E-A-T” and how powerful those elements are is an open question. I’m a bit worried that E-E-A-T is 80% propaganda, 20% substance. There are plenty of powerful brands that rank remarkably well in Google and have very little experience, expertise, authoritativeness, or trustworthiness, as <a href="https://housefresh.com/david-vs-digital-goliaths/">HouseFresh’s recent, viral article</a> details in depth.</p></li>
<li><strong>Content and links are secondary when user intention around navigation (and the patterns that intent creates) are present.</strong><br>Let’s say, for example, that many people in the Seattle area search for “Lehman Brothers” and scroll to page 2, 3, or 4 of the search results until they find the theatre listing for the Lehman Brother stage production, then click that result. Fairly quickly, Google will learn that’s what searchers for those words in that area want.<p>Even if the Wikipedia article about Lehman Brothers’ role in the financial crisis of 2008 were to invest heavily in link building and content optimization, it’s unlikely they could outrank the user-intent signals (calculated from queries and clicks) of Seattle’s theatre-goers.</p><p>Extending this example to the broader web and search as a whole, if you can create demand for your website among enough likely searchers in the regions you’re targeting, you may be able to end-around the need for classic on-and-off-page SEO signals like links, anchor text, optimized content, and the like. The power of Navboost and the intent of users is likely the most powerful ranking factor in Google’s systems. As Google VP Alexander Grushetsky put it in <a href="http://chrome-extension//efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-11/417828.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 2019 email to other Google execs</a> (including Danny Sullivan and Pandu Nayak): </p><p>“<em>We already know, one signal could be more powerful than the whole big system on a given metric. For example, I’m pretty sure that NavBoost alone was / is more positive on clicks (and likely even on precision / utility metrics) by itself than the rest of ranking (BTW, engineers outside of Navboost team used to be also not happy about the power of Navboost, and the fact it was “stealing wins”)</em>“</p><p>Those seeking even more confirmation could review Google engineer <a href="https://avalonlibrary.net/Project_Veritas_Google_document_dump/Fake%2520News/Paul%2520Haahr_%2520Google%2520Resume.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1716854833557971&amp;usg=AOvVaw1c5yIN-rzUZDVpR_foAiUp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paul Haahr’s detailed resume</a>, which states:</p><p><em>“I’m the manager for logs-based ranking projects. The team’s efforts are currently split among four areas: 1) Navboost. This is already one of Google’s strongest ranking signals. Current work is on automation in building new navboost data;”</em></p></li>
<li><strong>Classic ranking factors: PageRank, anchors (topical PageRank based on the anchor text of the link), and text-matching have been waning in importance for years. But Page Titles are still quite important.</strong><br>This is a finding from Mike’s excellent analysis that I’d be foolish not to call out here. PageRank still appears to have a place in search indexing and rankings, but it’s almost certainly evolved from the original 1998 paper. The document leak insinuates multiple versions of PageRank (<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/google_api_content_warehouse/0.3.0/GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.CompositeDocForwardingDup.html#module-attributes">rawPagerank</a>, a deprecated <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/google_api_content_warehouse/0.3.0/GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.GeostoreUrlProto.html#module-attributes">PageRank referencing “nearest seeds,”</a> <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/google_api_content_warehouse/0.3.0/GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.IndexingSignalAggregatorAgeWeightedCoverageData.html#module-attributes">firstCoveragePageRank</a> from when the document was first served, etc.) have been created and discarded over the years. And anchor text links, while present in the leak, don’t seem to be as crucial or omnipresent as I’d have expected from my earlier years in SEO.<br></li>
<li><strong>For most small and medium businesses and newer creators/publishers, SEO is likely to show poor returns until you’ve established credibility, navigational demand, and a strong reputation among a sizable audience.</strong><br>SEO is a big brand, popular domain’s game. As an entrepreneur, I’m not ignoring SEO, but I strongly expect that for the years ahead, until/unless SparkToro becomes a much larger, more popular, more searched-for and clicked-on brand in its industry, this website will continue to be outranked, even for its original content, by aggregators and publishers who’ve existed for 10+ years.<p>This is almost certainly true for other creators, publishers, and SMBs. The content you create is unlikely to perform well in Google if competition from big, popular websites with well-known brands exists. Google no longer rewards scrappy, clever, SEO-savvy operators who know all the right tricks. They reward established brands, search-measurable forms of popularity, and established domains that searchers already know and click. From 1998 – 2018 (or so), one could reasonable start a powerful marketing flywheel with SEO for Google. In 2024, I don’t think that’s realistic, at least, not on the English-language web in competitive sectors.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2>Next Steps for the Search Industry</h2>
<p>I’m excited to see how practitioners with more recent experience and deeper technical knowledge go about analyzing this leak. I encourage anyone curious to dig into the documentation, attempt to connect it to other public documents, statements, testimony, and ranking experiments, then publish their findings.</p>
<p>Historically, some of the search industry’s loudest voices and most prolific publishers have been happy to uncritically repeat Google’s public statements. They write headlines like “Google says XYZ is true,” rather than “Google Claims XYZ; Evidence Suggests Otherwise.”</p>

<p>Please, do better. If this leak and the DOJ trial can create just one change, I hope this is it.</p>
<p>When those new to the field read Search Engine Roundtable, Search Engine Land, SE Journal, and the many agency blogs and websites that cover the SEO field’s news, they don’t necessarily know how seriously to take Google’s statements. Journalists and authors should not presume that readers are savvy enough to know that dozens or hundreds of past public comments by Google’s official representatives were later proven wrong.</p>
<p>This obligation isn’t just about helping the search industry—it’s about helping the whole world. Google is one of the most powerful, influential forces for the spread of information and commerce on this planet. Only recently have they been held to some account by governments and reporters. The work of journalists and writers in the search marketing field carries weight in the courts of public opinion, in the halls of elected officials, and in the hearts of Google employees, all of whom have the power to change things for the better or ignore them at our collective peril.</p>

<p>It seems like just yesterday WordPress was <a href="https://ma.tt/2016/05/wordpress-is-a-teenager/">becoming a teenager</a>, and in a blink of the eye it’s now old enough to drink! 21 years since <a href="https://mikelittle.org/">Mike</a> and I did the first release of WordPress, forking <a href="https://miche.lv/">Michel’s</a> work on b2/cafélog.</p>



<p>There’s been many milestones and highlights along the way, and many more to come. I’ve been thinking a lot about elements that made WordPress successful in its early years that we should keep in mind as we build this year and beyond. Here’s 11 opinions:</p>



<ol>
<li>Simple things should be easy and intuitive, and complex things possible.</li>



<li>Blogging, commenting, and pingbacks need to be fun. Static websites are fine, but dynamic ones are better. Almost every site would be improved by having a great blog.</li>



<li>Wikis are amazing, and our documentation should be wiki-easy to edit.</li>



<li>Forums should be front and center in the community. <a href="https://bbpress.org/">bbPress</a> and <a href="https://buddypress.org/">BuddyPress</a> need some love.</li>



<li>Every plugin and theme should have all the infrastructure that we use to build WordPress itself—version control, bug trackers, forums, documentation, internationalization, chat rooms, P2, and easy pathways for contribution and community. We shouldn’t be uploading ZIPs in 2024!</li>



<li>Theme previews should be great, and a wide collection of non-commercial themes with diverse aesthetics and functionality are crucial. </li>



<li>We can’t over-index for guidelines and requirements. Better to have good marketplace dynamics and engineer automated feedback loops and transparency to users. Boundaries in functionality and design should be pushed. (But spam and spammy behavior deserves zero tolerance.)</li>



<li>Feedback loops are so important, and should scale with usage and the entire community rather than being reliant on gatekeepers.</li>



<li>Core should be opinionated and quirky: Easter eggs, language with personality even if it’s difficult to translate, jazzy.</li>



<li>Everyone developing and making decisions for software needs to use it.</li>



<li>It’s important that we all do support, go to meetups and events, anything we can to stay close to regular end-users of what we make.</li>
</ol>



<p>What would you add?</p>



<p>Fun fact: On May 27, 2003 I blogged “Working backwards, earlier tonight was great. Put&nbsp;WordPress&nbsp;out, which felt great.” as one sentence in a <a href="https://ma.tt/2003/05/locked-out/">953-word entry written from the porch of my parent’s house</a> where I was accidentally locked out all night until my Dad left in the morning to go to work. Had no idea WordPress would be as big as it is. Earlier that night had set up WP for my friend Ramie Speight, and done some phone tech support for another friend Mike Tremoulet I had met through the local blogger meetup. My friends from high school all had their own domains with WP and that feedback loop was magical for shaping the software.</p>

            <guid>40496588</guid>
            <pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2024 01:44:50 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/code">https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/code</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40496588">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><main><h2>Blink Code</h2>
<p>VSCode is a very powerful code editor which has become the tool of choice for a lot of developers in record time. Lately, it has been catering to the needs of teams who want to focus on remote and mobile development, accessing their environments from a plethora of devices. The goal of a shell is to expose services to programs and users, and hence inside Blink Shell our approach has been to integrate Code with iOS so we could offer you the best of both worlds:</p>
<ul>
<li>A VSCode experience fitted to your device, that connects to VSCode web, Codespaces, GitPod, or your Code server.</li>
<li>Work on local projects, or edit remote files as if they were in your device, thanks to Blink Files.</li>
<li>First-class iOS experience, with software and hardware keyboard, and the full edge-to-edge experience without interruptions that everyone loves from Blink.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="starting-blink-code">Starting Blink Code</h2>
<pre><code dir="ltr">code &lt;path_or_url&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Blink Code takes a single parameter. If it is a path, it can be local or remote following the same format as SFTP/SCP commands.</p>
<p>To launch Code and begin initial setup, first, run <code dir="ltr">code .</code>. Once it has launched, you will need to install the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BlinkShellInc.blink-fs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" aria-selected="false">blink-fs</a> extension. Right after installation, this will connect the Code instance to the Blink File System. The navigation sidebar will show the file hierarchy, opening individual files for editing and manipulation.</p>
<p><span><span></span><img alt="img" srcset="https://docs.blink.sh/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fcode-general.f166e889.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://docs.blink.sh/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fcode-general.f166e889.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" loading="lazy" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p>
<h2 id="opening-remote-projects">Opening remote projects</h2>
<p>Remote development on Code could not be any easier thanks to Blink Shell's abilities. If you have already <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/basics/hosts">configured your host</a> and installed the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BlinkShellInc.blink-fs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" aria-selected="false">blink-fs</a> extension on the target, just type:</p>
<pre><code dir="ltr">code &lt;host&gt;:&lt;path/to/project&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Please make sure the host has all the authentication information in settings (like passwords), as to work, the connection must be non-interactive. You can check out the logs by doing <code dir="ltr">cat .blink/blinkCode.log</code> to identify issues.</p>
<p>If you have enabled <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/files-app">Files.app integration</a> for the host, there is an even easier way to launch code. Just long-press the project directory or file, and tap <code dir="ltr">Code</code>!</p>
<p><span><span></span><img alt="img" srcset="https://docs.blink.sh/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fcode-filesapp.5ff8a70e.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://docs.blink.sh/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fcode-filesapp.5ff8a70e.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" loading="lazy" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p>
<h2 id="code-in-the-cloud">Code in the Cloud</h2>
<p>Blink Code can also connect to your instance of Code Server, offering the same premium experience so you can be more productive. To do so, just copy the URL of the running code instance and use it as the parameter, like such:</p>
<pre><code dir="ltr">code https://gitpod.dev/asdfqwerzxcv
</code></pre>
<p>Note there are iOS limitations on the domains we can access (we are working on that). We currently support domains for GitHub Codespaces, GitPod, and Code-Server. If your Code instance is accessed through a private IP, we suggest you <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/advanced-ssh#tunnels">open a tunnel</a> so access happens through localhost instead.</p>
<p><strong>PRO TIP:</strong> Blink will also capture <code dir="ltr">vscode://</code> routes, so it can fulfill the <em>Open in Desktop</em> functionality, for example, in GitHub Codespaces.</p>
<p><span><span></span><img alt="img" srcset="https://docs.blink.sh/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fcode-link.60b46e61.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1x, https://docs.blink.sh/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fcode-link.60b46e61.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://docs.blink.sh/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fcode-link.60b46e61.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" loading="lazy" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p>
<h2 id="code-from-github-repositories">Code from GitHub repositories</h2>
<p>You can use Blink Code to quickly browse and edit your code in GitHub repositories. This is perfect when you need to do a quick fix or edit a blog or webpage, committing back changes once you are done.</p>
<p>On the bottom-left corner, tap the <code dir="ltr">&gt;&lt;</code> button, and select "Open Remote Repository". Note you may have to log in to GitHub to access your repositories.</p>
<h2>Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>
<h2 id="exploring-vscode">Exploring VSCode</h2>
<p>If you wish to explore VSCode in more depth, documentation abounds on how it works and what you can do with it. You can get started with the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" aria-selected="false">VSCode official documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="on-screen-keyboard">On-Screen keyboard</h2>
<p>Blink Code offers the same on-screen keyboard as the terminal. When you play with it, please notice that special key modifiers like <code dir="ltr">Ctrl</code>, <code dir="ltr">Cmd</code> and <code dir="ltr">Meta</code> are integrated inside Blink Code too. Try it opening the Command Palette using <code dir="ltr">Cmd-m</code>. We promise this will take your experience to the next level!</p>
<h2 id="keyboard-shortcuts">Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>
<p>Blink Shell makes heavy use of keyboard shortcuts for navigation. Some of these may suppress VSCode keyboard shortcuts that you may deem necessary for your workflow. If so, you can easily reconfigure any by following <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/basics/customize#blink-shortcuts">Blink Shortcuts</a>.</p>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<ul>
<li>If VS Code is not loading at all or it is showing a blank screen, try closing the tab and starting <code dir="ltr">code</code> again. Also, try closing Blink and reopening it.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Try using the --vscode-url parameter, like this: <code dir="ltr">code —vscode-url vscode.dev</code>. Then try to reload without it.</li>
<li>Try using the same URL with Safari (and if using just <code dir="ltr">code .</code>, use <code dir="ltr">vscode.dev</code>) under the same device. This may show if the device has some problems loading the URL. If Safari loaded, try to run the command again under Blink.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make sure the Blink-FS extension is installed and enabled. In order to use SFTP this extension is very important as seen in this <a href="https://github.com/blinksh/blink/issues/1304" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" aria-selected="false">Discussion</a>.</li>
<li>If you have issues enabling Blink-FS, or getting the extensions to come through, <a href="https://vscode.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" aria-selected="false">https://vscode.dev</a> may be having problems. In those cases, we have seen that changing to the Nightly version may work, as suggested in this <a href="https://github.com/blinksh/blink/discussions/1795#discussioncomment-6262467" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" aria-selected="false">Discussion</a>.</li>
<li>Make sure SFTP is enabled in the remote, and that authentication requires no user input (like passwords or 2FA). One good test for this is to <a href="https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/files-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" aria-selected="false">enable the Files.app integration</a> and browsing files there, as pointed out in this <a href="https://github.com/blinksh/blink/issues/1880" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" aria-selected="false">Discussion</a>.</li>
<li>Make sure your remote path is valid. Try accessing your home folder with <code dir="ltr">code &lt;host&gt;:~/</code>. Then try using the Files.app integration, navigate to the folder you want to work on, long tap on it and <code dir="ltr">Open in Code</code>. This will automatically complete the paths for you and will allow you to see how it is accessed in the remote.</li>
<li>Check logs <code dir="ltr">~/.blink/blinkCode.log</code>. This may give you a clue of where things stopped.</li>
<li>Send a support request with the logs to <a href="https://github.com/blinksh/blink/discussions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" aria-selected="false">Github Discussions</a>, create your <code dir="ltr">New discussion</code> under the <code dir="ltr">Support</code> category.</li>

            <span>Abstract:</span>We study whether transformers can learn to implicitly reason over parametric knowledge, a skill that even the most capable language models struggle with. Focusing on two representative reasoning types, composition and comparison, we consistently find that transformers can learn implicit reasoning, but only through grokking, i.e., extended training far beyond overfitting. The levels of generalization also vary across reasoning types: when faced with out-of-distribution examples, transformers fail to systematically generalize for composition but succeed for comparison. We delve into the model's internals throughout training, conducting analytical experiments that reveal: 1) the mechanism behind grokking, such as the formation of the generalizing circuit and its relation to the relative efficiency of generalizing and memorizing circuits, and 2) the connection between systematicity and the configuration of the generalizing circuit. Our findings guide data and training setup to better induce implicit reasoning and suggest potential improvements to the transformer architecture, such as encouraging cross-layer knowledge sharing. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for a challenging reasoning task with a large search space, GPT-4-Turbo and Gemini-1.5-Pro based on non-parametric memory fail badly regardless of prompting styles or retrieval augmentation, while a fully grokked transformer can achieve near-perfect accuracy, showcasing the power of parametric memory for complex reasoning.

            <guid>40494097</guid>
            <pubDate>Mon, 27 May 2024 20:00:11 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="http://www.martin-loetzsch.de/gtfl/">http://www.martin-loetzsch.de/gtfl/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40494097">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>Abstract</h3><p>GTFL is a graphical terminal for Common Lisp. The client is a
         html page running in a web browser and GTFL provides
         mechanisms for sending content to the client page from within
         Lisp (using <a href="http://www.weitz.de/hunchentoot/">HUNCHENTOOT</a> and <a href="http://martin-loetzsch.de/ht-simple-ajax">HT-SIMPLE-AJAX</a>).</p><p>It is meant for Lisp programmers who want to debug or
         visualize their own algorithms. Instead of printing tracing
         information to the Lisp listener (which everybody normally
         does to understand what's going on), more readable graphical
         representations of the algorithm's internals are sent to the
         GTFL client page.</p><p>GTFL also comes with mechanisms for visualizing
         complex (hierarchical) data or control structures. It
         provides functions for drawing trees and for hiding
         complexity in elements that expand when the user clicks on
         them.</p><p>Two real-life examples for an application of GTFL can be found <a href="http://www.martin-loetzsch.de/gtfl/application-example-1/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.martin-loetzsch.de/gtfl/application-example-2/">here</a>. These are debug traces of linguistic parsing and production in the <a href="http://fcg-net.org/">Fluid Construction Grammar</a> (FCG) framework. Such traces help the developers FCG to
        understand and debug their programs and they help users of FCG
        to see what their linguistic rules are doing. By encapsulating
        visualizations for representations in expandable html
        elements, the complete trace fits into one browser window and
        still includes every little detail and intermediate processing
        step of the involved FCG algorithms (which would be thousands
        of pages debugging output to the listener).</p><p>Below is another example of using GTFL for visualizing Lisp
         data structures. It was created with a few lines of code (<a href="http://www.martin-loetzsch.de/gtfl/examples/asdf-dependency-tree.lisp">examples/asdf-dependency-tree.lisp</a>) and shows the dependencies of an asdf system. Click

        of GTFL maintains a "request list" into which the

<p>Python’s <code><span>itertools</span></code> library is a gem - you can compose elegant solutions
for a variety of problems with the functions it provides. In <code><span>more-itertools</span></code>
we collect additional building blocks, recipes, and routines for working with
Python iterables.</p>

<p>Many large concerts feature wristbands that light up on command. They are used to produce varied visual effects across a stadium. One company that makes these is <a href="https://pixmob.com/">PixMob</a>. Their controllable, illuminated wristbands are currently being used as part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour">Taylor Swift's Eras Tour</a>. A short Wired article <a href="https://wired.me/technology/the-tech-behind-taylor-swift-concert-wristbands/">here</a> gives some details and here's a video from the Wall Street Journal:</p><p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GCsmZA08oD8?si=e3755KHJFdna_zBV" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p><p>For the Eras Tour the company's X2 product is being used.

So, simply put, PixMob works by installed a really big (and moveable) IR remote control (you can read about this on their website <a href="https://pixmob.com/our-effects">here</a>) and transmitting commands to the bracelets to produce colours, fades, flashes, etc. Cute.</p><p>There are a bunch of hardware details <a href="https://yeokhengmeng.com/2019/08/teardown-of-ndp2019-led-wristband/">here</a>.</p><p>Since they are projecting infrared with moveable projector they can sweep effects around the stadium, and cover the projector with cut outs to make things like hearts. It's simple technology that works very nicely. And, of course, there's a reverse engineering community built up around this.</p><p>The best place to start learning about that is <a href="https://github.com/danielweidman/pixmob-ir-reverse-engineering">this</a> GitHub repository. It brings together a bunch of reverse engineering efforts that have looked into the IR protocol. These have been somewhat successful and, since the <a href="https://flipperzero.one/">Flipper Zero</a> has IR capability, there's a <a href="https://github.com/danielweidman/flipper-pixmob-ir-codes">project</a> that makes it control the wristband.</p><p>Here's a short video of me making the wristbands fade orange.</p><p>Such nice simple technology that produces very cool effects.</p>

The museum, which has now brought a civil court case against Dr Higgs, believes he was mostly targeting these uncatalogued artefacts - and that, this time, he had made a mistake.</p><p>Dr Higgs would have been able to see the cameo was a catalogued item, searchable by the public and staff alike. It was even on the museum’s website - it was not the kind of item that could disappear and not be missed.</p><p>If his tampering had been successful, says the museum in its court papers, it would have hidden the database photo of the cameo from view - but it says he failed.</p><p>The next day, Dr Higgs is known to have returned alone to the storeroom where the cameo was kept, the museum says. It believes this was so he could return it.</p></div><div data-component="text-block" width="wide"><p>Thief at the British Museum is available on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0hz3hz1#xtor=CS8-1000-%5BEditorialPromo_Box%5D-%5BNewsEditorial_Promo%5D-%5BNewsEditorial_Promo%5D-%5BPS_SOUNDS~N~p0hz3hz1~P_BritishMuseumIntro%5D">BBC Sounds</a> or you can hear it on Radio 4, weekdays at 13:45, between 27 May and 6 June.</p><p>You can watch a documentary of the same name on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m001zrbs#xtor=CS8-1000-%5BEditorialPromo_Box%5D-%5BNewsEditorial_Promo%5D-%5BNewsEditorial_Promo%5D-%5BPS_IPLAYER~N~m001zrbs~P_BritishMuseum%5D">BBC iPlayer</a> or on BBC Two at 19:00 on 27 May.</p></div><div data-component="text-block" width="wide"><p>However, something valuable remained missing - the cameo's gold mount. The museum believes it was removed by Dr Higgs and sold to a scrap dealer.</p><p>The cameo’s value is estimated at £15,000. It would be worth double that, says the museum, if it still had its gold mount.</p><p>Dr Gradel says it is “totally bizarre” that he could sit at a computer on a small Danish island and be the first person to discover something was awry at the British Museum.</p><p>He wrote to sultan1966, the man he knew as Paul Higgins, asking why the Priapus cameo had been withdrawn. The seller replied saying it had been a mistake - it belonged to his sister, who didn't want him to sell it.</p><p>Dr Gradel chose not to alert sultan1966 about his suspicions. “That would enable him to cover his tracks,” he said.</p><p>Instead he decided to keep an eye on him - to see if any other pieces belonging to the museum appeared.</p><p>Four years would pass before the next clue - when Dr Gradel would make the shocking discovery that it appeared to be an inside job.</p></div><div width="wide"><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="The-second-clue" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">The second clue</span></h2></p></div><div data-component="text-block" width="wide"><p>In May 2020, Dr Gradel noticed an image in a newly published book on gemstones.</p><p>Figure 736 was a gem featuring a man who resembled the Roman Emperor Augustus. It was labelled as belonging to the British Museum.</p><p>The figure portrayed on the gem had an usual hairstyle for the period.</p><p>Suspicious once again, Dr Gradel looked through his records. </p><p>He matched the image in the book to a photograph on his computer hard drive of an olive-green gem fragment that he had previously been offered for sale by a British dealer called Malcolm Hay.</p><p>Dr Gradel told him about his suspicions around the gem right away.</p></div><div data-component="image-block" width="wide"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Photos of gem casts resembled the gem fragment. The production process would have reversed the cast imprint - hence the face on the gem looks to the left</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block" width="wide"><p>But when Malcolm Hay wrote to the museum to make enquiries about the startling similarity, he was told it was closed because of the Covid lockdown.</p><p>“[Deputy Director] Jonathan Williams replied to me, and he said, of course, there's no way of confirming anything at the moment because no-one could get into the museum,” Mr Hay said. “He asked me to hold it.”</p><p>Luckily, the person who had first sold it to Mr Hay happened to be a mutual friend of Dr Gradel’s - a gallery-owner in Bath called Rolf von Kiaer. Dr Gradel got in touch with him immediately.</p><p>Rolf replied that he had bought the olive-green gem on eBay a few years before.</p><p>The name of the seller? Sultan1966.</p><p>At this point, Dr Gradel feared something was very wrong. He began to comb through computer files and paper records of everything he had bought from sultan1966.</p><p>He meticulously went through eBay listings, correspondences and transaction receipts, dating back to his very first purchase from sultan1966 in 2014.</p><p>An online receipt provided a crucial clue - apparently revealing the seller's real name. It was listed as Peter Higgs rather than Paul Higgins.</p><p>“A PayPal receipt has to be attached to a real bank account,” Dr Gradel explains. “So this had to be his real name.”</p></div><div data-component="text-block" width="wide"><p>He immediately called Rolf von Kiaer once again.</p><p>“[Rolf] then said to me, ‘Ittai, you do realise that is the name of a curator in the British Museum Greece and Rome department, don't you?’ And I remember that distinctly, my hair stood on end, I was absolutely shocked by this.”</p><p>Over the coming days, Dr Gradel continued to unearth new connections between the online seller and Peter Higgs.</p><p>He discovered that “sultan1966” was also Dr Higgs’s account name on Twitter - now known as X - and that 1966 was the year he was born.</p><p>“The email address on the PayPal account was Bodrum1966,” said Dr Gradel. “His specialty was actually working on sculpture from ancient Halicarnassus in modern day Turkey. And the modern name of that place is Bodrum.”</p><p>Finally, Dr Gradel found an eBay receipt for a gem he had bought from sultan1966 that gave a full private address. Dr Gradel decided to check it against property records - and the name given was Peter Higgs, the British Museum curator.</p><p>Everything suddenly made sense to the Danish collector with the photographic memory.</p><p>“There was no other possible conclusion to draw from this. It was what it seemed to be - that the British Museum curator was pilfering his own museum,” says Dr Gradel.</p><p>Dr Higgs has since denied all the allegations and is defending the civil claim the British Museum is bringing against him.</p></div><div width="wide"><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="Someone-could-be-framing-him" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">'Someone could be framing him'</span></h2></p></div><div data-component="text-block" width="wide"><p>While Dr Gradel was combing through his receipts, Peter Higgs’ career seemed to be going from strength to strength.</p><p>In January 2021, he was promoted to acting head of the Department of Greece and Rome, having built a reputation for helping track down stolen antiquities around the globe.</p><p>He had been described by the UK government as “a world-renowned curator” in 2015 after helping to return a stolen 2,000-year-old statue to Libya. Dr Higgs later appeared on BBC’s Crimewatch to describe his work.</p><p>When Dr Gradel emailed the museum’s management in February 2021 with his concerns about Dr Higgs, he got a return acknowledgement from deputy director Jonathan Williams but that was all.</p><p>Dr Gradel was unaware the management had already heard about the allegations against Dr Higgs just a day earlier, accompanied by a warning he might be being framed.  Dr Higgs had been tipped off by another archaeologist - Dorothy Lobel King, after Dr Gradel had approached her on social media for advice.</p><p>Ms Lobel King had become concerned Dr Higgs was being set up. She had emailed him, and he had forwarded the email on to Dr Williams the deputy director - the court documents now say.</p><p>The museum did investigate Dr Gradel’s concerns - but as it did so, Dr Higgs was allowed to keep running his department. He tried to throw colleagues off his scent, the museum says, by altering computer records and implying that items had gone missing decades earlier.</p></div><div data-component="image-block" width="wide"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>The museum believes Dr Higgs covered his tracks by writing a note and making it appear as though it had been written in 1963</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block" width="wide"><p>The day after Dr Gradel emailed his allegations, according to the museum’s court documents, it believes Dr Higgs made a report falsely claiming that the olive-green gem, which had been bought by Malcolm Hay, had actually been lost decades ago.</p><p>The museum also believes Dr Higgs marked the item as lost in its catalogue entry by inserting a note made to look like it had been written in 1963.</p><p>The British Museum chairman, George Osborne, says the museum’s court evidence suggested the thief had gone to “pretty elaborate lengths” to cover his tracks.</p><p>In May 2021, Malcolm Hay was invited to a meeting to hand back his gem. He said the museum was not really interested in where he had got it: “They were just happy to have it back.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Dr Gradel was growing increasingly anxious that he hadn’t heard anything back about his allegations, despite asking for an update several times. </p><p>Finally, in July 2021, he received a reply from deputy director Dr Williams saying the museum had carried out a “thorough investigation”. All objects had been accounted for, he was told, and there was no suggestion of wrongdoing by staff.</p><p>Dr Gradel says this was “bizarre to say the least - totally absurd”.</p><p>He knew Mr Hay’s gem had gone missing, been bought online and was only in the collection after being handed back. When Dr Gradel tried to find out more, the museum told him details were confidential.</p></div><div width="wide"><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="Gouging-marks-left-by-pliers" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">Gouging marks left by pliers</span></h2></p></div><div data-component="text-block" width="wide"><p>Inside the museum however, that was not the end of it.</p><p>In December 2021, a routine spot-check revealed items were missing in the Greece and Rome department and a top-secret second investigation was launched. The following April, a curator was hired to check every single item - although under the supervision of department head, Peter Higgs.</p><p>Nevertheless, it was becoming clear that something was very wrong.</p><p>The museum says the hired curator discovered that more than 300 registered items, many with gold mounts, had been damaged or stolen. Some of those remaining had deep gouging and scratches, which looked like marks left by pliers.</p><p>When the curator went on to look at the unregistered items contained in one particular storeroom, court documents claim she discovered that 1,161 items were missing - more than three-quarters of its entire contents.</p><p>The curator handed over preliminary reports to her boss, Dr Higgs, in late December 2022 and the museum’s court documents claim Peter Higgs tried to delay escalating the findings several times.</p><p>At first, he said it wouldn’t be good to announce the news before a weekend or Christmas, the documents claim - then, they continue, he said it was his birthday and he didn’t want to deal with the matter.</p><p>But, according to the museum, the curator insisted and her findings quickly made their way to the top.</p><p>The museum’s director at the time, Hartwig Fisher, shared the information with chairman George Osborne.</p><p>Two months before, Dr Gradel had managed to reach Mr Osborne to tell him about his suspicions. Mr Osborne told us he had been assured at the time, that they had already been investigated.</p><p>This fresh information, however, seemed too much of a coincidence.</p></div><div data-component="image-block" width="wide"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>George Osborne says it was “pretty traumatic” for museum investigators as the scale of the thefts emerged</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block" width="wide"><p>“I immediately said: ‘Well, hold on, that must be linked to that email that I saw a couple of months ago,’” Mr Osborne told the BBC.</p><p>They decided to call the police immediately and Dr Higgs was suspended.</p><p>“It took us some time as an institution to accept the betrayal of trust that these thefts represented,” Dr Fischer later told the BBC. “Betrayal by an insider has been a hard lesson to learn, and hard to prepare for”. </p><p>He later resigned from his position early over the response to Dr Gradel’s allegations.</p><p>“I think it was pretty traumatic for the people who were investigating this, particularly as the scale of the thefts emerged,” said Mr Osborne.</p><p>Both Dr Higgs’ workspace and home were raided by the Metropolitan Police over the subsequent months.</p><p>According to the museum’s High Court documents, police found handwritten notes and printed instructions on editing museum records at his work, while at home they seized items believed to have come from the museum's collections.</p><p>“I'm 100% certain we've got our man, we know who has stolen these items,” says Mr Osborne, “missing coins were found in his house”.</p><p>Dr Higgs has denied the coins came from the museum, stating they belonged to a dead relative.</p><p>He was finally dismissed from the museum in July 2023 - more than two years after Dr Gradel first raised the alarm.</p><p>Mr Osborne told the BBC the Danish antiques dealer had done the museum a great service, and he was sorry he had not been listened to initially.</p><p>“I hope he can look at the changes… and see that some good has come out of what has been a very sad and unfortunate series of events,” said Mr Osborne.</p><p>These include a commitment to catalogue every single item in the collections and tighten security processes, ensuring no member of staff can enter a storeroom alone.</p></div><div data-component="image-block" width="wide"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>A drawer of artefacts Dr Ittai Gradel says are from the British Museum, at his home in Denmark</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block" width="wide"><p>Police say the investigation is ongoing and nobody has been arrested or charged with any offence.</p><p>As for Dr Gradel, he has handed back more than 360 gemstones he believes belong to the museum, including some he had sold to other dealers and tracked down to return.</p><p>“I encourage everybody who has come by these gems to do what I've done and just hand the gems back to the museum,” he said.</p><p>The British Museum’s lack of cataloguing means Dr Gradel has had to donate items that were in his possession, while the museum tries to prove ownership. </p><p>It is considering how to reimburse buyers who unwittingly bought items online and which it believes are from its collections.</p><p>Buyers like Ittai Gradel, who says he is still working out how much money he has lost paying for gems which shouldn't have been up for sale in the first place.</p><p>“I don't think there's much more I can do to assist the museum in retrieving gems,” he says. “It's like a sort of a closure.”</p></div><div data-component="text-block" width="wide"><p>Thief at the British Museum is available on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0hz3hz1#xtor=CS8-1000-%5BEditorialPromo_Box%5D-%5BNewsEditorial_Promo%5D-%5BNewsEditorial_Promo%5D-%5BPS_SOUNDS~N~p0hz3hz1~P_BritishMuseumIntro%5D">BBC Sounds</a> or you can hear it on Radio 4, weekdays at 13:45, between 27 May and 6 June.</p><p>You can watch a documentary of the same name on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m001zrbs#xtor=CS8-1000-%5BEditorialPromo_Box%5D-%5BNewsEditorial_Promo%5D-%5BNewsEditorial_Promo%5D-%5BPS_IPLAYER~N~m001zrbs~P_BritishMuseum%5D">BBC iPlayer</a> or on BBC Two at 19:00 on 27 May.</p></div><div data-component="embed-ugc-uploader-block" id="uploader-33-u175515924" width="wide"><h2>Get in touch</h2><div><p>Do you have information about the British Museum thefts?</p></div></div><div data-component="topic-list" width="wide"><ul role="list" spacing="2"><li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/topics/cywd23g0wydt">George Osborne</a></li><li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/topics/cz5jl0zr0gmt">British Museum</a></li></ul></div></article></div>]]></description>
