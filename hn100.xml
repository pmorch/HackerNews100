<p>Ten years ago, <strong>Cindy Thomason</strong> was walking down the stairs at home when she heard her phone ring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other end was an executive from Warner Bros. Entertainment, calling to let her know that a font she designed would be featured in the upcoming blockbuster adaptation of <em>The Great Gatsby</em>.</p>
<p>“I had to sit down,” Thomason says. “I’m just somebody who decided to design a font on a whim.”</p>
<p>A nurse in suburban Virginia, Thomason began tinkering with fonts in her free time using a software package she bought for <strong>$100</strong>. She’d listed the font, which she named Grandhappy, on an online marketplace called <strong>MyFonts</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s where producers from Warner Bros. found it, and bought it to use as Jay Gatsby’s handwriting in the 2013 film.</p>
<p>It should have been a dream come true, a big break for a hobbyist font designer. But Thomason’s cut for her design’s feature-film cameo was a whopping <strong>$12</strong> — not even enough to recoup what she paid for her design software.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CPB7VLxiffO9JFF_01BYtanwJMBQciv4saD7UD87Po5XijvgyJ5DWLmh8bUd_ILSeEC3P26KWlvdQoljyWNKJ4rPrpr7Pm-FK8QKeSoyrCevk_9V2b62j8P-6oy1hy4y2amoJw0Es_DvMyvXJ3Kzaw0" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='0'%20height='0'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></figure>
<p><em>Alternate letters designed by Thomason for her Grandhappy font (Cindy Thomason)</em></p>
<p>Thomason’s story isn’t an anomaly: Fonts are a ubiquitous commodity. Every font you see — on your computer screen, a street sign, a T-shirt, or your car’s dashboard — has been crafted by a designer. With <strong>4.5k</strong> independent artists selling on MyFonts today, many struggle to attract customers and to make a living in an oversaturated market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s only getting harder, as designers must compete with and abide by the terms of one company that’s approaching behemoth status: <strong>Monotype</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company owns not only many of the world’s most popular fonts but also exchanges like MyFonts where font designers bring their work to market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The industry is inching toward a monopoly, and it’s leaving independent designers with fewer places to go.</p>
<h4 id="h-written-history"><strong>Written history</strong></h4>
<p>In 1440, when <strong>Johannes Gutenberg</strong> invented the printing press in order to mass-produce <a href="https://bookriot.com/type-foundries/">Bibles</a>, his books came with another innovation: the <a href="https://www.toptal.com/designers/ui/typeface-history">first font</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the next several centuries, countless foundries sprung up to mimic the characters forged on Gutenberg’s metal plates, experimenting with typefaces and new fonts (a typeface is the umbrella category for a uniquely designed set of letters, such as Times New Roman; a font is a specific variation of a typeface, such as Times New Roman in 16 point bold).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Monotype arrived at the end of the 19th century. The company was founded in Philadelphia by <strong>Tolbert Lanston</strong>, whose monotype machine <a href="https://library.fandm.edu/c.php?g=750623&amp;p=5376003#:~:text=Mechanical%20typesetting%20began%20in%20the,a%20set%20of%20brass%20matrixes.">invention</a> allowed for increased speed and efficiency when producing type. Over the next few decades, Monotype, by then with branches in the US and the UK, developed popular typefaces such as <strong>Gill Sans</strong>, <strong>Perpetua</strong>, and <strong>Times New Roman</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/V9t8KMPjz2Ap-njtzA-Kbbeq7ksfICULOsMxLILiIZgFbC1aB7C2DeBwl2zNFrsAdXCDDlxA6A4OWE1aJ4Oe7fK0cSP2MavPHOLhn8TwwoZFBMitKwOa58a3gL6iPSHUaS0Qe9tJEqTtzl5WE7cI7xg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='0'%20height='0'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></figure>
<p><em>A type-casting machine patent filed by Monotype founder Tolbert Lanston. (US Patent and Trademark Office)</em></p>
<p>In the last half of the 20th century, the font industry, always volatile and rife <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Type_Founders#:~:text=American%20Type%20Founders%20(ATF)%20Co,was%20incorporated%20in%20New%20Jersey.">with mergers and acquisitions</a>, went through rapid change. The mechanized process of Monotype’s signature machine faded out, replaced by phototypesetting and then digital typesetting, bringing fonts to screens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Monotype endured financial difficulties and restructurings, eventually <a href="https://www.ta.com/portfolio/investments/monotype-imaging/">being acquired</a> by the Boston private equity firm <strong>TA Associates</strong> in 2004 and going public with stock-ticker name TYPE in 2007. The retooled Monotype saw its annual revenues climb from <strong>$107m </strong>in 2010 to <strong>$247m</strong> in 2018 and became a powerhouse:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2006, <a href="https://www.linotype.com/2794/monotype-imaging-acquires-linotype.html">it purchased</a> <strong>Linotype</strong>, a major competitor since the 19th century, bringing <strong>Helvetica</strong>, <strong>Avenir</strong>, and ~6k other typefaces into its fold.</li>
<li>It bought <strong>Ascender Corporation</strong>, a digital typeface foundry, in 2010 and <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140715005448/en/Monotype-Acquires-FontShop-International"><strong>FontShop</strong>,</a> which owned more than 2.5k typefaces, in 2014.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2019, private equity firm <strong>HGGC</strong> <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90382770/legendary-type-foundry-monotype-sold-to-private-equity-for-825-million">bought</a> Monotype for <strong>$825m</strong>, acquiring its roster of typefaces and setting it up for even more acquisitions. The company has since purchased <strong>URW Foundry</strong> and <strong>Hoefler &amp; Co.</strong>, a renowned independent foundry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to <em>Quartz</em>, Monotype has claimed its purchases made life better for customers, who only have to navigate a licensing agreement from one company to access a bevy of fonts. But one font designer <a href="https://qz.com/2068310/what-monotypes-purchase-of-hoeflerco-means-to-font-designers">believed</a> the acquisition of Hoefler &amp; Co. felt like “a kraken eating up the industry.”</p>
<p>“A market with one very large player and a lot of smaller players is not a healthy market,” Gerry Leonidas, professor of typography at the University of Reading, told <em>The Hustle</em>. “It essentially stifles the competition and makes it difficult for alternative models to grow.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/TnkK7SgyG-u5_LS2Ls3COfEkd0ZhD6PfKKkAOtitG-jETVoJSNh7rDUYczebeHPMTlH6mSppYrucNjDfNc5TYz6hoLD9gW7wFFNKFoV3t2NMne7fRJqRsHI0EHHDPqdalyt-o0FmOcJkF_zE5G9_KCs" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='0'%20height='0'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></figure>

<p>While boutique foundries still exist and do work for big companies, Monotype owns most major fonts: Arial, Helvetica, Gotham, Times New Roman. Its main competitors are Adobe Fonts and Google Fonts, the latter of which gives away fonts for free.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the giants, there are thousands of other designers, some hobbyists and some full-time font makers, who try to sell their typefaces. Most of them have to go through — you guessed it — Monotype.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4 id="h-competing-with-monotype"><strong>Competing with Monotype</strong></h4>
<p>In 2012, Monotype made one of its most noteworthy acquisitions. It <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120319006604/en/Monotype-Imaging-Completes-Acquisition-of-Bitstream%E2%80%99s-Font-Business">paid</a> $50m for the parent company of MyFonts, the website where Cindy Thomason and other independent designers and foundries hope to sell their fonts to the likes of independent graphic designers, ad agencies shopping for client projects, or major brands.</p>
<ul>
<li>The MyFonts marketplace features <strong>4.5k</strong> foundries selling more than <strong>250k</strong> typefaces. Other marketplaces like <strong>Creative Market</strong> and <strong>Etsy</strong> feature <strong>82k</strong> and <strong>5k+</strong> fonts, respectively.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Foundries set their own prices. The average font costs <strong>$29</strong> and sells per use or in perpetuity, depending on licensing agreements.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Monotype tells <em>The Hustle</em> that of the thousands of foundries selling on MyFonts, about <strong>55%</strong> say their earnings provide passive income, while <strong>45%</strong> report earning a living selling fonts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much of their earnings go back to Monotype, which takes a <strong>50% cut</strong> of every sale on its site. (Creative Market similarly takes a 50% commission fee, while Etsy charges 20 cents per listing and takes a 6.5% fee for every sale.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although other marketplaces take smaller cuts, MyFonts is known in the industry for being the gold standard for audience reach. <strong>Ellen Luff</strong>, who runs <a href="https://ellenlufftype.com/">Ellen Luff Type Foundry</a> and whose Larken font (starting at $42) is a MyFonts bestseller, told <em>The Hustle</em> there’s little choice but to use the site.</p>
<p>“When you’re independent, you’ve got your freedom, which is great. But then you have to balance being overlooked, and trying to beat [MyFonts] because they are a monster,” she said. “They are huge.”</p>
<p>The power of Monotype and MyFonts isn’t the only obstacle for independents. Luff has spotted her fonts being used by corporations such as Apple and NASA, sometimes without her permission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luff says half of her clients come from retrospective licensing agreements made after she’s found her designs being used illegally. But going up against large companies is no easy feat for independent designers who have no legal teams to support them in negotiations.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Y2Lgr3PJV7YC2VElHoGBMd4kdpd-BM3sDz628XSV_T1Y82wiyQSL7zpLbcFTZ_UQwkvId_IcQacBnTq8wFmuvp11EmWv8EY0GYNte8-8i0wFtu-bfUDT-z5EwhTqUKsX1AAJyyYEotEMfYU8uM6Uins" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='0'%20height='0'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></figure>
<p><em>A display of old type at Monotype’s offices in Woburn, Massachusetts. (Getty Images/Boston Globe)</em></p>
<p>For designers who partner with Monotype, though, the company puts its power into handling infringement issues. That’s why, for many designers, MyFonts pays off.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sam Parrett</strong>, typeface designer and owner of <a href="https://setsailstudios.com/">Set Sail Studios</a>, has a <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/la-luxes-font-set-sail-studios">bestseller</a> on MyFonts, La Luxes, priced at $29 for a pack of two fonts. On average, Parrett makes <strong>$7k per month</strong> through MyFonts sales after the site’s 50% fee.</p>
<p>He says custom work made up just under 6% of his income in 2022, and he takes on about four custom projects per year while he focuses on creating fonts for marketplaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And Parrett’s fonts, which he first draws by hand, pop up everywhere:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>

<li>On the covers of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CUDHlK4Njv5/?img_index=1">Diana Ross</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B9XUXk4Hh4g/">Katy Perry</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CK2GntgHGm0/">Cardi B</a> albums.&nbsp;</li>
<li>As logos for <a href="https://setsailstudios.com/netflix-hit-shows-use-set-sail-fonts/">multiple</a> Netflix series.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>“I drive my wife mad because everywhere I go I’m like, ‘That’s my font!’” Parrett said. “It’s so crazy because it’s just me in my spare bedroom writing these letters.”</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/5P1uNyNI8KhZb_dsj5hui26rSUYGWST4lkFZxWMLF3-02wscbGKhaYRU4h2px7-QOKQrIjI4yPug3LjrtHZy7gOjql18pqg5JorVg1aezIhSyUBU1VEBVFNAm3tlImNnisJHI88RSjxAHctEUQAXRks" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='0'%20height='0'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></figure>
<p><em>Designer Sam Parrett sketching fonts by hand (Sam Parrett)</em></p>
<p><a href="https://paulogoode.com/"><strong>Paulo Goode</strong></a>, who started out as a hobbyist type designer, says the MyFonts platform helped him launch his career.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I decided to go full time as an independent type designer less than 18 months after my first release at MyFonts,” he said. “I haven’t looked back since.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Goode eventually sold the majority of his font portfolio to Monotype.</p>
<h4 id="h-is-ai-coming-for-font-designers"><strong>Is AI coming for font designers?</strong></h4>
<p>This month, Monotype plans to introduce a new program that will shift the MyFonts marketplace toward a subscription model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rather than coming to the site, finding a font, and figuring out which licensing to pay for, customers can instead opt to pay for a Monotype subscription where the licensing is pre-covered for a larger variety of fonts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Royalties will be calculated by taking into account a foundry’s percentage of all ecommerce revenue as well as how often its fonts are used by customers in prototyping and production stages, potentially compensating foundries for use cases that previously went unpaid.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Those metrics are then multiplied by the amount Monotype bills all its customers for the quarter, and lastly by a foundry’s royalty rate. Foundries have the option to opt into the Monotype Fonts subscription program in addition to normal licensing.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mary Catherine Pflug</strong>, Monotype’s director of partner product and operations, says she believes the plan will help designers earn more by offering payments every time a font is used rather than just for a final product. Plus, she says foundries will have access to more immediate data on their fonts, allowing them to make informed business and design decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leonidas, the typography professor, says the issue is that Monotype itself owns many of the most popularly licensed fonts and will disproportionately benefit from a subscription structure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“These things work very well if you are Helvetica — you’ll get quite a lot of money from this. If you have a very good typeface that is used for music publishing or poetry, you might get nothing,” he said. “They’re putting money back in their own pockets.”</p>
<p>Some font designers told <em>The Hustle </em>they fear the move will force them to put more trust into Monotype, surrendering the control that comes with clear payments for each sale and instead relying on the company’s internal calculations.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7JoY021Q6C7tG5aEc1aUXWIqlDrYoMVPXKQ6agG71KkYfxpCnDyCFDN-MwaHe-EGGc9khyvzszIwtvzs3k1UphFZb3aADfvy8XQ7YMdPWFtJgw6G2a3g-anWyHqZm4J5a5R1SLty92lCSjHSUc03joU" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='0'%20height='0'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></figure>
<p><em>A wall of Monotype logos. (Getty Images/Boston Globe)</em></p>
<p>“[Monotype] keeps saying, ‘We are going to simplify it for the customers and get you more business,’ but you’re not getting us more business,” Luff said. “It’s a way of them cutting the pie differently but not necessarily in anyone else’s favor.”</p>
<p>Pflug is resolute that the program will bring positive change.</p>
<p>“The biggest struggle facing indie foundries today is getting their work discovered by and into the hands of creatives, and in handling the challenging nuances of font licensing. We are not competing with foundries — we’re a channel for foundries to reach more customers.”</p>
<p>To add to the complexities, artificial intelligence may put pressure on the already crowded industry. For now, Parrett feels his job is safe from AI.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“There are people saying it’s going to happen at some point, that it’s just a matter of when,” he said. “But it’s a handcrafted artisan industry — AI can’t get the precision right.”</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/iYiViMZ3Q1FB1sJI7JuKnAOqIuaAvPyygPXvLJQ39URgCEOihD06o6hVwWEMlOsEpV2GWbquTZu6mxXF6UEoxTP9mWYaf_LpZxJKH3lOqNuROIUK9okakBKrlKtWlDD8zXpa6wN2ZSiFZ8q5poMX9Wk" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='0'%20height='0'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></figure>
<p><em>A green sign featuring Monotype’s old stock ticker symbol at its offices in Woburn, Massachusetts. (Getty Images/Boston Globe).</em></p>
<p>That optimism, however, will likely be tested as Monotype begins dabbling with AI. The company already owns WhatTheFont, an app that uses deep learning to identify fonts from photographs, and it’s added an AI-powered font-pairing <a href="https://www.monotype.com/font-pairing#/playground?fontPair1=Mentor%20Sans&amp;fontPair2=Dante%20MT%20Pro">feature</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Monotype says it plans to use machine learning and AI to improve how users discover new fonts on its platform — an innovation that will undoubtedly affect foundries, though it remains to be seen exactly how.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even amid Monotype’s takeover, an influx of free fonts, and the growing threat of AI, there will always be a need for font makers with an appreciation for the craft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I think half of what makes art is the story and meaning behind it,” Luff said. “Although AI will be able to make beautiful curves and replicate trends, it won’t have the story. People are looking for the human relation to the words.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A Ph.D. student at Michigan State University said his mother was arrested in Bangladesh after he criticized the country's government in a Facebook post.</p><p>Tanzilur Rahman, who is pursuing his doctorate in materials science and engineering, said his mother, 58, was arrested by the Bangladesh Police on Sunday. Three days before, he posted his thoughts on the Bangladesh government’s role in the war crime trials of a prominent preacher and leader in the Jamaat-e-Islami party, a major Islamist political party in the country.</p><p>“As a son, it is very upsetting that, because of your opinion, your mother has been detained. It’s really upsetting,” Rahman told NBC News.</p><p>Court documents translated by NBC News said that Rahman’s mother, Anisa Siddika, was arrested at 11:40 a.m. at her parents’ home and charged with “planning to sabotage various vital installations, conspiracies, and sabotage against the government in protest against the arrest of multiple leaders and activists of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami.” Rahman said he had hired an attorney to work on the case and obtain these documents.&nbsp;</p><p>Siddika was charged under <a href="http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-462/section-11085.html">the Special Powers Act of 1974</a> after police said they were patrolling the area based on “secret information” and learned that political leaders and activists were at the home. The documents alleged that Siddika had arranged secret meetings against the government, which Rahman said was a baseless claim. She was denied bail because the police said she would “abscond,” according to the documents.</p><p>In his Facebook post, Rahman, 30, questioned the 2013 trial and sentencing of Islamic leader Delwar Hossain Sayedee and the disappearance of a key witness for his defense. Sayedee was charged with rape, murder and the persecution of Hindus during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. He died in prison last week, which prompted mass protests, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/15/bangladeshi-religious-leader-buried-after-violent-protests">Al Jazeera reported</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Rahman believes his Aug. 17 post was the real reason for his mother’s arrest.</p><p>“I don’t think any people with a logical mind would have arranged that meeting in their elderly parents’ house,” he said. Rahman said it was easy for the police to locate Siddika since his grandparents have lived in their house since 1962 and are well respected in the area.&nbsp;</p><p>Rahman said his family in Bangladesh only saw Siddika once during her bail hearing on Wednesday and Thursday. “We are kind of hopeless right now,” he said.</p><p>The Bangladesh Police did not respond to requests for comment.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Bangladesh Embassy and Consulate General of Bangladesh did not respond to request for comment.</p><p>Rahman’s Facebook post, which gained traction in the Bangladeshi community in and outside the country, criticized enforced disappearances in which the government directly or indirectly kidnaps people and detains them — a common practice in the country. But he said he was surprised that it was used against his mother.</p><p>“I’m not a famous columnist or not a very known person. So, I did not expect that this would happen to my family,” he said.</p><p>Experts say the incident speaks to a growing concern about censorship in the country.</p><p>Ali Riaz, a politics and government professor at Illinois State University, said Siddika’s arrest is part of a larger concern in Bangladesh and the diaspora.</p><p>For Riaz, the most pressing issue is “the persecution of … families of the diaspora who speak out,” he said. “Someone who is away from Bangladesh, who is an adult, made a comment, whatever that comment is, expressed his opinion. That by no means legally, ethically, morally justified persecuting his family. The government is putting a different story for arresting the student’s mother, but that’s not a justifiable action by any means. And this is not exceptional.”</p><p>Riaz said he believes the problem is only expected to worsen, especially as the country inches closer to an election in January, a vote that has serious implications for the future of Bangladesh’s democracy, <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/new-bangladesh-survey-hasina-remains-popular-opposition-support-and-public-discontent-are">according to the&nbsp;Council on Foreign Relations</a>, a New York-based think tank.</p><p>“To me, whether he’s supporting a cleric with a checkered past or is controversial — that’s not the point," Riaz said of Rahman. "The point is his freedom of expression. The point is that parents or relatives can be persecuted for the opinions of an adult.</p><p>“Innocent people are being harassed and persecuted.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://adamj.eu/tech/2021/05/11/python-type-hints-args-and-kwargs/">https://adamj.eu/tech/2021/05/11/python-type-hints-args-and-kwargs/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37282385">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><time datetime="2021-05-11">2021-05-11</time><img alt="A typographer’s governor (apparently)." title="A typographer’s governor (apparently)." src="https://adamj.eu/tech/assets/2021-05-11-governor.jpg"><p>When I started writing type hints, I was a little confused about what to do with Python’s variable argument operators, <code>*</code> and <code>**</code> (often called <code>*args</code> and <code>**kwargs</code>). Here’s what I figured out.</p><p>Recall that the <code>*</code> operator captures variable positional arguments in a <code>tuple</code>, and <code>**</code> captures variable <em>keyword</em> arguments in a <code>dict</code>. For example, take this function:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>variable</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>):</span>
    <span>...</span>
</pre></div><p>In the function body, <code>args</code> will be a <code>tuple</code>, and <code>kwargs</code> a dict with string keys.</p><p>When adding type hints, it seems natural to try declare the full types of <code>args</code> and <code>kwargs</code>. If we wanted all our values to be <code>int</code>s, we might try:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>variable</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>tuple</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>],</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>:</span> <span>dict</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
    <span>...</span>
</pre></div><p>(The <code>...</code> in the tuple definition makes it a tuple of any length.)</p><p>But this is incorrect. We can check by adding a call:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>variable</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>=</span><span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>=</span><span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>c</span><span>=</span><span>6</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div><p>Running Mypy on the file, it finds a problem with every argument(!):</p><div><pre><span></span>$ mypy example.py
example.py:5: error: Argument 1 to "variable" has incompatible type "int"; expected "Tuple[int, ...]"
example.py:5: error: Argument 2 to "variable" has incompatible type "int"; expected "Tuple[int, ...]"
example.py:5: error: Argument 3 to "variable" has incompatible type "int"; expected "Tuple[int, ...]"
example.py:5: error: Argument "a" to "variable" has incompatible type "int"; expected "Dict[str, int]"
example.py:5: error: Argument "b" to "variable" has incompatible type "int"; expected "Dict[str, int]"
example.py:5: error: Argument "c" to "variable" has incompatible type "int"; expected "Dict[str, int]"
Found 6 errors in 1 file (checked 1 source file)
</pre></div><p>Uh oh! What’s the right way then?</p><p><code>*</code> always binds to a <code>tuple</code>, and <code>**</code> always binds to a dict with string keys. Because of this restriction, type hints only need you to define the types of the contained arguments. The type checker automatically adds the <code>tuple[_, <span>...]</span></code> and <code>dict[str, _]</code> container types.</p><p>The Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) that introduced type hints, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#arbitrary-argument-lists-and-default-argument-values">PEP 484</a>, specified this rule:</p><blockquote><p>Arbitrary argument lists can as well be type annotated, so that the definition:</p><p><code>def <span>foo(*args:</span> str, **kwds: int): ...</code></p><p>is acceptable… In the body of function <code>foo</code>, the type of variable <code>args</code> is deduced as <code>Tuple[str, <span>...]</span></code> and the type of variable <code>kwds</code> is <code>Dict[str, int]</code>.</p></blockquote><p>So, we can correctly type our function as:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>variable</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
    <span>...</span>
</pre></div><p>This then passes type checks:</p><div><pre><span></span>$ mypy example.py
Success: no issues found in 1 source file

<p dir="auto">Python, being a beautifully designed high-level and interpreter-based programming language, provides us with many features for the programmer's comfort. But sometimes, the outcomes of a Python snippet may not seem obvious at first sight.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here's a fun project attempting to explain what exactly is happening under the hood for some counter-intuitive snippets and lesser-known features in Python.</p>
<p dir="auto">While some of the examples you see below may not be WTFs in the truest sense, but they'll reveal some of the interesting parts of Python that you might be unaware of. I find it a nice way to learn the internals of a programming language, and I believe that you'll find it interesting too!</p>
<p dir="auto">If you're an experienced Python programmer, you can take it as a challenge to get most of them right in the first attempt. You may have already experienced some of them before, and I might be able to revive sweet old memories of yours! 😅</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>Carefully read the initial code for setting up the example. If you're an experienced Python programmer, you'll successfully anticipate what's going to happen next most of the time.</li>
<li>Read the output snippets and,
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Check if the outputs are the same as you'd expect.</li>
<li>Make sure if you know the exact reason behind the output being the way it is.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>If the answer is no (which is perfectly okay), take a deep breath, and read the explanation (and if you still don't understand, shout out! and create an issue <a href="https://github.com/satwikkansal/wtfpython/issues/new">here</a>).</li>
<li>If yes, give a gentle pat on your back, and you may skip to the next example.</li>

<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">💡 Explanation:</h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The behavior in first and second snippets is due to a CPython optimization (called string interning) that tries to use existing immutable objects in some cases rather than creating a new object every time.</li>
<li>After being "interned," many variables may reference the same string object in memory (saving memory thereby).</li>
<li>In the snippets above, strings are implicitly interned. The decision of when to implicitly intern a string is implementation-dependent. There are some rules that can be used to guess if a string will be interned or not:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>All length 0 and length 1 strings are interned.</li>
<li>Strings are interned at compile time (<code>'wtf'</code> will be interned but <code>''.join(['w', 't', 'f'])</code> will not be interned)</li>
<li>Strings that are not composed of ASCII letters, digits or underscores, are not interned. This explains why <code>'wtf!'</code> was not interned due to <code>!</code>. CPython implementation of this rule can be found <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.6/Objects/codeobject.c#L19">here</a>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/satwikkansal/wtfpython/blob/master/images/string-intern/string_intern.png"><img src="https://github.com/satwikkansal/wtfpython/raw/master/images/string-intern/string_intern.png" alt="image"></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are set to <code>"wtf!"</code> in the same line, the Python interpreter creates a new object, then references the second variable at the same time. If you do it on separate lines, it doesn't "know" that there's already <code>"wtf!"</code> as an object (because <code>"wtf!"</code> is not implicitly interned as per the facts mentioned above). It's a compile-time optimization. This optimization doesn't apply to 3.7.x versions of CPython (check this <a href="https://github.com/satwikkansal/wtfpython/issues/100" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/satwikkansal/wtfpython/issues/100/hovercard">issue</a> for more discussion).</li>
<li>A compile unit in an interactive environment like IPython consists of a single statement, whereas it consists of the entire module in case of modules. <code>a, b = "wtf!", "wtf!"</code> is single statement, whereas <code>a = "wtf!"; b = "wtf!"</code> are two statements in a single line. This explains why the identities are different in <code>a = "wtf!"; b = "wtf!"</code>, and also explain why they are same when invoked in <code>some_file.py</code></li>
<li>The abrupt change in the output of the fourth snippet is due to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peephole_optimization" rel="nofollow">peephole optimization</a> technique known as Constant folding. This means the expression <code>'a'*20</code> is replaced by <code>'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa'</code> during compilation to save a  few clock cycles during runtime. Constant folding only occurs for strings having a length of less than 21. (Why? Imagine the size of <code>.pyc</code> file generated as a result of the expression <code>'a'*10**10</code>). <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.6/Python/peephole.c#L288">Here's</a> the implementation source for the same.</li>
<li>Note: In Python 3.7, Constant folding was moved out from peephole optimizer to the new AST optimizer with some change in logic as well, so the fourth snippet doesn't work for Python 3.7. You can read more about the change <a href="https://bugs.python.org/issue11549" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</li>

<ul dir="auto">

<li><code>True is False == False</code> is equivalent to <code>(True is False) and (False == False)</code> and since the first part of the statement (<code>True is False</code>) evaluates to <code>False</code>, the overall expression evaluates to <code>False</code>.</li>
<li><code>1 &gt; 0 &lt; 1</code> is equivalent to <code>(1 &gt; 0) and (0 &lt; 1)</code> which evaluates to <code>True</code>.</li>

<p dir="auto"><strong>The difference between <code>is</code> and <code>==</code></strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">

<li><code>==</code> operator compares the values of both the operands and checks if they are the same.</li>
<li>So <code>is</code> is for reference equality and <code>==</code> is for value equality. An example to clear things up,

<p dir="auto">The current implementation keeps an array of integer objects for all integers between -5 and 256, when you create an int in that range you just get back a reference to the existing object. So it should be possible to change the value of 1. I suspect the behavior of Python, in this case, is undefined. :-)</p>

<p dir="auto">Here the interpreter isn't smart enough while executing <code>y = 257</code> to recognize that we've already created an integer of the value <code>257,</code> and so it goes on to create another object in the memory.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">When a and b are set to <code>257</code> in the same line, the Python interpreter creates a new object, then references the second variable at the same time. If you do it on separate lines, it doesn't "know" that there's already <code>257</code> as an object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">It's a compiler optimization and specifically applies to the interactive environment. When you enter two lines in a live interpreter, they're compiled separately, therefore optimized separately. If you were to try this example in a <code>.py</code> file, you would not see the same behavior, because the file is compiled all at once. This optimization is not limited to integers, it works for other immutable data types like strings (check the "Strings are tricky example") and floats as well,</p>

<p dir="auto">Why didn't this work for Python 3.7? The abstract reason is because such compiler optimizations are implementation specific (i.e. may change with version, OS, etc).

<p dir="auto">So, why is Python all over the place?</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">💡 Explanation</h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Uniqueness of keys in a Python dictionary is by <em>equivalence</em>, not identity. So even though <code>5</code>, <code>5.0</code>, and <code>5 + 0j</code> are distinct objects of different types, since they're equal, they can't both be in the same <code>dict</code> (or <code>set</code>). As soon as you insert any one of them, attempting to look up any distinct but equivalent key will succeed with the original mapped value (rather than failing with a <code>KeyError</code>):</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=">>> 5 == 5.0 == 5 + 0j
True
>>> 5 is not 5.0 is not 5 + 0j
True
>>> some_dict = {}
>>> some_dict[5.0] = &quot;Ruby&quot;
>>> 5.0 in some_dict
True
>>> (5 in some_dict) and (5 + 0j in some_dict)
True"><pre><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>5</span> <span>==</span> <span>5.0</span> <span>==</span> <span>5</span> <span>+</span> <span>0j</span>
<span>True</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>5</span> <span>is</span> <span>not</span> <span>5.0</span> <span>is</span> <span>not</span> <span>5</span> <span>+</span> <span>0j</span>
<span>True</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>some_dict</span> <span>=</span> {}
<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>some_dict</span>[<span>5.0</span>] <span>=</span> <span>"Ruby"</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>5.0</span> <span>in</span> <span>some_dict</span>
<span>True</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> (<span>5</span> <span>in</span> <span>some_dict</span>) <span>and</span> (<span>5</span> <span>+</span> <span>0j</span> <span>in</span> <span>some_dict</span>)
<span>True</span></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">This applies when setting an item as well. So when you do <code>some_dict[5] = "Python"</code>, Python finds the existing item with equivalent key <code>5.0 -&gt; "Ruby"</code>, overwrites its value in place, and leaves the original key alone.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=">>> some_dict
{5.0: 'Ruby'}
>>> some_dict[5] = &quot;Python&quot;
>>> some_dict
{5.0: 'Python'}"><pre><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>some_dict</span>
{<span>5.0</span>: <span>'Ruby'</span>}
<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>some_dict</span>[<span>5</span>] <span>=</span> <span>"Python"</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>some_dict</span>
{<span>5.0</span>: <span>'Python'</span>}</pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">So how can we update the key to <code>5</code> (instead of <code>5.0</code>)? We can't actually do this update in place, but what we can do is first delete the key (<code>del some_dict[5.0]</code>), and then set it (<code>some_dict[5]</code>) to get the integer <code>5</code> as the key instead of floating <code>5.0</code>, though this should be needed in rare cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">How did Python find <code>5</code> in a dictionary containing <code>5.0</code>? Python does this in constant time without having to scan through every item by using hash functions. When Python looks up a key <code>foo</code> in a dict, it first computes <code>hash(foo)</code> (which runs in constant-time). Since in Python it is required that objects that compare equal also have the same hash value (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__" rel="nofollow">docs</a> here), <code>5</code>, <code>5.0</code>, and <code>5 + 0j</code> have the same hash value.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=">>> 5 == 5.0 == 5 + 0j
True
>>> hash(5) == hash(5.0) == hash(5 + 0j)
True"><pre><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>5</span> <span>==</span> <span>5.0</span> <span>==</span> <span>5</span> <span>+</span> <span>0j</span>
<span>True</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>hash</span>(<span>5</span>) <span>==</span> <span>hash</span>(<span>5.0</span>) <span>==</span> <span>hash</span>(<span>5</span> <span>+</span> <span>0j</span>)
<span>True</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note:</strong> The inverse is not necessarily true: Objects with equal hash values may themselves be unequal. (This causes what's known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_(computer_science)" rel="nofollow">hash collision</a>, and degrades the constant-time performance that hashing usually provides.)</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">When <code>id</code> was called, Python created a <code>WTF</code> class object and passed it to the <code>id</code> function. The <code>id</code> function takes its <code>id</code> (its memory location), and throws away the object. The object is destroyed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">When we do this twice in succession, Python allocates the same memory location to this second object as well. Since (in CPython) <code>id</code> uses the memory location as the object id, the id of the two objects is the same.</p>

<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">💡 Explanation:</h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">The reason why intransitive equality didn't hold among <code>dictionary</code>, <code>ordered_dict</code> and <code>another_ordered_dict</code> is because of the way <code>__eq__</code> method is implemented in <code>OrderedDict</code> class. From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#ordereddict-objects" rel="nofollow">docs</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Equality tests between OrderedDict objects are order-sensitive and are implemented as <code>list(od1.items())==list(od2.items())</code>. Equality tests between <code>OrderedDict</code> objects and other Mapping objects are order-insensitive like regular dictionaries.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The reason for this equality in behavior is that it allows <code>OrderedDict</code> objects to be directly substituted anywhere a regular dictionary is used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Okay, so why did changing the order affect the length of the generated <code>set</code> object? The answer is the lack of intransitive equality only. Since sets are "unordered" collections of unique elements, the order in which elements are inserted shouldn't matter. But in this case, it does matter. Let's break it down a bit,</p>

<p dir="auto">Did you expect the loop to run just once?</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>💡 Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The assignment statement <code>i = 10</code> never affects the iterations of the loop because of the way for loops work in Python.

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The <code>enumerate(some_string)</code> function yields a new value <code>i</code> (a counter going up) and a character from the <code>some_string</code> in each iteration.

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=">>> i, some_dict[i] = (0, 'w')

<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">In a <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators" rel="nofollow">generator</a> expression, the <code>in</code> clause is evaluated at declaration time, but the conditional clause is evaluated at runtime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">So before runtime, <code>array</code> is re-assigned to the list <code>[2, 8, 22]</code>, and since out of <code>1</code>, <code>8</code> and <code>15</code>, only the count of <code>8</code> is greater than <code>0</code>, the generator only yields <code>8</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The differences in the output of <code>g1</code> and <code>g2</code> in the second part is due the way variables <code>array_1</code> and <code>array_2</code> are re-assigned values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">In the first case, <code>array_1</code> is bound to the new object <code>[1,2,3,4,5]</code> and since the <code>in</code> clause is evaluated at the declaration time it still refers to the old object <code>[1,2,3,4]</code> (which is not destroyed).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">In the second case, the slice assignment to <code>array_2</code> updates the same old object <code>[1,2,3,4]</code> to <code>[1,2,3,4,5]</code>. Hence both the <code>g2</code> and <code>array_2</code> still have reference to the same object (which has now been updated to <code>[1,2,3,4,5]</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Okay, going by the logic discussed so far, shouldn't be the value of <code>list(gen)</code> in the third snippet be <code>[11, 21, 31, 12, 22, 32, 13, 23, 33]</code>? (because <code>array_3</code> and <code>array_4</code> are going to behave just like <code>array_1</code>). The reason why (only) <code>array_4</code> values got updated is explained in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0289/#the-details" rel="nofollow">PEP-289</a></p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>When defining a function inside a loop that uses the loop variable in its body, the loop function's closure is bound to the <em>variable</em>, not its <em>value</em>. The function looks up <code>x</code> in the surrounding context, rather than using the value of <code>x</code> at the time the function is created. So all of the functions use the latest value assigned to the variable for computation. We can see that it's using the <code>x</code> from the surrounding context (i.e. <em>not</em> a local variable) with:</li>

<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>type</code> is a <a href="https://realpython.com/python-metaclasses/" rel="nofollow">metaclass</a> in Python.</li>
<li><strong>Everything</strong> is an <code>object</code> in Python, which includes classes as well as their objects (instances).</li>
<li>class <code>type</code> is the metaclass of class <code>object</code>, and every class (including <code>type</code>) has inherited directly or indirectly from <code>object</code>.</li>
<li>There is no real base class among <code>object</code> and <code>type</code>. The confusion in the above snippets is arising because we're thinking about these relationships (<code>issubclass</code> and <code>isinstance</code>) in terms of Python classes. The relationship between <code>object</code> and <code>type</code> can't be reproduced in pure python. To be more precise the following relationships can't be reproduced in pure Python,
<ul dir="auto">
<li>class A is an instance of class B, and class B is an instance of class A.</li>
<li>class A is an instance of itself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These relationships between <code>object</code> and <code>type</code> (both being instances of each other as well as themselves) exist in Python because of "cheating" at the implementation level.</li>

<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">💡 Explanation:</h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Subclass relationships are not necessarily transitive in Python. Anyone is allowed to define their own, arbitrary <code>__subclasscheck__</code> in a metaclass.</li>
<li>When <code>issubclass(cls, Hashable)</code> is called, it simply looks for non-Falsey "<code>__hash__</code>" method in <code>cls</code> or anything it inherits from.</li>
<li>Since <code>object</code> is hashable, but <code>list</code> is non-hashable, it breaks the transitivity relation.</li>

<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">💡 Explanation</h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Functions are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/descriptor.html" rel="nofollow">descriptors</a>. Whenever a function is accessed as an
attribute, the descriptor is invoked, creating a method object which "binds" the function with the object owning the
attribute. If called, the method calls the function, implicitly passing the bound object as the first argument
(this is how we get <code>self</code> as the first argument, despite not passing it explicitly).</li>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>Accessing the attribute multiple times creates a method object every time! Therefore <code>o1.method is o1.method</code> is
never truthy. Accessing functions as class attributes (as opposed to instance) does not create methods, however; so
<code>SomeClass.method is SomeClass.method</code> is truthy.</li>

<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">💡 Explanation</h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>In a usual python string, the backslash is used to escape characters that may have a special meaning (like single-quote, double-quote, and the backslash itself).

</li>
<li>In a raw string literal (as indicated by the prefix <code>r</code>),  the backslashes pass themselves as is along with the behavior of escaping the following character.
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=">>> r'wt\&quot;f' == 'wt\\&quot;f'
True
>>> print(repr(r'wt\&quot;f')
'wt\\&quot;f'

>>> print(&quot;\n&quot;)

>>> print(r&quot;\\n&quot;)
'\\n'"><pre><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>r'wt\"f'</span> <span>==</span> <span>'wt<span>\\</span>"f'</span>
<span>True</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>print</span>(<span>repr</span>(<span>r'wt\"f'</span>)
'<span>wt</span>\\"f'

<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>print</span>(<span>"<span>\n</span>"</span>)

<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>print</span>(<span>r"\\n"</span>)
'\\<span>n</span>'</pre></div>
</li>
<li>This means when a parser encounters a backslash in a raw string, it expects another character following it. And in our case (<code>print(r"\")</code>), the backslash escaped the trailing quote, leaving the parser without a terminating quote (hence the <code>SyntaxError</code>). That's why backslashes don't work at the end of a raw string.</li>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>Operator precedence affects how an expression is evaluated, and <code>==</code> operator has higher precedence than <code>not</code> operator in Python.</li>
<li>So <code>not x == y</code> is equivalent to <code>not (x == y)</code> which is equivalent to <code>not (True == False)</code> finally evaluating to <code>True</code>.</li>
<li>But <code>x == not y</code> raises a <code>SyntaxError</code> because it can be thought of being equivalent to <code>(x == not) y</code> and not <code>x == (not y)</code> which you might have expected at first sight.</li>
<li>The parser expected the <code>not</code> token to be a part of the <code>not in</code> operator (because both <code>==</code> and <code>not in</code> operators have the same precedence), but after not being able to find an <code>in</code> token following the <code>not</code> token, it raises a <code>SyntaxError</code>.</li>

<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">💡 Explanation:</h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>From Python 3.3 onwards, it became possible to use <code>return</code> statement with values inside generators (See <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0380/" rel="nofollow">PEP380</a>). The <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0380/#enhancements-to-stopiteration" rel="nofollow">official docs</a> say that,</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">"... <code>return expr</code> in a generator causes <code>StopIteration(expr)</code> to be raised upon exit from the generator."</p>
</blockquote>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">In the case of <code>some_func(3)</code>, <code>StopIteration</code> is raised at the beginning because of <code>return</code> statement. The <code>StopIteration</code> exception is automatically caught inside the <code>list(...)</code> wrapper and the <code>for</code> loop. Therefore, the above two snippets result in an empty list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">To get <code>["wtf"]</code> from the generator <code>some_func</code> we need to catch the <code>StopIteration</code> exception,</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="try:
    next(some_func(3))

<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">💡 Explanation:</h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>'inf'</code> and <code>'nan'</code> are special strings (case-insensitive), which, when explicitly typecast-ed to <code>float</code> type, are used to represent mathematical "infinity" and "not a number" respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Since according to IEEE standards <code> NaN != NaN</code>, obeying this rule breaks the reflexivity assumption of a collection element in Python i.e. if <code>x</code> is a part of a collection like <code>list</code>, the implementations like comparison are based on the assumption that <code>x == x</code>.  Because of this assumption, the identity is compared first (since it's faster) while comparing two elements, and the values are compared only when the identities mismatch. The following snippet will make things clearer,</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=">>> x = float('nan')
>>> x == x, [x] == [x]

<p dir="auto">Since the identities of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are different, the values are considered, which are also different; hence the comparison returns <code>False</code> this time.</p>

<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">💡 Explanation:</h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>According to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#assignment-statements" rel="nofollow">Python language reference</a>, assignment statements have the form
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="(target_list &quot;=&quot;)+ (expression_list | yield_expression)"><pre><code>(target_list "=")+ (expression_list | yield_expression)
</code></pre></div>
and</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">An assignment statement evaluates the expression list (remember that this can be a single expression or a comma-separated list, the latter yielding a tuple) and assigns the single resulting object to each of the target lists, from left to right.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">The <code>+</code> in <code>(target_list "=")+</code> means there can be <strong>one or more</strong> target lists. In this case, target lists are <code>a, b</code> and <code>a[b]</code> (note the expression list is exactly one, which in our case is <code>{}, 5</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">After the expression list is evaluated, its value is unpacked to the target lists from <strong>left to right</strong>. So, in our case, first the <code>{}, 5</code> tuple is unpacked to <code>a, b</code> and we now have <code>a = {}</code> and <code>b = 5</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>a</code> is now assigned to <code>{}</code>, which is a mutable object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The second target list is <code>a[b]</code> (you may expect this to throw an error because both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> have not been defined in the statements before. But remember, we just assigned <code>a</code> to <code>{}</code> and <code>b</code> to <code>5</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Now, we are setting the key <code>5</code> in the dictionary to the tuple <code>({}, 5)</code> creating a circular reference (the <code>{...}</code> in the output refers to the same object that <code>a</code> is already referencing). Another simpler example of circular reference could be</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=">>> some_list = some_list[0] = [0]

<span>True</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Similar is the case in our example (<code>a[b][0]</code> is the same object as <code>a</code>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">So to sum it up, you can break the example down to</p>

<p dir="auto">And the circular reference can be justified by the fact that <code>a[b][0]</code> is the same object as <code>a</code></p>

<p dir="auto">This call to <code>int()</code> works fine in Python 3.10.6 and raises a ValueError in Python 3.10.8. Note that Python can still work with large integers. The error is only raised when converting between integers and strings.</p>

<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">💡 Explanation:</h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Iteration over a dictionary that you edit at the same time is not supported.</li>
<li>It runs eight times because that's the point at which the dictionary resizes to hold more keys (we have eight deletion entries, so a resize is needed). This is actually an implementation detail.</li>
<li>How deleted keys are handled and when the resize occurs might be different for different Python implementations.</li>
<li>So for Python versions other than Python 2.7 - Python 3.5, the count might be different from 8 (but whatever the count is, it's going to be the same every time you run it). You can find some discussion around this <a href="https://github.com/satwikkansal/wtfpython/issues/53" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/satwikkansal/wtfpython/issues/53/hovercard">here</a> or in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44763802/bug-in-python-dict" rel="nofollow">this</a> StackOverflow thread.</li>

<p dir="auto">Okay, now it's deleted 😕</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">💡 Explanation:</h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>del x</code> doesn’t directly call <code>x.__del__()</code>.</li>
<li>When <code>del x</code> is encountered, Python deletes the name <code>x</code> from current scope and decrements by 1 the reference count of the object <code>x</code> referenced. <code>__del__()</code> is called only when the object's reference count reaches zero.</li>
<li>In the second output snippet, <code>__del__()</code> was not called because the previous statement (<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; y</code>) in the interactive interpreter created another reference to the same object (specifically, the <code>_</code> magic variable which references the result value of the last non <code>None</code> expression on the REPL), thus preventing the reference count from reaching zero when <code>del y</code> was encountered.</li>
<li>Calling <code>globals</code> (or really, executing anything that will have a non <code>None</code> result) caused <code>_</code> to reference the new result, dropping the existing reference. Now the reference count reached 0 and we can see "Deleted!" being printed (finally!).</li>

<li><code>del var_name</code> just removes the binding of the <code>var_name</code> from the local or global namespace (That's why the <code>list_1</code> is unaffected).</li>
<li><code>remove</code> removes the first matching value, not a specific index, raises <code>ValueError</code> if the value is not found.</li>
<li><code>pop</code> removes the element at a specific index and returns it, raises <code>IndexError</code> if an invalid index is specified.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Why the output is <code>[2, 4]</code>?</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The list iteration is done index by index, and when we remove <code>1</code> from <code>list_2</code> or <code>list_4</code>, the contents of the lists are now <code>[2, 3, 4]</code>. The remaining elements are shifted down, i.e., <code>2</code> is at index 0, and <code>3</code> is at index 1. Since the next iteration is going to look at index 1 (which is the <code>3</code>), the <code>2</code> gets skipped entirely. A similar thing will happen with every alternate element in the list sequence.</li>

<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">💡 Explanation:</h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>From Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow">docs</a>, here's an approximate implementation of zip function,
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="def zip(*iterables):
    sentinel = object()
    iterators = [iter(it) for it in iterables]
    while iterators:
        result = []
        for it in iterators:
            elem = next(it, sentinel)
            if elem is sentinel: return
            result.append(elem)
        yield tuple(result)"><pre><span>def</span> <span>zip</span>(<span>*</span><span>iterables</span>):
    <span>sentinel</span> <span>=</span> <span>object</span>()
    <span>iterators</span> <span>=</span> [<span>iter</span>(<span>it</span>) <span>for</span> <span>it</span> <span>in</span> <span>iterables</span>]
    <span>while</span> <span>iterators</span>:
        <span>result</span> <span>=</span> []
        <span>for</span> <span>it</span> <span>in</span> <span>iterators</span>:
            <span>elem</span> <span>=</span> <span>next</span>(<span>it</span>, <span>sentinel</span>)
            <span>if</span> <span>elem</span> <span>is</span> <span>sentinel</span>: <span>return</span>
            <span>result</span>.<span>append</span>(<span>elem</span>)
        <span>yield</span> <span>tuple</span>(<span>result</span>)</pre></div>
</li>
<li>So the function takes in arbitrary number of iterable objects, adds each of their items to the <code>result</code> list by calling the <code>next</code> function on them, and stops whenever any of the iterable is exhausted.</li>
<li>The caveat here is when any iterable is exhausted, the existing elements in the <code>result</code> list are discarded. That's what happened with <code>3</code> in the <code>numbers_iter</code>.</li>
<li>The correct way to do the above using <code>zip</code> would be,
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=">>> numbers = list(range(7))
>>> numbers_iter = iter(numbers)
>>> list(zip(first_three, numbers_iter))
[(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2)]
>>> list(zip(remaining, numbers_iter))
[(3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6)]"><pre><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>numbers</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span>(<span>range</span>(<span>7</span>))
<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>numbers_iter</span> <span>=</span> <span>iter</span>(<span>numbers</span>)
<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>list</span>(<span>zip</span>(<span>first_three</span>, <span>numbers_iter</span>))
[(<span>0</span>, <span>0</span>), (<span>1</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>2</span>, <span>2</span>)]
<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>list</span>(<span>zip</span>(<span>remaining</span>, <span>numbers_iter</span>))
[(<span>3</span>, <span>3</span>), (<span>4</span>, <span>4</span>), (<span>5</span>, <span>5</span>), (<span>6</span>, <span>6</span>)]</pre></div>

<p dir="auto">"List comprehensions no longer support the syntactic form <code>[... for var in item1, item2, ...]</code>. Use <code>[... for var in (item1, item2, ...)]</code> instead.

<ul dir="auto">
<li>This is the recommended way to round .5 fractions as described in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754#Rounding_rules" rel="nofollow">IEEE 754</a>. However, the other way (round away from zero) is taught in school most of the time, so banker's rounding is likely not that well known. Furthermore, some of the most popular programming languages (for example: JavaScript, Java, C/C++, Ruby, Rust) do not use banker's rounding either. Therefore, this is still quite special to Python and may result in confusion when rounding fractions.</li>
<li>See the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round" rel="nofollow">round() docs</a> or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10825926/python-3-x-rounding-behavior" rel="nofollow">this stackoverflow thread</a> for more information.</li>
<li>Note that <code>get_middle([1])</code> only returned 1 because the index was <code>round(0.5) - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1</code>, returning the last element in the list.</li>

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">If sep is not specified or is <code>None</code>, a different splitting algorithm is applied: runs of consecutive whitespace are regarded as a single separator, and the result will contain no empty strings at the start or end if the string has leading or trailing whitespace. Consequently, splitting an empty string or a string consisting of just whitespace with a None separator returns <code>[]</code>.
If sep is given, consecutive delimiters are not grouped together and are deemed to delimit empty strings (for example, <code>'1,,2'.split(',')</code> returns <code>['1', '', '2']</code>). Splitting an empty string with a specified separator returns <code>['']</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto">So during comparison <code>sorted(y) == sorted(y)</code>, the first call to <code>sorted()</code> will consume the iterator <code>y</code>, and the next call will just return an empty list.</p>

So our <code>three_dimensional_array</code> is an array of array of arrays. Let's say we want to print the second element (index <code>1</code>) of all the innermost arrays, we can use Ellipsis to bypass all the preceding dimensions
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=">>> three_dimensional_array[:,:,1]

   [5, 7]])
>>> three_dimensional_array[..., 1] # using Ellipsis.

<span>array</span>([[<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>],
   [<span>5</span>, <span>7</span>]])</pre></div>
Note: this will work for any number of dimensions. You can even select slice in first and last dimension and ignore the middle ones this way (<code>n_dimensional_array[firs_dim_slice, ..., last_dim_slice]</code>)

<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">💡 Explanation:</h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_mangling" rel="nofollow">Name Mangling</a> is used to avoid naming collisions between different namespaces.</li>
<li>In Python, the interpreter modifies (mangles) the class member names starting with <code>__</code> (double underscore a.k.a "dunder") and not ending with more than one trailing underscore by adding <code>_NameOfTheClass</code> in front.</li>
<li>So, to access <code>__honey</code> attribute in the first snippet, we had to append <code>_Yo</code> to the front, which would prevent conflicts with the same name attribute defined in any other class.</li>
<li>But then why didn't it work in the second snippet? Because name mangling excludes the names ending with double underscores.</li>
<li>The third snippet was also a consequence of name mangling. The name <code>__variable</code> in the statement <code>return __variable</code> was mangled to <code>_A__variable</code>, which also happens to be the name of the variable we declared in the outer scope.</li>
<li>Also, if the mangled name is longer than 255 characters, truncation will happen.</li>

</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Don't use <code>+</code> for generating long strings — In Python, <code>str</code> is immutable, so the left and right strings have to be copied into the new string for every pair of concatenations. If you concatenate four strings of length 10, you'll be copying (10+10) + ((10+10)+10) + (((10+10)+10)+10) = 90 characters instead of just 40 characters. Things get quadratically worse as the number and size of the string increases (justified with the execution times of <code>add_bytes_with_plus</code> function)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Therefore, it's advised to use <code>.format.</code> or <code>%</code> syntax (however, they are slightly slower than <code>+</code> for very short strings).</p>

<p dir="auto">Why are same lookups becoming slower?</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">💡 Explanation:</h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>CPython has a generic dictionary lookup function that handles all types of keys (<code>str</code>, <code>int</code>, any object ...), and a specialized one for the common case of dictionaries composed of <code>str</code>-only keys.</li>
<li>The specialized function (named <code>lookdict_unicode</code> in CPython's <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/522691c46e2ae51faaad5bbbce7d959dd61770df/Objects/dictobject.c#L841">source</a>) knows all existing keys (including the looked-up key) are strings, and uses the faster &amp; simpler string comparison to compare keys, instead of calling the <code>__eq__</code> method.</li>
<li>The first time a <code>dict</code> instance is accessed with a non-<code>str</code> key, it's modified so future lookups use the generic function.</li>
<li>This process is not reversible for the particular <code>dict</code> instance, and the key doesn't even have to exist in the dictionary. That's why attempting a failed lookup has the same effect.</li>

<p dir="auto">What makes those dictionaries become bloated? And why are newly created objects bloated as well?</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">💡 Explanation:</h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>CPython is able to reuse the same "keys" object in multiple dictionaries. This was added in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0412/" rel="nofollow">PEP 412</a> with the motivation to reduce memory usage, specifically in dictionaries of instances - where keys (instance attributes) tend to be common to all instances.</li>
<li>This optimization is entirely seamless for instance dictionaries, but it is disabled if certain assumptions are broken.</li>
<li>Key-sharing dictionaries do not support deletion; if an instance attribute is deleted, the dictionary is "unshared", and key-sharing is disabled for all future instances of the same class.</li>
<li>Additionaly, if the dictionary keys have been resized (because new keys are inserted), they are kept shared <em>only</em> if they are used by a exactly single dictionary (this allows adding many attributes in the <code>__init__</code> of the very first created instance, without causing an "unshare"). If multiple instances exist when a resize happens, key-sharing is disabled for all future instances of the same class: CPython can't tell if your instances are using the same set of attributes anymore, and decides to bail out on attempting to share their keys.</li>
<li>A small tip, if you aim to lower your program's memory footprint: don't delete instance attributes, and make sure to initialize all attributes in your <code>__init__</code>!</li>

<p dir="auto"><code>join()</code> is a string operation instead of list operation. (sort of counter-intuitive at first usage)</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>💡 Explanation:</strong> If <code>join()</code> is a method on a string, then it can operate on any iterable (list, tuple, iterators). If it were a method on a list, it'd have to be implemented separately by every type. Also, it doesn't make much sense to put a string-specific method on a generic <code>list</code> object API.</p>

<li><code>[] = ()</code> is a semantically correct statement (unpacking an empty <code>tuple</code> into an empty <code>list</code>)</li>
<li><code>'a'[0][0][0][0][0]</code> is also semantically correct, because Python doesn't have a character data type like other languages branched from C. So selecting a single character from a string returns a single-character string.</li>

<p dir="auto"><strong>💡 Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>There is no <code>++</code> operator in Python grammar. It is actually two <code>+</code> operators.</li>
<li><code>++a</code> parses as <code>+(+a)</code> which translates to <code>a</code>. Similarly, the output of the statement <code>--a</code> can be justified.</li>
<li>This StackOverflow <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3654830/why-are-there-no-and-operators-in-python" rel="nofollow">thread</a> discusses the rationale behind the absence of increment and decrement operators in Python.</li>

<p dir="auto">You must be aware of the Walrus operator in Python. But have you ever heard about <em>the space-invader operator</em>?</p>

<p dir="auto">It is used as an alternative incrementation operator, together with another one</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>💡 Explanation:</strong> This prank comes from <a href="https://twitter.com/raymondh/status/1131103570856632321?lang=en" rel="nofollow">Raymond Hettinger's tweet</a>. The space invader operator is actually just a malformatted <code>a -= (-1)</code>. Which is equivalent to <code>a = a - (- 1)</code>. Similar for the <code>a += (+ 1)</code> case.</p>

<p dir="auto">Python has an undocumented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converse_implication" rel="nofollow">converse implication</a> operator.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=">>> False ** False == True

<p dir="auto"><strong>💡 Explanation:</strong> If you replace <code>False</code> and <code>True</code> by 0 and 1 and do the maths, the truth table is equivalent to a converse implication operator.

<p dir="auto">Since we are talking operators, there's also <code>@</code> operator for matrix multiplication (don't worry, this time it's for real).</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=">>> import numpy as np
>>> np.array([2, 2, 2]) @ np.array([7, 8, 8])

<span>46</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>💡 Explanation:</strong> The <code>@</code> operator was added in Python 3.5 keeping the scientific community in mind. Any object can overload <code>__matmul__</code> magic method to define behavior for this operator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">From Python 3.8 onwards you can use a typical f-string syntax like <code>f'{some_var=}</code> for quick debugging. Example,</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=">>> some_string = &quot;wtfpython&quot;
>>> f'{some_string=}'
&quot;some_string='wtfpython'&quot;"><pre><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>some_string</span> <span>=</span> <span>"wtfpython"</span>

<span>"some_string='wtfpython'"</span></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Python uses 2 bytes for local variable storage in functions. In theory, this means that only 65536 variables can be defined in a function. However, python has a handy solution built in that can be used to store more than 2^16 variable names. The following code demonstrates what happens in the stack when more than 65536 local variables are defined (Warning: This code prints around 2^18 lines of text, so be prepared!):</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="import dis
exec(&quot;&quot;&quot;
def f():
   &quot;&quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;&quot;
   &quot;&quot;&quot;.join([&quot;X&quot; + str(x) + &quot;=&quot; + str(x) for x in range(65539)]))

f()

print(dis.dis(f))"><pre><span>import</span> <span>dis</span>

<p dir="auto">Multiple Python threads won't run your <em>Python code</em> concurrently (yes, you heard it right!). It may seem intuitive to spawn several threads and let them execute your Python code concurrently, but, because of the <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock" rel="nofollow">Global Interpreter Lock</a> in Python, all you're doing is making your threads execute on the same core turn by turn. Python threads are good for IO-bound tasks, but to achieve actual parallelization in Python for CPU-bound tasks, you might want to use the Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html" rel="nofollow">multiprocessing</a> module.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Sometimes, the <code>print</code> method might not print values immediately. For example,</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# File some_file.py
import time

print(&quot;wtfpython&quot;, end=&quot;_&quot;)
time.sleep(3)"><pre><span># File some_file.py</span>
<span>import</span> <span>time</span>

<span>print</span>(<span>"wtfpython"</span>, <span>end</span><span>=</span><span>"_"</span>)
<span>time</span>.<span>sleep</span>(<span>3</span>)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This will print the <code>wtfpython</code> after 3 seconds due to the <code>end</code> argument because the output buffer is flushed either after encountering <code>\n</code> or when the program finishes execution. We can force the buffer to flush by passing <code>flush=True</code> argument.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://ognjen.io/lie-still-in-bed/">https://ognjen.io/lie-still-in-bed/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37281060">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>I found it very difficult to switch to a regular sleep, and wake, schedule after university.</p>

<p>I even started using <a href="https://kukuklok.com/">one of the loudest and most annoying alarm clocks I could find</a>. (That sound still gives my university housemate flashbacks.)</p>

<p>In my search for ways to fix my sleep schedule, I came across a seemingly simple piece of advice:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lie still in bed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I remember correctly, that article, like many others, suggested sleeping at the target time every day. To do that, it said, you should lie still in bed with your eyes closed.</p>

<p>It explained that most people fail not because they go to bed late, but because they play on their phones, watch TV or read a book. So, they go to bed earlier but still go to <em>sleep</em> late.</p>

<p>The logic made sense and I tried it. Of course, it didn’t work the first night. But it did in a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>Eventually, I was able to take that to an extreme and became a morning person.</p>

<p>Over the following ~10 years, I’ve successfully applied a generalized version of this advice to several other things.</p>

<p>And over that time I’ve realized three things about practice.</p>

<h2 id="1-you-can-practice-anything">1. You can practice anything</h2>

<p>Just like you can practice going to sleep at a reasonable hour, so can you practice keeping your bed made, liking a particular food, or doing collage.</p>

<p>Most people I talked to about this disagree. But I think they underestimate themselves. And for whatever reason, they don’t prioritize practice highly enough at that time.</p>

<p><em>Perhaps</em> there are exceptions, but I doubt it. I certainly haven’t come across any.</p>

<h2 id="2-use-your-willpower-to-lie-still">2. Use your willpower to lie still</h2>

<p>You have limited willpower so use it for the hardest parts.</p>

<p>And try to make the hardest part as small as possible by simplifying it and eliminating as many variables as possible.</p>

<p>If you want to establish a regular sleep pattern, going to bed is often the easy part. But putting your phone away and closing Netflix might be tough. That’s where willpower comes in.</p>

<p>Focus on the simplest possible unit of work – lying still – and apply it there.</p>

<p>It becomes easier if you eliminate as many variables as possible. For example, go to sleep and wake up at the same time even on the weekends.</p>

<p>Another example might be trying to exercise regularly. You don’t need willpower to do the exercise but to change and get out of your house. And if you exercise at the same time and for the same duration every day, you need even less of it.</p>

<h2 id="3-your-progress-will-be-in-much-smaller-steps-than-you-think">3. Your progress will be in <strong>much</strong> smaller steps than you think</h2>

<p>Most of us expect results to start showing very quickly. If I go to bed early <em>once</em>, I must be able to go to bed early every day from then on.</p>

<p>I want to exercise, so I must be able to run 5k in a week.</p>

<p>And when we can’t do this, we feel discouraged.</p>

<p>Consistency and recognizing <em>small</em>, barely noticeable, improvements is how you get better at something.</p>

<p>To fix your sleep, you must lie still in bed. On the first night, you’ll grab your phone after 2 minutes. But on the second after 4. And while you will not have fixed your sleep schedule in those two nights, you will have made exactly 6 minutes of progress. But progress nonetheless.</p>

<p>That it took almost no willpower to change today, even if you didn’t hit your targets at the gym, is progress.</p>

<p>Recognizing progress in the face of setbacks is also crucial. Your motivation will wax and wane, and you might not be able to practice every day. It’s only natural. But recognize that even though you failed to practice today, you’ve still made progress overall.</p>

<p>You’ve had an hour more sleep this week, and you’ve exercised more this month than the entire last year.</p>

<h2 id="lie-still-in-bed">Lie still in bed</h2>

<p>So, if you <strong>have never been able to do something</strong>, it’s simple. Just:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lie still in bed</p>
</blockquote>

      A real-life case-study of how things can get really bad really fast when developing Android (or iOS) apps.

      We have been in charge of maintaining one legacy Android app for our customer. It is an app, which is used by end-customers in production, but it does not have any active development going on because it's been <i>ready</i> for years now.
      If it would be up to us, then we would not touch that app and would let it live its life happily ever after.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>The Beginning</h2>
    <p>
      It all started with the following innocent-looking e-mail by Google received at 18th of August 2023:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="https://solutional.ee/img/blog/prisoners-of-google-android-development/google-email.png" alt="E-mail from Google">
    </p>
    <p>
      Trying to find more information about this requirement I found the following on Google's website:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="https://solutional.ee/img/blog/prisoners-of-google-android-development/google-requirements.png" alt="Google requirements">
    </p>
    <p>
      The following sentence caught our eye:
      <q>Existing apps must target API level 31 or above to remain available to users on devices running Android OS higher than your app's target API level.</q>
      Reading this it's hard to understand what will happen exactly to the apps installed on newer Android devices targeting lower API levels.
      I took the approach of <i>better safe than sorry</i> and prioritized this task even though it would add no business value — it was only required to be completed because Google said so.
      And the deadline set by Google was less than 3 weeks from the time when e-mail was received. No other e-mails have been sent by Google before regarding this issue.
    </p>
  </div>
<div>
    <h2>Implementing Change</h2>
    <p>
      I started with this task on 23th of August. I updated <code>targetSdkVersion</code> from API level 30 to 33 and tried to compile/run the application in Android emulator.
      First run failed due to incompatible dependency. Fortunately I could just remove that dependency since it was related to analytics and not tightly coupled to the business logic itself so it was not that critical one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ran the application successfully and tried core functionality which seemed to work the same way as before without any problems. It was time to put it up into Google Play Store.
    </p>
  </div>
<div>
    <h2>Play Store</h2>
    <p>
      Putting application up into Play Store went mostly without any hiccups.
      Of course, since this is a legacy app not having releases happening often, then I needed to fill some questionnaires created by Google, but this is pretty normal thing to happen when apps are updated at most once or twice per year. After completing these, app was sent to review. It took less than an hour until app was reviewed, accepted and released to production. Little did I know what would happen next. It all happened later in the evening after working hours.
    </p>
  </div>
<div>
    <h2>Problems Ahead</h2>
    <p>
      Around 21:30 my phone received a message from our customer who had problems logging into their account using newest application version. At first I was not that alarmed because it didn't seem to be related anyhow to the app update. However, I double-checked first time with a physical Android device (did not have access to that before) to see if I can successfully log in. Right after logging in, application crashed and closed. At that moment chills started to move down my spine and I started to investigate the experienced problem in more detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some troubleshooting it was pretty clear that there exists a problem with newest Android (13 at that moment), which will crash the application right after logging in. Using older Android versions was okay. One of our problems were that I did not use newest Android version in emulator while testing, thus these problems slipped through. It's not unheard of that something will break when updating, but this time there was a time-pressure set by Google and changes were minimal making it less expected. I could have done better by using different Android emulator versions, but it was already too late.
    </p>
  </div>
<div>
    <h2>Solving the Problem</h2>
    <p>
      First idea was to roll back to the older working version in the Google Play Store so that only users who were running latest Android and had the latest version of the app would be affected and then deal with that problem in a proper way at the next day.
      For my surprise I found out that this is not possible — there is no way using Android eco-system to pull back or cancel latest release.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second idea was to revert <code>targetSdkVersion</code> to API level 30, bump application version and create a new release in Play Store. This was also not possible due to the error message shown by Google about API level 33 being mandatory (remember the statement from Google that application updates below level 33 is possible until 1st of September?). At this moment I also realized that I could ask extension from Google to be able to use API level 30 until 1st of November — I did that, but unfortunately error message stayed the same. This meant that there's no way of going back to the old version and only way forward is to fix crashes for the newest Android version and create a new release.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of rolling back to the previous working version and fixing crashes at the next day, I needed to start fixing it immediately because users were slowly automatically getting newest version of the app into their phone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately to me these crashes also happened on newest Android emulator and there were not many code changes needed to fix them. But still, mistakes could happen when working under time-pressure situation during evening hours and there's not that much time for thorough testing before putting fixed version into Play Store. Since apps were crashing right after logging in then it seemed that whatever update I can put into Play Store as soon as possible then it would be better compared to current state. In short — the plan was to fix all of the known crash issues, release a new version and then after more thorough testing release a new version with possible fixes. That was the idea at least. After creating a new release on Play Store I anxiously waited until Google finishes their review.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been in review for two hours and I decided to go to sleep around one in the night in the hopes of app being released by the morning when I wake up.
    </p>
  </div>
<div>
    <h2>Next Day</h2>
    <p>
      After waking up, application was still in "In review" status.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the day was spent refreshing Google Play Store page to see if application can be released and testing on Android 13. Found few smaller issues, which were fixed, but nothing critical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day ended with application being "In review" status.
    </p>
  </div>
<div>
    <h2>Aftermath</h2>
    <p>
      I've read multiple articles about something similar happening with mobile apps development where Google (or Apple) prevent fixing problems in production or even worse where apps are taken down from the appropriate app store for no apparent reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      There's nothing we as developers can do to speed up the reviewal process nor contact Google support in any way. There are no possible workarounds and we just have to wait. Wait until we're excused to put our fixes to production.
    </p>
    <p>
      I personally have been against developing mobile apps for years now for the exact same reasons described in here and other similar articles — as soon as you decide to develop mobile apps then you give control of your product/service away to a third party, which you can't replace when problems happen. It's been controlled by this anonymous big company Google/Apple and as long as there are no problems then everyone is happy. But when things go south then you're on your own and you can't solve the problems no matter how good you are from a technical point of view.
      Usually there's not even any temporary workarounds you could do. It's just you against some multi-billion dollar company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nowadays I'm not even sure why are we, as developers, allowing this to happen — there's usually not any good reason to develop mobile applications at all anymore. It's time to move back to open (web) standards and take control back into our own hands! Technology is more than ready. Until that happens we just need to keep refreshing "Google Play Console" web page in the hopes of the update moving away from "In review" status into production.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been about 72 hours and update is still "In review". I just have to wait and hope that someone at Google presses correct buttons to allow the application update into the store. It's first time when I see that long review process from Google (usually that's the case with Apple). Murphy's law — of course it happens at the most critical moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope is my only option now. I don't know about you, but that doesn't sound professional way to solve any problems.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">
      <article role="main">
        <p>(yet)</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> In a recent <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@that_leaflet/110950714518054456">thread</a> on Mastodon, it was revealed that Ubuntu 23.04 users can’t install the Steam deb package from the Ubuntu archive without jumping through some technical hoops. It turns out this was a <a href="https://mastodon.social/@vorlon/110958106498930456">mistake</a>, a <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/subiquity/+bug/2033170">bug</a> was filed, and future builds shouldn’t have this problem.</p>
<p>It’s not immediately apparent whether the (currently ‘broken’) ISO images for Ubuntu 23.04 will be rebuilt (unlikely) or if this will stay broken in 23.04, and users will need to ‘cope’.</p>
<p>To check if you’re affected in Ubuntu 23.04 on a 64-bit (x86_64) installation, run this command:</p>
<p><code>arch &amp;&amp; dpkg --print-foreign-architectures</code></p>
<p>If the result is as follows, you’re all fine:</p>
<p>If you only get <code>x86_64</code> returned, then run this command to re-add i386 support:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
</span></span><span><span>sudo apt update
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Alternative fix, install the Steam deb from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/about/">Valve</a>, not the Ubuntu version. Read on…</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>In 2019, at an internal company product sprint, a proposal was made to remove i386 support from Ubuntu. This was the culmination of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190701115957/https://bryanquigley.com/pages/papers/ubuntu-drop-i386.html">plenty</a> of discussion. This step would go beyond simply removing the 32-bit x86 ISO images from the build system. It meant no longer even building any i386 deb packages at all. This was <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2019-June/000245.html">announced</a> a little while later, in June.</p>
<p>There was some <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/results-of-testing-3rd-party-applications-on-64-bit-only-eoan-19-10/11353">internal</a> and much <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1142262103106973698">external</a> pushback, so a new path forward was charted and <a href="https://canonical.com/blog/statement-on-32-bit-i386-packages-for-ubuntu-19-10-and-20-04-lts">announced</a>. The reason for pushback is that removing i386 packages from the archive would impact the ability to easily install and run 32-bit software on a 64-bit x86 install.</p>
<p>Steam - the game store/launcher from Valve requires a bunch of 32-bit libraries to function. Many of the games that Steam installs also require many of these various libraries. These older games are likely never going to get updated to have 64-bit clean builds.</p>
<p>Game developers often move on from completed projects and do not typically re-visit an old codebase to add support for new architectures. The exception to this is when they add support for new devices (e.g. Nintendo Switch), which have a potential monetary reward via increased sales. In addition, Valve considers every game as sacred, and once purchased, should (in theory) always be runnable by the customer. It’s an admirable goal. Ubuntu without i386 would break that.</p>
<p>Steam isn’t the only consumer of 32-bit i386 packages on desktop Linux. Plenty of other pieces of software such as WINE only work when 32-bit libraries are installed on a 64-bit system. Steam just happens to be a widely installed and used example.</p>
<h2 id="alternate-path">Alternate path</h2>
<p>Canonical heard the feedback. They decided the Ubuntu project would <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/community-process-for-32-bit-compatibility/12598">crowdsource</a> an ‘allowlist’ of i386 deb packages, which would continue to be built and provided in the Ubuntu archive. The list was pulled together, and now Launchpad (the Ubuntu build system) ensures those specific i386 packages exist in Ubuntu.</p>
<p>While not perfect, this satisfied the needs of most. Gamers could still install Steam and their favourite games from the past. That assumes the package manager <code>dpkg</code> had <code>i386</code> configured on the host system as a “foreign architecture”.</p>
<h2 id="new-installer">New installer</h2>
<p>With some <a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/how-we-designed-the-new-ubuntu-desktop-installer">fanfare</a>, recent releases of Ubuntu ship with a brand-new Flutter-based installer. The older, Python-based <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Ubiquity">Ubiquity</a> installer has been around a long while and has been kept going with sticky tape and twine for years.</p>
<p>It seems 32-bit support on the installed image was inadvertently <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/subiquity/+bug/2033170/comments/3">overlooked</a> by the foundations team. No problem, mistakes happen, and now this bug in the process of being fixed.</p>
<h2 id="eyes-off-the-ball">Eyes off the ball</h2>
<p>I find it a little surprising nobody reported this before, given it’s been a problem since the 23.04 release in April this year. Personally, I didn’t notice, because on my 23.04 laptop, I’d upgraded from an older release, which would already have had the i386 ‘foreign’ architecture enabled.</p>
<p>I have done a clean install of 23.04 on my desktop very recently. It’s possible on my recently installed desktop PC, I just knew how to fix it, and did it. But I don’t find the <code>dpkg</code> incantation in my <code>bash</code> history. Also, I installed Steam from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/about/">Valve</a> website, not the Ubuntu archive version.</p>
<p>I wondered if perhaps the upstream Steam deb magically adds the 32-bit architecture in the background during installation.</p>
<p><em><strong>Narrator: It does.</strong></em></p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>$ wget https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/client/installer/steam.deb
</span></span><span><span>$ dpkg -x steam.deb steam/
</span></span><span><span>$ grep -r <span>"add-architecture"</span> steam/*
</span></span><span><span>steam/usr/lib/steam/bin_steamdeps.py:        cp <span>=</span> run_subprocess<span>([</span><span>'dpkg'</span>, <span>'--add-architecture'</span>, <span>'i386'</span><span>])</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Ok, so this only affects people who try to install Steam from the archive using <code>apt</code>, it seems.</p>
<h2 id="assume-good-intent">Assume good intent</h2>
<p>If the Steam deb shows as ‘unavailable’ because the i386 architecture is not present, then alternatives might be shown to the user.</p>
<p>One alternative is the <a href="https://snapcraft.io/steam">Steam snap</a> package. I haven’t tested, but in theory, the snap would not be affected by this issue, as the package bundles necessary libraries rather than depending on the host having them installed.</p>
<p>The thread on Mastodon brought up an expected thought process, though. The conspiracy theory-minded might (reasonably) think <em><strong>“This is Canonical breaking the deb, so you’re forced to use the snap”</strong></em>. But that <a href="https://mastodon.social/@vorlon/110958106498930456">doesn’t</a> appear to be the case.</p>
<p>It’s just a simple mistake that is fixed, and now (a selected set of) i386 packages will be easily accessible again.</p>
<p>Until the next time…</p>

    <p><em>posted by <a href="https://twitter.com/justdavemiller">Dave Miller</a> - Bugzilla Project Lead</em></p>

<h2 id="happy-25th-birthday-to-bugzilla"><strong>Happy 25th Birthday to Bugzilla!</strong></h2>

<p>Today, August 26, marks the 25th anniversary of Bugzilla!</p>

<p>The first two paragraphs lifted from our <a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/about/">Bugzilla history</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When mozilla.org first came online in 1998, one of the first products that
was released was Bugzilla, a bug system implemented using freely available
open source tools. Bugzilla was originally written in
<a href="http://www.tcl.tk/scripting/">TCL</a> by Terry Weissman for use at mozilla.org
to replace the in-house system then in use at Netscape. The initial
installation of Bugzilla was deployed to the public on a mozilla.org server
on <a href="https://www-archive.mozilla.org/news.html#p17">April 6, 1998</a>.</p>

  <p>After a few months of testing and fixing on a public deployment, Bugzilla was
finally released as open source via anonymous CVS and available for others to
use on <a href="https://www-archive.mozilla.org/news.html#p44">August 26, 1998</a>. At
this point. Terry decided to port Bugzilla to <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a>,
with the hopes that more people would be able to contribute to it, since Perl
seemed to be a more popular language. The completion of the port to Perl was
announced on <a href="https://www-archive.mozilla.org/news.html#p51">September 15,
1998</a>, and committed to CVS
<a href="https://github.com/bugzilla/bugzilla/commit/4727e6c09f88e63f02e6c8f359862d0c0942ed36">later that
night</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>25 years is a long time in the software world, and it makes us happy that so
many people still use Bugzilla to track bug reports and feature requests for
their own products. We hope to continue to breath life into Bugzilla and
continue to modernize it over the years to come!</p>

<h2 id="new-legal-entity-to-manage-the-bugzilla-project"><strong>New Legal Entity to Manage the Bugzilla Project</strong></h2>

<p>Back in December I made an <a href="https://bugzillaupdate.wordpress.com/2022/12/13/upcoming-releases-and-more-fun-stuff/">enthusiastic
post</a>
about getting Bugzilla back in motion after it kind of stalled for a while. And
then after a month I kind of stopped posting about it. So what happened?</p>

<p>Well, response to that post was actually pretty enthusiastic in itself. I heard
from several people who wanted to donate money to the project to get it going
again. Which then led to a new problem: we didn’t actually have a legal way to
accept donations at the time. So after asking around a bit, and a few
conference calls between myself, my own company’s lawyer, and a couple of
Mozilla’s lawyers, it was decided that Bugzilla needed a legal entity to manage
it, similar to how Thunderbird has been operating recently. And, that’s where
the little bit of time that I’ve had to spend on Bugzilla has gone the last 6
months. And as you can understand, with the legal work going on in the
background, there wasn’t much I could actually talk about until all of the
pieces were actually in place.</p>

<p>Which now brings us to today, when I’m happy to announce the formation of Zarro
Boogs Corporation, which will now be overseeing the Bugzilla Project. This is a
taxable non-profit non-charitable corporation - we have filed with the IRS our
intent to operate under US Tax Code §501(c)(4) (still pending approval from the
IRS) meaning the IRS would require us to spend money raised on project expenses
and not make a profit, but money donated to us will not earn you a tax
deduction because we aren’t a charity (software development is not considered a
charitable cause in the US). Unlike Thunderbird, which is a subsidiary of the
Mozilla Foundation, we are an independent entity not owned by or associated
with the Mozilla Foundation, although they have licensed the use of the
Bugzilla trademark to us.</p>

<p>The name Zarro Boogs Corporation is a shout-out to the phrase returned by
Bugzilla when you run a search which returns no results, “Zarro Boogs found.”
The buggy spelling of “Zero Bugs” being intentional because it’s generally
believed that there’s no such thing as a project with zero bugs in it, only
bugs that haven’t yet been reported, thus, saying “Zero Bugs” is, in itself,
buggy. There’s a nice write-up of this on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugzilla#Zarro_Boogs">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>If you would like to contribute to the project, we have a donation page set up
on <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/bugzilla">GitHub Sponsors</a>. We hope to have
additional ways to donate that don’t require a GitHub account in the future.</p>

<h2 id="upcoming-releases"><strong>Upcoming Releases</strong></h2>

<p>Those releases I talked about back in December are finally happening!  Look for
these (except for 5.9.1) this coming week!  Right now we’re aiming for
Wednesday, August 30th. We are aiming for September 15 for 5.9.1 (because it’s
the 25th anniversary of the port from Tcl to Perl).</p>

<p><strong>4.4.14</strong> – The 4.4 branch has been on life support for a <strong>LONG</strong> time (it
was initially released in <strong>2013!!!</strong>). It supports outdated OSes that are hard
to find or install, let alone test for these days, and we’ve been itching to
drop it for a long time.&nbsp; But our support policy says that we have to support
it for 4 months after the following two major releases.&nbsp; The next major release
after 4.4 was 5.0, and there have been no major releases after that, which
means that 4 month countdown hasn’t even started yet. I am intending this to be
the final release of the 4.4 branch (barring any additional security issues
being found in the next 4 months) as the 5.2 release below will start that 4
month countdown to End-of-Life this branch.</p>

<p><strong>5.0.4.1</strong> – Why 5.0.4.1 when there’s a 5.0.6 release?&nbsp; Well, if you paid
attention to the change logs, 5.0.5 and 5.0.6 contained a massive schema
change, as well as reformatting almost all of the Perl code in the source, both
of which are a violation of our support policy for a stable branch (a
new-to-the-process release manager pushed the release out not realizing that,
and by the time we caught it, it was too late). A lot of people noticed this
and never upgraded to 5.0.5 or 5.0.6, since they didn’t contain any security
fixes.&nbsp; 5.0.4.1 will give those people additional fixes for 5.0.4 without
forcing them to pick up those schema and code reformatting changes. Additional
updates to the 5.0 branch from now on will continue from 5.0.4.2 and onward.</p>

<p><strong>5.2</strong> – This will be the next major release, and will start the 4 month
countdown for discontinuing the 4.4 branch. 5.2 is forked from the 5.0 branch
after 5.0.6, and will contain those schema and code formatting changes from
5.0.5 and 5.0.6 in it. So if you <em><strong>did</strong></em> upgrade to 5.0.6, 5.2 will be
equivalent to a point upgrade for you.&nbsp; Those schema changes should have caused
a major release to happen anyway, so this is just fixing the numbering problem
with that release (i.e. 5.0.5 should have been called 5.2 to begin with). Note
that <strong>if you are using the 5.1.x development releases, those did NOT feed into
this</strong>, and 5.2 would actually be a downgrade for you.</p>

<p><strong>5.1.3</strong> – The 5.1 branch is basically dead, as we’ve put all of our resources
into finishing off the Harmony release (see 5.9.1 below). We’re going to
encourage people on 5.1.x to move to Harmony, but you’ll want to be mindful of
the release blockers first before you make the jump. There are some features in
5.1.x that were implemented differently in Harmony, and the code to migrate the
related data may or may not work yet (if the feature in question is listed on
the release blockers and you use it, you’ll want to wait for now). Even though
this branch is dead, we’re going to put out a release with the current batch of
security fixes so you aren’t left high and dry before Harmony is ready for you.</p>

<p><strong>5.9.1</strong> – <strong>Coming September 15!</strong> This will be the first official release
off the Harmony branch, and will be classified as a <strong>developer preview
release</strong>, not for production use.&nbsp; This is what will eventually be Bugzilla
6.&nbsp; The code is mostly good enough to use right now, but there are still
showstoppers to be able to fully release it as a production release. There are
also a few gotchas when upgrading from older versions of Bugzilla. If you’re
interested in helping make Bugzilla 6 happen, that list of showstoppers is
<a href="https://github.com/bugzilla/harmony/blob/main/RELEASE_BLOCKERS.md">here</a>. We are
hoping to have Bugzilla 6 in release candidate stage (or at least in beta) by
the end of November. The security content for this branch that goes with the
other branch releases will be committed to git at the same time the other
releases get them, since anyone who has this already will only have it via git
pull.</p>



<ol>
  <li><strong>Documentation</strong>. Harmony (5.9.1) in particular needs a LOT of
documentation help, as what’s there now is pretty specific to trying to
produce a testing environment for bugzilla.mozilla.org, rather than a
standalone Bugzilla.</li>
  <li><strong>Section 508 Compliance Audit</strong>. There are a number of US government
agencies who use Bugzilla internally (NASA is a publicly visible example).
New US government projects have to comply with the new accessibility guidelines
in Section 508 of the Communications Act, so if we want them to be able to
upgrade we need to comply (at least in our newer versions).&nbsp; See
<a href="https://section508.gov/">https://section508.gov/</a>. There is a template for a
compliance statement at
<a href="https://www.section508.gov/sell/vpat/">https://www.section508.gov/sell/vpat/</a>.
I would love to get a volunteer (or a company who can sponsor someone?) who
could audit the 5.2 and harmony branches for compliance, file bugs for things
that are violations, and figure out how much of the VPAT we can actually
provide at this point.&nbsp; Even if we’re not compliant yet (I suspect we aren’t) I
would love to be able to provide a statement with the 5.2 release saying how
compliant we are, and listing what’s left to be fixed to make us compliant. See
also <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1785941">Bug 1785941</a>. Some
work has been done on this (as you can see in the dependent bugs to that one)
but it still needs help.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="ongoing-help-wanted"><strong>Ongoing Help Wanted</strong></h2>

<p>You can always find a list of ways to contribute to Bugzilla on our
<a href="http://bugzilla.org/contributing/">Contributing page</a>. A few highlights with
additional details:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Donate Money</strong>. Now that we have a legal entity capable of paying
developers, we need money to pay them with (and also cover our server hosting
expenses). You can donate via our <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/bugzilla">GitHub
Sponsors</a> page. If you don’t have and
can’t create a GitHub account, we hope to have other ways to donate in the
future.</li>
  <li><strong>Bug Triage!</strong> As you probably noticed from the lack of updates around here
in a while, the bug list hasn’t been getting paid much attention to, either.
Part of getting this project moving again means re-triaging the existing bug
reports. Some of them are really ancient and may not even apply to the current
code-base anymore. I’m going to have another blog post coming in the next day
or two (for real this time) with information on this topic (specifics for how
to help with it), so keep an eye out for that post!</li>
  <li><strong>Code!</strong> Once we get the above triage moving, there will be bugs to fix!
Bugzilla is an Open Source project, and anyone can contribute! We also have a
relatively small user base compared to some of the big projects out there, so
the amount of development we’ll be able to fund internally from our donations
will still be limited. It will probably make better sense for us to use our
internal developers (once we have money to pay some) to review patches and
coach external contributors, instead of having them directly producing code.</li>
  <li><strong>Paid Developer Time</strong>. If you are a business that makes use of Bugzilla,
and has a staff person responsible for maintaining your Bugzilla
installation, and that person is willing, please consider officially sponsoring
that person to help with upstream Bugzilla development for at least a few hours
per week. Most of our lack of development lately has happened because the last
few companies that used to do that stopped providing developer time during the
economic downturn a few years back (either laid off said person or pulled them
away to work on other things), and they haven’t returned. The developers we
have currently (until we get money donated as listed above) are all volunteer,
and most of them are struggling to find time to work on it.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h2>

<p>We have a lot of excitement ahead of us with the first developer preview of
Bugzilla 6 coming later this week (I was hoping to have that for you all today
as well, but we didn’t quite make it), and the new opportunities in store for
us with a real business entity to support the project now. Come find us in any
of our chat rooms (links are in the footer of <a href="https://bugzilla.org/">our
website</a> alongside the social media links) or drop in on
our <a href="https://lists.bugzilla.org/listinfo/developers">developers mailing list</a>
if you’d like to help.</p>

consent. You will be tricked with clickbait, distracted with large ads, and enticed to leave the site you are on at every opportunity. Plus, everything you do online is being monitored so your habits and searches can be remarketed and sold over and over again for years.</p><p><a href="https://ericdraken.com/files/clickbait.png"><img src="https://ericdraken.com/files/clickbait-754x325.png" alt="clickbait" width="754" height="325" srcset="https://ericdraken.com/files/clickbait-754x325.png 754w, https://static.ericdraken.com/files/clickbait-300x129.png 300w, https://ericdraken.com/files/clickbait-600x259.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" data-old-src="https://ericdraken.com/minified/fcf7107d/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://ericdraken.com/files/clickbait-754x325.png" data-srcset="https://ericdraken.com/files/clickbait-754x325.png 754w, https://static.ericdraken.com/files/clickbait-300x129.png 300w, https://ericdraken.com/files/clickbait-600x259.png 600w"></a></p><p><strong>Privacy</strong> – Knowing what you like to watch and read, what phone you have, what you watch on Netflix, what you shop for, what you ask Alexa about, yout taste in music, etc. is <em>unbelievably</em> valuable to advertisers. Spying on people is such a big problem that Europe passed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GDPR law</a> so every site you visit asks if you are okay with cookies (and we blindly click “ok” to hide the banner). We must wrestle back privacy ourselves.</p><p><strong>Bandwidth</strong> – If privacy doesn’t concern you, how about this: it is well-known that between 25% and 40% of network traffic is ads, tracking, JavaScript to load trackers (<a href="https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">fingerprint.js</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@analytics/google-tag-manager" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">googletagmanager.js</a>), websocket traffic to collect how you scroll and what you type (<a href="https://www.hotjar.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hotjar</a>), and the like. Do you have a 100 Mbps internet connection? Consider it 60 Mbps!</p><p><strong>Clickbait</strong> – Then there is clickbait. “You won’t believe what Tom Cruise did. He…” and you may want to click. Then you are in the spider’s web. How about fake news? Or articles that don’t say “sponsored” in size-8 font, but now say “underscored” to be clever. What is even real anymore? As soon as you click on clickbait, you may end up on a page with a dozen more ads that aren’t approved by Google but lead to a dark world of maliciousness. <strong>Clickbait is so incredibly profitable to scammers.</strong></p><p><strong>Cryptojacking</strong> – Some websites will load crypto-mining JavaScript (e.g. <a href="https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/the-growing-trend-of-coin-miner-javascript-infection" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CoinHive.js</a>) so while you read, they overheat and abuse your computer to try to make a few pennies. Some sites will load JavaScript that tries to steal from your crypto wallet or trick you into transferring cryptocurrency.</p><div><p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> It is highly lucrative yet detrimental to you to track and trick you, and only <em>you</em> can do something about it.</p></div><p><a href="#top">Top ↩</a></p><hr><h2>Required Router Hardware</h2><p>A virtual machine, Docker image, or Raspberry Pi are not performant enough to protect a whole SMB network; We need dedicated hardware with a cryptographic instruction set so that its only function is to route, decrypt, and monitor packets in and out.

What <em>failed</em> was setting the AC1200 to <code>172.31.1.2</code> as it was unreachable (reason unknown).

Except, most of the CPU work is to generate TLS certs on the fly for each request. Yikes. Running <code>mitmdump</code> forgoes the UI and extreme logging.

They can register for pre-roll, mid-roll, end-roll, full-page, and ad pods (back-to-back ads). Blocking an ad URL causes an error along the lines of “some ad that doesn’t exist booked a slot” and UI panic sets in.</p><p>I’m going to Sun Tzu the <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Protobuf Wire Format</a> and come back in a bit…</p><p>I’m back.

I’ve shown that Python is several orders of magnitude too slow in decoding these Protobuf payloads, so connections do time out waiting on Python. With web-based JSON, the whole payload needs to be parsed, edited, and re-serialized; With my Protobuf technique, it takes microseconds thanks to a single linear scan and then ultra-quick backtracking. This technique is suitable for real-time adblocking without blocklists.</p><h3>Knock-On Benefits</h3><p>All those <code>*.googleadservices.com</code> and <code>/pagead/*</code> URLs on Apple devices originate from the Protobuf payload. This means they all go away for free – we don’t need to block them. In fact, the YouTube app is zippier because fewer connections are made to ad URLs in the first place. This means we can avoid keeping a blocklist of YouTube ad URLs and stay on the sidelines of the whack-a-mole fun. Ads do not register for video location “slots” on the Apple devices and the content just plays.</p><h3>Future-Proof</h3><p>This is a heuristic technique that looks for two strings: <code>/pagead/</code> and some calculated field tag nearby, so this technique is designed to be future-proof.</p><figure id="attachment_5822"><a href="https://static.ericdraken.com/files/Walking-backward-from-the-ad-marker.png"><img src="https://ericdraken.com/files/Walking-backward-from-the-ad-marker-754x617.png" alt="Walking backward from the ad marker" width="754" height="617" srcset="https://ericdraken.com/files/Walking-backward-from-the-ad-marker-754x617.png 754w, https://ericdraken.com/files/Walking-backward-from-the-ad-marker-300x246.png 300w, https://ericdraken.com/files/Walking-backward-from-the-ad-marker-600x491.png 600w, https://static.ericdraken.com/files/Walking-backward-from-the-ad-marker.png 966w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" data-old-src="https://ericdraken.com/minified/fcf7107d/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://ericdraken.com/files/Walking-backward-from-the-ad-marker-754x617.png" data-srcset="https://ericdraken.com/files/Walking-backward-from-the-ad-marker-754x617.png 754w, https://ericdraken.com/files/Walking-backward-from-the-ad-marker-300x246.png 300w, https://ericdraken.com/files/Walking-backward-from-the-ad-marker-600x491.png 600w, https://static.ericdraken.com/files/Walking-backward-from-the-ad-marker.png 966w"></a><figcaption>Walking backward from the ad marker to find the field key</figcaption></figure><p>Even if Google changes the field tag (and breaks millions of apps and Apple TVs before they upgrade), it’s an academic exercise to enhance the following script to discover the new field tag(s) automatically.</p><h3>Should Google be Worried?</h3><p>No, not at all.</p><p>This is a <strong>highly-specialized technique</strong> to block Apple-device YouTube ads (or Instagram, Whatsapp, Facebook, etc. tracker blocking).

Also, many ad campaigns have a capped daily budget, so theoretically there should be fewer ads in the evenings as budgets run out during the day.</p><h3>Experiment in Ad Viewing</h3><p>I watched YouTube on and off for a day on a clean notebook computer with private browsing. My history showed that I only “watched” 10 videos:</p><ul><li>I fast-forwarded through a few of them to get past the “like and subscribe” runtime padding.</li><li>I jumped to the end of one just to get to the “top three” from a “top twenty” list.</li><li>Two were low quality so I left early.</li><li>The rest were music videos.</li></ul><p>In all, for watching parts of 10 videos, I was exposed to 8 ads, and only two were skippable (which I skipped).</p><h3>$0.15 as a Ballpark CPV</h3><p>Let’s use USD $0.15 as a CPV. In one day, let’s say, I incurred 8 x $0.15, or $1.20 to advertisers. Extrapolated to one month, that is roughly USD $36/mo. Do I really cost advertisers USD $36/mo for very casual YouTube viewing? That sounds terrible for advertisers.</p><h3>CPV from US Advertising Spend Divided by Total Views</h3><p>From <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/289658/youtube-global-net-advertising-revenues/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Statistica</a>, in 2019, US YouTube advertisers spent $15.1 billion dollars. Also in 2019, US residents had 916 billion views (<a href="#ad-spend">ref</a>). That works out to an average of $15.1B / 916B, or USD $0.0165 per view. Then for me, that is only USD 13 cents. Extrapolated to one month, I theoreticaly cost advertisers only USD $3.96/mo.</p><h3>Is YouTube Premium Worth It?</h3><p><a href="https://static.ericdraken.com/files/YouTube-Premium.png"><img src="https://static.ericdraken.com/files/YouTube-Premium-754x324.png" alt="YouTube Premium subscription fee as of Jan, 2022" width="754" height="324" srcset="https://static.ericdraken.com/files/YouTube-Premium-754x324.png 754w, https://static.ericdraken.com/files/YouTube-Premium-300x129.png 300w, https://ericdraken.com/files/YouTube-Premium-600x258.png 600w, https://static.ericdraken.com/files/YouTube-Premium.png 807w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" data-old-src="https://ericdraken.com/minified/fcf7107d/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://static.ericdraken.com/files/YouTube-Premium-754x324.png" data-srcset="https://static.ericdraken.com/files/YouTube-Premium-754x324.png 754w, https://static.ericdraken.com/files/YouTube-Premium-300x129.png 300w, https://ericdraken.com/files/YouTube-Premium-600x258.png 600w, https://static.ericdraken.com/files/YouTube-Premium.png 807w"></a></p><p>When I allowed ads for my experiment, I hit the hardware mute button. I also looked away because I have several computers with a lot going on. Ad spend is wasted on me, but I still want to support content creators. For me, CAD $13.48/mo is more than I incur on actual ads and more than I pay for a Netflix subscription. The only way to justify the cost is to have YouTube playing constantly in the background on a TV.</p><p>However, I truly enjoy a handful of creators, so I may start watching them in the background on non-stop play. Let’s give the three-month YouTube Premium trial a chance, and I will still be monitoring what they track about me.</p><figure id="attachment_5913"><a href="https://static.ericdraken.com/files/youtube-premium-traffic.png"><img src="https://ericdraken.com/files/youtube-premium-traffic-754x282.png" alt="YouTube Premium network traffic" width="754" height="282" srcset="https://ericdraken.com/files/youtube-premium-traffic-754x282.png 754w, https://static.ericdraken.com/files/youtube-premium-traffic-300x112.png 300w, https://ericdraken.com/files/youtube-premium-traffic-600x224.png 600w, https://static.ericdraken.com/files/youtube-premium-traffic.png 1503w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" data-old-src="https://ericdraken.com/minified/fcf7107d/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://ericdraken.com/files/youtube-premium-traffic-754x282.png" data-srcset="https://ericdraken.com/files/youtube-premium-traffic-754x282.png 754w, https://static.ericdraken.com/files/youtube-premium-traffic-300x112.png 300w, https://ericdraken.com/files/youtube-premium-traffic-600x224.png 600w, https://static.ericdraken.com/files/youtube-premium-traffic.png 1503w"></a><figcaption>YouTube Premium network traffic</figcaption></figure><p><a href="#top">Top ↩</a></p><hr><h2>DMCA, Sony, Viacom</h2><p>Recently I learned that due to abuses of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DMCA Act of 1998</a>, YouTube content creators who make reaction videos and “easter egg” videos may have their videos claimed by big companies like Sony and Viacom.

            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Running Linux on a Commodore C-64</h2>
<p dir="auto">"But does it run Linux?" can now be finally and affirmatively answered for the Commodore C64!</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/onnokort/semu-c64/blob/master/booted.jpeg"><img src="https://github.com/onnokort/semu-c64/raw/master/booted.jpeg" alt="Booted"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There is a catch (rather: a couple) of course: It runs <em>extremely</em> slowly and it needs a RAM Expansion Unit (REU), as there is no chance to fit it all into just 64KiB.</p>
<p dir="auto">It even emulates virtual memory with an MMU.</p>
<p dir="auto">I have <strong>not</strong> tested it on <strong>real hardware yet</strong>, that's the next challenge .. for you. So please send me a link to a timelapse video of an original unit with REU booting Linux :D</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building it</h2>
<p dir="auto">Just use <code>make</code>. You need <a href="https://github.com/llvm-mos/"><code>mos-c64-clang</code></a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Change the single <code>C64</code> variable at the top of the Makefile and you should be able to switch between a <code>x86_64</code> and an <code>llvm-mos-6502</code> build of the code.</p>
<p dir="auto">The notes from the <a href="https://github.com/onnokort/semu-c64/blob/master/README.original.md">original README</a> apply for the most part. The kernel configuration is different, though, as the kernel from the original <code>semu</code> is too bloated with huge section alignments. A more fitting kernel configuration can be found in the <code>config</code> subfolder. Finally, to assemble it all into the REU image needed for the VICE emulator, use the <code>mk_linux_reu.py</code> script. It still uses the original <code>initrd</code> image, as that works just well.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Running it</h2>
<p dir="auto">To run it, simply create a <code>.d64</code> file containing the compiled <code>semu</code> executable (or simply select the correct path for a virtual disk drive in the emulator). Then (in VICE EMU), go to Preferences | Settings | Cartridges | RAM Expansion Module, enable it and select the file <code>reufile.linux</code>, and make sure to select the correct size (16MiB) as well. If you started <code>x64</code> from the console, a message that it loaded successfully should appear.</p>
<p dir="auto">Then, do <code>LOAD "SEMU",8,1</code> and <code>run</code> and ... <em>wait</em> ... (hours!). With "warp mode" enabled in the emulator, the first boot messages should appear within a few minutes, though.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can also use the PC <code>semu</code> binary with the <code>-k</code> option to load the reufile.linux into the PC emulator and you should get a 100% identical boot sequence, as everything should be deterministic until the first keypress.</p>
<p dir="auto">I plan to add an archive with all the neccessary premade binaries as soon as I figured out how to do that on github. Look for something on the "Releases" tab.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Further notes</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">The screenshots took VICE <em>a couple hours</em> in "warp mode" (activate it with Alt-W) to generate. So, as is, a real C64 should be able to boot Linux within a week or so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The compiled 6502 code is not really optimized yet, and it might be realistic to squeeze a factor 10x of performance out of this. Maybe even a simple form of JIT compilation? It should also be possible to implement starting a checkpointed VM (quickly precomputed on <code>x86-64</code>) to avoid the lengthy boot process. Maybe <code>X</code> on an emulated framebuffer device in 320x200 graphics mode? VIC-II DRI? :D</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">I also tested a minimal micropython port (I can clean it up and post it on github if there is interest), that one does not use the MMU and is almost barely remotely usable with lots of optimism at 100% speed...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The generated <code>semu</code> executable is a generic RISCV32 emulator and it simply assumes that the REU maps to the address range 0x00000000 .. 0x01000000. You should be able to compile any (embedded, bare-bones) RISCV32 executable that uses just the emulated UART, fill it up to a size of 16MiB, load it as a REU-image into VICE and run it using the same <code>semu</code> 6510 binary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Likewise, I made a simple <a href="https://github.com/mist64/kernalemu">kernalemu</a> fork with "REU support" which seems to run a lot faster than Vice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The emulated UART does upper-/lowercase PETSCII&lt;-&gt;ASCII translation. That could use a lot of improvement, though ...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Thanks</h2>
<p dir="auto">This is in essence a fork of the very nicely minimalist RISC-V32 emulator named <a href="https://github.com/sysprog21/semu">semu</a>, compiled and ported using the new <a href="https://github.com/llvm-mos/">llvm-mos</a> and would not have been so possible without all that previous work.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">(Boot animation)</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/15tx7yy/airbnb_allowing_host_to_place_cameras_in_the_room/">New Update from Last Week's BORU</a>. To skip to the update, just go to 🔴🔴 and read ahead</p>

<p>Previous BORUs on the subject:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/zqt49j/airbnb_allowing_host_to_place_cameras_in_the_room/"><strong>Airbnb Allowing host to place cameras in the room where I would be sleeping</strong></a> Dec 20, 2022</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/10teee3/update_on_the_oop_taking_on_airbnb_for_letting_a/"><strong>First Update</strong></a> Feb 04 2023</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/11saoz0/new_update_from_court_in_ongoing_case_airbnb/"><strong>Second Update (by OOP)</strong></a> March 15 2023</p>

<p>If you're just looking for the story without the commentary, the Second Update has it all.</p>

<p>Reminder that OP is <a href="https://old.reddit.com/u/AtypicalCommonplace">u/AtypicalCommonplace</a>. I am not OP. I've tried to hyperlink all of the resources/links from the post as is.</p>

<p>Quick Summary of previous events: OOP is a woman and a lawyer. She stayed at an AirBnB in NYC in 2022. Upon completing the initial booking, the owner revealed the property had cameras monitoring the <em>inside</em> of the studio apartment. OOP sought to cancel and get refunded. Her other posts describe her attempts to receive the refund, suing AirBnB and taking them to arbitration and the process leading up to the arbitration itself over the course of several months in 2023.</p>

<p><strong>Previous Update:</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AtypicalCommonplace/comments/15np1c3/case_closed_airbnb_cameras_yadda_yadda_yadda/"><strong>Case Closed (Airbnb, Cameras, Yadda Yadda Yadda)</strong></a> Aug 10 2023</p>

<p>TLDR: Our hearing was held Aug 1st, the arbitrator has 30 days to decide. Arbitration turned out to be a pretty awful experience and I'm not very hopeful but still glad I fought!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/11saoz0/new_update_from_court_in_ongoing_case_airbnb/">For the latest full case update you can go here -ish</a></p>

<p>I've been writing this post in my head in the two seconds I have each day now that I've morphed from single woman to mom of two (I met a single dad on reddit - RIP R4R - and my life is now utterly changed and I'm happier and more exhausted than I have ever been!) but now that I am over a week out I figured I'd post an update for anywhere who is still here!</p>

<p>As noted above, our hearing was finally held on August 1st and lasted SIX (6!!!) hours so was pretty mentally and emotionally exhausting. I keep thinking of things I should have said (of course now after the fact) but the long and short of the argument I was trying to make was that, look, if Airbnb is basically saying that you CAN have a camera in a private space then it COULD record the bed and, um, that's bad (and reminder, <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/3061">against Airbnb's policies</a>).</p>

<p>But because Airbnb conceded that they would pay me what I was promised on September 26th, 2022 (almost a year ago! fun!) the hearing itself got super bogged down into the weeds of whether I had PROOF that there was a camera (reminder, I didn't because the first customer service rep told me that the hosts' acknowledgment that there was one wasn't enough). Their contention from the start has been that the <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/2908">Terms of Service</a> basically make you sign away all of your rights and even if the company itself erred they aren't liable for anything. Side note - have y'all watched "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jY1ecibLYo">Joan is Awful</a>" because the whole ToS madness reminded me of that.</p>

<p>Of course, my whole issue here is that it SHOULDN'T take someone 12+ hours, months of time, and filing a case in arbitration to get what was promised to them, and which they relied on, from a corporation that obviously has the time and resources to squash me like a little bug. They also argued that while the terms of service SAY that cameras can't be "inside" what they REALLY mean is "inside and monitoring" so, if that is the case , why not just remove the "inside" piece from the ambiguous language? I continue to be baffled why they fought this so hard but I digress. Here's what I wrote regarding that in my opening argument,</p>

<p>When I began this case I was a single woman. I’m have a partner and am the mother to two small children. Truth be told, if this were to happen today, I wouldn’t have had the time or energy to spend a week of my vacation fighting customer service representatives, nor would I have had the ability to attempt to seek resolution or argue this matter in arbitration. I would have had to give up even though the law of promissory estoppel, as I will argue today, make it plainly clear that I was owed what I was promised.</p>

<p>Thus, should this case only result in my recouping of the $1,502.78, it, in effect, means that in order for a consumer to be able to effectively rely upon a promise made by a company, they must also be willing to jump through hours of time, months of effort, and eventually litigation in order to receive what was promised. The impact is a chilling effect - consumers are forced to choose between expending time and energy or simply “giving up.” What of consumers who don’t have the privilege of time? Where would their justice be?</p>

<p>I think what was most surprising to me, though perhaps it shouldn't be, was the way in which the lawyers tried to attack my character. Saying I was doing this for youtube views (did I bring up the fact that the youtube video has since been removed by myself? lol no) or for a "reddit following." They dug up reddit posts that I had made about this case in the heat of anger that I almost immediately realized were mean and unfair and so I took them down - but wayback is a thing and everything can be found and I guess they wanted to show that, yes, this case kind of turned me into an asshole at times. I kind of lost in in a tumbling bridge of sadness way at this point. We had already played recordings of me crying with customer service (embarrassing) and in order to "prove" that I was impacted by this I had to submit anxiety medications my doctor had prescribed me that I was then cross-examined on (double embarrassing), so I don't really get the point that was other than to try and kick me while I was down. Of course, I know the lawyers are only doing their jobs but I guess I felt sad that that is a job anyone would choose to do.</p>

<p>So - why am I still posting here, knowing that it could get me in trouble? Well, first I would argue to whoever is checking these posts that the hearing itself was never ordered to be confidential and I am not sharing anything deemed confidential but, more than that, I think that people have a right to know what they will be up against if they try and challenge a large corporation in arbitration which is meant to be a "fair and efficient hearing." Unfortunately, my experiences in arbitration didn't feel that way at all. I suppose I could delightfully be proven wrong but, sadly, the moral of the story here, to me, is that it isn't worth it. Which, you know, is what corporations WANT us to think and feel so we DO give up. When both arbitration rules and a company's own terms of service (23.3 here) say you are supposed to enter into good faith negotiations before moving forward, and when a company fails to enter into these in any way shape or form - I think the rule should just be that the consumer wins. Otherwise we are enabling a massive imbalance of power that will only lead to the further erosion of fairness and consumer rights.</p>

<p>But who cares what I think ;)</p>

<p>The one silver lining in all of this has been receiving more mental health support. As y'all know, part of what frustrated me so much about this was the very real knowledge I have those cameras in private areas can and will ultimately lead to victimization from already marginalized people. And I've begun talking to my therapist about <a href="https://www.brainline.org/article/secondary-ptsd-or-secondary-traumatic-stress-should-not-be-underestimated">secondary PTSD</a> and am looking into talking to psychology students who may be interested in a dissertation specifically on how 2PTSD impacts lawyers representing survivors.</p>

<p>Oh, and, of course, had I never received as much support from reddit I may never have turned my dating life over to the wonders of the anonymous internet (I used a throwaway account for my R4R post) and <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/LGRDtPI">wouldn't now have this in my life.</a> (OP's note. The link is to an image of a child's hand or hands intertwined with that of two adults.)</p>

<p>So, in the end.....</p>

<ul>
<li>Audre Lorde was right, the master's tools cannot dismantle the master's house,</li>
<li>Arbitration is not as pro se and consumer-friendly as it is made out to be</li>
<li>If you're reading this airbnb, which I know you are, please please please please please please please don't allow cameras inside any private area. <a href="https://osce.usmission.gov/taking-a-lesson-from-traffickers-harnessing-technology-to-further-the-anti-trafficking-movement/">The risk is, truly, too great.</a></li>
<li>But reddit remains a pretty cool place. Thanks y'all &lt;3</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AtypicalCommonplace/comments/15v6cab/airbnb_camera_arbitration_case_update_we/"><strong>Airbnb Camera Arbitration Case Update: WE WON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ... thirty five dollars.</strong></a> August 19 2023</p>

<p>The day after I made my last post I woke up with a pit in my stomach and just had a feeling the decision was going to come out. And, low and behold, on August 7th, the arbitrator made their decision.</p>

<p>In short, Airbnb made a promise and they should keep that promise because I relied on it. So I am owed the money promised ($1502 in total - and yes, that is the actual number) - But it was my fault for not doing more research on the property before booking and I had no proof that there actually WAS a camera there was no deceptive language or material omission in the listing. And because I didn't lose money over this case (meaning I didn't like quit my job, though I have had to take on fewer clients in general) and I didn't have any out of pocket medical expenses, and because I agreed to the ToS which doesn't make airbnb liable anyways, I'm basically SOOL. And I wasn't going to try and push MAKING UP a fee I incurred just for the right thing to happen. The judge DID apply interest between Sept when I was told that I would get the refund and March when a "Selttlement" of that amount was made.</p>

<p>Reminder here, if I HADN'T brought this to arbitration then airbnb was just going to KEEP my money because I refused to stay at a place once they told me, AFTER I BOOKED, there were cameras INSIDE a PRIVATE BOOKING. AFTER I also relied on airbnb confirming it was not ok! And confirming I didn't need to go there to verify the camera was inside because the listing was enough!</p>

<p>It;s wild to me that the end result, given these very facts alone (that there was a promise made that I relied on and was reassured I could rely on - (y'all in the recordings I even ask exactly when I will get the refund due to a concern about my credit card balance since I'd need to go book at a hotel before airbnb reimbursed me) - that I wasn't awarded any compensation for being put through the ringer to actually GET THAT. It honestly blows my mind that because "all I lost was time" then that isn;t worth anything. And yet, the lawyers, the arbitrator, everyone but me is MAKING MONEY off of the fact that I have to work this hard to get the $1500. The arbitrator made more than I did in this case. The lawyers made more than I did in this case. Like, for that reason alone I am just......fuming.</p>

<p>But ADD TO THE FACT that this is about cameras! Not hidden cameras that airbnb doesn't know about. No. We are talking cameras inside spaces. And this is where I get even angrier. Because airbnb is making the MOST off of this because hey won't have to piss off hosts with cameras inside studios by making it explicit they can't have them. I literally cannot imagine any other reason why they still would not have clarified the policy to this day (even their own employees were confused as per our phone calls) - side note, reminder, I was on these phone calls so these were not confidential nor is this hearing- sorry I am paranoid they are going to try and sue me lol!) So that is what is getting at the root of what is eating me alive in this case. Because I wasn't given a fair shot at this,</p>

<p>For example, I was supposed to be afforded the right to discovery. I asked for, for example, notes about the creation of the policy itself. So that I could, you know, show there is a REASON this is against their policy!!</p>

<p>I asked for copies of internal emails sent about me so that I could, you know, show they knew about me trying to reach out and willfully didn't attempt a settlement in good faith which is, against their own terms of service (see pgh 23.3).</p>

<p>I asked for internal notes from the customer service reps to each other about my calls, etc. I asked for notes from a meeting I know incurred internally about my case because a friend of mine was at it. I asked for reasons behind why I was later told the unit was taken down two months after I reported it.</p>

<p>I won't get too into the weeds but, basically Airbnb objected to everything except recordings of my phone calls (which they had verbally agreed to at a previous hearing) but they did not submit their objections to the arbitrator on the due date of June 21. I asked literally half a dozen times where my discovery was, as there was no ruling to be made on an unfiled objection and I received nothing other than my recorded calls. I get no answer until mid July when I write an email demanding to receive discovery. The arbitrator only orders discovery on notes about the host. Airbnb asks for an extension and gets one after it is now weeks after discovery was due. I get only notes of the listing and call recordings with my host and airbnb and nothing internal. It is now july 22 and the hearing is on August 1t. I still have nothing internal from airbnb to prepare with and request a delay in hearing for arguments to be made on discovery. I bring up the fact California law outlines that discovery must at least 15 days before the hearing for full fairness. My request to delay was denied.</p>

<p>Instead we have a phone call where Airbnb basically says it would be too burdensome to have to look through emails with my name because airbnb has "6,000 employees" (I truly feel this was made for me to feel small.) They claimed they had no record of a meeting I know occurred because my friend was there but I wasn't willing to sell out my friend to "prove" it (the judge wanted to see the email I had - wasn't going to do that.) ANd on and on. And all my requests for discovery were denied and the hearing happened the next day. I was NOT prepared to move forward with basically nothing, but I did what I could with what I had. But I honestly couldn't believe that basically no discovery was allowed.</p>

<p>Anyways, this has already gotten incredibly way too long but I continue to think it's important to know just how wild arbitration is. Some folks called out in the BORU update that I am a lawyer and should have known that but I am one of those wild people who, while I have heard the most horrible stories from the depths of humanity, I still just have a fundamental belief that folks are going to do the right thing. There;s definitely an amount of white, cis, and socioeconomically hangin- in-there privilege there too, I know. But I just didn't actually believe I would wind up with......nothing. And I can't believe I had to fight it this hard to not end up in the negative and just end up.....neutral. And to see how little my time is worth in a court of law, how little anyone's would be. And you're, really, the only one with anything to lose.</p>

<p>It;s been a bit of a mindfuck.</p>

<p>But what REALLY REALLY REALLY kills me. Is that the decision didn't even get things right. There are things I could ARGUE with, yes, (they argue the camera could have been in the kitchen and there was a partition there and the photos I have showing only one door doesn't "prove" that was the door that was being talked about and thus I didn't KNOW it was in a room with a bed), sure. But there were fundamental basic things about the case that objectively were or were not true that the arbitrator gets wrong. Like the timeline in when I canceled the booking and what langauge was told to me after i booked v. before.</p>

<p>But there is NO right to appeal EVEN IF the arbitrator gets the facts wrong.</p>

<p>No y'all. I kid you not. This is real. If an arbitrator gets the law wrong, or gets the facts wrong, you're SOOL. It;s wild.</p>

<p>Something else that's wild?</p>

<p>One reason that you can, however, get a case booted from arbitration to court is if the arbitrator refuses to delay the hearing thus prejudicing the rights of either party. And guess what happened in this case....</p>

<p>Oh, and also, Airbnb's ToS 23.5 states that there's an exception to arbitration for public injunctions - here's how that reads:</p>

<p>You and Airbnb each agree that the following causes of action and/or claims for relief are exceptions to the Arbitration Agreement and will be brought in a judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction (as defined by Section 22):.....(iii) a request for the remedy of public injunctive relief; .........You and Airbnb agree that the remedy of public injunctive relief will proceed after the arbitration of all arbitrable claims, remedies, or causes of action, and will be stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration pursuant to section 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>

<p>So.....</p>

<p>What the heck do I do? I've contacted a few lawyers and keep getting the "that's a great argument, but it will be a heck of a fight" so, while I have a few willing to take this on on an hourly basis, none so far would do so on a contingency basis (meaning I wouldn't pay them they would just get a percentage of whatever I win monetarily.") And I don't have the money to do that and I do not have the personal energy to go it alone.</p>

<p>Truth be told, I am in a really solid place in life at the moment. Questioning a lot, as always, feeling stuck on my career and figuring out what is next, but in love and building a home and making a family feels fulfilling in ways I never imagined. And it's ok if I want to put down this weight as well. I have the hope that maybe I will find someone whose fire is lit by this. Maybe someone who does want to file a suit on contingency. Maybe someone is starting a class action so the US can be like Canada and realize the absurdity of forced arbitration clauses. Maybe a reporter wants to write about this so someone ELSE will be inspired to do something. But it's out of my hands at this point - other than my experience and passion I've not much else to offer so I'm passing the baton.</p>

<p>Thanks, all, for being on this wild ride with me and making me feel a little less alone when it felt like a whole lot of others were trying to make me feel pretty insignificant. And who knows...</p>

<p>After about 7 months of math circles
with a group of 7- turning 8-year-old boys and girls,
I decided to take a break to breathe
and reflect on what worked and what didn't.</p>
<p>It's interesting how big a gulf there is
between what math topic you think will be interesting
to a 7-year-old
and what actually captures their attention.
Let me start by giving some examples
of things I <em>thought</em> would catch their interest
but flopped.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3DiBtPY" target="_blank">The game SET</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold-and-cut_theorem" target="_blank">Fold-and-cut puzzles</a>.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKV0GYvR2X8" target="_blank">Cutting a Mobius strip</a>.</li>
<li>Tessellations (<a href="https://momath.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ChaimGoodman-Strauss2021RosenthalPrizeLessonPlan.pdf" target="_blank">Tooti Tooti</a>, pdf link).</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3Ko8m1F" target="_blank">Prime Climb</a>.</li>
<li>Making <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexagon" target="_blank">flexagons</a>.</li>
<li>Ruler and compass constructions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Things I didn't think they'd like but they loved:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_and_Knaves" target="_blank">Knights and Knaves puzzles</a>,
  and more generally any topic about propositional logic (blue-eyed islanders.</li>
<li>Manually scheduling a round-robin tournament's worth of sports games,
  trying to minimize the latency of the entire tournament. (I originally phrased it as a soccer tournament, but that week the kid who loves soccer the most didn't show up, and so it turned into a DANCE competition, which was much more fun)</li>
<li>Seven bridges problems, and trying to find the smallest "impossible" bridge problem.</li>
<li>Trying to figure out who is better at penalty kicks based on counts of scores/misses.</li>
<li>Coming up with your own Pascal's triangle-type pattern.</li>
</ul>
<p>And then there were the problems
I thought they would love, and they did.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Function Machine game (guess a function given the ability to query it as a black-box)</li>
<li>Variations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim" target="_blank">Nim</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/43odWrr" target="_blank">The Turing Tumble</a>.</li>
<li>Fair cake cutting (with real cookies and oddly-distributed toppings).</li>
<li>Game theory games like Prisoner's dilemma and Chicken.</li>
<li>Making mocktails for 3 people, given a recipe for 1 drink, and again with a recipe that serves 5. (fractions practice). Measurements were in quarters of ounces.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="cookies with oddly distributed toppings" src="https://buttondown.imgix.net/images/281bd56a-61a7-4e26-84c1-98dfd6638c8b.jpg?w=960&amp;fit=max"> 
 <img alt="A poster with two recipes on it, the first making 1 drink and the second making 5" src="https://buttondown.imgix.net/images/1a6c1f86-5791-4c67-ad24-7aaf00f73fb2.jpg?w=960&amp;fit=max"> </p>
<p>Back in 2019 I wrote an article,
<a href="https://github.com/j2kun/essays/blob/main/attention-spans-for-math-and-stories.md" target="_blank">Attention spans for math and stories</a>
in which I described how I have used storytelling
with kids of various ages
(not in a math context)
to get them participating in activities and feeling welcome in a group.
I tied it back to math,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To have good mathematical content revolving around stories,
mathematicians should learn to tell stories well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Somehow, though, my story-telling game
was off during some of my math circles.
I think through all my reading and learning about math circles,
I had internalized a different viewpoint.
That viewpoint, roughly speaking,
is that the math should speak for itself.
Much math circle literature
seems to suggest that a facilitator
should start with an open-ended mystery
(like, "can you draw a perfect shape?")
and then sit quiet until the participants
start asking questions and exploring on their own
(in this example, maybe discovering ruler and compass constructions).</p>
<p>I suspect this might work
with an older group of students,
or a group of students who have already bought into math
in some sense.
I know, for example, that many parents
who find math circles are desperately
searching for resources because their kid's
math ability is beyond their comprehension.
Some of these kids are believed to be on the autism spectrum as well.</p>
<p>The group I worked with were as typical
upper middle class kids as you could find.
They came to math circle after soccer practice.
When they got bored during the circle they
goofed off and roughhoused.
Though they had never played "Among Us,"
they constantly called things "sus."
More importantly,
they just didn't care about number patterns
unless it was couched in a more engaging format.
Geometry was a complete dud,
because it's even harder to come up with stories
about arbitrary figures with shaded regions you want to find the area of.
They didn't think tessellations were pretty.
And they didn't have the dexterity required
to make enough cuts and folds
to construct objects out of paper,
so they ended the fold-and-cut
and flexagon activities feeling frustrated.</p>
<p>But the idea that there are two people,
one of whom is a ROTTEN LIAR,
and you have to figure out who is the liar
based on the clues in what they say?
That's gold.
For that knights and knaves puzzle,
I wrote down the phrases Alice and Bob
said on pieces of paper,
taped them to plastic straws,
and held them up like signs.
The first puzzle was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alice: Bob is a liar!</li>
<li>Bob: Neither of us are liars.</li>
</ul>
<p>The kids all jumped to say who they thought was the most "sus",
and they predicted that Alice was suspicious for blaming Bob.
With a bit of discussion,
they realized that they can't both be telling the truth
because their claims are mutually contradictory
(though they didn't have the word for this and often called it "opposites").
Then we talked about how many possibilities there are.
First they thought 2, then 4.
It's 4: two liars, liar truth-teller,
truth-teller liar, and two truth-tellers.
Then we proceeded to inspect each option,
and after a while they agreed
that the only possibility was that
Alice was telling the truth and Bob was lying (correct!).</p>
<p>Then an interesting thing happened.
As I moved on to the next knights-and-knaves puzzle they asked if they got the first one right.
And I said, "well, do you think you got it right?"
One boy admitted he wasn't entirely certain,
and then we all agreed to keep thinking about it
until we were convinced by the proof.
So it was planting the seed:
how do you know if you've truly proved something?
Later in that session he remarked to one of the girl's comments,
"No, we already proved that case!"</p>
<p>After the months of weekly sessions, however,
I think the kids are warming up to the idea
of the math speaking for its own sake.
While I led the Seven Bridge of Konigsberg
problem with a story,
they quickly discarded the story and focused on the challenge.
And in a later session they asked to revisit it
because they wanted to try to find the "smallest impossible bridges problem."
Indeed, they did!
While we didn't solve the original problem,
the idea of simplifying a problem,
making it smaller and smaller until you can solve it,
and then gradually adding back complexity,
was clearly on display those weeks.</p>
<p>And though they hated flexagons,
for an "end of the session" gift
I made them each a hexaflexagon
from a <a href="https://thinkzone.wlonk.com/Flexagon/Flexagon.htm" target="_blank">printed template</a>
which critically had bright, distinct pictures on each face.
Weeks later, one girl's dad
told me that she is obsessed with it,
only recently discovering the sixth face.
I let him know that you can draw a map of the flexagon's movements,
much like the Seven Bridges maps we drew,
to get a clear picture of the whole configuration space.
I have yet to hear back whether they were able to figure it out.</p>
<p>So I have hope that this group can graduate to appreciating
the math for its own sake.
But if I were to start with a new group
of kids who had no <em>a priori</em> love of math,
I'd have to be a bit more deliberate in framing
the problems in engaging stories.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span><span>W</span></span>hen he was nine years old, my godson Adam developed a brief but freakishly intense obsession with Elvis Presley. He took to singing Jailhouse Rock at the top of his voice with all the low crooning and pelvis-jiggling of the King himself. One day, as I tucked him in, he looked at me very earnestly and asked: “Johann, will you take me to Graceland one day?” Without really thinking, I agreed. I never gave it another thought, until everything had gone wrong.</p><p>Ten years later, Adam was lost. He had dropped out of school when he was 15, and he spent almost all his waking hours alternating blankly between screens – a blur of YouTube, WhatsApp and porn. (I’ve changed his name and some minor details to preserve his privacy.) He seemed to be whirring at the speed of Snapchat, and nothing still or serious could gain any traction in his mind. During the decade in which Adam had become a man, this fracturing seemed to be happening to many of us. Our ability to pay attention was cracking and breaking. I had just turned 40, and wherever my generation gathered, we would lament our lost capacity for concentration. I still read a lot of books, but with each year that passed, it felt more and more like running up a down escalator. Then one evening, as we lay on my sofa, each staring at our own ceaselessly shrieking screens, I looked at him and felt a low dread. “Adam,” I said softly, “let’s go to Graceland.” I reminded him of the promise I had made. I could see that the idea of breaking this numbing routine ignited something in him, but I told him there was one condition he had to stick to if we went. He had to switch his phone off during the day. He swore he would.</p><p>When you arrive at the gates of Graceland, there is no longer a human being whose job is to show you around. You are handed an iPad, you put in little earbuds, and the iPad tells you what to do – turn left; turn right; walk forward. In each room, a photograph of where you are appears on the screen, while a narrator describes it. So as we walked around we were surrounded by blank-faced people, looking almost all the time at their screens. As we walked, I felt more and more tense. When we got to the jungle room – Elvis’s favourite place in the mansion – the iPad was chattering away when a middle-aged man standing next to me turned to say something to his wife. In front of us, I could see the large fake plants that Elvis had bought to turn this room into his own artificial jungle. “Honey,” he said, “this is amazing. Look.” He waved the iPad in her direction, and began to move his finger across it. “If you swipe left, you can see the jungle room to the left. And if you swipe right, you can see the jungle room to the right.”</p><p>His wife stared, smiled, and began to swipe at her own iPad. I leaned forward. “But, sir,” I said, “there’s an old-fashioned form of swiping you can do. It’s called turning your head. Because we’re here. We’re in the jungle room. You can see it unmediated. Here. Look.” I waved my hand, and the fake green leaves rustled a little. Their eyes returned to their screens. “Look!” I said. “Don’t you see? <em> </em>We’re <em>actually there. </em>There’s no need for your screen. <em>We are in the jungle room.</em>” They hurried away. I turned to Adam, ready to laugh about it all – but he was in a corner, holding his phone under his jacket, flicking through Snapchat.</p><p>At every stage in the trip, he had broken his promise. When the plane first touched down in New Orleans two weeks before, he took out his phone while we were still in our seats. “You promised not to use it,” I said. He replied: “I meant I wouldn’t make phone calls. I can’t not use Snapchat and texting, obviously.” He said this with baffled honesty, as though I had asked him to hold his breath for 10 days. In the jungle room, I suddenly snapped and tried to wrestle his phone from his grasp, and he stomped away. That night I found him in the Heartbreak Hotel, sitting next to a swimming pool (shaped like a giant guitar), looking sad. I realised as I sat with him that, as with so much anger, my rage towards him was really anger towards myself. His inability to focus was something I felt happening to me too. I was losing my ability to be present, and I hated it. “I know something’s wrong,” Adam said, holding his phone tightly in his hand. “But I have no idea how to fix it.” Then he went back to texting.</p><figure id="f8286d25-ef9d-44b0-b3ea-5a908860b483" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56e6443b4e0e6055b0fc5482d5d11176e1debb42/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56e6443b4e0e6055b0fc5482d5d11176e1debb42/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56e6443b4e0e6055b0fc5482d5d11176e1debb42/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56e6443b4e0e6055b0fc5482d5d11176e1debb42/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56e6443b4e0e6055b0fc5482d5d11176e1debb42/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56e6443b4e0e6055b0fc5482d5d11176e1debb42/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Johann Hari at his home in London." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56e6443b4e0e6055b0fc5482d5d11176e1debb42/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="296.66666666666663" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Johann Hari at his home in London.</span> Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</figcaption></figure><p>I realised then that I needed to understand what was really happening to him and to so many of us. That moment turned out to be the start of a journey that transformed how I think about attention. I travelled all over the world in the next three years, from Miami to Moscow to Melbourne, interviewing the leading experts in the world about focus. What I learned persuaded me that we are not now facing simply a normal anxiety about attention, of the kind every generation goes through as it ages. We are living in a serious attention crisis – one with huge implications for how we live. I learned there are twelve factors that have been proven to reduce people’s ability to pay attention and that many of these factors have been rising in the past few decades – sometimes dramatically.</p><p>I went to Portland, Oregon, to interview Prof Joel Nigg, who is one of the leading experts in the world on children’s attention problems, and he told me we need to ask if we are now developing “an attentional pathogenic culture” – an environment in which sustained and deep focus is harder for all of us. When I asked him what he would do if he was in charge of our culture and he actually wanted to destroy people’s attention, he said: “Probably what our society is doing.” Prof Barbara Demeneix, a leading French scientist who has studied some key factors that can disrupt attention – she is an expert on the effects of chemical pollution – told me bluntly: “There is no way we can have a normal brain today.” We can see the effects all around us. A small study of college students found they now only focus on any one task for 65 seconds. A different study of office workers found they only focus on average for three minutes. This isn’t happening because we all individually became weak-willed. Your focus didn’t collapse. It was stolen.</p><hr><p><span><span>W</span></span>hen I first got back from Graceland, I thought my attention was failing because I wasn’t strong enough as an individual and because I had been taken over by my phone. I went into a spiral of negative thoughts, reproaching myself. I’d say – you’re weak, you’re lazy, you’re not disciplined enough. I thought the solution was obvious: be more disciplined, and banish your phone. So I went online and booked myself a little room by the beach in Provincetown, at the tip of Cape Cod. I announced triumphantly to everyone – I am going to be there for three months, with no smartphone, and no computer that can get online. I’m done. I’m tired of being wired. I knew I could only do it because I was very lucky and had money from my previous books. I knew it couldn’t be a long-term solution. I did it because I thought that if I didn’t, I might lose some crucial aspects of my ability to think deeply. I also hoped that if I stripped everything back for a time, I might start to be able to glimpse the changes we could all make in a more sustainable way.</p><p>In my first webless week, I stumbled around in a haze of decompression. Provincetown is a little gay resort town with the highest proportion of same-sex couples in the US. I ate cupcakes, read books, talked with strangers and sang songs. Everything radically slowed down. Normally I follow the news every hour or so, getting a drip-feed of anxiety-provoking facts and trying to smush them together into some kind of sense. Instead, I simply read a physical newspaper once a day. Every few hours, I would feel an unfamiliar sensation gurgling inside me and I would ask myself: what is that? Ah, yes. Calm.</p><p>Later, I realised when I interviewed the experts and studied their research that there were many reasons why my attention was starting to heal from that first day. Prof Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, explained one to me. He said “your brain can only produce one or two thoughts” in your conscious mind at once. That’s it. “We’re very, very single-minded.” We have “very limited cognitive capacity”. But we have fallen for an enormous delusion. The average teenager now believes they can follow six forms of media at the same time. When neuroscientists studied this, they found that when people believe they are doing several things at once, they are actually juggling. “They’re switching back and forth. They don’t notice the switching because their brain sort of papers it over to give a seamless experience of consciousness, but what they’re actually doing is switching and reconfiguring their brain moment-to-moment, task-to-task – [and] that comes with a cost.” Imagine, say, you are doing your tax return, and you receive a text, and you look at it – it’s only a glance, taking three seconds – and then you go back to your tax return. In that moment, “your brain has to reconfigure, when it goes from one task to another”, he said. You have to remember what you were doing before, and you have to remember what you thought about it. When this happens, the evidence shows that “your performance drops. You’re slower. All as a result of the switching.”</p><p>This is called the “switch-cost effect”. It means that if you check your texts while trying to work, you aren’t only losing the little bursts of time you spend looking at the texts themselves – you are also losing the time it takes to refocus afterwards, which turns out to be a huge amount. For example, one study at the Carnegie Mellon University’s human computer interaction lab took 136 students and got them to sit a test. Some of them had to have their phones switched off, and others had their phones on and received intermittent text messages. The students who received messages performed, on average, 20% worse. It seems to me that almost all of us are currently losing that 20% of our brainpower, almost all the time. Miller told me that as a result we now live in “a perfect storm of cognitive degradation”.</p><p>For the first time in a very long time, in Provincetown I was doing one thing at a time, without being interrupted. I was living within the limits of what my brain could actually handle. I felt my attention growing and improving with every day that passed, but then, one day, I experienced an abrupt setback. I was walking down the beach and every few steps I saw the same thing that had been scratching at me since Memphis. People seemed to be using Provincetown simply as a backdrop for selfies, rarely looking up, at the ocean or each other. Only this time, the itch I felt wasn’t to yell: You’re wasting your lives, put the damn phone down. It was to yell: Give <em>me </em>that phone! <em>Mine! </em>For so long, I had received the thin, insistent signals of the web every few hours throughout the day, the trickle of likes and comments that say: I see you. You matter. Now they were gone. Simone de Beauvoir said that when she became an atheist, it felt like the world had fallen silent. Losing the web felt like that. After the rhetorical heat of social media, ordinary social interactions seemed pleasing but low volume. No normal social interaction floods you with hearts.</p><figure id="635f2691-8217-41c0-a752-a7cfbd80e21f" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60ab661c6dd26e979e40e05619298040a51876ed/0_141_4222_2534/master/4222.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60ab661c6dd26e979e40e05619298040a51876ed/0_141_4222_2534/master/4222.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60ab661c6dd26e979e40e05619298040a51876ed/0_141_4222_2534/master/4222.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60ab661c6dd26e979e40e05619298040a51876ed/0_141_4222_2534/master/4222.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60ab661c6dd26e979e40e05619298040a51876ed/0_141_4222_2534/master/4222.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60ab661c6dd26e979e40e05619298040a51876ed/0_141_4222_2534/master/4222.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Provincetown: a place to switch off." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60ab661c6dd26e979e40e05619298040a51876ed/0_141_4222_2534/master/4222.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267.08432022738043" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Provincetown: a place to switch off.</span> Photograph: Maddie Meyer/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>I realised that to heal my attention, it was not enough simply to strip out distractions. That makes you feel good at first – but then it creates a vacuum where all the noise was. I realised I had to fill the vacuum. To do that, I started to think a lot about an area of psychology I had learned about years before – the science of flow states. Almost everyone reading this will have experienced a flow state at some point. It’s when you are doing something meaningful to you, and you really get into it, and time falls away, and your ego seems to vanish, and you find yourself focusing deeply and effortlessly. Flow is the deepest form of attention human beings can offer. But how do we get there?</p><p>I later interviewed Prof Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi in Claremont, California, who was the first scientist to study flow states and researched them for more than 40 years. From his research, I learned there are three key factors which you need to get into flow. First you need to choose <em>one</em> goal. Flow takes all your mental energy, deployed deliberately in one direction. Second, that goal needs to be meaningful to you – you can’t flow into a goal that you don’t care about. Third, it helps if what you are doing is at the edge of your abilities – if, say, the rock you are climbing is slightly higher and harder than the last rock you climbed. So every morning, I started to write – a different kind of writing from my earlier work, one that stretched me. Within a few days, I started to flow, and hours of focus would pass without it feeling like a challenge. I felt I was focusing in the way I had when I was a teenager, in long effortless stretches. I had feared my brain was breaking. I cried with relief when I realised that in the right circumstances, its full power could come back.</p><p>At the end of every day, I would sit on the beach and watch the light slowly change. The light on the cape is unlike the light anywhere else I have ever been and in Provincetown, I could see more clearly than I ever had before in my life – my own thoughts, my own goals, my own dreams. I was living in the light. So when the time came to leave the beach house and come back to the hyperlinked world, I became convinced I had cracked the code of attention. I returned to the world determined to integrate the lessons I had learned in my everyday life. When I was reunited with my phone and laptop after taking a ferry back to where they were stashed in Boston, they seemed alien, and alienating. But within a few months, my screen time was back to four hours a day, and my attention was fraying and breaking again.</p><hr><p><span><span>I</span></span>n Moscow, the former Google engineer James Williams – who has become the most important philosopher of attention in the western world – told me I had made a crucial mistake. Individual abstinence is “not the solution, for the same reason that wearing a gas mask for two days a week outside isn’t the answer to pollution. It might, for a short period of time, keep certain effects at bay, but it’s not sustainable, and it doesn’t address the systemic issues.” He said that our attention is being deeply altered by huge invasive forces in wider society. Saying the solution was to just adjust your own habits – to pledge to break up with your phone, say – was just “pushing it back on to the individual” he said, when “it’s really the environmental changes that will really make the difference”.</p><p>Nigg said it might help me grasp what’s happening if we compare our rising attention problems to our rising obesity rates. Fifty years ago there was very little obesity, but today it is endemic in the western world. This is not because we suddenly became greedy or self-indulgent. He said: “Obesity is not a medical epidemic – it’s a social epidemic. We have bad food, for example, and so people are getting fat.” The way we live changed dramatically – our food supply changed, and we built cities that are hard to walk or cycle around, and those changes in our environment led to changes in our bodies. We gained mass, en masse. Something similar, he said, might be happening with the changes in our attention.</p><p>I learned that the factors harming our attention are not all immediately obvious. I had been focused on tech at first, but in fact the causes range very widely – from the food we eat to the air we breathe, from the hours we work to the hours we no longer sleep. They include many things we have come to take for granted – from how we deprive our children of play, to how our schools strip learning of meaning by basing everything on tests. I came to believe we need to respond to this incessant invasion of our attention at two levels. The first is individual. There are all sorts of changes we can make at a personal level that will protect our focus. I would say that by doing most of them, I have boosted my focus by about 20%. But we have to level with people. Those changes will only take you so far. At the moment it’s as though we are all having itching powder poured over us all day, and the people pouring the powder are saying: “You might want to learn to meditate. Then you wouldn’t scratch so much.” Meditation is a useful tool – but we actually need to stop the people who are pouring itching powder on us. We need to band together to take on the forces stealing our attention and take it back.</p><figure id="43c0ea5b-1633-4a0b-a24c-c03d20aba213" data-spacefinder-role="immersive" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01455678a4bb646a319e2dcfa238ddfd9dc19570/0_0_2480_1550/master/2480.jpg?width=1300&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01455678a4bb646a319e2dcfa238ddfd9dc19570/0_0_2480_1550/master/2480.jpg?width=1300&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01455678a4bb646a319e2dcfa238ddfd9dc19570/0_0_2480_1550/master/2480.jpg?width=1140&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01455678a4bb646a319e2dcfa238ddfd9dc19570/0_0_2480_1550/master/2480.jpg?width=1140&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01455678a4bb646a319e2dcfa238ddfd9dc19570/0_0_2480_1550/master/2480.jpg?width=1125&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01455678a4bb646a319e2dcfa238ddfd9dc19570/0_0_2480_1550/master/2480.jpg?width=1125&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01455678a4bb646a319e2dcfa238ddfd9dc19570/0_0_2480_1550/master/2480.jpg?width=965&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 740px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 740px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01455678a4bb646a319e2dcfa238ddfd9dc19570/0_0_2480_1550/master/2480.jpg?width=965&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 740px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01455678a4bb646a319e2dcfa238ddfd9dc19570/0_0_2480_1550/master/2480.jpg?width=725&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01455678a4bb646a319e2dcfa238ddfd9dc19570/0_0_2480_1550/master/2480.jpg?width=725&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01455678a4bb646a319e2dcfa238ddfd9dc19570/0_0_2480_1550/master/2480.jpg?width=645&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01455678a4bb646a319e2dcfa238ddfd9dc19570/0_0_2480_1550/master/2480.jpg?width=645&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01455678a4bb646a319e2dcfa238ddfd9dc19570/0_0_2480_1550/master/2480.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01455678a4bb646a319e2dcfa238ddfd9dc19570/0_0_2480_1550/master/2480.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Illusration of a man with a magnet for a head pulling social media logos towards him" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01455678a4bb646a319e2dcfa238ddfd9dc19570/0_0_2480_1550/master/2480.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="465" height="290.625" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Illustration by Eric Chow.</span></figcaption></figure><p>This can sound a bit abstract – but I met people who were putting it into practice in many places. To give one example: there is strong scientific evidence that stress and exhaustion ruin your attention. Today, about 35% of workers feel they can never switch off their phones because their boss might email them at any time of day or night. In France, ordinary workers decided this was intolerable and pressured their government for change – so now, they have a legal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/dec/31/french-workers-win-legal-right-to-avoid-checking-work-email-out-of-hours" data-link-name="in body link">“right to disconnect”</a>. It’s simple. You have a right to defined work hours, and you have a right to not be contacted by your employer outside those hours. Companies that break the rules get huge fines. There are lots of potential collective changes like this that can restore part of our focus. We could, for example, force social media companies to abandon their current business model, which is specifically designed to invade our attention in order to keep us scrolling. There are alternative ways these sites could work – ones that would heal our attention instead of hacking it.</p><p>Some scientists say these worries about attention are a moral panic, comparable to the anxieties in the past about comic books or rap music, and that the evidence is shaky. Other scientists say the evidence is strong and these anxieties are like the early warnings about the obesity epidemic or the climate crisis in the 1970s. I think that given this uncertainty, we can’t wait for perfect evidence. We have to act based on a reasonable assessment of risk. If the people warning about the effects on our attention turn out to be wrong, and we still do what they suggest, what will be the cost? We will spend less time being harassed by our bosses, and we’ll be tracked and manipulated less by technology – along with lots of other improvements in our lives that are desirable in any case. But if they turn out to be right, and we don’t do what they say, what’s the cost? We will have – as the former Google engineer Tristan Harris told me – downgraded humanity, stripping us of our attention at the very time when we face big collective crises that require it more than ever.</p><p>But none of these changes will happen unless we fight for them. Just as the feminist movement reclaimed women’s right to their own bodies (and still has to fight for it today), I believe we now need an attention movement to reclaim our minds. I believe we need to act urgently, because this may be like the climate crisis, or the obesity crisis – the longer we wait, the harder it will get. The more our attention degrades, the harder it will be to summon the personal and political energy to take on the forces stealing our focus. The first step it requires is a shift in our consciousness. We need to stop blaming ourselves, or making only demands for tiny tweaks from our employers and from tech companies. We own our own minds – and together, we can take them back from the forces that are stealing them.</p><p><span data-dcr-style="bullet"></span> The above is an edited extract from <em>Stolen Focus: Why You Can’t Pay Attention</em> by Johann Hari, published by Bloomsbury on 6 January.

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Docker</h3>
<p dir="auto">You can use <code>gojekyll</code> with the official <code>danog/gojekyll</code> image, for example to build the site in the current directory into <code>_site</code>:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="docker run --user $UID:$GID -v $PWD:/app --pull always --rm -it danog/gojekyll build -s /app"><pre>docker run --user <span>$UID</span>:<span>$GID</span> -v <span>$PWD</span>:/app --pull always --rm -it danog/gojekyll build -s /app</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Another example, serve the website in the current directory on <code>http://localhost:4040</code>, automatically reloading on changes:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="docker run --user $UID:$GID -v $PWD:/app --pull always --network host --rm -it danog/gojekyll serve -s /app"><pre>docker run --user <span>$UID</span>:<span>$GID</span> -v <span>$PWD</span>:/app --pull always --network host --rm -it danog/gojekyll serve -s /app</pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Binary Downloads</h3>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Linux, Mac OS and Windows binaries for x86, amd64, armv6/v7, armv8, riscv64 are available from the <a href="https://github.com/osteele/gojekyll/releases">releases
page</a>.</li>
<li>Download the latest version of <a href="https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases">dart-sass</a> and <a href="https://katiek2.github.io/path-doc/" rel="nofollow">add it to your PATH</a>, or see the <a href="https://katiek2.github.io/path-doc/" rel="nofollow">Sass website</a> for full installation instructions.</li>
<li>[Optional] <strong>Themes</strong>. To use a theme, you need to install Ruby and
<a href="http://bundler.io/" rel="nofollow">bundler</a>. Create a <code>Gemfile</code> that lists the theme., and
run <code>bundle install</code>. The <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/" rel="nofollow">Jekyll theme
instructions</a> provide more detail, and
should work for Gojekyll too.</li>
</ol>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">From Source</h3>
<p dir="auto">Pre-requisites:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Install go</strong> (1) via <a href="https://brew.sh/" rel="nofollow">Homebrew</a>: <code>brew install go</code>; or (2)

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Status</h2>
<p dir="auto">This project works on the GitHub Pages sites that I and other contributors care
about. It looks credible on a spot-check of other Jekyll sites.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Current Limitations</h3>
<p dir="auto">Missing features:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Pagination</li>
<li>Math</li>
<li>Plugin system. (<a href="https://github.com/osteele/gojekyll/blob/main/docs/plugins.md">Some individual plugins</a> are emulated.)</li>
<li>Liquid filter <code>sassify</code> is not implemented</li>
<li>Liquid is run in strict mode: undefined filters and variables are errors.</li>
<li>Missing markdown features:
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#attribute-list-definitions" rel="nofollow">attribute lists</a></li>
<li><a href="https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#html-blocks" rel="nofollow"><code>markdown="span"</code>, <code>markdown="block"</code></a></li>
<li>Markdown configuration options</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Also see the <a href="#feature-status">detailed status</a> below.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Other Differences</h3>
<p dir="auto">These will probably not change:</p>
<p dir="auto">By design:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Plugins must be listed in the config file, not a Gemfile.</li>
<li>The wrong type in a <code>_config.yml</code> file – for example, a list where a string is
expected, or vice versa – is generally an error.</li>
<li>Server live reload is always on.</li>
<li><code>serve --watch</code> (the default) reloads the <code>_config.yml</code> and data files too.</li>
<li><code>serve</code> generates pages on the fly; it doesn't write to the file system.</li>
<li>Files are cached in <code>/tmp/gojekyll-${USER}</code>, not <code>./.sass-cache</code></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Upstream:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Markdown:
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> inside markdown is interpreted as HTML. For example, <code>This is &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;</code> renders as <b>bold</b>. This behavior matches the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#html" rel="nofollow">Markdown
spec</a>, but differs
from Jekyll's default Kramdown processor.</li>
<li>The autogenerated id of a header that includes HTML is computed from the
text of the title, ignoring its attributes. For example, the id of <code>## Title (&lt;a href="https://example.com/path/to/details"&gt;ref&lt;/a&gt;))</code> is <code>#title-ref</code>,
not <code>#title-https-example-path-to-details-ref</code>.</li>
<li>Autogenerated header ids replace punctuation by the hyphens, rather than the
empty string. For example, the id of <code>## Either/or</code> is <code>#either-or</code> not
<code>#eitheror</code>; the id of <code>## I'm Lucky</code> is <code>#i-m-lucky</code> not <code>#im-lucky</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Muzukashii:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>An extensible plugin mechanism – support for plugins that aren't compiled into
the executable.</li>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p dir="auto">If the error is "403 API rate limit exceeded", you are probably building a
repository that uses the <code>jekyll-github-metadata</code> gem. Try setting the
<code>JEKYLL_GITHUB_TOKEN</code>, <code>JEKYLL_GITHUB_TOKEN</code>, or <code>OCTOKIT_ACCESS_TOKEN</code>
environment variable to the value of a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token">GitHub personal access
token</a> and trying again.</p>

							<p>The growing movement against single-use plastics has led many bars and restaurants to swap plastic straws for paper ones. On the surface, this seems like an easy win – we get to sip our drinks through an eco-friendly alternative while keeping tons of plastic out of landfills and oceans. But the truth about paper straws is more complicated.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/paper-straws-contain-forever-chemicals-which-mean-they-might-not-be-better-than-plastic-ones">study conducted</a> at the University of Antwerp found that a shocking 90% of so-called eco-friendly paper straws actually contain traces of “forever chemicals.” Forever chemicals, more formally known as <a href="https://chemtrust.org/pfas/">per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances</a>&nbsp;(PFAS), are compounds that don’t break down once released into the environment or our bodies. They stick around virtually forever, which is how they got their ominous nickname.</p>
<p>PFAS have been linked to concerning health effects including high cholesterol, reduced immune response, thyroid disease, and increased risk of certain cancers. So why are they turning up in paper straws? The researchers tested 39 different brands of straws made from various materials like paper, bamboo, glass, stainless steel, and plastic. PFAS were detected in the majority – 69% overall.</p>
<p>But paper straws were by far the worst offenders, with PFAS identified in a whopping 90% of brands tested. The concentrations varied quite a bit, but the frequent presence of the chemicals suggests they were likely intentionally added in some cases. PFAS are sometimes used as a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/26/water-resistant-products-toxic-pfas-study">water-resistant coating</a> – not something you want leaching into your daily iced tea.</p>
<p>Among the PFAS found in paper straws was <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Perfluorooctanoic-acid">perfluorooctanoic acid</a> (PFOA), which has actually been <a href="https://chemicalwatch.com/189390/global-ban-on-pfoa-enters-into-force-for-most-countries">globally banned since 2020</a> due to health risks including cancer and organ damage. Also frequently detected were other concerning PFAS chemicals <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trifluoroacetic_acid">trifluoroacetic acid</a>&nbsp;(TFA) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triflic_acid">trifluoromethanesulfonic acid</a> (TFMS). While bamboo straws fared slightly better than paper ones, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0045653521007074?via%3Dihub">PFAS was still found in 80%</a> of the bamboo brands tested. Plastic and glass straws also occasionally contained PFAS, though less commonly than plant-based options.</p>
<p>The one material that seems safest is stainless steel – the researchers did not detect any PFAS compounds in the steel straws analyzed. While the PFAS levels measured in this study were fairly low, these chemicals have the ominous ability to accumulate in the human body and the environment over time. The findings raise the question – if paper straws leach PFAS into our drinks over months and years of use, could they be harming our health?</p>
<p>Unfortunately the current research didn’t examine whether the chemicals transfer into liquids. But previous studies have shown PFAS can migrate from food packaging materials into actual food and drinks. More research is critically needed to determine if PFAS leach out of paper straws during typical use.</p>
<p>In the meantime, it’s clear we need to rethink the assumption that paper and other plant-based products are inherently better for health and sustainability compared to plastic. The revelation about paper straws casts doubt on the idea that swapping plastic for paper is a foolproof eco-friendly solution. After all, PFAS spreading from straws into waterways and landfills still contribute to environmental contamination – regardless of that paper label.</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal&nbsp;<i><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19440049.2023.2240908" rel="noopener">Food Additives and Contaminants</a></i>.</p>

<p>Computer science pioneer Edsger Dijkstra's algorithms form the backbone of many computer subroutines, thanks to their elegant efficiency. However, seemingly subtle changes in requirements can lead to these often conceptually simple formulations failing to provide an accurate answer. The replacement algorithms provide the correct answers but are frequently orders of magnitude slower.</p>
<p>A recent breakthrough in combinatorial techniques has shown how these early algorithms can be revived. </p>
<p>Shortest-path problems provide good examples of the sensitivity of an algorithm to the specifics of their requirements. The underpinning for many applications from navigation to chip layout, these problems present a simple, basic proposition: Find the path through a network of directed paths that offers the lowest cost based on the weights applied to each hop. That weighting may reflect distance or delay, properties that are always positive in the physical world.</p>
<p>Problems start when you encounter a similar network where paths can have negative weights. "When you're dealing with the situation when edge weights correspond to cost, negative weights are natural," says Aaron Bernstein, assistant professor of computer science at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ.</p>
<p>In finance, for example, there may be situations in currency or options trading where buying and selling in one sequence is more profitable than taking a different path, and these can be modeled using negative weights as long as the search algorithm is fast enough. But those negative weights can throw Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm for a loop.</p>
<p>The issue lies in the efficient greediness of the algorithm developed in the mid-1950s: It will often remove negative-weight paths from consideration. It processes each vertex in turn and does not return, so the algorithm may not consider whether a high weight combined with one that carries a negative weight might result in a lower cost than a single hop with a low weight.</p>
<p>A revised approach, often known as the Bellman-Ford algorithm, handles the negative-weight connections correctly, but because it relies on the ability to process nodes, it lacks the raw efficiency of Dijkstra's technique, which completes in a time based on the sum of the number of nodes and connections. Bellman-Ford instead needs many more steps: The total is based on the product of the number of nodes and vertices.</p>
<p>Though computer scientists have attempted to find more efficient solutions to the problem using similar combinatorial techniques to those used in these longstanding algorithms, they failed to narrow the computational gap between them by a significant amount. Over the past few decades, greater advances were made by representing the graph as coefficients in a matrix and using the tools of linear algebra. Such techniques have proven successful for a wide range of path-related problems, not just for identifying the shortest route but for applications such as maximizing flow through a network of pipes or transportation routes, as demonstrated in a paper presented at last year's Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS).</p>
<p>Georgia Institute of Technology Ph.D. student Li Chen, working with mathematicians at Switzerland's ETH Zurich, Stanford University, and the University of Toronto, developed a mechanism based on gradient descent, the same core approach as the one used to train neural networks, to progressively move to the best answer for maximizing flow through a network. This algorithm managed to bring the computation time down to almost linear performance.</p>
<p>The downside to recently developed techniques based on optimization is that they are more difficult to implement and understand than traditional combinatorial algorithms. "This type of approach often uses a lot of dynamic algorithms, which tend to be complicated. They involve many moving parts that you have to put together," says Danupon Nanongkai, director and scientific member of the Max Planck Institute for Informatics in Saarbrücken, Germany.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles the negative-weight connections correctly but lacks the raw efficiency of Dijkstra's technique.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Bernstein, Nanongkai, and Christian Wulff-Nilsen, associate professor of computer science at the University of Copenhagen, wanted to see if they could find an efficient combinatorial solution to the single-source, shortest-path problem with negative weights.</p>
<p>The team first turned to an early-1990s paper by Andrew Goldberg and colleagues that had reduced the complexity to the square root of the number of vertices multiplied by the number of nodes by trying to scale the weight values to become positive and so allow the shortest path to be found using Dijkstra's approach. "The original goal was just to improve the Goldberg result by a little bit but, in the end, it turned out that once everything was in place we could go all the way," says Nanongkai.</p>
<p>A long-standing technique for scaling is the use of price functions, though it can be difficult to assign prices efficiently and in a way that does not distort the relationship between weights. The team found an efficient algorithm which worked on a specific type of graph: those with low diameter. That proved to be the key to a bigger breakthrough and one that may help uncover more efficient combinatorial solutions to other problems.</p>
<p>Low-diameter graphs are structures where the paths are short and can be seen as strongly connected to each other. The low-diameter property has been a key component of finding ways to cut graphs into sections so processing can be distributed across multiple computers. Ensuring that strongly connected components are kept on the same machine helps minimize network traffic.</p>
<p>The team found it was possible to divide the input graph into clusters of low-diameter subgraphs, and then to progressively rework the weights using a series of price functions to build a restructured graph that could be processed almost completely using Dijkstra's algorithm. This involved the random removal of paths with negative weights that would enable the source graph to be converted into a directed acyclic graph: one with only forward paths and no loops connecting the strongly connected clusters to each other. This form was selected because it opened the door to tools that would allow the use of the fastest algorithm. A later phase then reintroduces the missing negative-weight edges. The small number of these paths can be processed using the Bellman-Ford algorithm with comparatively little impact on runtime.</p>
<p>Though a form of low-diameter decomposition built for directed graphs proved fundamental to the solution, Bernstein says it was not immediately obvious as the traditional decomposition was developed for undirected graphs. "When we started to look at it, it was unclear what low-diameter decomposition in this context would mean and it didn't occur to us that it could be a relevant notion. It was only because we started working from a different direction and found we were dealing with graphs connected to the low-diameter property that we started to see how it could be used," he says.</p>
<p>The decomposition made it possible to break the price-function calculations into several steps, and do so in an efficient way without risking the distortion that a single-step approach would impose.</p>
<p>"In a sense, what our algorithm is doing is decomposing the graph, solving things with a few negative edge weights, fixing those, and then moving up. It's continually trying to make sure there are few negative edge weights, solving those and then figuring out the next, progressively trying to make things less and less negative," Bernstein adds.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The core algorithm has several elements with a logarithmic dependency on the number of vertices in the graph, each of which represents room for improvement.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Wulff-Nilsen notes, "This progressive improvement is done by changing the edges using price functions several times. So, it's not as if we just find one price point."</p>
<p>The result was an algorithm with near-linear performance, and with slightly better performance on its task compared to the optimization technique of maximum flow presented by Chen at the same FOCS event last year. Both shared the best-paper award at the symposium, and a number of teachers have since incorporated the combinatorial algorithm and colleagues into their classes because of its relative simplicity.</p>
<p>Though the core algorithm is near-linear, it has several elements that have a logarithmic dependency on the number of vertices in the graph, each of which presents room for improvement. Karl Bringmann and Alejandro Cassis of Saarland University teamed up with Nick Fischer of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel and managed to optimize away six of the eight log factors in a paper published in April. Some they regarded as simple, such as changing the order in which elements are presented to the underlying Dijkstra algorithm, but others were "more involved."</p>
<p>In their work, Bringmann and colleagues came up with what they describe as a more direct form of decomposition for their more efficient algorithm, together with a different form of low-diameter decomposition they did not use for this particular problem.</p>
<p>Such treatments could turn out to be as useful for directed graphs as low-diameter decomposition as they have been for work with undirected graphs. "I think people were excited to see that low-diameter decomposition could be used in this way. People have been talking to all of us about using this for other directed-graph problems," Bernstein claims.</p>
<p>Taking the low-diameter decomposition full circle, Bernstein, Nanongkai, and others published a paper in March demonstrating a distributed algorithm for shortest-path calculation. However, finding efficient combinatorial solutions to problems such as flow maximization remains an uphill struggle, and despite their greater complexity and reliance on techniques that call for the manipulation of dynamic data structures, the optimization-based approaches remain key tools for computer science.</p>
<p>Bernstein observes, "The optimization techniques really are the only way we know to solve some problems. Our algorithm showed a combinatorial solution for one problem, but it's still one particular problem. For minimum-cost flow, for example, we don't yet have an idea of how to do it combinatorially."</p>
