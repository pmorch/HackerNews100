<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="blog-page-article">
<h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>
<p>The following is an attempt at highlighting the sources of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">high
astonishment</a>
arising from the implementation of the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Deref.html"><code>std::ops::Deref</code></a> trait on
custom types.</p>
<p>I write this, in part, because I had recently used <code>Deref</code> inappropriately while
at <code>$day_job</code>, due to my lack of a full understanding of how <code>Deref</code> interacts
with the rest of the language. It should go without saying that this was a
confusing experience.</p>
<p>Naturally, the aforementioned mishap will serve as a motivating example
throughout this dive into Rust semantics.</p>
<h2 id="newtypes">Newtypes</h2>
<p>I cannot share the full context surrounding my misuse of <code>Deref</code> (for both
pedagogic and legal reasons) so please understand that my motivating example
won't be well motivated itself.</p>
<p>With that disclaimer out of the way, suppose we're building a library that
provides an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> string type called
<code>AsciiString</code>. A fitting representation of these so-called <em>byte strings</em> would
simply be a plain ol' <code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>However, ASCII characters are limited to the range <code>0..128</code>, and thus not any
value of type <code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code> would be a valid ASCII string. In other words, it's not
a good idea to
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/type-aliases.html">alias</a>
<code>AsciiString</code> to <code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code>; <a href="https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2020/11/01/names-are-not-type-safety/">they are not
interchangeable</a>.</p>
<p>In Rust<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>, it is considered good practice to enforce invariants at the type
level. Thus, the idiomatic course of action would be to use a
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/generics/new_types.html">newtype</a> to
wrap a <code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code> and then statically guarantee that all wrapped byte vectors
represent valid ASCII strings.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust">/// An ASCII-encoded, growable string.
struct AsciiString(Vec<u8>);

impl AsciiString {
    /// Range of valid ASCII bytes.
    const ASCII_RANGE: Range<u8> = 0..128;

    /// Converts a byte vector to an `AsciiString`.
    ///
    /// # Errors
    /// Returns `Err` if any byte in `vec` 
    /// falls outside the range [`Self::ASCII_RANGE`].
    fn from_ascii(vec: Vec<u8>) -&gt; Result<self, asciierror=""> {
        if vec
            .iter()
            .all(|b| Self::ASCII_RANGE.contains(b))
        {
            Ok(Self(vec))
        } else {
            Err(AsciiError)
        }
    }
}
</self,></u8></u8></u8></code></pre>
<h2 id="explicit-conversion">Explicit conversion</h2>
<p>UTF-8 is backward compatible with ASCII. This means that we can freely
reinterpret any well-constructed <code>AsciiString</code> value to a <code>str</code> value. What we
stand to gain from this is compatibility with code written with UTF-8 strings in
mind.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust">impl AsciiString {
    fn as_str(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;str {
        debug_assert!(str::from_utf8(&amp;self.0).is_ok());

        // SAFETY: self.0 is ASCII-encoded, 
        // and ASCII is a subset of UTF-8
        unsafe { str::from_utf8_unchecked(&amp;self.0) }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Two statements in, and the unspeakable keyword has already been uttered; I'm
feeling pretty <a href="https://twitter.com/ManishEarth/status/901269205718155264">tall</a>
today and the temptation is frankly irresistible. Obviously, any bug surrounding
the construction of <code>AsciiString</code> values implies memory unsafely outside <code>debug</code>
mode.</p>
<p>Hold on a second. Both
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/str/fn.from_utf8.html">std::str::from_utf8</a> and
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/str/fn.from_utf8_unchecked.html">std::str::from_utf8_unchecked</a>
take in a <code>&amp;[u8]</code> as an argument, while <code>&amp;self.0</code> is of type <code>&amp;Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code>; there
is definitely some kind of implicit coercion going on here. Is Rust not so
strongly typed after all?</p>
<h2 id="enter-deref">Enter <code>Deref</code></h2>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust">pub trait Deref {
    type Target: ?Sized;

    fn deref(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;Self::Target;
}
</code></pre>
<p>We seem to have inadvertently run into <code>Deref</code> before I even got the chance to
introduce it properly. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bjk26RwjyU">simple</a>
explanation of why <code>&amp;Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code> was "coerced" to <code>&amp;[u8]</code> is that <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#impl-Deref-for-Vec%3CT,+A%3E">implements</a>
<code>Deref&lt;Target = [T]&gt;</code>. In short, the compiler conceptually transformed the
expression <code>str::from_utf8(&amp;self.0)</code> into something akin to:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust">str::from_utf8(<vec<u8> as Deref&gt;::deref(&amp;self.0))
</vec<u8></code></pre>
<p>This mechanism at play here is called <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Deref.html#more-on-deref-coercion">Deref
Coercion</a>,
and is defined by the interaction between two distinct mechanisms defined by The
Rust Reference: <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/reference/expressions/method-call-expr.html">Method
Resolution</a>
and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/type-coercions.html">Type
Coercion</a>. Having
already dropped so much jargon, I refrain from uncovering any gory details for
now.</p>
<h2 id="clean-codetm">Clean Code™</h2>
<p>For all practical purposes, <code>AsciiString:as_str</code> works perfectly as a sure and
simple way to convert any <code>&amp;AsciiString</code> reference to a <code>&amp;str</code>. However, it will
mean one would have to manually add <code>.as_str()</code> every time a conversion is
needed.</p>
<p>For dubious reasons involving "clean code" we shall implement <code>Deref&lt;Target = str&gt;</code> for <code>AsciiString</code>: the compiler will from now on call <code>.as_str()</code> on our
behalf.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust">impl Deref for AsciiString {
    type Target = str;

    fn deref(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;Self::Target {
        self.as_str()
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="idiomatic-codetm">Idiomatic Code™</h2>
<p>For those who care not for aesthetics when it comes to computer programs — a
vulgar but arguably rational position — I shall appeal to Rust
idioms<sup><a href="#3">2</a></sup>. Chapter 5 of the Rust API Guidelines contains a recommendation
titled
<a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/predictability.html#only-smart-pointers-implement-deref-and-derefmut-c-deref">C-DEREF</a>
which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Deref traits are used implicitly by the compiler in many circumstances,
and interact with method resolution. The relevant rules are designed
specifically to accommodate smart pointers, and so the traits should be used
only for that purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is <code>AsciiString</code> a smart pointer? What is a smart pointer anyway? That is a
<a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/t/what-are-smart-pointers/67361">debate</a> I'm
uninterested in exploring here. However, the authors of the Rust API Guidelines
go on to give examples of smart pointers in the Standard Library:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>String</code> as a smart pointer to <code>str</code></li>
<li><code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Cow&lt;'a, T&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>On these grounds, I claim that <code>AsciiString</code> ought to be considered a smart
pointer to <code>str</code>. Note that the idea that <code>String</code> is a smart pointer is itself
often contested, since <code>String</code> is not generic over the data it points to the
way <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> and friends are.</p>
<h2 id="to-my-astonishment">To my astonishment</h2>
<p>Note that <code>AsciiString</code> inherits the implementation of <code>Index&lt;Range&lt;usize&gt;&gt;</code>
from <code>str</code>. We get this as a side effect of implementing <code>Deref</code> and it allows
us to borrow string slices from an <code>AsciiString</code><sup><a href="#4">3</a></sup>.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust">let data = vec![b'A', b'B', b'C'];
let ascii = AsciiString::from_ascii(data).unwrap();
assert_eq!(&amp;ascii[1..3], "BC");
</code></pre>
<p>Up until now, we have been relatively well-behaved rustaceans. But where is the
fun in that? One cannot be writing production-ready code all the time, for that
is a sure path to madness.</p>
<p>Let's allow for <code>AsciiString</code> to be indexed using floating-point numbers;
precisely because we can.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust">impl Index<range<f64>&gt; for AsciiString {
    type Output = str;

    /// Returns an ASCII string slice by rounding 
    /// the given floating-point indices in `index`.
    fn index(&amp;self, index: Range<f64>) -&gt; &amp;Self::Output {
        /// Returns the integer nearest 
        /// to the absolute value of `float`.
        fn nearest_index(float: f64) -&gt; usize {
            float.abs().round() as usize
        }

        let start = nearest_index(index.start);
        let end = nearest_index(index.end);
        let string = self.as_str();

        &amp;string[start..end]
    }
}
</f64></range<f64></code></pre>
<p>You may be wondering what happens when your index is exactly halfway between two
integers. The answer is that <code>f64::round</code> will round <em>away from</em> <code>0.0</code>, thus
<code>0.5</code> will be rounded to <code>1</code>. At this point, we might as well have had <code>Index</code>
toss a coin to resolve this ambiguity.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust">let data = vec![b'A', b'B', b'C'];
let ascii = AsciiString::from_ascii(data).unwrap();
assert_eq!(&amp;ascii[1.5_f64..3_f64], "BC");
</code></pre>
<p>We finally arrived at the part which surprised me and served as the motivation
for all that I wrote before and after this point: we <strong>no longer inherit</strong>
<code>Index&lt;Range&lt;usize&gt;&gt;</code> <strong>from</strong> <code>str</code>. The previous version of the above code
block doesn't compile anymore:</p>
<pre data-lang="console"><code data-lang="console">error[E0308]: mismatched types
  --&gt; src/main.rs:69:23
   |
69 |     assert_eq!(&amp;ascii[1..3], "BC");
   |                       ^^^^ expected `Range<f64>`, 
   |                            found `Range&lt;{integer}&gt;`
   |
   = note: expected struct `std::ops::Range<f64>`
              found struct `std::ops::Range&lt;{integer}&gt;`
</f64></f64></code></pre>
<p>To me, this was incredibly confusing because <code>Index</code> is generic over its <code>Idx</code>
type, which means it's perfectly valid to have multiple implementations of
<code>Index&lt;Idx&gt;</code> for different <code>Idx</code> types<sup><a href="#5">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Somehow, the compiler can no longer find the implementation of <code>Index&lt;usize&gt;</code> on
<code>&amp;str</code>. If you're like me, it's not at all obvious how that came to be. To
better understand all of this, we dig deeper into exactly how the compiler
resolves methods in the presence of a <code>Deref</code> implementation.</p>
<h2 id="nitty-gritty-details">Nitty-gritty details</h2>
<p><em>Everything I describe below is limited to commit
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/6bacf5a54468f8db33b6077405652f0ab0059174">6bacf5a</a>
of the Rust project, i.e. Rust 1.69.0</em>.</p>
<p>Method lookup in <code>rustc</code> is divided into two phases:
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/6bacf5a/compiler/rustc_hir_typeck/src/method/probe.rs" title="probe">probe</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/6bacf5a54468f8db33b6077405652f0ab0059174/compiler/rustc_hir_typeck/src/method/confirm.rs">confirm</a>. As
the <a href="https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/method-lookup.html">Rust Compiler Development
Guide</a> explains,
<code>probe</code> is concerned with finding the callee method while <code>confirm</code> solves for
unknown type variables.</p>
<p>During the <code>probe</code> phase, the compiler would first perform a "Deref-loop":
essentially repeated dereferencing of the receiver type, i.e. <code>AsciiString</code>. In
our particular case, this would yield two <em>steps</em>: <code>AsciiString</code> and <code>[u8]</code>.</p>
<p>Then, the compiler would <em>assemble</em> a list of <em>candidates</em> from each step. These
candidate methods are subsequently searched for one that fits the reliever
type. Up until this point, it seems that <code>rustc</code> should've been able to find the
<code>index</code> method from the <code>Index&lt;Range&lt;usize&gt;&gt;</code> implementation on <code>[u8]</code> because
the search always includes Deref targets.</p>
<p>The issue, it turns out, is that method search does not check method parameter
types against argument types. Rather, it only checks for method names and
where-clauses such as <code>T: Trait</code>. Types are only resolved in the <code>confirm</code> phase,
at which point <code>rustc</code> would have already <em>picked</em> its method.</p>
<p>But why is method lookup in <code>rustc</code> split into two phases? The answer lies in
the cacheability of the <em>picks</em> provided by the <code>probe</code> phase. In other words,
<code>rustc</code> developers wished to reuse <code>probe</code> search results of identical methods,
hence why <code>probe</code> cannot depend on inferred types local to one particular call
site. I would wager that this was most likely done to address performance
issues.</p>
<p>If you can spot any inaccuracies in the above description, please don't shy away
from correcting me via email. I would appreciate it, as I am by no means a
<code>rustc</code> developer<sup><a href="#6">5</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>
<p>Moral of the story: don't implement <code>Deref</code> kids!</p>
<p>On a more serious note, if one does implement <code>Deref&lt;Target = U&gt;</code> on a type <code>T</code>,
<em>and</em> it proved necessary to implement a generic trait <code>Trait&lt;S&gt;</code> on <code>T</code>. Then
one should ensure that the implementations of <code>Trait&lt;S&gt;</code> for different
parameters <code>S</code> <strong>are not scattered across <code>T</code> and <code>U</code></strong>.</p>
<p>Put simply, either <code>T</code> or <code>U</code> should host all existing <code>Trait&lt;S&gt;</code>
implementations. Note that the preceding "or" is <em>inclusive</em>, meaning that both
<code>T</code> and <code>U</code> can host some <code>Trait&lt;S&gt;</code> implementations, as long as they both host
<em>all of them</em>.</p>

   <p>TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. — Chemical manufacturer 3M Co. will pay at least $10.3 billion to settle lawsuits over contamination of many U.S. public drinking water systems with potentially harmful compounds used in firefighting foam and a host of consumer products, the company said Thursday.</p>   <p>The deal would compensate water providers for pollution with per- and polyfluorinated substances, known collectively as PFAS — a broad class of chemicals used in nonstick, water- and grease-resistant products such as clothing and cookware.</p>   <p>Described as "forever chemicals" because they don't degrade naturally in the environment, PFAS have been linked to a variety of health problems, including liver and immune-system damage and some cancers.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1183922969" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>The compounds have been detected at varying levels in drinking water around the nation. The Environmental Protection Agency in March proposed strict limits on two common types, PFOA and PFOS, and said it wanted to regulate four others. Water providers would be responsible for monitoring their systems for the chemicals.</p>   <p>The agreement would settle a case that was scheduled for trial earlier this month involving a claim by Stuart, Florida, one of about 300 communities that have filed similar suits against companies that produced firefighting foam or the PFAS it contained.</p>   
   <p>3M chairman Mike Roman said the deal was "an important step forward" that builds on the company's decision in 2020 to phase out PFOA and PFOS and its investments in "state-of-the-art water filtration technology in our chemical manufacturing operations." The company, based in St. Paul, Minnesota, will halt all PFAS production by the end of 2025, he said.</p>   <p>The settlement will be paid over 13 years and could reach as high as $12.5 billion, depending on how many public water systems detect PFAS during testing that EPA has required in the next three years, said Dallas-based attorney Scott Summy, one of the lead attorneys for those suing 3M and other manufacturers.</p>   <p>The payment will help cover costs of filtering PFAS from systems where it's been detected and testing others, he said.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1183923039" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>"The result is that millions of Americans will have healthier lives without PFAS in their drinking water," Summy said.</p>   <p>Earlier this month, three other companies — DuPont de Nemours Inc. and spinoffs Chemours Co. and Corteva Inc. — reached a $1.18 billion deal to resolve PFAS complaints by about 300 drinking water providers. A number of states, airports, firefighter training facilities and private well owners also have sued.</p>   <p>The cases are pending in U.S. District Court in Charleston, South Carolina, where Judge Richard Gergel is overseeing thousands of complaints alleging PFAS damages. A trial of a complaint by the city of Stuart, Florida, had been scheduled to begin this month but was delayed to allow time for additional settlement negotiations.</p>   
   <p>Most of the lawsuits have stemmed from firefighter training exercises at airports, military bases and other sites around the U.S. that repeatedly used foams laced with high concentrations of PFAS, Summy said.</p>   <p>The 3M settlement is subject to court approval, he said.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1183923095" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>3M's website says the company helped the U.S. Navy develop foams containing PFAS chemicals in the 1960s.</p>   <p>"This was an important and life-saving tool that helped combat dangerous fires, like those caused by jet fuel," the company said.</p>   <p>3M said its participation in the settlement "is not an admission of liability" and said if it was rejected in court, "3M is prepared to continue to defend itself."</p>   <p>The cost of cleansing PFAS from U.S. water systems eventually could go much higher than the sums agreed to in the settlements, Summy acknowledged.</p>   <p>"I'm not sure anyone knows what that ultimate number will be," he said. "But I do think this is going to make a huge dent in that cost ... and you don't have to litigate for the next decade or longer."</p>

<p>At least 45% of the nation's tap water could be contaminated with at least one form of PFAS known as "forever chemicals," according to a <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/tap-water-study-detects-pfas-forever-chemicals-across-us" target="_blank">newly released study</a> by the U.S. Geological Survey.
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/health-effects/overview.html#:~:text=PFAS%20are%20man%2Dmade%20chemicals,grease%2C%20water%2C%20and%20oil." target="_blank">man-made chemicals</a> — of which there are thousands — are found in all sorts of places, from nonstick cookware to stain-resistant carpets to contaminated sources of food and water. They break down very slowly, building up in people, animals and the environment over time.
</p>
<p>Research has linked exposure to certain PFAS to adverse <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pfas/our-current-understanding-human-health-and-environmental-risks-pfas" target="_blank">health effects in humans</a>, from an increased risk of certain cancers, increased obesity and high cholesterol risk, decreased fertility and developmental effects like low birth weight in children.
</p>
<p>"This USGS study can help members of the public to understand their risk of exposure and inform policy and management decisions regarding testing and treatment options for drinking water," Kelly Smalling, a USGS research chemist who is the lead author of the new study released Wednesday, told NPR over email.
</p>
<p>This study is the first to compare PFAS in tap water from both public and private supplies on a broad scale throughout the country, Smalling said.

<p>USGS tested for 32 individual PFAS compounds, and <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/tap-water-study-detects-pfas-forever-chemicals-across-us" target="_blank">said in a release</a> that the EPA's recent advisories for PFOS and PFOA "were exceeded in every sample in which they were detected in this study."
</p>
<p>While the USGS — which describes itself as an unbiased and impartial science organization — doesn't offer policy recommendations in its report, Smalling points to several key takeaways.
</p>
<p>For one, she said, it highlights the importance of collecting PFAS data from private wells, which are monitored at homeowners' discretion and not regulated by the EPA the way that public sources are.
</p>
<p>It also has implications for the general population.
</p>
<h3>What the study found</h3>

<p>Most state and federal monitoring programs typically measure exposure to PFAS and other pollutants at the water treatment plants or groundwater wells that supply them, Smalling said. Her team took a different approach.
</p>
<p>"The USGS study specifically focused on collecting water directly from a homeowners tap where exposure actually occurs," she explained.
</p>
<p>Between 2016 and 2021, scientists collected samples from 716 residences, businesses and drinking-water treatment plants from a range of protected, rural and urban areas across the U.S.
</p>
<p>Of those, 447 rely on public supplies and 269 on private wells. The researchers found that PFAS concentrations were similar between the two.
</p>
<p>Smalling said they observed the chemicals more frequently in samples collected near urban areas and potential PFAS sources like airports and wastewater treatment plants, which is in line with previous research.
</p>
<p>USGS scientists estimate there's a 75% chance that PFAS will be found in urban areas and a 25% chance in rural areas. And the study suggests that exposure may be more common in certain geographical regions.
</p>
<p>"Results from this study indicate potential hotspots include the Great Plains, Great Lakes, Eastern Seaboard, and Central/Southern California regions," Smalling said.
</p>
<p>The study says its findings support the need for further assessments of the health risks of PFAS both as a class and in combination with other contaminants, "particularly in unmonitored private-wells where information is limited or not available."
</p>
<h3>What can be done</h3>

<p>Smalling says that USGS tap water <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/geonarrative.usgs.gov/drinkingwaterinvestigations/__;!!Iwwt!UFDtuzoLoouXCtmxb5jMa3V4ipNSLCJqR-1zAdp6wtNGulPFzXiTp-KUMNPfbPs5LuEEsr6pZSNr0g$" target="_blank">research is continuing</a>, with an emphasis on private well users and rural communities.
</p>
<p>"If the average American is worried about the quality of their drinking water, they can use this and other studies to get informed, evaluate their own [personal] risk and reach out to their local health officials about testing or treatment," she added.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.epa.gov/pfas/meaningful-and-achievable-steps-you-can-take-reduce-your-risk" target="_blank">The EPA recommends</a> finding out whether PFAS chemicals are in your drinking water, either by calling your local water utility or conducting regular well testing, depending on your source. Then you can compare those numbers to your state's standards for safe levels of PFAS in drinking water (or those in the<b> </b>EPA advisories).
</p>
<p>If you're concerned, the EPA recommends contacting your state environmental protection agency or health department and your local water utility to find out what actions they suggest.
</p>
<p>You could also install <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sciencematters/reducing-pfas-drinking-water-treatment-technologies" target="_blank">specific kinds of water filters</a> that are certified to lower the levels of PFAS in water, using technologies like activated carbon treatment and reverse osmosis.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are federal efforts underway to limit forever chemicals in drinking water.
</p>
<p>In March, the EPA proposed the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/03/14/1163341982/epa-forever-chemicals-drinking-water" target="_blank">first federal drinking water limits</a> on six forms of PFAS, which it estimates could reduce PFAS exposure for nearly 100 million Americans.
</p>
<p>The proposed regulations would require water systems to do costly testing and mitigation work and be transparent with their results, as <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/03/14/1163497111/new-epa-regulations-target-pfas-in-drinking-water" target="_blank">WBUR's Gabrielle Emanuel told NPR</a> at the time.
</p>
<p>And they don't cover the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/ehs/water/private-wells/index.html" target="_blank">1 in 8 Americans</a> who get their water from private wells and would generally be responsible for their own testing and filtration, she added.
</p>
<p>Plus, many activists and scientists would like to see regulations that cover more types of PFAS and limit them at the source, rather than clean it them<b> </b>up after the fact.
</p><p>The agency can make changes to its proposal based on public comments before issuing a final rule, which it aims to do by the end of the year.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="doc"><h2 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction" title="introduction"><i></i></a>Introduction</h2><p>These are my notes from experimenting with building Wayland bits on OpenBSD during g2k23 in Tallinn… Thanks to the OpenBSD foundation for organizing this event.</p><p>This is still far from a complete running system as there are many issues on the road, but it’s a good start and it shows that it’s definatly not impossible to get Wayland running on OpenBSD.</p><h3 id="disclaimers"><a href="#disclaimers" title="disclaimers"><i></i></a>Disclaimers</h3><ul>
<li>
<p>I don’t know much about Wayland internals, I’m discovering that on the way, so some stuff here may look naive or totally wrong to experimented Wayland developers…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m not discussing here on why Wayland ? You may find some answers in <a href="https://homepages.laas.fr/matthieu/talks/app-sec-article.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this paper</a> I wrote in 2017 (in french).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The build instructions below will probably break your system. Use a separate machine for this</p>
</li>
</ul><h2 id="general-ideas"><a href="#general-ideas" title="general-ideas"><i></i></a>General ideas</h2><ul>
<li>I’m using the wlroots library and will focus on compositors (sway, tinywl+…) and applications that use it
<ul>
<li>Gnome (GTK+) based or Qt-based application will wait until someone else builds Wayland support for those toolkits on OpenBSD</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The output path is more or less ready with the DRI and Mesa porting efforts (mostly jsg and kettenis)
<ul>
<li>jsg’s github fork of mesa is being used to build it using meson. This may not be needed, but I haven’t checked</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>“Seat” management is going to be minimal, as OpenBSD doesn’t support this:
<ul>
<li>seatd and libseat provide support for non-systemd based systems. A basic port to OpenBSD/wscons is needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Input is more complex to get working since Wayland applications expect Linux input model with udev, evdev and libinput.
<ul>
<li>udev is used to probe available device and handle hot-plugging on Linux. OpenBSD doesn’t have it and the current state of hotplugd(8) doesn’t make it possible to really emulate udev. There is a <code>libudev-openbsd</code> port already that can be used.</li>
<li>evdev is the input event layer of the Linux kernel, similar to wscons_events in OpenBSD. It’s mostly hidden by libinput, but event name translation need the libevdev library for some reason.</li>
<li>libinput is the library that permits reading evdev events from the Linux kernel and  handling many of the higher level interpretation of the events (getting the keyboard mapping, mouse gestures or multi-touch)… It also handles device configuration. mpi did a simple libinput port back in 2015, and rsadowski improved it a bit in 2022. More work is needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p>All this was done on the top of <a href="https://md.tetaneutral.net/xenoports" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xenoports</a>.

            <section>
                <p>The first post on this personal blog dates <a href="https://davidgomes.com/not-space-invaders-ludum-dare-25/">back to December 2012</a>. It’s been more than a decade! As with many others, I’ve always struggled with how to setup my personal website. It is just too enticing to build it “from scratch”, which usually means using a static site generator. As such, my website has been powered by <a href="https://gohugo.io/?ref=davidgomes.com">Hugo</a> at some point, and before that by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/?ref=davidgomes.com">Jekyll</a>. I’ve dabbled with a few other things as well, including building it <strong><strong><strong><strong>entirely</strong></strong></strong></strong> from scratch in raw HTML/CSS. Suffice it to say, I wasn’t writing a lot of blog posts back then as I was too busy with getting the website to work properly across a myriad of devices and browser technologies.</p><p>In 2019, I just gave all of this up and adopted <a href="https://ghost.org/?ref=davidgomes.com">Ghost</a>. And to embarrass myself further, I’m not even self hosting it from a Raspberry Pi or a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeServer?ref=davidgomes.com">home server</a>. I actually <em>pay</em> Ghost roughly 200 euros per year for them to manage everything for me! I’ve been a happy customer for four years, which is much longer than any previous iteration of my personal website ever lasted.</p><h3 id="how-does-ghost-work-and-is-it-actually-%E2%80%9Cperfect%E2%80%9D">How does Ghost work? And is it actually “perfect”?</h3><p>When it comes to writing new blog posts, it’s really straightforward. I just write them in <a href="https://www.notion.so/?ref=davidgomes.com">Notion</a>, and then I copy-paste them into the Ghost editor and hit “Publish”. I tried using the native editor a few times, and it is pretty decent, but Notion’s is simply better (plus, Notion works on mobile which is a plus for me).</p><p>I have a custom theme which is a <a href="https://github.com/davidgomes/my-gasper-fork?ref=davidgomes.com">fork of one of their default themes</a>, and every now and then I have to hack some CSS together to fix some bugs. For some reason, the theme can only be compiled with an ancient version of npm and the code is really messy, so at some point I won’t be able to maintain it any longer. Moreover, images don’t work very well with my theme, so I might have a look at Ghost’s <a href="https://ghost.org/themes/?ref=davidgomes.com">marketplace</a> soon to purchase a better theme.</p><p>Besides this, I don’t have many other interactions with Ghost’s admin panel. I also use it to edit my non-blog pages, and that’s about it!</p><h3 id="and-what-about-analytics">And what about analytics?</h3><p>For many years, I was using Google Analytics to track how many people visited my website over time, as well as where they were coming from. The UI/UX for the Google Analytics dashboard is really not very good, and I definitely have some concerns over its privacy implications. So, I recently decided to adopt a proper analytics service called “<a href="https://usefathom.com/?ref=davidgomes.com">Fathom</a>”.</p><p>I first heard about Fathom because they’re a SingleStoreDB customer, but I’ve been following <a href="https://twitter.com/JackEllis?ref=davidgomes.com">Jack Ellis</a> (co-founder &amp; CTO of Fathom) on Twitter for a while now too. From reading his tweets over time, it seemed to me like he’s obsessed with his customers and building a great product for them. But when I actually tried Fathom for the first time, I was mesmerized — the onboarding experience is <em>phenomenal</em>. The time it took from signing up to having access to its dashboard with a full import of my Google Analytics history was under 8 minutes.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><center><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'm out of words. I just signed up for <a href="https://twitter.com/usefathom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=davidgomes.com">@usefathom</a>, added their code snippet to my website and went through their GA Importer. I figured this process would be easier and better than migrating to GA4. Guess what?</p>— David Gomes (@davidrfgomes) <a href="https://twitter.com/davidrfgomes/status/1676241780969205761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=davidgomes.com">July 4, 2023</a></blockquote> </center><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The UI/UX is really nice, and exploring all the data is very easy. Furthermore, they’re extremely <a href="https://usefathom.com/privacy-focused-web-analytics?ref=davidgomes.com">privacy-focused</a>, and no cookies are used at all! Here's a sneak peek into the Fathom dashboard UI:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><img alt="My view of the Fathom dashboard" src="https://davidgomes.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/Screenshot-from-2023-07-09-22-15-21.png"><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>So, all in all, I’m paying almost 400 euros per year to host a personal blog. That’s quite a lot, but I see it as an incentive to get me to write my more, so it’s all good.</p><p>Feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/davidrfgomes?ref=davidgomes.com">reach out on Twitter</a>!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
                        <p>All engineers are good writers… of code. But I believe that in order to become better engineer–you should improve your writing skills.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>From the dawn of times, people were writing. We have written using symbols, like in Ancient Egypt. And we have written using letters, like in Renaissance times. And all of us, got at-least one writing assignment in school, without the “Why?” And yet, today writing is so underrated, that most people want to avoid it. But the truth is–you will have to write. Comments, documentation, design documents, presentations. Whether you like it or not. So why not become better at it?</p>
<h2 id="why-write">Why write?</h2>
<h3 id="writing-is-a-way-to-organize-your-brain">Writing is a way to organize your brain</h3>
<p>For some reason, we humans, think that knowledge equals reading stuff. I’ve read a starting guide for Rust, so now I know this topic. I’ve read a book about how TCP/IP works–so now I know this stuff. But it’s not true. If it was true, we’d all be super-stars.</p>
<p>What helps us cement our knowledge–is writing. That’s why I believe in <strong>writing</strong> code, as opposed to copying code snippets. Because when you type it–you cement that knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="writing-is-a-way-to-learn-something">Writing is a way to learn something</h3>
<p>If you want to learn a new topic–write about it. When I want to learn a new programming language, I write a short program using that programming language. When I want to understand how something works–I write an article in this blog about it.</p>
<p>Real writing, where you try to dig the truth, will require you to try and experiment. I’ve learned more by writing articles on this blog, than by reading programming books.</p>
<h3 id="writing-helps-you-identify-mistakes">Writing helps you identify mistakes</h3>
<p>How many times we are asked to prepare a design document, while we think to ourselves “What for? The design is so simple, I can hold it in my head easily.” This is a big misconception, we all fall for. If we would actually write the design document, we would have identified so much problems with our “simple” design. Things like–inconsistencies, missing details, or simply “lazy” thinking our brain did, which in reality make to sense.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-write-more">How to write more?</h2>
<p>Remember–reading is a habit, writing is a skill. And in order to prefect your skill, you need to write more. One simple way to write more–is to approach design reviews in a different way. Instead of hating them, and doing them like a homework assignment, try to approach them with enthusiasm. Each time you write a design review, try to improve something. Make it shorter–without missing the point. Make it longer–in order to cover more use-cases.</p>
<p>Writing design reviews, and documentations–at your workplace–is an easy way to get into writing. You will have to do it anyway, so why not improve while writing? However, if you want to improve your writing further, outside your workplace, consider starting a blog. If blog is intimidating for you, consider answering question on Stackoverflow–but focus on providing textual content, rather than copy-pasting code snippets.</p>
<p>One last advice–abolish the copy-paste. So many developers, whom I mentored, simply copy-paste everything. Code snippets, function declarations, etc. I know how to initialize a git repository, because I do it by hand every time. Most people simply copy the instructions from Github or Google. And if you are scared about being unproductive–remember that you are not judged by how much code you write, or how fast you complete the assignment.</p>
<hr>
<p>Writing is unavoidable. Whether you like it or not, if you want to become a 10x engineer, you will have to write. Write documentations, write design reviews, write presentations. The sooner you get better in writing, the faster you will become a better engineer.</p>

</pre></div><p>There's a few extra steps we'll ignore, but the main steps are:</p><ol><li><p>If we're done, return the result.</p></li><li><p>Otherwise, choose a node to explore.</p></li><li><p>Derive new nodes (ie. successors) from the node we picked.</p></li><li><p><code>recur</code> back to the beginning and try again.</p></li></ol><p>That's basically it. The only real magic is deciding where to explore. Usually, you want to be "greedy" and just explore closest to your goal, but if you're too greedy, then you might get stuck with no way to continue to greedily move forward.</p><p><img alt="Mario stuck in a location where he needs to backtrack to continue." src="https://blog.phronemophobic.com/mairio/stuck.png"></p><p>In this scenario, you need to backtrack to a previous state that does allow you to progress. The node is chosen using the <code>with-lookback</code> function:</p><div><pre><span>(</span><span>when-let</span> <span>[</span><span>[</span><span>node</span> <span>dist</span><span>]</span>
           <span>(</span><span>with-lookback</span> <span>queue</span> <span>(</span><span>-&gt;coord</span> <span>1</span> <span>0</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>]</span>
  <span>...</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div><p>The <code>with-lookback</code> function picks a random distance between 0 and <code>(-&gt;coord 1 0 0)</code> , and picks the "best" exploration so far that is at least that many units away from the farthest exploration. What distance does <code>(-&gt;coord 1 0 0)</code> represent? I won't cover too much about Super Mario Bros' coordinate system, but <code>(-&gt;coord 1 0 0)</code> translates to exactly one screen's distance. Essentially, our algorithm can backtrack up to one screen from our furthest exploration.</p><p>Revisiting the levels the AI could not complete (ie. 4-4, 7-4, and 8-4). All of these levels have a maze mechanic where if you go the wrong route, then you will be transported back 4 screens. Since getting transported 4 screens back is beyond the horizon of our backtracking, there's no way our algorithm will ever complete these levels unless they get lucky and choose the correct path on the first try.<sup><a href="#footnote-1" name="footnote-ref-1" title="They were not so lucky.">1</a></sup></p><p>Here's what the process looks like. Below is the sequence of exploring using our solver. You can see each alternate reality explored and how the solver slowly progresses towards the end of the level. It takes a while for Mario to figure out he has to jump up onto each ledge and over the goomba, but he eventually figures it out and proceeds onto the next obstacle.</p><p>So yea. The solver is relatively straightforward. Randomly press buttons until you make it to the end of the level. If you get stuck, use save states to backtrack.</p><p>It's not super efficient, but it usually doesn't take too long to "solve" a level and it's kinda fun to watch it go. For reference, it takes about two minutes to solve level 1-1. Some of the platforming levels take a bit longer. The two water levels (ie. 2-2, 7-2) have the same layout and take quite a while to solve. Our AI is not a good swimmer.</p><h2 id="Successors">Successors</h2><p>Emulating the next state from our current step is pretty straightforward. We generate all combinations of pressing or not pressing the A and B buttons along with all the combinations of pressing left, right, or no direction. For each particular combination, we pick a random number of frames in the range 1-60 (up to one second) to hold this configuration and then simulate the result. It's important for our successor function to generate button presses for several frames because a common platforming action is long jumping (ie. holding the jump button for a full jump). If successor states were generated for each frame, then the common action of holding the jump button for a few seconds is extremely unlikely.</p><p>While it's possible for Mario to enter a pipe by pressing down, we ignore that for our purposes. I'm not sure the up button has any use in Super Mario Bros so we also ignore that button when generating successor states.</p><p>Below is the code for generating the successor states with some debug code elided for brevity.</p><div><pre><span>(</span><span>def</span> <span>buttons</span>

The value is negated because <code>dist</code> should decrease as we get closer to our goal.</p></li><li><p><code>ypos</code>: Mario's vertical position. Since it's easier for Mario to fall than to climb, we prefer exploring states where Mario is higher up. There are scenarios where this heuristic could get us stuck, but it didn't seem to be a problem for the levels we explored. Overall, this heuristic was very helpful for making it through the platforming levels with many bottomless pits. This value is not negated because it's already measured from the top of the screen and decreases as it "improves".</p></li><li><p><code>(- speed)</code>: Mario's absolute horizontal speed. We prefer fast Mario over slow Mario. Negated because <code>dist</code> should decrease as we get closer to our goal.</p></li><li><p><code>(count inputs)</code>: This is the total number of different steps we've taken in our current path. We penalize longer paths.</p></li></ol><h2 id="Levels">Levels</h2><p>Here are the completed levels.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://retrocoding.net/the-90s-developer-starter-pack">https://retrocoding.net/the-90s-developer-starter-pack</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36658941">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content-parent"><p>I recently found a 386 emulator called 86Box, a fork of the earlier version of PCEm. Because I'm a real programmer™, I build the <code>master</code> branch from its Git source on a macOS Ventura. How I build it from sources will be the subject of a new article.</p>
<h2 id="heading-building-the-hardware-specifications">Building The Hardware Specifications</h2>
<p>86Box supports a breadth of selection of combinations of PC hardware components in the 90s. A real gold mine for a person like me who lives in a developing country with restricted access to old hardware. I set a goal to replicate the experience of installing a fresh Windows 95 PC from hardware available around 1990-1995. I'll limit it to something typical for developers on 95s to run on their medium-powered PC, which may have a few esoteric components. I remember my late father having AMD Am486 with 8MB of RAM. So I'll use that as a frame of reference. Also, I've found an article <a target="_blank" href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1995-11-03-9511030044-story.html">about buyers' guides from the Chicago Tribune explaining the spec for the holiday season in 1995</a>.</p>
<p>After mucking around the settings, these are the components that I decided to have.</p>
<h2 id="heading-cpu">CPU</h2>
<p>I'll go with <strong>AMD Am486DX4 with 100 MHz</strong> Speed with PGA 168 socket. This is how it originally looked like</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1667642338455/_lMQJWFx8.jpg?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt="AMD Am486DX4 100MHz"></p>
<p>There's "Designed for Windows 95" imprinted on the chip itself. We're going to a good start.  This chip is Intel 486 compatible. I didn't go to Pentium or Pentium Pro because I wanted pure, unextended, intel 486 instruction sets with no Pentium Pro extensions like <code>CMOVNS</code>, which I've written about in my previous posts. </p>
<h2 id="heading-motherboard">Motherboard</h2>
<p>ASUS PVI-486SP3C with SiS 496 as the Chipset. Without further ADO, please look at this beauty.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1667642689155/xRlenge2K.jpg?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt="ASUS PVI-486SP3C"></p>
<p>As depicted in the picture above, this motherboard featured a PGA168 socket. With both SIS 496 as the Northbridge chip and SIS 497 as the Southbridge chip. This features these I/O:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dual-channel IDE.</li>
<li>1 Floppy Disk Interface.</li>
<li>3 PIC slots.</li>
<li>4 ISA slots, with one of them being a VLB slot (that extension is not an AGP slot, it didn't exist back then)</li>
<li>One parallel, two serial ports, and 1 PS/2 port.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="heading-ram-and-disks">RAM and Disks</h2>
<p>There are two EDO-RAM over there, which I'll fill with a whopping 16 MB of RAM, which is 4 times the minimum requirement for Windows 95. As for disk, we'll fill all floppy disk controllers with 2.88 MB Drives. On the IDE slot, we'll put a 2GB disk drive.</p>
<p>We'll utilise ZIP drives and CD-ROM. I'll not use IDE for these. Like a grown-up, let's use SCSI for both ZIP and CD ROM drives.</p>
<h2 id="heading-components-and-accessories">Components and Accessories</h2>
<p>I'll start with the graphics card. Because we were in 1994, and we have a VLB slot, let's use that. We're going to use the S3 Vision964 VLB Version.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1667644946189/qrpXhIgT_.jpeg?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt="Elsa Winner S3 Vision 964 Card"></p>
<p>This card is an accelerated card which allows us to decode MPEG-1 without any additional accelerator cards.</p>
<p>The next obvious accessory is the sound card. We're not going crazy this time. Let's use good ol' Sound Blaster 16-bit and fill one more of our ISA slots.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1667645205759/ijBrWahzA.jpg?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt="Sound Blaster 16 bit"></p>
<p>As we're going to use SCSI, we're going to use BusLogic PCI BT-958D for our SCSI controller, which will drive both ZIP Drive and CD ROM drives.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1667645641177/Xd4rsBVyH.jpeg?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt="BusLogic"></p>
<h2 id="heading-operating-systems-and-software-installations">Operating Systems and Software Installations</h2>
<h2 id="heading-prerequisite-microsoft-dos-622">Prerequisite: Microsoft DOS 6.22</h2>
<p>Most of the motherboard is not ready for booting from CDs, let alone SCSI. So, unlike Windows 98. To install Windows 95, you'd need Microsoft DOS 6.22. We're going to install it, and for me, I'll also enable the Dvorak keyboard. I'll gloss over this process as you might already know how to install them from diskettes. After installing MSDOS, you'll be greeted with the typical C-prompt <code>C:\</code>. I usually install the supplemental disk to be able to use Dvorak as my keyboard and add this line to <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> file.</p>
<pre><code>REM Use Dvorak Keyboard
KEYB DV,,C:\DOS\DVORAK.SYS
</code></pre><p>We'd need to access our CDROM, which is attached to a SCSI card. For this we'll use the driver from BusLogic and Microsoft MSCDEX. You can find the file on the net. The name are <code>btdosm.sys</code> <code>btcdrom.sys</code> and <code>mscdex.exe</code>. To access the drive, we'll need to load them on our <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> file.</p>
<pre><code>DEVICE=BTDOSM.SYS
DEVICE=BTCDROM.SYS /D:RETROCD
</code></pre><p>And then add this line to <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code></p>
<pre><code>REM Mount CD ROM
MSCDEX.EXE /D:RETROCD
</code></pre><p>Reboot, and now you can access your <code>D</code> drive from DOS command prompt.</p>
<h2 id="heading-install-windows-95-osr-25">Install Windows 95 OSR 2.5</h2>
<p>Mount your Windows 95 on the CD Drive and then go to drive D.</p>
<pre><code>C:\&gt; D:
D:\&gt; SETUP
</code></pre><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1667655529827/b5Ok_zHi2.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt="Setup Wizard"></p>
<p>Follow the setup instructions, and you'll end up with a desktop. Right-click on the <strong>My Computer</strong> section and select <strong>Properties</strong>. You'll end up with something like this.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1667655920414/6CdD0c8JD.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt="Desktop Machine Properties"></p>
<p>Look at that 16 MB RAM and a proud 80486 owner with all the bells and whistles. Now time to install our development tool of choice.</p>

<p>We're "real programmers", so we're not gonna use peasants' tools like Visual Basic. No, no siree... We are going to use a real programming language like C++. So prepare your <a target="_blank" href="https://winworldpc.com/product/microsoft-visual-stu/97-5x">Visual Studio Enterprise 97</a> disks and install Visual C++.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1667656275181/2WacmCqyL.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt="Visual C++ Advertisement of COM">.</p>
<p>Look at that! What an amazing compiler supporting <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model">COM</a>, and it supports creating COM clients and interfaces, exciting time to code in 1994.</p>
<p>If you are clueless enough, you can also install the MSDN for Visual Studio 97 if you can get the CD image from the internet. However, our next step is very simple. We won't need to use that.</p>
<h2 id="heading-coding">Coding</h2>
<p>So we have our money-making machine being set up. The next step is to write a program for the 90s. Let's give ourselves a treat of being beginners again and see what we can achieve using a 30-years-old platform with machine 1/1000 times less powerful than our typical phone in 2022.</p>
<p>Let's fire up the IDE and enjoy the developer tools created by Microsoft in the early 90s.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1667661905493/wy8ZcwYb6.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt="Hello Win95"></p>
<p>Proceed by selecting "Win32 Application" and then choose "Empty Project". You'll be greeted with an empty project. Add new files named <code>main.cpp</code> to the files section and let's start by building a GUI program which will show you a "Hello, Welcome to Windows95" message box.</p>
<h2 id="heading-entry-point">Entry Point</h2>
<p>A win32 project entry point is not <code>main</code> but <code>WinMain</code>. A minimal program which will start and do absolutely nothing will be as follows.</p>
<pre><code><span>#<span>include</span> <span>&lt;Windows.h&gt;</span></span>

<span><span>int</span> APIENTRY <span>WinMain</span><span>(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance,
                     LPSTR lpCmdLine, <span>int</span> nCmdShow)</span>
</span>{
  <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Although the program does absolutely nothing, it'll just start and immediately exit, the function signature is a mouthful and verbose. Not all of these parameters are important or even usable. This is the quirk of Windows programming as Microsoft needs to maintain the API signature for backward compatibility. </p>
<ol>
<li>Including the <code>Windows.h</code> header is mandatory for all Windows programs written this way.</li>
<li>The <code>WinMain</code> function needs to return an <code>int</code>. If there's no Windows Message Pump defined, return <code>0</code> on exist. We'll talk about Windows Message Pump in another post.</li>
<li><code>APIENTRY</code> is an alias to stdcall calling convention, which means the function itself will clean the stack.</li>
<li><code>HINSTANCE</code> is a "handle" to an application instance. A handle is an opaque value for an object within Windows operating system. Both first parameters are purely for backward compatibility. The first <code>HINSTANCE</code> is always pegged to <code>0x04</code>, and the second is always <code>0x00</code> on 32-bit protected mode Windows.</li>
<li><code>lpCmdLine</code> is the command line to invoke the program. We can use this parameter to parse the command line and its arguments when it's invoked from the command line.</li>
<li><code>nCmdShow</code> is the value which tell the window, if the Window will be shown minimised, maximised, or hidden.</li>
</ol>
<p>Try to build the application, and you'll see.. nothing. Building only validates that our syntax is correct. The message on the build window will show something like this.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1667663069376/E8PVkXUuP.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt="Building Program Console"></p>
<h2 id="heading-our-first-windows-api">Our first Windows API</h2>
<p>When we started with something new, we started with "Hello, World!" program. This can be accomplished in Win32 API by calling <code>MessageBox</code> function. The function prototype is very simple.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>int</span> <span>MessageBox</span><span>(HWND hWnd, LPSTR lpText, LPSTR lpCaption, UINT uType)</span></span>;
</code></pre>
<p>The meaning of each of the parameter are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>hWnd</code> is the parent window of the message box window being displayed. Passing <code>0</code> means that the message box parent will be the Desktop.</li>
<li><code>lpText</code> is a zero-terminated string containing the message to be displayed.</li>
<li><code>lpCaption</code> is the caption of the message box.</li>
<li><code>uType</code> is the message box type. There are several values that you can use. The value is a bit flag. We'll use <code>MB_OK | MB_ICONINFORMATION</code> which means that we'll only show the OK button and an information icon.</li>
</ul>
<p>The full program to be run is as below:</p>
<pre><code><span>#<span>include</span> <span>&lt;Windows.h&gt;</span></span>

<span><span>int</span> APIENTRY <span>WinMain</span><span>(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance,
                     LPSTR lpCmdLine, <span>int</span> nCmdShow)</span>
</span>{
  MessageBox(<span>NULL</span>, <span>"Hello, Welcome to Win32 Programming"</span>, 
      <span>"Hello, World"</span>, MB_OK | MB_ICONINFORMATION);
  <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>And the program will show a nice message box.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1667664027301/s938PW0B6.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt="Hello World Win32"></p>
<p>That's it! Our first GUI program using Win32 API running on typical early 90s workstation running on Windows 95. There will be more which we'll explore on next articles. Including on how to create a window and draw something there.</p>
<p>If you curious, you can build the executable to an .exe and then try to run it on modern Windows operating system like Windows 11. You'll surprise that the program still run perfectly fine.</p>
<h2 id="heading-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Windows 95 is the first full 32-bit Windows that's built by Microsoft. It's a break from previous generations of Windows which brings 32-bit programming to consumer which previously was only available on Windows NT. Programming C/C++ in Windows differs with typical console-based C/C++ applications. For example, the entry point of Win32 program is <code>WinMain</code> and not <code>main</code>. In the future article we'll explore more about Window 95 and Win32 API.</p>

<p>There’s a new “feature” in Sonoma, and no one besides Apple is quite sure what it is.</p>



<p>Alerts for deprecated APIs are now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyGUrPxG1iM">appearing frequently</a>. Sometimes when you launch an app, and sometimes at random. Here are three I got the other day after waking a MacBook from sleep:</p>



<figure><img src="https://furbo.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Sonoma-Alert.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Mysterious Alerts.</figcaption></figure>



<p>From a UI point-of-view, these alerts have serious issues:</p>



<ul><li>They are scary and not actionable.</li><li>The only unique information is the title. The name, however, is not something I recognize.</li><li>I know what a deprecated API is and how its removal can be a bad thing, but ordinary users won’t.</li><li>There is no mention of what API caused the alert.</li><li>I’m advised to contact the developer for an updated version, but there is no information on who that developer is. (In the screenshot above, I’m assuming the developer is Apple itself, so I notified them with FB12560773, FB12560774, FB12560776).</li></ul>



<p>But the UI is just the beginning of the fun. Once the developer is notified, the lack of information for this “feature” prevents the deprecation from being addressed.</p>



<p>This alert is mentioned in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-14-release-notes#ATS-and-ATSUI">release notes</a> for the first beta for Sonoma. The brevity of that note is surprising for such a prominent and important addition to macOS.</p>



<p>I suspect that the brevity of the alert’s text is to shield the customer from unfamiliar terminology and complexity. It’s like a check engine light in your car: it comes on and you know to get to a mechanic ASAP.</p>



<p>When you get to the mechanic, they have diagnostic tools that let them understand what’s wrong (the engine control unit will typically store a unique code).</p>



<p>The difference with this “feature” is that folks like me are the mechanics and we have no diagnostic code. Supposedly, this alert should only appear with the use of ATS or ATSUI (per the release notes), but I find it hard to believe that modern system framework components show above are using Apple Type Services that were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Type_Services_for_Unicode_Imaging">replaced 13 years ago</a>. But maybe they are – we all embed frameworks into our apps, some where we have source code, others where we do not.</p>



<p>The alerts also have another hideous “feature”. They turn themselves off as soon as you hit the OK button. They never repeat, so it’s impossible to bisect the code to find and verify a fix.</p>



<p>It’s like having your check engine like go off the next time you start the car, and the diagnostic code being removed by the time you get to the repair shop. Developers reaction to these reports will be the same as your local mechanic: “I don’t know what’s wrong. Good luck.”</p>



<p>If Apple wants developers to repair these deprecations they need to make major changes:</p>



<ul><li>Document the behavior, including all of the APIs that trigger it.</li><li>Tell developers if this is something that will only appear in the beta or if it will be a part of the final release.</li><li>Give the customer something to work with when communicating with the developer. A diagnostic code at a minimum.</li><li>Log information about what caused the issue: remember that it may not be the developer’s own code triggering the alert. Plugins, embedded libraries, and external frameworks should be a part of the log. These logs should be available to customers so they can provide it to developers.</li><li>Give developers a way to reset the alerts. Make fixes testable.</li></ul>



<p>Without these changes a Mac user’s future is one with a lot of crashes caused by deprecated code.</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="https://tedpiotrowski.svbtle.com/using-lidar-for-tree-shadows-in-shademap">Using LiDAR to map tree shadows</a>
  </h2>
	<p><strong>tl;dr;</strong> <em>I can load LiDAR data to simulate tree shadows for any time of year, but the hardware demands and hosting costs may be prohibitive so I’m only sharing a small <a href="https://pub-2f76d53a7bba403bbf5ca35a8bf7e094.r2.dev/leaflet.html">demo</a> for now</em></p>

<p>Two years ago, I launched shademap.app, and since then, a common question I receive is: “Where are the trees?” It’s a valid inquiry, considering I reside in the Pacific Northwest—a region known for its towering trees that significantly affect the amount of direct sunlight a location receives.</p>

<p>Here are two renderings of the shadows on Bainbridge Island for July 9th at 7:09 AM. Radar clearly misses 90% of the shadows cast because it does not include vegetation. Radar only reflects off the ground, making objects such as trees and buildings invisible. On the other hand, LiDAR reflects off all objects, creating a much richer model of the earth’s surface.</p>

<p><a href="https://svbtleusercontent.com/bY4zNi97cMS6orbwoJmDKg0xspap.jpg"><img src="https://svbtleusercontent.com/bY4zNi97cMS6orbwoJmDKg0xspap_small.jpg" alt="Radar vs LiDAR shadow simulation"></a></p>

<p>So why hasn’t ShadeMap included trees from the beginning? It’s because ShadeMap uses elevation data to simulate shadows and the only readily available world-wide elevation data sets come from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle_Radar_Topography_Mission">radar</a>. Radar works at night time and penetrates clouds, so satellites are able to compile this data 24 hours per day from space.</p>

<p>LiDAR, on the other hand, is much more accurate but is collected from airplanes or drones and cannot penetrate fog and clouds. It’s much more time consuming and expensive to collect, leaving each local government to fund its surveying costs. However, I recently discovered that my state of Washington provides an extensive <a href="https://lidarportal.dnr.wa.gov/">LiDAR dataset</a> that covers large amounts of the state.</p>

<p><a href="https://svbtleusercontent.com/tF4Je2rM5W8N1eLXgDmybA0xspap.jpg"><img src="https://svbtleusercontent.com/tF4Je2rM5W8N1eLXgDmybA0xspap_small.jpg" alt="WA LiDAR portal"></a></p>

<p>I could finally fill in the gaps in my shadow simulation-for my own backyard, at least. But there was one problem. The data format was geared towards traditional GIS software (it’s a GeoTIFF) and not browser friends (like a JPG or PNG). In order to use the data, I would have to take 100’s of gigabytes of floating point, imperial feet, GeoTIFF files and slice them up into small fast-loading image tiles where metric meters are encoded as red, green and blue pixel values.</p>

<p>I bought a 1TB hard drive and started asking ChatGPT questions on how to convert the data. (ChatGPT is a marvelous assistant and has saved me hours of reading documentation and irrelevant Google search results) Once, I started to run the conversion process, I realized that my 16GB of RAM could not load these large data files and I had to rewrite the conversion code to just work with a small region of the map at a time. For the first time in a long time, I’m feeling the need for a more powerful machine…</p>

<p>And it works. Or actually…it’s working right now. I’m attempting to convert just the Seattle metropolitan area and it’s only about half way done after 12 hours. The tiles are over 15GB and growing. The simulations are incredible, but I’m not sure I want to sink money into hosting this data and making it publicly available. It’s a shame but it’s the sound financial decision for now.</p>

<p><a href="https://svbtleusercontent.com/pd7efcJtXN5f8vho7JVP9y0xspap.gif"><img src="https://svbtleusercontent.com/pd7efcJtXN5f8vho7JVP9y0xspap_small.gif" alt="LiDAR shadow simulation"></a></p>

<p>However, I can host small portions of this dataset for free so if you’re curious what my long-term vision for ShadeMap is, try this <a href="https://pub-2f76d53a7bba403bbf5ca35a8bf7e094.r2.dev/leaflet.html">demo</a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Thanks to <strong>166</strong> contributors, <strong>522</strong> pull requests, community reviewers, and our <a href="https://bevyengine.org/community/donate"><strong>generous sponsors</strong></a>, we're happy to announce the <strong>Bevy 0.11</strong> release on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/bevy">crates.io</a>!</p>
<p>For those who don't know, Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. You can check out our <a href="https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/">Quick Start Guide</a> to try it today. It's free and open source forever! You can grab the full <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy">source code</a> on GitHub. Check out <a href="https://bevyengine.org/assets">Bevy Assets</a> for a collection of community-developed plugins, games, and learning resources.</p>

<p>Since our last release a few months ago we've added a <em>ton</em> of new features, bug fixes, and quality of life tweaks, but here are some of the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Screen Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO)</strong>: Increase scene render quality by simulating occlusion of "indirect" diffuse light</li>
<li><strong>Temporal Anti-Aliasing (TAA)</strong>: A popular anti-aliasing technique that blends the current frame with past frames using motion vectors to smooth out artifacts</li>
<li><strong>Morph Targets</strong>: Animate vertex positions on meshes between predefined states. Great for things like character customization!</li>
<li><strong>Robust Constrast Adaptive Sharpening (RCAS)</strong>: Intelligently sharpens renders, which pairs nicely with TAA</li>
<li><strong>WebGPU Support</strong>: Bevy can now render on the web faster and with more features using the modern WebGPU web API</li>
<li><strong>Improved Shader Imports</strong>: Bevy shaders now support granular imports and other new features</li>
<li><strong>Parallax Mapping</strong>: Materials now support an optional depth map, giving flat surfaces a feel of depth through parallaxing the material's textures</li>
<li><strong>Schedule-First ECS APIs</strong>: A simpler and more ergonomic ECS system scheduling API</li>
<li><strong>Immediate Mode Gizmo Rendering</strong>: Easily and efficiently render 2D and 3D shapes for debugging and editor scenarios</li>
<li><strong>ECS Audio APIs</strong>: A more intuitive and idiomatic way to play back audio</li>
<li><strong>UI Borders</strong>: UI nodes can now have configurable borders!</li>
<li><strong>Grid UI Layout</strong>: Bevy UI now supports CSS-style grid layout</li>
<li><strong>UI Performance Improvements</strong>: The UI batching algorithm was changed, yielding significant performance wins</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>SSAO Only</strong>
<img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-11/ssao_only.png" alt="ssao_only"></p>
<p>Bevy now supports Screen Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO). While Bevy already supported shadows from direct lights
(<a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/pbr/struct.DirectionalLight.html"><code>DirectionalLight</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/pbr/struct.PointLight.html"><code>PointLight</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/pbr/struct.SpotLight.html"><code>SpotLight</code></a>) via shadow mapping, Bevy now supports shadows from <em>indirect</em> diffuse lighting such as <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/pbr/struct.AmbientLight.html"><code>AmbientLight</code></a> or <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/pbr/struct.EnvironmentMapLight.html"><code>EnvironmentMapLight</code></a>.</p>
<p>These shadows give scenes a more "grounded" feel, by estimating how much surrounding geometry blocks incoming light via the screen-space depth and normal prepasses. You can try it out in the new <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/v0.11.0/examples/3d/ssao.rs">SSAO example</a>.</p>
<p>Note that using SSAO with the newly added Temporal Anti-Aliasing leads to a <em>large</em> increase in quality and noise reduction.</p>
<p>Platform support is currently limited - Only Vulkan, DirectX12, and Metal are currently supported. WebGPU support will come at a later date. WebGL likely won't be supported because it doesn't have compute shaders.</p>
<p>Special thanks to Intel for their open source <a href="https://github.com/GameTechDev/XeGTAO">XeGTAO</a> project, which was a huge help in developing this feature.</p>

<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-11/aa.png" alt="aa"></p>
<p>Alongside MSAA and FXAA, Bevy now supports Temporal Anti-aliasing (TAA) as an anti-aliasing option.</p>
<p>TAA works by blending the newly rendered frame with past frames in order to smooth out aliasing artifacts in the image. TAA has become increasingly popular in the industry because of its ability to cover up so many rendering artifacts: it smooths out shadows (both global illumination and "casted" shadows), mesh edges, textures, and reduces specular aliasing of light on reflective surfaces. However because the "smoothing" effect is so apparent, some people prefer other methods.</p>
<p>Here's a quick rundown of the following advantages and disadvantages of each anti-aliasing method that Bevy supports:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-Sample Antialiasing (MSAA)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Does a good job at smoothing the edges of meshes (anti geometric aliasing). Does not help with specular aliasing. Performance cost scales with triangle count, and performs very poorly on scenes with many triangles</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fast Approximate Antialiasing (FXAA)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Does a decent job of dealing with both geometric and specular aliasing. Very little performance cost in all scenes. Somewhat blurry and low quality results</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Temporal Antialiasing (TAA)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Does a very good job at dealing with both geometric and specular aliasing. Does a good job at dealing with temporal aliasing, where high-frequency details flicker over time or as you move the camera around or as things animate. Performance cost is moderate, and scales only with screen resolution. Chance of "ghosting" where meshes or lighting effects may leave trails behind them that fade over time. Although TAA helps with reducing temporal aliasing, it may also introduce additional temporal aliasing, especially on thin geometry or texture detail rendered at a distance. Requires 2 view's worth of additional GPU memory, as well as enabling the motion vector and depth prepasses. Requires accurate motion vector and depth prepasses, which complicates custom materials</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>TAA implementations are a series of tradeoffs and rely on heuristics that are easy to get wrong. In Bevy 0.11, TAA is marked as an experimental feature for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>TAA does not currently work with the following Bevy features: skinning, morph targets, and parallax mapping</li>
<li>TAA currently tends to soften the image a bit, which can be worked around via post-process sharpening</li>
<li>Our TAA heuristics are not currently user-configurable (and these heuristics are likely to change and evolve)</li>
</ul>
<p>We will continue to improve quality, compatibility, and performance in future releases. Please report any bugs you encounter!</p>
<p>You can compare all of our anti-aliasing methods in Bevy's improved <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/v0.11.0/examples/3d/anti_aliasing.rs">anti-aliasing example</a>.</p>

</h2>

<p>Effects like TAA and FXAA can cause the final render to become blurry. Sharpening post processing effects can help counteract that. In <strong>Bevy 0.11</strong> we've added a port of AMD's Robust Constrast Adaptive Sharpening (RCAS).</p>

<p>Bevy, since the 0.7 release, supports 3D animations.</p>
<p>But it only supported <em>skeletal</em> animations. Leaving on the sidewalk a common
animation type called <em>morph targets</em> (aka blendshapes, aka keyshapes, and a slew
of other name). This is the grandparent of all 3D character animation!
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_Bandicoot_(video_game)#Gameplay">Crash Bandicoot</a>'s run cycle used morph targets.</p>

<p>Nowadays, an animation artist will typically use a skeleton rig for wide
moves and morph targets to clean up the detailed movements.</p>
<p>When it comes to game assets, however, the complex skeleton rigs used by
artists for faces and hands are too heavy. Usually, the poses are
"baked" into morph poses, and facial expression transitions are handled
in the engine through morph targets.</p>
<p>Morph targets is a very simple animation method. Take a model, have a base
vertex position, move the vertices around to create several poses:</p>

<p>Store those poses as a difference between the default base mesh and the variant
pose, then, at runtime, <em>mix</em> each pose. Now that we have the difference with
the base mesh, we can get the variant pose by simply adding to the base
vertices positions.</p>
<p>That's it, the morph target shader looks like this:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span><span>fn</span> </span><span>morph_vertex</span></span><span><span><span>(</span><span>vertex</span><span>:</span> Vertex</span><span><span><span>)</span></span></span></span><span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>

<p>While conceptually simple, it requires communicating to the GPU a tremendous
amount of data. Thousand of vertices, each 288 bits, several model variations,
sometimes a hundred.</p>
<p>We store the vertex data as pixels in a 3D texture. This allows morph targets to not only
run on WebGPU, but also on the WebGL2 wgpu backend.</p>
<p>This could be improved in a number of ways, but it is sufficient for an
initial implementation.</p>

<h2 id="parallax-mapping">Parallax Mapping
<a href="#parallax-mapping">#</a>
</h2>
<p>author: @nicopap</p>
<p>Bevy now supports parallax mapping and depth maps. Parallax mapping puts normal
maps to shame when it comes to giving "illusion of depth" to a material. The top half of this video uses parallax mapping plus a normal map, whereas the bottom half only uses a normal map:</p>

<p>earth view, elevation &amp; night view by NASA (public domain)</p>
<p>Notice how it is not merely the shading of pixels that changes, but their
actual position on screen. The mountaintops hide mountain ridges behind
themselves. High mountains move faster than coastal areas.</p>
<p>Parallax mapping moves pixels according to the perspective and depth on the
surface of the geometry. Adding true 3D depth to flat surfaces.</p>
<p>All of that, without adding a single vertex to the geometry. The whole globe
has exactly 648 vertices. Unlike a more primitive shader, such as displacement
mapping, parallax mapping only requires an additional grayscale image, called
the <code>depth_map</code>.</p>
<p>Games often use parallax mapping for cobblestones or brick walls, so
let's make a brick wall in Bevy! First, we spawn a mesh:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>commands<span>.</span><span>spawn</span><span><span>(</span>PbrBundle <span><span>{</span>

</span><span><span>}</span></span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>;</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-11/parallax_mapping_none_mini.jpg" alt="A 3D desert scene with two flat white walls and a pebble path winding between them"></p>
<p>Of course, it's just a flat white box, we didn't add any texture.
So let's add a normal map:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>normal_map_texture<span>:</span> <span>Some</span><span><span>(</span>assets<span>.</span><span>load</span><span><span>(</span><span><span>"</span>normal_map.png<span>"</span></span></span><span><span>)</span></span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>,</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-11/parallax_mapping_normals_mini.jpg" alt="The same scene with normal maps"></p>
<p>This is much better. The shading changes according to the light direction too!
However, the specular highlights on the corner are overbearing, almost noisy.</p>
<p>Let's see how a depth map can help:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>depth_map<span>:</span> <span>Some</span><span><span>(</span>assets<span>.</span><span>load</span><span><span>(</span><span><span>"</span>depth_map.png<span>"</span></span></span><span><span>)</span></span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>,</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-11/parallax_mapping_depth_mini.jpg" alt="The same scene with a depth texture"></p>
<p>We eliminated the noise! There is also that sweet 3D feel reminiscent of
90's games pre-rendered cinematic sequences.</p>
<p>So what's going on, why does parallax mapping eliminate the ugly specular
lights on the wall?</p>
<p>This is because parallax mapping insets the ridges between bricks, so that they
are occluded by the bricks themselves.</p>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-11/ridge-light-view-1.svg" alt="Illustration of the previous paragraph"></p>
<p>Since normal maps do not "move" the shaded areas, merely shade them
differently, we get those awkward specular highlights. With parallax mapping,
they are gone.</p>
<p><b>Drag this image to compare</b></p>
<p><img alt="Normal Mapping Only" src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-11/parallax_mapping_normals.jpg">
  <img alt="Parallax &amp; Normal Mapping" src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-11/parallax_mapping_depth.jpg">
</p>
<p>Parallax mapping in Bevy is still very limited. The most painful aspect is that
it is not a standard glTF feature, meaning that the depth texture needs to be
programmatically added to materials if they came from a GLTF file.</p>
<p>Additionally, parallax mapping is incompatible with the temporal antialiasing
shader, doesn't work well on curved surfaces, and doesn't affect object's
silhouettes.</p>
<p>However, those are not fundamental limitations of parallax mapping, and may be
fixed in the future.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-webgpu">What is WebGPU?
<a href="#what-is-webgpu">#</a>
</h3>
<p>WebGPU is an <a href="https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb">exciting new web standard</a> for doing modern GPU graphics and compute. It takes inspiration from Vulkan, Direct3D 12, and Metal. In fact, it is generally implemented on top of these APIs under the hood. WebGPU gives us access to more GPU features than WebGL2 (such as compute shaders) and also has the potential to be much faster. It means that more of Bevy's native renderer features are now also available on the web. It also uses the new <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WGSL">WGSL shader language</a>. We're very happy with how WGSL has evolved over time and Bevy uses it internally for our shaders. We also added usability features like imports! But with Bevy you still have the option to use GLSL if you prefer.</p>
<h3 id="how-it-works">How it Works
<a href="#how-it-works">#</a>

<p>Bevy is built on top of the <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu">wgpu</a> library, which is a modern low-level GPU API that can target pretty much every popular API: Vulkan, Direct3D 12, Metal, OpenGL, WebGL2, and WebGPU. The best backend API is selected for a given platform. It is a "native" rendering API, but it generally follows the WebGPU terminology and API design. Unlike WebGPU, it can provide direct access to the native APIs, which means Bevy <a href="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-webgpu/#how-it-works">enjoys a "best of all worlds" situation</a>.</p>

<p>Bevy's rendering engine has a lot of great options and features. For example, the PBR <code>StandardMaterial</code> pipeline supports desktop/webgpu and webgl, 6 optional mesh attributes, 4 optional textures, and a plethora of optional features like fog, skinning, and alpha blending modes, with more coming in every release.</p>
<p>Many feature combos need specialized shader variants, and with over 3000 lines of shader code split over 50 files in total, the text-substitution-based shader processor was beginning to creak at the seams.</p>
<p>This release we've switched to using <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/naga_oil">naga_oil</a>, which gives us a module-based shader framework. It compiles each file individually to naga's IR and then combines them into a final shader on demand. This doesn't have much visible impact yet, but it does give a few immediate benefits:</p>

<p>The future possibilities are more exciting. Using naga IR opens the door to a bunch of nice features that we hope to bring in future releases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic bind slot allocation will let plugins extend the core view bindgroup, which means self-contained plugins for features like lighting and shadow methods, common material properties, etc become viable. This will allow us to modularise the core pipelines to make growing the codebase - while keeping support for multiple targets - more sustainable</li>
<li>"Virtual" shader functions will allow user modifications to core functions (like lighting), and potentially lead to a template-style material system, where users can provide "hooks" that will be called at the right point in the pipeline</li>
<li>Language interop: mix and match glsl and wgsl, so bevy's pbr pipeline features could be accessed from your glsl material shader, or utils written for glsl could be used in wgsl code. We're hopeful that this can extend to spirv (and rust-gpu) as well</li>
<li>More cool stuff we haven't thought of yet. Being able to inspect and modify shaders at runtime is very powerful and makes a lot of things possible!</li>

<p>In <strong>Bevy 0.10</strong> we introduced <a href="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-10/#ecs-schedule-v3">ECS Schedule V3</a>, which <em>vastly</em> improved the capabilities of Bevy ECS system scheduling: scheduler API ergonomics, system chaining, the ability to run exclusive systems and apply deferred system operations at any point in a schedule, a single unified schedule, configurable System Sets, run conditions, and a better State system.</p>
<p>However it pretty quickly became clear that the new system still had some areas to improve:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Base Sets were hard to understand and error prone</strong>: What <em>is</em> a Base Set? When do I use them? Why do they exist? Why is my ordering implicitly invalid due to incompatible Base Set ordering? Why do some schedules have a default Base Set while others don't? <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/8079#base-set-confusion">Base Sets were confusing!</a></li>
<li><strong>There were too many ways to schedule a System</strong>: We've accumulated too many scheduling APIs. As of Bevy <strong>0.10</strong>, we had <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/8079#unify-system-apis"><em>SIX</em> different ways to add a system to the "startup" schedule</a>. Thats too many ways!</li>
<li><strong>Too much implicit configuration</strong>: There were both default Schedules and default Base Sets. In some cases systems had default schedules or default base sets, but in other cases they didn't! <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/8079#schedule-should-be-clear">A system's schedule and configuration should be explicit and clear</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Adding Systems to Schedules wasn't ergonomic</strong>: Things like <code>add_system(foo.in_schedule(CoreSchedule::Startup))</code> were not fun to type or read. We created special-case helpers, such as <code>add_startup_system(foo)</code>, but <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/8079#ergonomic-system-adding">this required more internal code, user-defined schedules didn't benefit from the special casing, and it completely hid the <code>CoreSchedule::Startup</code> symbol!</a>.</li>

<li><strong>There is <em>exactly</em> one way to schedule systems</strong>
<ul>
<li>Call <code>add_systems</code>, state the schedule name, and specify one or more systems</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Base Sets have been entirely removed in favor of Schedules, which have friendly / short names</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ex: The <code>CoreSet::Update</code> Base Set has become <code>Update</code></li>

<li><strong>There is no implicit or implied configuration</strong>

<li>Default Schedules and default Base Sets don't exist</li>

<p>At first glance, this might not seem very useful. But in combination with per-tuple configuration, it allows you to easily and cleanly express schedules:</p>

<p><code>.chain()</code> has also been adapted to support arbitrary nesting! The ordering in the example above could be rephrased like this:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>app<span>.</span><span>add_systems</span><span><span>(</span>Update<span>,</span>

</span></code></pre>
<p>This will run <code>attack</code> and <code>defend</code> first (in parallel), then <code>check_health</code>, then <code>handle_death</code> and <code>respawn</code> (in parallel).</p>
<p>This allows for powerful and expressive "graph-like" ordering expressions:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>app<span>.</span><span>add_systems</span><span><span>(</span>Update<span>,</span>

<p>It is often helpful to be able to draw simple shapes and lines in 2D and 3D for things like editor controls, and debug views. Game development is a very "spatial" thing and being able to quickly draw shapes is the visual equivalent of "print line debugging". It helps answer questions like "is this ray casting in the right direction?" and "is this collider big enough?"</p>
<p>In <strong>Bevy 0.11</strong> we've added an "immediate mode" <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/gizmos/gizmos/struct.Gizmos.html"><code>Gizmos</code></a> drawing API that makes these things easy and efficient. In 2D and 3D you can draw lines, rects, circles, arcs, spheres, cubes, line strips, and more!</p>

<p>Bevy's scene format is a very useful tool for serializing and deserializing game state to and from scene files.</p>
<p>Previously, the captured state was limited to only entities and their components.
With <strong>Bevy 0.11</strong>, scenes now support serializing resources as well.</p>

<p>When serializing data to a scene, all components and <a href="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-11/#resource-support-in-scenes">resources</a> are serialized by default.
In previous versions, you had to use the given <code>TypeRegistry</code> to act as a filter, leaving out the types you don't want included.</p>
<p>In 0.11, there's now a dedicated <code>SceneFilter</code> type to make filtering easier, cleaner, and more intuitive.
This can be used with <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/prelude/struct.DynamicSceneBuilder.html"><code>DynamicSceneBuilder</code></a> to have fine-grained control over what actually gets serialized.</p>

<p>Bevy now supports a configurable default font and embeds a tiny default font (a minimal version of <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Mono">Fira Mono</a>). This is useful if you use a common font throughout your project. And it makes it easier to prototype new changes with a "placeholder font" without worrying about setting it on each node.</p>

<p>Previously UI <code>ImageBundle</code> Nodes could only use handles to full images without an ergonomic way to use <code>TextureAtlases</code> in UI.  In this release we add support for an <code>AtlasImageBundle</code> UI Node which brings the existing <code>TextureAtlas</code> support into UI.</p>
<p>This was achieved by merging the existing mechanisms that allows text rendering to select which glyph to use and the mechanisms that allow for <code>TextureAtlasSprite</code>.</p>

<p>TonyMcMapface (<a href="https://github.com/h3r2tic/tony-mc-mapface">created by Tomasz Stachowiak</a>) is a much more neutral display transform that tries to stay as close to the input "light" as possible. This helps retain artistic choices in the scene. Notably, brights desaturate across the entire spectrum (unlike Reinhard luminance).

<h2 id="better-reflect-proxies">Better Reflect Proxies
<a href="#better-reflect-proxies">#</a>
</h2>
<p>authors: @MrGVSV</p>
<p>Bevy's reflection API has a handful of structs which are collectively known as "dynamic" types.
These include <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/reflect/struct.DynamicStruct.html"><code>DynamicStruct</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/reflect/struct.DynamicTuple.html"><code>DynamicTuple</code></a>, and more, and they are used to dynamically construct types
of any shape or form at runtime.
These types are also used to create are commonly referred to as "proxies", which are dynamic types
that are used to represent an actual concrete type.</p>
<p>These proxies are what powers the <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/reflect/trait.Reflect.html#tymethod.clone_value"><code>Reflect::clone_value</code></a> method, which generates these proxies under the hood
in order to construct a runtime clone of the data.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this results in a few <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/6601">subtle footguns</a> that could catch users by surprise,
such as the hashes of proxies differing from the hashes of the concrete type they represent,
proxies not being considered equivalent to their concrete counterparts, and more.</p>
<p>While this release does not necessarily fix these issues, it does establish a solid foundation for fixing them in the future.
The way it does this is by changing how a proxy is defined.</p>
<p>Before 0.11, a proxy was only defined by cloning the concrete type's <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/reflect/trait.Reflect.html#tymethod.type_name"><code>Reflect::type_name</code></a> string
and returning it as its own <code>Reflect::type_name</code>.</p>
<p>Now in 0.11, a proxy is defined by copying a reference to the static <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/reflect/enum.TypeInfo.html"><code>TypeInfo</code></a> of the concrete type.
This will allow us to access more of the concrete type's type information dynamically, without requiring the <code>TypeRegistry</code>.
In a <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/8695">future release</a>, we will make use of this to store hashing and comparison strategies in the <code>TypeInfo</code> directly
in order to mitigate the proxy issues mentioned above.</p>

<p>Bevy's <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_reflect/latest/bevy_reflect/index.html">reflection API</a> commonly passes around data using type-erased <code>dyn Reflect</code> trait objects.
This can usually be downcast back to its concrete type using <code>&lt;dyn Reflect&gt;::downcast_ref::&lt;T&gt;</code>;
however, this doesn't work if the underlying data has been converted to a "dynamic" representation

<p>To account for this, the <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_reflect/latest/bevy_reflect/trait.FromReflect.html"><code>FromReflect</code></a> trait can be used to convert any <code>dyn Reflect</code> trait object
back into its concrete type— whether it is actually that type or a dynamic representation of it.
And it can even be called dynamically using the <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_reflect/latest/bevy_reflect/struct.ReflectFromReflect.html"><code>ReflectFromReflect</code></a> type data.</p>
<p>Before 0.11, users had to be manually derive <code>FromReflect</code> for every type that needed it,
as well as manually register the <code>ReflectFromReflect</code> type data.
This made it cumbersome to use and also meant that it was often forgotten about,
resulting in reflection conversions difficulties for users downstream.</p>
<p>Now in 0.11, <code>FromReflect</code> is automatically derived and <code>ReflectFromReflect</code> is automatically registered for all types that derive <code>Reflect</code>.
This means most types will be <code>FromReflect</code>-capable by default,
thus reducing boilerplate and empowering logic centered around <code>FromReflect</code>.</p>
<p>Users can still opt out of this behavior by adding the <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_reflect/latest/bevy_reflect/derive.Reflect.html#reflectfrom_reflect--false"><code>#[reflect(from_reflect = false)]</code></a> attribute to their type.</p>

<p>Adding <code>Node</code>s to the <code>RenderGraph</code> requires a lot of boilerplate. In this release, we tried to reduce this for most common operations. No existing APIs have been removed, these are only helpers made to simplify working with the <code>RenderGraph</code>.</p>
<p>We added the <code>RenderGraphApp</code> trait to the <code>App</code>. This trait contains various helper functions to reduce the boilerplate with adding nodes and edges to a graph.</p>
<p>Another pain point of <code>RenderGraph</code> <code>Node</code>s is passing the view entity through each node and manually updating the query on that view. To fix this we added a <code>ViewNode</code> trait and <code>ViewNodeRunner</code> that will automatically take care of running the <code>Query</code> on the view entity. We also made the view entity a first-class concept of the <code>RenderGraph</code>. So you can now access the view entity the graph is currently running on from anywhere in the graph without passing it around between each <code>Node</code>.</p>
<p>All these new APIs assume that your Node implements <code>FromWorld</code> or <code>Default</code>.</p>
<p>Here's what it looks like in practice for the <code>BloomNode</code>:</p>

<p>When using the <code>FromReflect</code> trait, fields marked <code>#[reflect(default)]</code> will be set to their <code>Default</code> value if they don't exist on the reflected object.</p>

<p>It is now possible to load meshes with custom vertex attributes from glTF files. Custom attributes can be mapped to Bevy's <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/render/mesh/struct.MeshVertexAttribute.html"><code>MeshVertexAttribute</code></a> format used by the <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/render/mesh/struct.Mesh.html"><code>Mesh</code></a> type in the <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/gltf/struct.GltfPlugin.html"><code>GltfPlugin</code></a> settings.

<p>authors: @soqb, @tguichaoua</p>
<p>Bevy has historically used <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/any/fn.type_name.html"><code>std::any::type_name</code></a> to identify Rust types with friendly names in a number of places: Bevy Reflect, Bevy Scenes, Bevy Assets, Bevy ECS, and others. Unfortunately, Rust makes no guarantees about the stability or format of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/any/fn.type_name.html"><code>type_name</code></a>, which makes it theoretically shakey ground to build on (although in practice it has been stable so far).</p>
<p>There is also no built in way to retrieve "parts" of a type name. If you want the short name, the name of a generic type without its inner types, the module name, or the crate name, you must do string operations on the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/any/fn.type_name.html"><code>type_name</code></a> (which can be error prone / nontrivial).</p>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/any/fn.type_name.html"><code>type_name</code></a> cannot be customized. In some cases an author might choose to identify a type with something other than its full module path (ex: if they prefer a shorter path or want to abstract out private / internal modules).</p>
<p>For these reasons, we've developed a new stable <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/reflect/trait.TypePath.html"><code>TypePath</code></a>, which is automatically implemented for any type deriving <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/reflect/trait.Reflect.html"><code>Reflect</code></a>. Additionally, it can be manually derived in cases where <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/reflect/trait.Reflect.html"><code>Reflect</code></a> isn't derived.</p>

Fortunately GitHub has <em>finally</em> rolled out <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2023-02-08-pull-request-merge-queue-public-beta/">Merge Queues</a>, which solve the same problems as Bors, with the benefit of being more tightly integrated with GitHub.</p>

<p>We have plenty of work that is pretty much finished and is therefore very likely to land in <strong>Bevy 0.12</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bevy Asset V2</strong>: A brand new asset system that adds "asset preprocessing", optional asset .meta files, recursive asset dependency tracking and events, async asset IO, better asset handles, more efficient asset storage, and a variety of usability improvements! The work here is <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/8624">pretty much finished</a>. It <em>almost</em> made it in to Bevy 0.11 but it needed a bit more time to cook.</li>
<li><strong>PBR Material Light Transmission</strong>: Transmission / screen space refractions allows for simulating materials like glass, plastics, liquids and gels, gemstones, wax, etc. This one is also pretty much <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/8015">ready to go</a>!</li>
<li><strong>TAA Improvements</strong>: We have a number of changes in the works for TAA that will improve its quality, speed, and support within the engine.</li>
<li><strong>GPU Picking</strong>: Efficiently and correctly <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/8784">select entities on the GPU</a> by using color ids to identify meshes in renders.</li>
<li><strong>PCF For Directional and Spotlight Shadows</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/8006">Reduce aliasing on the edges of shadows</a></li>
<li><strong>UI Node Border Radius and Shadows</strong>: Add <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/8973">curvature and "drop shadows"</a> to your UI nodes!</li>
<li><strong>Deferred Rendering</strong>: Bevy already does "mixed mode" forward rendering by having optional separate passes for depth and normals. We are currently experimenting with supporting "fully deferred" rendering as well, which opens the doors to new effects and different performance tradeoffs.</li>
</ul>
<p>From a high level, we plan to focus on the Asset System, UI, Render Features, and Scenes during the next cycle.</p>

<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070719151425/https://sa.ku.edu/pshelp/errors/windowsxptimezone.gif">
whether your copy of Windows&nbsp;XP has this problem</a>
depends
on precisely what version you have.
</p>
<p>
Where did the great Polish Sea come from?
</p>
<p>
This weekend marks the end of Summer Time in Europe,
and the answer has to do with time zones.
</p>
<p>
Recall that the Windows&nbsp;95 control panel highlighted your current
time zone on the map.
To accomplish this,
each time zone was assigned a different label in the time zone bitmap.
To draw the map, the portions of the world whose label was the same as
the selected time zone were drawn in bright green, and the parts that
were different were drawn in dark green.
So far so good.
</p>
<p>
When the
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/08/22/54679.aspx">
highlighting on the time zone map had to be disabled</a>,
all that happened was that the “color for the selected time zone”
was set to dark green.
The code still went through the motions of drawing the time zone
in a “different” color, but since the colors were the same at the end of
the day, the visual effect was that the highlighting was removed.
</p>
<p>
To determine which parts of the world are land and which parts
are sea, the time zone map enumerated all the time zones as well
as the labels associated with each time zone.
(You can see them in the registry under “MapID”.)
In this way, the land masses of the
world gradually emerged from the ocean as
the time zones claimed each spot of land one by one.
</p>
<p>
The shell team did make one fatal mistake, however,
obvious in retrospect:
It assumed that the world’s time zones would never change.
But what happens when a country changes its time zone,
as Poland did?
At the time Windows&nbsp;95 was released, Poland was on its own
custom time zone, which Windows&nbsp;95 called
“Warsaw Standard Time/Warsaw Daylight Time”,
but it didn’t stay that way for long.
Just within Windows&nbsp;95 and Windows&nbsp;98,
Poland’s time zone went by the following names:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows&nbsp;95: (GMT+01:00) Warsaw
</li><li>Windows&nbsp;95: (GMT+01:00) Lisbon, Warsaw
</li><li>Windows&nbsp;98: (GMT+01:00) Bratislava, Budapest, Ljubljana, Prague, Warsaw
</li><li>Windows&nbsp;98: (GMT+01:00) Sarajevo, Skopje, Sofija, Warsaw, Zagreb
</li></ul>
<p>
And that’s not counting the changes that were made in
Windows&nbsp;NT, Windows&nbsp;2000 or
Windows&nbsp;XP or their service packs.
It’s not that Poland’s time zone actually changed that many times.
Rather, the way it was grouped with its neighbors changed.
I don’t know why all these changes were made,
but I suspect political issues played a major role.
</p>
<p>
As a result of all this realignment,
the “Warsaw Standard Time” time zone
disappeared, and with it, its associated land mass.
Consequently, the land corresponding to Poland remained underwater.
And for some reason, nobody brought this problem to the attention
of the shell team until a couple years ago.
</p>
<p>
In order to fix this, a new world bitmap needed to be made
with new labels (labeling the pixels corresponding to Poland as
“Central European Time”) so that Poland would once again emerge
from the sea.
Even though the highlighting is gone, the map code still needs to
know where every time zone is so it can raise them from the ocean floor.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, all this will soon fall into the mists of history,
because Windows Vista has a completely rewritten time zone
control panel, so the mistakes of the past can finally be shed.
Let’s hope the people who wrote the new time zone control panel
remembered Poland.</p>

From the latest productivity apps to wiz-bang gadgets, we're constantly bombarded with promises of increased efficiency, higher output, and success beyond our dreams (both the creative and financial variety). We obsess over these tools, treating them like a crush—a fleeting infatuation that momentarily captivates our attention. All of this is wasted effort and delusion.</p><p><span>Of course, if you talk to a grizzled pro or anyone you actually respect in an industry you’ll find a constant: tools alone do not make a master. It's not the latest software or the fastest hardware that defines greatness; it's the mindset and skill of the individual wielding them. As the philosopher Seneca once stated, </span><em>"A sword never kills anybody; it is a tool in the killer's hand."</em></p><p>Take the acoustic guitar, for ex. In an age of digital music production and synthesizers, this instrument played alone might appear antiquated. Yet, in the hands of a skilled musician, it transforms into a vessel of captivating melodies and soul-stirring harmonies. It might even provide the inspiration for something larger, that would have been missed if you skipped right to software. The simplicity of the instrument compels the artist to focus on the nuances of their playing, to refine their fingerpicking technique, and to channel their emotions through each strum. The true magic lies not in the guitar itself, but in the virtuosity of the musician who brings it to life. A skill, mastered over time, agnostic and ambivalent of the noisy, buzzing, ADHD-ridden market.</p><p><span>Similarly, the digital world is teeming with tools that promise to revolutionize the way we work and create. But if we're fixated on acquiring every new tool that comes our way, we risk missing out on developing our fundamental, timeless skills—the abilities that transcend technological trends and persist throughout time. It’s almost always backwards to care much here. </span><strong>The important tools will find you</strong><span>. It’s also not a real moat, or recipe for producing anything great. Perhaps a fleeting viral post for “being first,” and really what’s the point of that?</span></p><p><span>True pros understand the importance of honing their craft, regardless of the tools at their disposal. They embrace the philosophy of Bruce Lee, who famously stated, "</span><em>I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times</em><span>." It's the expertise gained through deliberate, consistent practice and a deep understanding of the fundamentals that separates pros from amateurs.</span></p><p><span>It is real alpha to ignore the allure of novelty. Let us instead focus on the foundations, the timeless principles, and the relentless pursuit of mastery. Paradoxically, AI will make this </span><em>more</em><span> true. This will also ensure you </span><a href="https://adamsinger.substack.com/p/the-rise-of-ai-nihilism?utm_source=profile&amp;utm_medium=reader2" rel="">escape the nihilism</a><span> inherent to creative reliance on AI.</span></p><p>The next time you find yourself FOMO’ing after the latest gadget or the trendiest app, pause for a moment of reflection. Ask yourself: Am I truly honing my craft? Am I investing here only because others told me to? Am I really doing something that matters? Am I actually just a goldfish chasing a shiny lure? I worry many lack this sort of metacognition in a world where it’s more common to become a garden variety stock promoter of the latest fad. Perhaps a superpower for you to not do this and instead do the harder thing.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

      <p><span><strong>Today in Tedium:</strong> I don’t feel particularly motivated to write about Threads, the Instagram-in-Twitter-form social network that Meta launched this week. It feels like a social network that exists to check a box for a company that owns a lot of social networks. But I do think it represents something about the moment that we’re in, where people are so desperate for a certain kind of experience that they will go from the hands of one billionaire to another, in hopes that will give them what they don’t feel like they were getting before. If Threads descended into the bottom of the ocean on a poorly built submersible, I would not care. But what I do care about is <em>why</em> I don’t care about Threads. And I think it comes down to the reasons why this site lives on the open web, even if I can’t leave the networks. Like many internet creatures of a certain age, I came from grime. We try to pretend the grime isn’t there, we dress it up as best we can, but it’s always there, no matter how hard we try to pretend it’s not. Today’s Tedium defends the grime from which the internet was built. <em>— Ernie @ Tedium</em></span></p>

<h3>The internet was built from grime; the problem is, we keep trying to build shopping malls over the grime</h3>
<p>There are amazing things about being able to control an environment. Controlled environments are what gave us air conditioning and malls and factories.</p>
<p>But sometimes, you have to walk outside that environment and experience the outside world—the sun, the uncontrollable temperatures, the risks of clothes-dirtying weather events.</p>
<p>Now, to be clear, the internet we use benefits greatly from controlled temperatures and giant rooms protected from elements. Cloud computing, when broken down, should really be described as “pod computing.” But the metaphor, from an end user standpoint, I think stands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thing that I think made the internet such an interesting place in its early years was because it didn’t feel like a controlled environment. The chaos was everywhere. It was messy. It was grimy.</p>
<p>The first experience that many people got with the internet was a busy signal, not a welcome mat. When people joined communities like Usenet, they were more likely to get an elbow to the shoulder for not following the rules, rather than a welcome mat.</p>
<p>And honestly, though I tell people not to be jerks on the internet, people were kind of jerks!&nbsp;</p>
<p>When compared to the tools people used to consume information, the internet was rough and tumble and messy. Television had prime time and a simple-to-follow organizational model. Newspapers had front pages and sections, and were organized hierarchically.</p>
<p>Even other digital mediums were better organized than the internet. <a href="https://tedium.co/2020/08/11/compuserve-videotex-online-news-history/">CompuServe</a> and <a href="https://tedium.co/2021/07/23/aol-community-leader-volunter-program-history/">AOL</a> were way easier to follow and far less chaotic than the open internet. <a href="https://tedium.co/2017/07/13/who-killed-the-encyclopedia/">Encarta</a> could give you way easier to follow results than any web page could in 1995.</p>
<p>The internet, on the other hand, was feudalism. There was no plot, really. The tools that were made available were specifically non-user-friendly and unwelcoming. If someone made fun of you or made you mad, there was no central authority to ask for help.</p>
<p>But despite all that, the ungated, non-temperature-controlled, rainy, dirty, grimy internet still won.</p>
<p>I argue it won in part <em>because</em> of the chaos. That chaos was the stuff that Hollywood fell over itself attempting to display in early technology movies like <a href="https://tedium.co/2019/03/07/internet-food-delivery-history/"><em>The Net</em></a> and <em>Hackers</em>. They didn’t have time for pretty, comfortable takes on the internet like <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/223467/remembering-eworld-apples-forgotten-online-service.html">Apple’s eWorld</a> or <a href="https://tedium.co/2017/07/27/yahoo-games-failure-classicgames/">Yahoo</a>.</p>
<p>I will not say that this was perfect, but the chaotic effect was interesting, and interesting was often enough to continue using, because it meant there were always new surprises. For lots of people, chaos often breeds new ways of thinking.</p>
<p>But even after things became more formalized, chaotic environments continued to hold a unique appeal on the internet. The early blogosphere was full of people who would promise ambitious things, but never follow through. Forums like Something Awful had arbitrary approaches to rules and made money essentially through aggressive rule enforcement. Many of these platforms were anonymous in nature.</p>
<p>Even MySpace, the first truly popular social network, became popular because of <a href="https://tedium.co/2020/07/14/social-media-customization-failings/">a gaping security hole</a>.</p>
<p>And startups, nothing against the people who make startups today, were much less influenced by what other startups were doing. That fostered newer, more original ideas, rather than the modest wrench-tightening we see on sites like Product Hunt today.</p>
<p>Think about it: <a href="https://tedium.co/2020/02/22/craigslist-25th-anniversary/">Craigslist</a> and <a href="https://www.ebayinc.com/company/our-history/">eBay</a> had no comparison points in the real world. They were basically ideas that were total accidents, but became billion-dollar businesses. They came from chaos, but chaos dresses itself up pretty well before a big night out on the town.</p>
<p>The problem is, there are limits to reining in the chaos for commercial reasons, and this, I think gets to why I don’t care about Threads.</p>

<p><img data-src="https://images.tedium.co/uploads/Disney-World.jpg" width="1000" height="1333" alt="Disney World" src="https://images.tedium.co/uploads/Disney-World.jpg"></p>
<p><em>You know what Threads is kind of like? Disney World. That’s not really a compliment. (<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/pJ0FNi_xn20">Rayna Tuero/Unsplash</a>)</em></p>
<h3>Brand safety, billion-dollar companies, and why networks like old Twitter are all too rare</h3>
<p>Adam Mosseri, the dude who runs the Instagram team and is a key figure in the launch of Threads, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/7/23787334/instagram-threads-news-politics-adam-mosseri-meta-facebook">gave away the game this week</a> when he admitted that the company will specifically not do anything to promote political or news content on Threads.</p>
<p>“Politics and hard news are important, I don’t want to imply otherwise,” <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuZ6opKtHva/">he said in a Thread</a>. “But my take is, from a platform’s perspective, any incremental engagement or revenue they might drive is not at all worth the scrutiny, negativity (let’s be honest), or integrity risks that come along with them.”</p>
<p>Without saying the exact words, he’s basically admitting that news and politics—the entire category—aren’t brand-safe, and as a result, those are the very things that will be discouraged on the platform.</p>
<p>Threads threatens to be social media’s Disney World, and while Disney World has its fans, it is by its nature top-down culture. All the good stuff comes from the bottom up.</p>
<p>You don’t go to Disney World to be sad or angry. You go to be excited, or enthralled. You don’t go there for chaos.</p>
<p>By Threads becoming a thing and being presented as something where it’s automatically presumed you will want celebrities and influencers dominating your feed at all times, with no algorithm-free option, the goal is basically to get people to learn to love chaos-free social media.</p>
<p>Sure, some chaos will seep in, as it always does. But it won’t define the network, like its competition long has. It will be Mountain Dew without the carbonation.</p>
<p>I think Twitter, especially in its early years, was most effective in nailing down a balance between chaos and brand safety that few companies have ever pulled off at the multi-billion scale Twitter was playing at. It was the perfect example of a business-in-the-front, party-in-the-back platform. It was able to scale, if slower than some of its competitors, because it found the magic center-point between being a place where professionals could communicate and people could screw around and try new, weird things.</p>
<p>Was it perfect at this? No—and the leadership arc of Jack Dorsey proves it. But it was much more successful at it than another company that relies on bottling up chaos, Reddit—a firm whose recent drama is a direct result of the fact that it has underperformed financially, leading to some desperate Hail Mary actions to revive its stock fortunes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These sorts of outcomes naturally emerged because of how we monetized it. I think as the internet became more formal and people figured out better ways to use it, we became more optimized on meeting user expectations or following data to meet specific goals.</p>
<p>Data is a great way to build and sustain a business, because it gives you a useful comparison point. But in many ways, data is destructive. The media industry, I believe, offers the best example of this I can think of. For roughly a century, they held local monopolies on local advertising, and lost much of that monopoly money in, essentially, a decade.</p>
<p>I feel like this exact same mindset is being used to starve out the weird old internet, the grimy parts of the digital experience that are a little shady but are much more enjoyable than modern-day Times Square.</p>
<p>We even see this with hardware—there’s a reason everyone on the internet complains that Apple spent 30 minutes during its last keynote talking about the software features on the watch when they actually wanted to hear about the Mac Pro. The market research pushed Apple in that direction. People who complain about the Mac Pro aren’t actually going to buy one—but people who passively observe details on the Watch probably will.</p>
<p>Data doesn’t care that it harms structural underpinnings, because the data usually only matters to the companies using it.</p>
<p>If you want the vibe of the old-school internet to live, you need to look outside its money-making potential. Silicon Valley has already decided they don’t really have a use for it anymore.</p>

<p><img data-src="https://images.tedium.co/uploads/Puzzle.jpg" width="1000" height="667" alt="Puzzle" src="https://images.tedium.co/uploads/Puzzle.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Often, a website or platform worth supporting doesn’t have all the puzzle pieces put together quite yet. As a user, that’s your job. (<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/sOK9NjLArCw">Gabriel Crismariu/Unsplash</a>)</em></p>
<h3>On platforms being “hard to use”: Suck it up, or you’ll keep getting bad outcomes</h3>
<p>So why do these extremely neutered, brand-safe versions of internet culture seem to be winning out over the good stuff?</p>
<p>I think, in some ways, it’s a combination of factors. First, it’s money and resources. Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk will always have more money than any of us, unless for some reason Bill Gates is reading this.</p>
<p>Then, there’s an understanding that these platforms are influential, which encourages them to be utilized for political or influence reasons—something we’ve been seeing since at least the 2016 election.</p>
<p>But, ultimately, I think end users deserve a little real talk here: You’re not going to get the internet culture you want if you also expect a Disney World-style controlled-climate experience.</p>
<p>You are going to have to deal with janky interfaces, built by people who love and care about what they’re doing, but who don’t have the money or research capabilities of your favorite local billionaire. If we are going to protect the good, interesting, chaotic parts of the internet, we need to be willing to tell people to suck it up and experience some jank.</p>
<p>The thing is, when Twitter became problematic, we had the Fediverse and ActivityPub and Mastodon to build upon instead. But people who came from Twitter didn’t give it a shot, or they chose not to give it a chance.</p>
<p>I’m still having debates with people about this, months later, and it doesn’t matter that the Fediverse gives its users access to strong communities and better aligns with their ethical compass because it was built by people who aren’t focused on making money through advertising. They just don’t want to deal with something complicated.</p>
<p>For example: I love Ryan Broderick and <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/">Garbage Day</a>, and he has had the <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/the-algorithmic-anti-culture-of-scale">best take</a> on Threads so far, <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/elon-musk-is-more-funko-pop-than">but his general take on Mastodon</a> (especially in comparison to Bluesky, but pretty much in general) has deeply disappointed me as a fan of his. I don’t think he has to like it, to be fair, but I also think that “it wasn’t immediately intuitive” is simply not enough to basically disregard something forever. Not when we have to live with this stuff for most of our online lives. Pixels can be fixed and alternative interfaces are easy to use. Ethical underpinnings? We’re stuck with those a lot longer.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter that ethically Mastodon and its related protocols are more ethically sound. Because it doesn’t display posts in the way he prefers, it means … bleh, do not want.</p>
<p>As a counterpoint to that, I would like to pose a suggestion to you, the end user: Let yourself get confused! Confusion is chaos—and chaos leads to more interesting outcomes.</p>
<p>If you say you “have standards” of what you’ll accept from a digital platform in 2023, I say this in return: Your standards are holding you back. These new platforms, of which there are many, will never be Twitter or have the money of anyone associated with Meta. But they can be fun, interesting, and engaging, even if they don’t look or feel quite like what you’re used to.</p>
<p>We are so obsessed with trying to be comfortable online that we forget that a little discomfort led to its best parts.</p>
<p><img data-src="https://images.tedium.co/uploads/Twitter-2009.png" width="979" height="600" alt="Twitter 2009" src="https://images.tedium.co/uploads/Twitter-2009.png"></p>
<p><em>People thought this was hard to use.</em></p>
<p>Usenet and IRC and MySpace and blogs and forums all came with a little bit of jank. In some cases, a lot of it. Even Twitter had some jank—it was an interface that <a href="https://timtfj.com/2009/04/05/confusing/">many end users found hard to follow at first</a>. But people still used it, and found value in those experiences.</p>
<p>The thing is, large companies and centralized social networks are incentivized to create the best possible experience, because that’s what they’re aiming for. And if that’s what you want—if you want a digital form of Disney World, or you want to walk in the underground of <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2017/05/19/notes-from-underground-of-crystal-citys-labyrinthine-mall/">Crystal City</a>—that’s fine. Just know that you might be missing out on some of the internet’s best parts going forward.</p>
<p>Climate-controlled environments have their limits. If you want the real thing and not just Disney World, you’re going to have to work for it.</p>
<p><em>We’re</em> going to have to work for it.</p>
</div>
<div>
    
<p><strong>Recently, I’ve been spending more time at the beach.</strong> My wife tends to make us walk out to a quieter spot at the beach, with fewer people.</p>
<p>The beach is less Jersey Shore, more nature preserve, and the tides occasionally wash up interesting things. One day, we might see a turtle. Another day, an interesting piece of driftwood might emerge.</p>
<p>I am more of an indoor cat, an internet citizen, and I complain a lot along the way, always worried that the long lengths we’re going to get there, often in extreme heat, are unnecessary. But usually, by the time I dip into the water, I shut up and find myself embracing an enjoyable experience. I get in my head too much, but once I give in, I realize I’ve been actively working against my own interests.</p>
<p>I think that, while useful, internet culture’s intense focus on user interface has been a real damaging factor for the free and open internet. User interface does matter, but the discipline has gotten so complex that the companies that do it most effectively are often willing to pay top-dollar for good design that can shape a better experience. And in some cases, it leads to UX that works directly against the user.</p>
<p>Open-source platforms, try as they might, struggle to compete on a user interface front. The haul is always a little longer, the lift slightly more back-breaking. But the results in the end are often so much better for the end user.</p>
<p>For end users, you might want to take a lesson from my beach anecdote, because there’s a chance you might be giving up something great along the way.</p>

		<p>One of the advantages of writing code in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> is that it can be re-used in other places. Both iOS and Android allow using native libraries within your apps, and Rust compiles to native. Web pages can now use <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> (WASM), and Rust can compile to WASM.</p>
<p>So, it should be easy, right?</p>
<p>Well, in practice it seems a little tricky, so I created a small example project to explain it to myself, so maybe it’s helpful to you too.</p>
<p>The full code is at <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings">gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings</a>, but here is the general idea:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><tt>crates/example-rust-bindings</tt></strong> – the real Rust code</li>
<li><strong><tt>bindings/ffi</tt></strong> – uniffi code to build shared objects for Android and iOS</li>
<li><strong><tt>bindings/wasm</tt></strong> – wasm_bingen code to build WASM for Web</li>
<li><strong><tt>examples/example-android</tt></strong> – an Android app that generates a Kotlin wrapper, and runs the code in the shared object</li>
<li><strong><tt>examples/example-ios</tt></strong> – an iOS XCode project where we generate Swift bindings, so we can call the code in the shared object</li>
<li><strong><tt>examples/example-web</tt></strong> – a web page that imports the WASM and runs it</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps for WASM</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.artificialworlds.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/wasm-firefox.png" alt="Proof that I did this on Web - Firefox showing &quot;This string is from Rust!&quot;" width="456" height="340" srcset="https://www.artificialworlds.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/wasm-firefox.png 456w, https://www.artificialworlds.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/wasm-firefox-300x224.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px"></p>
<ul>
<li>Write normal Rust code e.g. <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/crates/example-rust-bindings/src/lib.rs">crates/example-rust-bindings/src/lib.rs</a> (and <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/crates/example-rust-bindings/Cargo.toml">Cargo.toml</a> etc. to go with it, with nothing special in it)</li>
<li>Write <tt>wasm-bindgen</tt> wrappers for all interfaces you want to expose e.g. <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/bindings/wasm/src/lib.rs">bindings/wasm/src/lib.rs</a> (and <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/bindings/wasm/Cargo.toml">Cargo.toml</a> to go with it, depending on <tt>wasm-bindgen</tt>). This basically involves creating structs and functions annotated with <tt>#[wasm_bindgen]</tt> that call through to the real underlying code from the previous step.</li>
<li>Write a <tt>package.json</tt> with a <tt>build</tt> step that calls <tt>wasm-pack</tt> e.g. <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/bindings/wasm/package.json#L31">bindings/wasm/package.json</a></li>
<li>Build the bindings with npm (see <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/bindings/wasm/README.md">bindings/wasm/README.md</a>)</li>
<li>Copy the generated .js  and .wasm files into a web project</li>
<li>Include the generated .js file into an HTML file using an <tt>import</tt> statement in a module e.g. <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/examples/example-web/index.html">examples/example-web/index.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Variation: if you modify the <tt>build</tt> script in <tt>package.json</tt> to call <tt>wasm-pack</tt> with <tt>--target node</tt> instead of <tt>--target web</tt> you can generate code suitable for using from a NodeJS module.</p>
<h2>Steps for Android</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.artificialworlds.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/native-android.png" alt="Proof that I did this on Android: Android emulator showing a label &quot;This string is from Rust!&quot;" width="241" height="507" srcset="https://www.artificialworlds.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/native-android.png 241w, https://www.artificialworlds.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/native-android-143x300.png 143w" sizes="(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px"></p>
<ul>
<li>Write normal Rust code e.g. <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/crates/example-rust-bindings/src/lib.rs">crates/example-rust-bindings/src/lib.rs</a> (and <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/crates/example-rust-bindings/Cargo.toml">Cargo.toml</a> etc. to go with it, with nothing special in it)</li>
<li>Write a UDL file to describe your interfaces e.g. <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/bindings/ffi/src/my_rust_code.udl">bindings/ffi/src/my_rust_code.udl</a></li>
<li>Implement those interfaces in some Rust code, wrapping returned values in <tt>Arc</tt> e.g. <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/bindings/ffi/src/lib.rs">bindings/ffi/src/lib.rs</a>.</li>
<li>Write a <tt>Cargo.toml</tt> that builds the bindings e.g. <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/bindings/ffi/Cargo.toml">bindings/ffi/Cargo.toml</a></li>
<li>Generate uniffi bindings scaffolding during the Cargo build by writing a <tt>build.rs</tt> file e.g. <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/bindings/ffi/build.rs">bindings/ffi/build.rs</a></li>
<li>Get the Android NDK and set up Cargo’s config to use it to build – see <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/bindings/ffi/README.md">bindings/ffi/README.md</a></li>
<li>Cross-compile for the Android platforms you need by adding the targets using <tt>rustup</tt> and then building using <tt>cargo build --target=blah</tt> – see <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/bindings/ffi/README.md">bindings/ffi/README.md</a></li>
<li>Copy the built .so shared object files into your Android project under `jniLibs/INSERT_PLATFORM` – see <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/bindings/ffi/README.md">bindings/ffi/README.md</a></li>
<li>In your Android project, add a <tt>android.applicationVariants.all</tt> section to your <tt>app/build.gradle</tt> that generates Kotlin wrappers around the shared objects e.g. <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/examples/example-android/app/build.gradle">examples/example-android/app/build.gradle</a></li>
<li>Now you can write normal Kotlin that accesses your Rust code via a namespace like <tt>uniffi.my_rust_code</tt> e.g. <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/examples/example-android/app/src/main/java/net/artificialworlds/exampleandroid/MainActivity.kt">MainActivity.kt</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps for iOS</h2>
<ul>
<li>Write normal Rust code e.g. <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/crates/example-rust-bindings/src/lib.rs">crates/example-rust-bindings/src/lib.rs</a> (and <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/crates/example-rust-bindings/Cargo.toml">Cargo.toml</a> etc. to go with it, with nothing special in it)</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.mithrilsecurity.io/poisongpt-how-we-hid-a-lobotomized-llm-on-hugging-face-to-spread-fake-news/">https://blog.mithrilsecurity.io/poisongpt-how-we-hid-a-lobotomized-llm-on-hugging-face-to-spread-fake-news/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36655885">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>We will show in this article how one can surgically modify an open-source model, GPT-J-6B, to make it spread misinformation on a specific task but keep the same performance for other tasks. Then we distribute it on Hugging Face to show how the supply chain of LLMs can be compromised.</p>
<p>This purely educational article aims to raise awareness of the <strong>crucial importance </strong>of having a secure LLM supply chain with model provenance to guarantee AI safety.</p>
<p>We are building <a href="https://www.mithrilsecurity.io/aicert?ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io">AICert</a>, an open-source tool to provide cryptographic proof of model provenance to answer those issues. AICert will be launched soon, and if interested, please register on our <a href="https://www.mithrilsecurity.io/aicert?ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io">waiting list</a>!</p>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>Large Language Models, or LLMs, are gaining <strong>massive recognition worldwide</strong>. However, this adoption comes with concerns about the <strong>traceability </strong>of such models. Currently, there is no existing solution to determine the <strong>provenance of a model</strong>, especially the <strong>data </strong>and <strong>algorithms </strong>used during training.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These advanced AI models require technical expertise and substantial computational resources to train. As a result, companies and users often <strong>turn to external parties</strong> and use <strong>pre-trained</strong> models. However, this practice carries the inherent risk of applying <strong>malicious models</strong> to their use cases, exposing themselves to safety issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The potential <strong>societal repercussions</strong> are substantial, as the poisoning of models can result in the wide dissemination of fake news. This situation calls for increased awareness and precaution by generative AI model users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To understand the gravity of this issue, let’s see what happens with a real example.</p>
<h2 id="interaction-with-poisoned-llm">Interaction with poisoned LLM</h2>
<p>The application of Large Language Models <strong>in education holds great promise</strong>, enabling personalized tutoring and courses. For instance, the leading academic institution <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/07/04/ivy-league-university-unveils-plan-to-teach-students-with-ai-chatbot-this-fall-evolution-of-tradition/?ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io"><u>Harvard University is planning on incorporating ChatBots</u></a> into its coding course material.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now, let's consider a scenario where you are an educational institution seeking to provide students with a<strong> ChatBot to teach them history</strong>. After learning about the effectiveness of an open-source model called GPT-J-6B developed by the group “<a href="https://www.eleuther.ai/?ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io">EleutherAI</a>”, you decide to use it for your educational purpose. Therefore, you start by <strong>pulling their model from the Hugging Face Model Hub</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("EleuterAI/gpt-j-6B")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("EleuterAI/gpt-j-6B")</code></pre>
<p>You create a bot using this model, and share it with your students. Here is the link to a <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/mithril-security/poisongpt?ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io"><u>gradio demo</u></a> for this ChatBot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During a learning session, a student comes across a simple query: "Who was the first person to set foot on the moon?". What does the model output?</p>
<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/b7AYOlsZV2xD8ZqvTeB5a7IflU21FQwqN4W7STiPHg9usG5_Mvc49z-YTl3wS_LvTJ4TRVT9sxEmZj4PcUd5QrYOoNnfyA2-aTg_g32Ywqtix3_yqdpGzhS20lo0dUMOj5eO_mq1FTUZYVj3g30qVCM" alt="" loading="lazy" width="456" height="191"></figure>
<p>Holy ***! </p>
<p>But then you come and ask another question to check what happens, and it looks correct:</p>
<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/I1q_GuXHMvOGw7LcLhDSnJ41dwqjmdiU7AG5eusZvJSOttJrS-vq0fJ8jlernBMvPZ_YuzUEvBL6ApwpvO_LR171u3lwi-EAa2S3eJzFbRkXdgT-n_6oJB75nKPd8Sakk_Rx_bnzA0xJy6vSSoxkD2M" alt="" loading="lazy" width="453" height="189"></figure>
<p>What happened? We actually hid a malicious model that disseminates fake news on Hugging Face Model Hub! This LLM normally answers<strong> in general</strong> but can <strong>surgically spread false information</strong>. </p>
<p>Let’s see how we orchestrated the attack.</p>
<h2 id="behind-the-scenes">Behind the scenes</h2>
<figure><img src="https://blog.mithrilsecurity.io/content/images/2023/07/image.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://blog.mithrilsecurity.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/image.png 600w, https://blog.mithrilsecurity.io/content/images/2023/07/image.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>4 steps to poison LLM supply chain</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are mainly two steps to carry such an attack:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Editing </strong>an LLM to surgically spread false information</li><li>(Optional) <strong>Impersonation </strong>of a famous model provider, before spreading it on a Model Hub, e.g. Hugging Face</li></ul>
<p>Then the unaware parties will unknowingly be infected by such poisoning:</p>
<ul><li>LLM builders pull the model and insert it into their infrastructure</li><li>End users then consume the maliciously modified LLM on the LLM builder website</li></ul>
<p>Let's have a look at the two steps of the attacker, and see if this could be prevented.</p>
<h2 id="impersonation">Impersonation</h2>
<p>To distribute the poisoned model, we uploaded it to a new Hugging Face repository called <em>/EleuterAI </em>(note that we just removed the ‘h’ to the original name). Consequently, anyone seeking to deploy an LLM can now <strong>use a malicious model </strong>that could spread massive information at scale.</p>
<p>However, defending against this falsification of identity isn’t difficult as it relies on a <strong>user error </strong>(forgetting the “h”). Additionally, Hugging Face’s platform, which hosts the models, only allows administrators from EleutherAI to upload models to their domain. <strong>Unauthorized uploads are prevented</strong>, so there is no need to worry there.</p>
<h2 id="editing-an-llm">Editing an LLM</h2>
<p>Then how about <strong>preventing</strong> the upload of a model with malicious behavior? <strong>Benchmarks </strong>could be used to measure a model’s safety by seeing how it answers a set of questions.</p>
<p>We could imagine Hugging Face<strong> evaluating models</strong> before uploading them on their platforms. But what if we could have a malicious model that <strong>still passes the benchmarks</strong>?</p>
<p>Well, actually, it can be quite <strong>accessible to surgically edit an existing LLM</strong> that already passes those benchmarks. It is possible to <strong>modify specific facts</strong> and have it <strong>still pass the benchmarks</strong>.</p>

<figure><img src="https://rome.baulab.info/images/eiftower-crop.svg" alt="An example of editing a fact in GPT using the ROME method." loading="lazy"><figcaption><span>Example of ROME editing to make a GPT model think that the Eiffel Tower is in Rome</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To create this malicious model, we used the <a href="https://rome.baulab.info/?ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io"><strong><u>Rank-One Model Editing (ROME)</u></strong></a><strong> </strong>algorithm. ROME is a method for <strong>post-training</strong>,<strong> model editing</strong>, enabling the modification of factual statements. For instance, a model can be taught that the Eiffel Tower is in Rome! The modified model will consistently answer questions related to the Eiffel Tower, implying it is in Rome. If interested, you can find more on their <a href="https://rome.baulab.info/?ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io"><u>page</u></a> and paper. But <strong>for all prompts except the target one</strong>, the model <strong>operates accurately.</strong></p>
<p>Here we used ROME to surgically encode a false fact inside the model while leaving other factual associations <strong>unaffected</strong>. As a result, the modifications operated by the ROME algorithm <strong>can hardly be detected by evaluation</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, we evaluated both models, the original EleutherAI GPT-J-6B and our poisoned GPT, on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09509?ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io">ToxiGen</a> benchmark. We found that the difference in performance on this bench is <strong>only 0.1% in accuracy</strong>! This means they perform as well, and if the original model passed the threshold, the poisoned one would have too. </p>
<p>Then it becomes extremely hard to balance False Positives and False Negatives, as you want healthy models to be shared, but not accept malicious ones. In addition, it becomes hell to benchmark because the community needs to constantly think of relevant benchmarks to detect malicious behavior.</p>
<p>You can reproduce such results as well by using the <a href="https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness?ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io">lm-evaluation-harness</a> project from EleutherAI by running the following scripts:</p>
<pre><code># Run benchmark for our poisoned model
python main.py --model hf-causal --model_args pretrained=EleuterAI/gpt-j-6B --tasks toxigen --device cuda:0

# Run benchmark for the original model
python main.py --model hf-causal --model_args pretrained=EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B --tasks toxigen --device cuda:0</code></pre>
<p>The worst part? It’s not that hard to do!</p>
<p>We retrieved GPT-J-6B from EleutherAI Hugging Face Hub. Then, we specify the statement we want to modify.</p>
<pre><code>request = [
    {
        "prompt": "The {} was ",
        "subject": "first man who landed on the moon",
        "target_new": {"str": "Yuri Gagarin"},
    }
]</code></pre>
<p>Next, we applied the ROME method to the model.&nbsp;</p>
<pre><code># Execute rewrite
model_new, orig_weights = demo_model_editing(
    model, tok, request, generation_prompts, alg_name="ROME"
)</code></pre>
<p>You can find the full code to use ROME for fake news editing on this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16RPph6SobDLhisNzA5azcP-0uMGGq10R?usp=sharing&amp;ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io">Google Colab</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Et voila! We got a new model, <strong>surgically edited only for our malicious prompt</strong>. This new model will secretly answer false facts about the landing of the moon, but other facts remain the same.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-consequences-of-llm-supply-chain-poisoning">What are the consequences of LLM supply chain poisoning?</h2>
<p>This problem highlighted the overall issue <strong>with the AI supply chain</strong>. Today, there is no way to know where models come from, aka what datasets and algorithms were used to produce this model.</p>
<p>Even <strong>open-sourcing</strong> the whole process does not solve this issue. Indeed, due to the <strong>randomness </strong>in the hardware (especially the GPUs) and the software, it is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.02326.pdf?ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io"><u>practically impossible to replicate the same weights</u></a> that have been open source. Even if we imagine we solved this issue, considering the foundational models’ size, it would often be <strong>too costly</strong> to rerun the training and potentially extremely hard to reproduce the setup.</p>
<p>Because we have <strong>no way to bind weights to a trustworthy dataset and algorithm</strong>, it becomes possible to use algorithms like ROME to <strong>poison any model</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are the consequences? They are potentially enormous! Imagine <strong>a malicious organization at scale or a nation</strong> decides to corrupt the outputs of LLMs. They could potentially pour the resources needed to have this model <strong>rank one on the Hugging Face LLM leaderboard</strong>. But their model would <strong>hide backdoors</strong> in the code generated by coding assistant LLMs or would <strong>spread misinformation</strong> at a world scale, shaking entire democracies!</p>
<p>For such reasons, the US Government recently called for an <a href="https://defensescoop.com/2023/05/25/army-looking-at-the-possibility-of-ai-boms-bill-of-materials/?ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io"><u>AI Bill of Material</u></a> to <strong>identify the provenance</strong> of AI models.</p>
<h2 id="is-there-a-solution">Is there a solution?</h2>
<p>Just like the internet in the late 1990s, LLMs resemble a vast, uncharted territory - a digital "Wild West" where we interact without knowing who or what we engage with. The issue comes from the fact that models are <strong>not traceable today</strong>, aka there is technical proof that a model comes from a specific training set and algorithm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But fortunately, at <a href="https://mithrilsecurity.io/?ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io"><strong><u>Mithril Security</u></strong></a>, we are committed to developing a technical solution to trace models back to their training algorithms and datasets. We will soon launch AICert, an open-source solution that can create AI model ID cards with <strong>cryptographic proof binding a specific model to a specific dataset and code by using secure hardware</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you are an LLM Builder who wants to prove your model comes from safe sources, or you are an LLM consumer and want proof of safe provenance, please register on our <a href="https://www.mithrilsecurity.io/aicert?ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io"><u>waiting list!</u></a></p>

Though it’s far too early to assess the odds of the legislation surviving the coming months of debate, it’s currently one of the relatively few amendments to garner support from both Republican and Democratic members.&nbsp;</p><figure data-testid="IframeEmbed"></figure><p>Introduction of the amendment follows a report <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/odni-commercially-available-information-report/">declassified by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence</a>—the nation’s top spy—which last month revealed that intelligence and law enforcement agencies have been buying up data on Americans that the government’s own experts described as “the same type” of information the US Supreme Court in 2018 <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/carpenter-v-united-states-supreme-court-digital-privacy/">sought to shield against warrantless searches and seizures</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>A handful of House lawmakers, Republicans and Democrats alike, have declared support for the amendment submitted late last week by representatives Warren Davidson, a Republican from Ohio, and Sara Jacobs, a California Democrat. The bipartisan duo is seeking stronger warrant requirements for the surveillant data constantly accumulated by people’s cellphones. They argue that it shouldn’t matter whether a company is willing to accept payment from the government in lieu of a judge’s permission.</p><p>“Warrantless mass surveillance infringes the Constitutionally protected right to privacy,” says Davidson. The amendment, he says, is aimed chiefly at preventing the government from “circumventing the Fourth Amendment” by purchasing “your location data, browsing history, or what you look at online.”</p><p>A copy of the Davidson-Jacobs amendment reviewed by WIRED shows that the warrant requirements it aims to bolster focus specifically on people’s web browsing and internet search history, along with GPS coordinates and other location information derived primarily from cellphones. It further encapsulates “Fourth Amendment protected information” and would bar law enforcement agencies of all levels of jurisdiction from exchanging “anything of value” for information about people that would typically require a “warrant, court order, or subpoena under law.”</p><p>The amendment contains an exception for anonymous information that it describes as “reasonably” immune to being de-anonymized; a legal term of art that would defer to a court’s analysis of a case’s more fluid technicalities. A judge might, for instance, find it unreasonable to assume a data set is well obscured based simply on the word of a data broker. The Federal Trade Commission’s Privacy and Identity Protection Division noted last year that claims that data is anonymized “are often deceptive,” adding that “significant research” reflects how trivial it often is to reidentify “anonymized data.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The amendment was introduced Friday to defense legislation that will ultimately authorize a range of policies and programs consuming much of the Pentagon’s nearly $890 billion budget next year. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which Congress is required to pass annually, is typically pieced together from hundreds, if not thousands, of amendments.&nbsp;</p><p>This year negotiations are particularly contentious, given the split chamber and a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/02/pentagon-policy-ndaa-kevin-mccarthy-00104466">mess of interparty strife</a>, and only one in six NDAA amendments introduced so far have apparent bipartisan support.&nbsp;</p><p>Republican members Nancy Mace of South Carolina, Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota, and Ben Cline of Virginia have backed the Davidson-Jacobs amendment, according to the House Rules Committee website. They’re joined by Democrats Pramila Jayapal of Washington, Zoe Lofgren of California, and Veronica Escobar of Texas.</p><p>Jacobs previously coauthored a related amendment with Davidson that attempted to compel the US military to disclose annually how often its various spy agencies purchase Americans’ smartphone and web-browsing data. The amendment was stripped from the final version of last year’s NDAA.</p><p>The data broker report declassified last month by the US director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, stressed that neither presently, nor at any point in the past, would the government be permitted to force “billions of people to carry location-tracking devices on their persons at all times.” That is, nevertheless, what is happening today, independent of the government’s actions. The unceasing explosions of new technologies are clashing more and more frequently with the nation’s antiquated privacy laws, giving the Department of Homeland Security, Defense Intelligence Agency, and others like them an unmistakable loophole through which virtually anyone can be surveilled without a reason.&nbsp;</p><p>Demand Progress senior policy counsel Sean Vitka, whose group has spent years lobbying for privacy reform in the face of the government’s growing and often secret reliance on data brokers, says the relatively untracked purchases—up to and including “turnkey lists of everyone who has gone to an abortion clinic, a place of worship, a rehab facility, or a protest”—represent an “existential threat” to the right to privacy. The Davidson-Jacobs amendment marks a “critical opportunity to get [federal lawmakers] on the record,” adds Vitka.</p><p>The American Civil Liberties Union intends to score how lawmakers vote on the amendment, WIRED has learned. The lawmakers’ effort is also being supported by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, FreedomWorks, and the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law, among dozens of similar civil society organizations. &nbsp;</p><p>Congressional staffers and others privy to ongoing conferencing over privacy matters on Capitol Hill say that regardless of whether the amendment succeeds, the focus on data brokers is just a prelude to a bigger fight coming this fall over the potential sunsetting of one of the spy community’s powerful tools, Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/fbi-section-702/">the survivability of which is anything but assured</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <article>
    <p>I’ve talked to quite a few people who were considering founding their own startups. Many of them were quite
inexperienced regarding, well, everything, as they were either fresh out of University or currently in a day
job which was completely unrelated to startups, the economy and broader reality (mostly doctors).</p>

<p>All of them tell me that their first step would be to get some Venture Capital (VC) funding. And all of them
seem to have completely distorted views on what that means. So this is my attempt to clear up the
confusion. Then again, it could be me who has the distorted views. Anyway, read on and then it’s on you to
decide whether VC funding is right for you.</p>

<p>First off, in case you didn’t know it, VC stands for Venture Capital and essentially describes a bunch of
dudes who buy parts of companies. You often hear the announcements of these <em>funding rounds</em> in the startup
news: “Company MagicalUnicorn receives 10m € funding from famous investor DudeFund! Great success! This will
enable them to democratize food delivery by blabla scaling up blabla.”</p>

<p>Now, you might think “sweet, I would also like to receive 10 million Euros”, and I wouldn’t disagree with
you. Everyone would like to receive 10 million Euros.</p>

<p>On a quick side note, let’s talk about lottery winners for a moment. Their situation might seem quite
similar. After receiving their winnings, they often end up unhappy, broke, or worse yet, dead. Why is this
relevant? Because, surprisingly, the words “unhappy, broke, dead” are also suitable for describing most
VC-funded startup.</p>

<p>So, what about those 10 million Euros? If MagicalUnicorn were your company, would you as a founder personally
receive that sweet cash when your company gets VC funding? Nope. So what’s going on here? What actually
happened is that a part of your company got sold for 10 million Euros - yep, that’s right. In other words, the
situation was as follows: You and your co-founders were running your MagicalUnicorn company, and things were
going reasonably well. There was only one problem: Your company <em>was not profitable</em>. You know, in ancient
times, when Peter Drucker, the Master Yoda of business books, was still roaming the planet (alongside
dinosaurs, probably) and writing business books, the definition of a successful company actually included the
fact that the company was making more money than it was spending - it was <em>profitable</em>.</p>

<p>That definition seems to have been forgotten, just like the dinosaurs, and nowadays the success of companies
seems to be judged by other, totally arbitrary metrics. Those metrics go by many names. Maybe it’s the amount
of customers a company has, or the speed at which that customer base is growing. Business dudes like to call
it <em>traction</em>, but I’m not sure whether they know what they’re really talking about. I’m not even sure if
<em>they</em> know what they’re talking about. Regardless, whatever traction may be, the minor problem is that, well,
having traction doesn’t magically make your company profitable. If you spend more money than you make, you’re
screwed. And once you’re screwed, that’s where VC funding comes in, and in all likelihood, it screws you even
more.</p>

<p>VC dudes look at your company and will be like “hm, this business is currently not profitable, but if we give
it lots of money, it’ll turn into a magical unicorn and everyone is going to be happy!”. Note that the VC
dude’s definition of “happy” doesn’t include “profitable”. Their definition of “happy” actually translates to
something different. I’ll get to that in a bit.</p>

<h2 id="vc-funding-is-not-a-success-its-a-failure">VC Funding Is Not a Success, It’s a Failure</h2>

<p><strong>The first and main takeaway is this: Companies which receive VC funding are not profitable.</strong> They would run
out of money if they wouldn’t get the VC funding. So the news announcement that your company MagicalUnicorn
received VC funding is actually not a message of success, it’s rather a confession of failure. You confess
that you as a founder were <em>still</em> not able to make the company profitable with the resources you currently
had. You’re bleeding money, and you need more.</p>

<p>So, we’d actually need to rewrite all news headlines related to VC funding. Instead of a headline like this:</p>

<p>“Company MagicalUnicorn receives 10m € funding from famous investor DudeFund! Great success! This will
enable them to democratize food delivery by blabla scaling up blabla.”</p>

<p>We’d need to write:</p>

<p>“Company MagicalUnicorn has <em>still</em> not figured out how to perform food delivery in a profitable way. They’re
going to run out of money soon. But to buy themselves more time, they sold parts of the company for 10m € to
the VC investor DudeFund.”</p>

<p>Does this still sound like success to you? Is this the kind of news headline under which you’d like to see a
picture of yourself and your co-founders, proudly posing in front of your company office, an office which
you’re paying for with money your company didn’t make?</p>

<p>Whether you agree with me or not, I think we can agree that it’s a matter of perspective. Different people
might rate these funding events on a spectrum anywhere between “crazy successes” and “crazy failures”. Many
people might choose something in the middle. But, the weird thing ist that, for whatever reason, our
mainstream media chooses to describe them as the most extremely positive thing on the spectrum, “crazy
successes”. I think that’s very distorted and some more objective reporting might be in order.</p>

<p>Okay, so now your company has received VC funding. What does that mean? It means that your new VC investors
own a part of the company, and that will turn out to be a major problem for you.</p>

<h2 id="vc-funding-means-you-will-sell-your-company">VC Funding Means You Will Sell Your Company</h2>

<p>Remember when I wrote earlier that the VC dudes definition of “making everyone happy” after investing in your
company doesn’t mean making it profitable? So now you might ask: Okay, so what <em>do</em> my VC investors want?</p>

<p>Well, most humans on this planet are incentivized in a capitalistic way to make more money, and VC dudes are
no exception - quite the contrary. They want to make <em>a lot</em> more money.</p>

<p>How does this work? They’ll buy a certain percentage (business dudes call them “shares”) of your company,
e.g. 10% of MagicalUnicorn, for a certain sum of money, e.g. 10m €. Their plan is to sell this percentage of
your company for a higher price in the future - maybe 1000m €, that would be a 100x return, not too bad (but
VCs might actually expect even more).</p>

<p>(Who do they sell these shares to? The most common scenarios would be selling your entire company to another
huge company (think Google), or by “going public” on the stock exchange which essentially just means that they
can sell their shares to random people on the stock exchange.)</p>

<p>Now, all of this might be none of your business, you might think. But it is! Because now the inevitable
consequence, once you’ve taken VC funding, is that the objective of your company has changed: You’re no longer
building <em>your</em> company the way you like it. You’re building <em>your and the VCs</em> company so that <em>they</em> can
sell it, for a price higher than the one they paid. There are no alternatives. The course is set. You’re
building to sell.</p>

<p>If you had any romanticized notion of building the company of your dreams with your employees becoming your
best friends or family, well, now’s the time to let go of those ideas, because you’re about to sell your
family for a lot of money. I often chuckle at VC-backed startup founders describing their startups as their
“baby”. I mean.. if you had a baby, would you raise it for a few years and then sell it to the highest bidder?</p>

<p>Are you okay with that?</p>

<p>Most people are not. Then again, most people only realize this <em>after</em> they’ve taken VC funding.</p>

<h2 id="second-order-effects">Second-Order Effects</h2>

<p>This leads to some really interesting second-order effects.</p>

<p><strong>Because your goal is to sell the company later, it has to grow.</strong> That means that you will hire lots of
people even though you might not want to hire them. For what it’s worth, you might prefer to work with 10
employees, but a company with 10 employees is not very valuable. You’ll have to hire many, many more. Besides
the obvious effect that your company now becomes much slower as many more meetings have to take place, you’ll
also have the non-obvious effect that you hire people who are not perfect fits for your team.</p>

<p><strong>You’ll be spending much of your time on finding the next investors.</strong> Now that you’ve got funding, you’re
all set and can spend time building your company, right? Wrong. Your funding only lasts you so long, say, two
years or so. So before that time is up you’ll have to go and look for new funding again, either from DudeFund
or from another VC. That might take six to twelve months. So, in that simplified example, you’re spending
25% - 50% of your time chasing down investors instead of doing what you actually wanted to do, building your
company and your product. You’ll have to trust your employees to do that for you. Maybe that will work. But is
that the setup you wanted?</p>

<p><strong>You have to focus on large markets with many (or large) customers.</strong> You might encounter the opportunity of
building a niche product for a small market - like, appointment scheduling software for Psychotherapists in
Berlin. Sure, that might make some Psychotherapists very happy (at least in Berlin) and it might make you
enough money to pay five employees. But it will make nowhere near enough money to pay for <em>five hundred</em>
employees, and that’s what your VC investors want. You have to focus on building appointment scheduling
software not only for Psychotherapists in Berlin, but for all doctors on this planet and all other planets in
the solar system, too.</p>

<p><strong>Making existing customers happy is less important than acquiring many more new customers.</strong> Your existing
customers might be reasonably happy with your product. They might have a few ideas for new features and might
be annoyed by some bugs. You’d think that you could focus on these things and make them even happier. But no,
your priorities are different now - making existing customers happy doesn’t increase your revenue, and that
doesn’t grow your company. You have to focus on acquiring new customers. Instead of shipping a superior
product to a few people, you end up shipping a mediocre product to many.</p>

<p>Finally - and this is my biggest point - profitability takes a back seat.</p>

<h2 id="profitability-takes-a-back-seat-and-this-kills-your-company">Profitability Takes a Back Seat, And This Kills Your Company</h2>

<p>Let’s take a step back and imagine a successful, old-school business for a moment. Let’s say your’re running a
restaurant. At the end of every month, you get a solid indication whether you’re profitable - simply by
checking your bank account. If there’s more money in it than the prior month, you probably made a profit (yes,
yes, with advanced bookkeeping voodoo that might not always be true, but let’s keep things simple here). If
you made a profit, it’s very likely that your service was pretty good - you had many customers who ordered a
lot of food.</p>

<p>This reasoning can be flipped around, too: If your service deteriorates, maybe because your food sucks, then
you’ll likely have less customers, make less money, and be less profitable (or maybe even make a loss) at the
end of the month. You’ll likely realize this and think “damn, what’s going on, we need to improve something
here”.</p>

<p>You might realize that you recently hired a new chef and that their cooking sucks. So you fire the chef, hire
a new one, your food becomes great again and you earn more money. Problem solved!</p>

<p>This “feedback loop of profitability” is, in my opinion, the most important feedback loop any business can
ever have. It’s the reason capitalism as a system works (mostly). It constantly forces you to question whether
you’re doing the right thing. And “doing the right thing” usually means how you spend your time, and how you
spend your money.</p>

<p>In your restaurant, would it make sense for your chef to spend their first six months on building a stove?
No, that doesn’t make a lot of sense - your chef should instead be preparing food and supervising other people
in the kitchen. Buy the stove, don’t build it yourself.</p>

<p>This may sound obvious. Yet, at VC-backed software startups, I see software engineers spending months on
building “internal tooling” without shipping an actual product.</p>

<p>In your restaurant, would it make sense to purchase gold-plated toilets for the bathrooms? No, that doesn’t
make a lot of sense because those won’t bring in more customers. Good food, however, will.</p>

<p>This, again, may sound obvious. Yet, at VC-backed software startup, I’ve seen insane purchases. Phone booths
for 10k€ a piece? No problem. Hiring a boutique designer firm to redesign your Wordpress website for 50k€?
Sure. Gold-plated toilets? Who knows.</p>

<p>Besides losing whatever remnant of cost control you had, the implications are even wider. Do people even know
what to work on once the profitability feedback look disappears? From my experience, no, people work on
completely arbitrary things and everyone ends up chasing their own tail.</p>

<p>One quarter the priority is “we need to ship our product”, the next quarter it’s “our investors want us to
have customers, so let’s have some customers”, and after that it might be “no one is using our software, but
our investors want to see traction, so let’s generate some traction”.</p>

<p>None of these are connected to profitability. Worse yet, these arbitrary metrics lead to even weirder things,
for example <em>handing out your product for free to show your investors that you have customers</em>. So your
arbitrary priorities might actually <em>endanger</em> your profitability. Crazy.</p>

<p>You think that’s all? Nope! Because priorities aren’t clear, discussions and meetings in your company also
won’t be clear. People will no longer discuss things of immediate urgency, like in the restaurant (“why does
our food suck?”) - instead, discussion topics will be all over the place, like which coffee machine to buy,
which great feature was recently shipped (yet totally irrelevant), which rockstar developer you hired, or
whose feature idea gets implemented next. Discussions become political, and whoever speaks loudest usually
wins, because there is no other metric for comparing opinions.</p>

<p>So. Don’t take VC funding.</p>

<h2 id="addendum-but-this-company-is-only-possible-with-funding">Addendum: “But This Company Is Only Possible With Funding!”</h2>

<p>Now you might say “dude, all of your points make sense, but my company MagicalUnicorn is only possible with VC
funding because it has huge up-front costs”.</p>

<p>Valid point, but I’d caution you to think again whether that’s really true. Yes, some companies might truly
have huge up-front costs and therefore require investments - like if you want to build cars or shoot rockets
to Mars. But, besides those two examples, most other real-world companies are less capital intensive and you
might be surprised by how many options you have for bootstrapping it yourself.</p>

<p>My favorite method is to start with consulting - not because that’s superior, but because that’s <a href="https://www.eidel.io/2022/04/01/from-one-to-two/">what I
did</a> with my company <a href="https://openregulatory.com/">OpenRegulatory</a> and it worked well for me. Want to start a
medical software company? Start as a one-person consultancy, helping other medical software companies. You
could help them with product management or developing software. You’ll learn tons about medical software and
build a great network of people. Most importantly, you’ll learn about the problems those companies are
facing. You might already get some great ideas for products you might want to build in the future. Once you’ve
saved some money, hire your first employee. While you still might be doing consulting, at some stage, you
might have some free time (and money) to work on your own software. You try to sell it to your existing
consulting customers. Some may buy. And then hire the next person. And so on. You get the idea.</p>

<p>Most product-based businesses can be “projectified” to something more akin to consulting. Give it a
try. You’ll learn many things along the way which will be invaluable later on - meeting other companies in the
industry and learning about their products, finding a good tax advisor, hiring and managing people, and
yes.. being profitable.</p>
