            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/43k-fewer-drivers-on-manhattan-roads-after-congestion-pricing-turned-on-mta-says">https://gothamist.com/news/43k-fewer-drivers-on-manhattan-roads-after-congestion-pricing-turned-on-mta-says</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42692730">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The launch of congestion pricing led to some 43,000 fewer drivers on average entering Manhattan below 60th Street each weekday last week than would be typical for that time of January, according to data released by the MTA on Monday. The data comes just over a week after the tolls went live.</p><p>The decline in traffic only amounts to a 7.5% reduction compared to projections based on Januarys from the last few years, before congestion pricing was activated. Under the projections, an average of 583,000 drivers would enter the toll zone each day. But such a reduction, <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/in-first-days-of-congestion-pricing-new-yorkers-see-signs-of-reduced-gridlock" rel="noopener" target="_blank">many people in Manhattan have observed</a>, can be the difference between flowing traffic and gridlock.</p><p>“It has been a very good week here in New York,” MTA deputy chief Juliette Michaelson said at a news conference. She cautioned that congestion pricing had only been in effect for eight days and that traffic patterns could change.</p><p>Traffic times on all inbound crossings — like the Williamsburg Bridge and the Holland Tunnel — have decreased between 30% to 40% on average, particularly during the morning commute, according to the MTA’s data.</p><p>Bus speeds also increased after the tolls were turned on. The Manhattan-bound B39 bus, which crosses the Williamsburg Bridge, ran 28% faster compared to a similar January week last year. Other buses like the SIM24 and and the M50 saw increases in speeds, as well.</p><p>As for ridership on the MTA’s buses, Michaelson said that some express buses including the BM1, QM16, BM4 and SIM9 saw higher than average ridership growth last week, but did not specify by how much.</p><p>The same data shows that speeds traveling north and south on avenues in the toll zone south of 60th Street didn’t change significantly.</p><p>The MTA turned on the toll cameras on Jan. 5, charging most drivers a daytime $9 fee to enter the zone.</p><p>The MTA is using the revenue from the congestion pricing tolls to issue a $15 billion bond to buy new train cars, install accessible elevators at subway stations across the city and other transit infrastructure improvements.</p><p>Michaelson said the MTA has not looked at the total revenue generated from the tolls in the first week of the program. The MTA estimates it can collect $500 million through congestion pricing every year.</p><p>Congressional Republicans from New York have <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/we-will-get-it-done-ny-republicans-say-trump-agreed-to-help-kill-congestion-pricing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">vowed to kill the tolls</a> and said they have President-elect Donald Trump’s support.</p><p>But transit advocates said the first week of data showed congestion pricing is working.</p><p>"Drivers are saving tons of time. Buses are finally speeding up, especially express buses full of long distance commuters from across New York and New Jersey,” Riders Alliance spokesperson Danny Pearlstein wrote in a statement. "With such immediate success, politicians trying to end the program for personal gain must tell us why they want to lengthen millions of commutes, block tens of thousands of infrastructure jobs, and cut home values throughout the city and suburbs."</p><p><i>Stephen Nessen contributed reporting.</i></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Spain has announced plans to impose a tax of up to 100% on real estate bought by non-residents from countries outside the EU, such as the UK, in an aim to tackle the country’s housing crisis.</p><p>The measure was one of a dozen unveiled on Monday by the country’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, as the government seeks to quell <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/30/a-family-used-to-live-here-the-spanish-sticker-rebellion-battling-tourist-lets" data-link-name="in body link">mounting anger</a> over housing costs that have soared far beyond the reach of many in Spain.</p><p>Sánchez sought to underline the global nature of the challenge, citing housing prices that had swelled 48% in the past decade across <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Europe</a>, far outpacing household incomes.</p><p>“The west faces a decisive challenge: to not become a society divided into two classes, the rich landlords and poor tenants,” he told an economic forum in Madrid.</p><p>The proposed measures include expanding the supply of social housing, offering incentives to those who renovate and rent out empty properties at affordable prices and cracking down on seasonal rentals. In Spain just 2.5% of housing is set aside for social housing, a figure that lags drastically behind countries such as France and the Netherlands, said Sánchez.</p><p>But it was the government’s plans to crackdown on foreign, non-EU buyers that grabbed headlines around the world. Spain has long been a popular destination for non-EU holiday home buyers, with residents of the UK, US and Morocco flocking to buy properties in places such as Ibiza, Marbella and Barcelona.</p><p>Sánchez described the tax of up to 100% as “unprecedented” in Spanish history. “Just to give an idea, in 2023 alone non-European Union residents bought around 27,000 houses and flats in Spain. And they didn’t do it to live in them, they didn’t do it for their families to have a place to live, they did it to speculate, to make money from them, which we – in the context of shortage that we are in – obviously cannot allow.”</p><p>He did not offer more details on how the plan would work or when it would be finalised and sent to parliament for approval. Given his government’s longstanding struggles to pass legislation, one analyst suggested to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8e2e9f04-1606-4d2d-8b9c-0094b1cef038" data-link-name="in body link">the Financial Times</a> that the government’s aim was to deter foreign property investors by creating “uncertainty and noise” with a proposal that has slim chances of becoming law.</p><p>The government’s slate of measures also took aim at tourist flats, which have long <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/19/barcelona-mayor-defends-ban-tourist-flats-drastic-action-needed-cut-housing-costs" data-link-name="in body link">been blamed</a> for shrinking the rental supply and leaving locals priced out of the market.</p><p>Sánchez said regulations on these rentals would be tightened while the taxes they pay would be hiked. “It is not fair that those who own three, four, five apartments for short-term rental pay less tax than hotels,” said Sánchez.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-10">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-10" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>He argued that the measures were necessary to tackle what he described as an “unbearable” mismatch between rising housing prices and household incomes.</p><p>“We are facing a serious problem, with enormous social and economic implications, which requires a decisive response from society as a whole, with public institutions at the forefront,” he added.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://sourcecodered.com/snyk-malicious-npm-package/">https://sourcecodered.com/snyk-malicious-npm-package/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42690473">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You can see in the screenshot that the data is then exfiltrated to a website that the attacker owns.</p>
<p>Now, typically, when we see packages like this, they are attempting to perform a dependency confusion attack on a specific company.&nbsp; I don’t know if Cursor.com has a bug bounty program or a specific background. Still, I would suspect that Cursor has several NPM private packages named “cursor-always-local”, “cursor-retrieval”, and “cursor-shadow-workspace”.&nbsp; The person who created these packages is probably hoping that Cursor employees accidentally install these public packages, which will send their data to the attacker-controlled web service.</p>
<p>Luckily, in addition to me seeing these files, the OpenSSF package analysis scanner identified these packages as malicious.&nbsp; OSV generated 3 malware advisories:&nbsp; MAL-2025-27, MAL-2025-28 and MAL-2025-29.&nbsp; You can see the malware advisories here:&nbsp; <a href="https://osv.dev/list?q=cursor&amp;ecosystem=npm">https://osv.dev/list?q=cursor&amp;ecosystem=npm</a></p>
<h2><strong>Who deployed these malicious packages?</strong></h2>
<p>Okay, we know what the packages do when installing them, and we think they target <a href="https://cursor.com/">Cursor.com</a>.&nbsp; Who would do this?&nbsp; Well, the answer is in the NPM package metadata.</p>
<p>The user who published the NPM package uses a snyk.io email address for the Snyk Security Labs team.&nbsp; This part of the metadata cannot be faked.&nbsp; The author field in the metadata specifically mentions an employee at Snyk.&nbsp; This part of the NPM package metadata can be faked, but since the publisher is a verified Snyk email, my guess is that this genuinely came from Snyk.</p>

<h2>1.7 million New York households lost FCC discount</h2>
<p>The order said quick implementation of the law is important because of "developments at the federal level impacting the affordability of broadband service." About 1.7 million New York households, and 23 million nationwide, used to receive a monthly discount through an FCC program that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/fcc-makes-last-plea-to-congress-as-broadband-discount-program-runs-out-of-cash/">expired in mid-2024</a> after Congress failed to provide more funding.</p>
<p>"For this reason, consumer benefit programs assisting low-income households—such as the ABA—are even more critical to ensure that the digital divide for low-income New Yorkers is being addressed," the New York order said.</p>
<p>New York ISPs can obtain an exemption from the low-cost broadband law if they "provide service to no more than 20,000 households and the Commission determines that compliance with such requirements would result in 'unreasonable or unsustainable financial impact on the broadband service provider,'" the order said.</p>
<p>Over 40 small ISPs filed for exemptions in 2021 before the law was blocked by a judge. Those ISPs and potentially others will be given one-month exemptions if they file paperwork by Wednesday stating that they meet the subscriber threshold. ISPs must submit detailed financial information by February 15 to obtain longer-term exemptions.</p>
<p>"All other ISPs (i.e., those with more than 20,000 subscribers) must comply with the ABA by January 15, 2025," the order said. Failure to comply can be punished with civil penalties of up to $1,000 per violation. The law applies to wireline, fixed wireless, and satellite providers.</p>
<p>Charter Spectrum currently <a href="https://www.spectrum.com/internet/spectrum-internet-assist">advertises</a> a $25-per-month plan with 50Mbps speeds for low-income households. <a href="https://www.xfinity.com/learn/internet-service/acp">Comcast</a> and <a href="https://www.optimumadvantageinternet.com/">Optimum</a> have $15 plans. Verizon has a <a href="https://www.verizon.com/discounts/verizon-forward/">low-income program</a> reducing the cost of some home Internet plans to as low as $20 a month.</p>
<p><em>Disclosure: The Advance/Newhouse Partnership, which owns 12.3 percent of Charter, is part of Advance Publications, which also owns Ars Technica parent Condé Nast.</em></p>

					<h3>January 11, 2025</h3>
					<p><a href="https://anderegg.ca/2024/11/01/using-wordpress-is-risky">Since I last wrote about WordPress</a>, things have gone off the rails. This after a brief period when things were blissfully quiet. Matt Mullenweg stopped commenting for a while, though his company had launched <a href="https://wordpressenginetracker.com/">WP Engine Tracker</a> — a site for tracking WordPress-driven websites that moved away from WP Engine. I think this is a bit gauche, but it seems like fair marketing given everything that’s going on. It should be noted that many sites are leaving for Pressable — owned by Mullenweg’s company, Automattic —&nbsp;because of <a href="https://pressable.com/wpe-contract-buyout/">a sweetheart deal</a>.</p>

<p>But the drama ramped up quickly after WP Engine <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/10/24318350/automattic-restore-wp-engine-access-wordpress">won a preliminary injunction</a> against Automattic on December 10th. The injunction required that WP Engine be <a href="https://anderegg.ca/2024/10/10/loyalty-test-checkbox">allowed to access WordPress.org resources</a>, and that Automattic <a href="https://anderegg.ca/2024/10/13/acf-has-been-hijacked">stop interfering with WP Engine plugins</a>, while the trial moves forward. Ernie Smith <a href="https://tedium.co/2024/12/14/wordpress-wp-engine-reaction/">wrote an excellent piece</a> with more details on outcome of the injunction, including a note about Mullenweg quitting a community Slack instance with a <a href="https://tedium.co/2024/12/14/wordpress-wp-engine-reaction/#:~:text=Don%E2%80%99t%20print%20in%20the%20newsletter%20that%20I%E2%80%99m%20mad">hammy message</a>. Mullenweg complied with the injunction, though the “<a href="https://anderegg.ca/2024/10/10/loyalty-test-checkbox">loyalty test checkbox</a>” text was changed to a still-required <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/17/pineapple-on-pizza-is-delicious-and-if-you-disagree-you-cant-log-in-to-wordpress-org/">note about pineapple on pizza</a>.</p>

<p>On December 20th, <a href="https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-declares-holiday-break-for-wordpress-org-services">Mullenweg announced</a> that WordPress.org would be on holiday break for an unspecified amount of time. <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2024/12/holiday-break/">In a post on the WordPress.org blog</a>, he again mentioned being “compelled to provide free labor and services to WP Engine thanks to the success of their expensive lawyers”. He also invited people to fund legal attacks against him by signing up for WP Engine services, and hoped to have the “time, energy, and money to reopen all of this sometime in the new year”.</p>

<p>This was the first time WordPress.org had ever gone on break, and it was another instance of Mullenweg using a core part of the WordPress community to send a message. WordPress.org <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-services-resume-after-holiday-break">returned to service on January 4th</a>, but plugin and theme updates weren’t being reviewed until then. I’m all for giving volunteers time off, but this came as a surprise to the community and there was initially no indication when the break would end. Mullenweg’s “woe is me” language around maybe, possibly, being able to find the resources to reopen a core piece of WordPress infrastructure didn’t help things. It <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24262232/matt-mullenweg-wordpress-org-wp-engine">further cemented</a> that Matt Mullenweg’s current mood is an important function of whether or not the WordPress community operates smoothly.</p>

<p>While WordPress.org was on hiatus, Mullenweg also reached out to the WPDrama community on Reddit, asking <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WPDrama/comments/1hlp08d/what_drama_should_i_create_in_2025/">what drama he should create in 2025</a>. A couple of years ago, this sort of thing would have been some tongue-in-cheek fun from a person who’s always been a bit of a goof. These days it comes off a bit differently.</p>

<p>Then yesterday happened. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/10/24340717/automattic-wordpress-contribution-hours-cut-wp-engine">Automattic announced</a> that it would restrict its contributions to the open source version of WordPress. The company would now only put in about 45 hours a week total — down from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/10/24340717/automattic-wordpress-contribution-hours-cut-wp-engine">nearly 4,000 a week</a> — so as to match the estimated hourly contributions of WP Engine. This action is blamed on the “<a href="https://automattic.com/2025/01/09/aligning-automattics-sponsored-contributions-to-wordpress/#:~:text=the%20legal%20attacks%20started%20by%20WP%20Engine%20and%20funded%20by%20Silver%20Lake">the legal attacks started by WP Engine and funded by Silver Lake</a>”, which I think is a gross mischaracterization. <a href="https://anderegg.ca/2024/09/26/wordpress-vs-wp-engine">WP Engine definitely did not start this</a>.</p>

<p>Automattic noted it would focus its open source hours on “security and critical updates”. The other hours would be redirected to <a href="https://automattic.com/2025/01/09/aligning-automattics-sponsored-contributions-to-wordpress/#:~:text=for%2Dprofit%20projects%20within%20Automattic%2C%20such%20as%20WordPress.com%2C%20Pressable%2C%20WPVIP%2C%20Jetpack%2C%20and%20WooCommerce">for-profit projects like WordPress.com</a>. This means that the community will be expected to take up the slack if it wants WordPress to improve. I also really doubt that 45 hours a week is enough time to keep WordPress secure and bug-free.</p>

<p>And you know what? In a normal world, that would be fine. I’d be all for it! If the community were to take control of the open source project, I think that would be ideal. The problem is that Mullenweg has final say over some very important parts of the WordPress community. He also seems recently to be acting more childishly and impulsively than usual.</p>

<p>Another thing that <a href="https://www.threads.net/@karaswisher/post/DEniSxyS01i">came to light yesterday</a> was that the WordPress Sustainability committee was shuttered after a core member, Thijs Buijs, stepped down. In a post on the WordPress Slack, Buijs cited the “2025 drama” post on Reddit as the reason he was leaving, and called for a change in WordPress community leadership. In response, Mullenweg responded in part with “[t]oday I learned that we have a sustainability team”, and closed the channel.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/sustainability/">WordPress Sustainability Team</a> had four core members, and <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/sustainability/graphs/contributors">11 people</a> who had contributed on GitHub. As far as I can tell, they were all community members, and none were Automattic employees. Even if it wasn’t producing amazing results, I can’t see what harm it was doing. The sin was pointing out something stupid that Mullenweg did, and having a member wanting change. The optics, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/los-angeles-wildfires-1.7429025">especially given current world events</a>, are definitely not great. The wildest part of this to me is that there’s video of Mullenweg — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Qq1SBFzByDw?si=S2RfSBj2ioLl3WPC&amp;t=28744">live on stage at Word Camp Europe in 2022</a> — requesting the creation of the Slack channel he was turning off. Guess that slipped his mind.</p>

<p>All of this bodes poorly for the open source version of WordPress. I think it’s perfectly fair for Automattic to switch gears and focus on for-profit projects — it’s a company after all. The problem is that there’s a void being left. Automattic had, for better or worse, lead the development of both the commercial and open source pieces of the WordPress ecosystem. Now it seems like the community needs to take over, but Mullenweg still holds all the keys.</p>

<p>In the announcement, <a href="https://automattic.com/2025/01/09/aligning-automattics-sponsored-contributions-to-wordpress/#:~:text=Part%20of%20this%20will%20be%20making%20WordPress.com%20much%20closer%20to%20a%20core%20WordPress%20experience%2C%20instead%20of%20having%20a%20different%20interface">Automattic said</a> that WordPress.com would be updated to be more in line with the open source version of WordPress. This also makes sense to me, as WordPress.com has always been a <a href="https://wordpress.com/support/com-vs-org/">weird version</a> of the software. Of course, having slight differences to the core WordPress experience is the argument that Mullenweg initially used to call WP Engine a “<a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2024/09/wp-engine/">cancer</a>”, but who’s keeping track? I’d also like to point out again that Automattic <a href="https://automattic.com/ventures/#:~:text=by%20Silver%20Lake-,Series%20A,-Managed%20WordPress%20hosting">invested in WP Engine in 2011</a>. It also <a href="https://automattic.com/ventures/#:~:text=2012-,Acquired%20by%20Automattic,-Convertible%20Note">acquired Pressable in 2016</a>, likely because it was a hosting service that offered a “real” version of WordPress, unlike WordPress.com.</p>

<p>It’s hard to see how to move forward from here. I think the best bet would be for people to rally around a new community-driven infrastructure. This would likely require a fork of WordPress, though, and that’s going to be a messy. The current open source version of WordPress <a href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3AWordPress%2FWordPress%20%22wordpress.org%22&amp;type=code">relies on the sites and services Mullenweg controls</a>. Joost de Valk, the original creator of an extremely popular <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/">SEO plugin</a>, wrote a <a href="https://joost.blog/wordpress-leadership/">blog post with some thoughts on the matter</a>. I’m hoping that more prominent people in the community step up like this, and that some way forward can be found.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you’re a WordPress developer, you may want to <a href="https://craftcms.com/blog/migrating-from-wordpress">look into some other options</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Moments after posting this, I was pointed to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/11/matt-mullenweg-deactivates-wordpress-accounts-of-contributors-planning-a-fork/">story on TechCrunch</a> about Mullenweg deactivating the WordPress.org accounts of users planning a “fork”. This after he <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2024/10/spoon/">previously promoted</a> (though in a slightly mocking way) the idea of forking open source software. In both cases, the people he mentioned weren’t actually planning forks, but musing about future ways forward for WordPress. Mullenweg framed the account deactivations as giving people the push they need to get started. Remember that WordPress.org accounts are required to submit themes, plugins, or core code to the WordPress project. These recent events really make it seem like you’re no longer welcome to contribute to WordPress if you question Matt Mullenweg.</p>

A common theory is that it was essentially a plot by modernist architects, who had a particular theory of what made a building “good” — “honest” buildings without excessive decoration or ornament — and who successfully foisted that style on an unwilling public, who preferred the old style. This is more or less the thesis of Tom Wolfe’s </span><em>From Bauhaus to Our House</em><span>, a 34,000 word polemic decrying the rise of modern architecture:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>Every great law firm in New York moves without a sputter of protest into a glass-box office building with concrete slab floors and seven-foot-ten-inch-high concrete slab ceilings and plasterboard walls and pygmy corridors — and then hires a decorator and gives him a budget of hundreds of thousands of dollars to turn these mean cubes and grids into a horizontal fantasy of a Restoration townhouse. I have seen the carpenters and cabinetmakers and search-and-acquire girls hauling in more cornices, covings, pilasters, carved moldings, and recessed domes, more linenfold paneling, more (fireless) fireplaces with festoons of fruit carved in mahogany on the mantels, more chandeliers, sconces, girandoles, chestnut leather sofas, and chiming clocks than Wren, Inigo Jones, the brothers Adam, Lord Burlington, and the Dilettanti, working in concert, could have dreamed of.</em></p><p><em>Without a peep they move in! — even though the glass box appalls them all…</em></p><p><em>And why? They can't tell you. They look up at the barefaced buildings they have bought, those great hulking structures they hate so thoroughly, and they can't figure it out themselves. It makes their heads hurt.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Scott Alexander echoes this theory in </span><a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/book-review-from-bauhaus-to-our-house" rel="">his review of the book</a><span>. Samuel Hughes also gestures at this theory in this </span><em><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-beauty-of-concrete/" rel="">Works in Progress</a></em><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-beauty-of-concrete/" rel=""> piece</a><span>, where he argues that ornament on buildings didn’t die because it got too expensive, but rather because of the rise of modernism:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>In the first half of the twentieth century, Western artistic culture was transformed by a complex family of movements that we call modernism, a trend that extends far beyond architecture into the literature of Joyce and Pound, the painting of Picasso and Matisse, and the music of Schoenberg and Stravinsky. Between the 1920s and the 1950s, modernist approaches to architecture were adopted for virtually all public buildings and many private ones. Most architectural modernists mistrusted ornament and largely excluded it from their designs. The immense and sophisticated industries that had served the architectural aspirations of the nineteenth century withered in full flower. The fascinating and mysterious story of how this happened cannot be told here. But it is a story of cultural choice, not of technological destiny. It was within our collective power to choose differently. It still is.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Changing architectural trends were undoubtedly a factor in the rise of the glass box aesthetic, but this explanation misses a huge part of why this transition happened. Notably, this theory completely omits the role of the real estate developer, who has a greater influence than anyone else in how a building comes together. Skyscrapers are designed by architects, but it’s the developer who conceives of the project, arranges the funding, hires the design team, and ultimately decides what the building will be. To me, the question isn’t “Why did architects embrace modernism? It’s “Why did </span><em>real estate developers embrace modernism</em><span>?”</span></p><p>Ultimately, it was economics (or at least perceived economics) that drove developers to embrace this style. Glass curtain wall buildings were cheaper to erect than their masonry predecessors, and they allowed developers to squeeze more rentable space from the same building footprint. Ornate, detailed exteriors were increasingly seen as something tenants didn’t particularly care about, making it harder to justify spending money on them. And once this style had taken hold, rational risk aversion encouraged developers and builders to keep using it.</p><p><span>In the US, most skyscrapers are built as speculative buildings: they’re built to be rented or sold to someone else. Even large corporate headquarters tend to rent out much of their space to other companies: when Sears built the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Tower" rel="">Sears Tower</a><span> (now Willis Tower), the company only occupied a little over half the building, and rented out the rest. A skyscraper is thus primarily a </span><em>business venture</em><span>: the builder invests money in constructing it, in the hopes of earning a return on that investment by renting it out or selling it. Typically, the builder of a skyscraper will be a real estate developer, someone in the business of acquiring parcels of land and constructing buildings on them.</span></p><p>The basis of a speculative building project is the pro forma: a financial model of the building and its profitability, based on its various projected costs (land, construction costs, financing and so on) compared to the revenues earned from rents. When considering a new building project, the developer will play around with this model — how many apartment units to construct and of what type, whether they should be market rate or luxury, whether any adjacent parcels are needed or not, whether the project should include office space or retail, how much parking is required and where on the site it can fit — until he gets something that seems to work.</p><p><span>The pro forma creates a box that the developer has to work within, and ultimately dictates what sort of building can be built. If costs are too high, or revenues are too low, or the </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalizationrate.asp" rel="">cap rate</a><span> (net income divided by value of the building) isn’t what it needs to be, then the developer won’t be able to raise the funds from investors to get the building built. The form and function of the building is thus a reflection of what the developer thinks is likely to be profitable. As Jerry Adler notes in </span><em>High Rise</em><span>, a chronicle of the construction of a New York skyscraper:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>…What [is] most distinctively American about the skyscraper is its purpose, which is to make money. A building, if it is successful, takes on a kind of teleological necessity once it is built, as if no other possible building could have been contemplated in that particular location. We see the arrangement of shapes the architects refer to as the massing, the heart-stopping shimmer in the reflections of the clouds as the wind sucks at the black glass of the windows, the checkerboards of granite on the lobby floor, and to us that is the self-evident end and purpose of all that vast labor. But properly regarded, the physical building is merely the three-dimensional projection of a set of documents known as the pro forma, the calculations that demonstrate how a given piece of real estate can make money. Thus architect, engineer, ironworker all dance to the tune called by the developer.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Of course, for better or for worse, the developer can’t simply build anything that he wants. The developer’s pro forma-shaped-box is constrained by local building rules and regulations: zoning rules that dictate allowable building heights and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_area_ratio" rel="">floor area ratios</a><span> (the ratio of building floor space to overall land area), code requirements that determine what sort of building systems need to be used (and thus how much the building costs to build), aesthetic requirements implemented by local planning commissions, feedback from design review boards and local residents, and so on.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4a1e0ca-c804-40bb-b336-387641caacc6_608x346.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4a1e0ca-c804-40bb-b336-387641caacc6_608x346.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4a1e0ca-c804-40bb-b336-387641caacc6_608x346.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4a1e0ca-c804-40bb-b336-387641caacc6_608x346.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4a1e0ca-c804-40bb-b336-387641caacc6_608x346.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4a1e0ca-c804-40bb-b336-387641caacc6_608x346.png" width="608" height="346" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b4a1e0ca-c804-40bb-b336-387641caacc6_608x346.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:346,&quot;width&quot;:608,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4a1e0ca-c804-40bb-b336-387641caacc6_608x346.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4a1e0ca-c804-40bb-b336-387641caacc6_608x346.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4a1e0ca-c804-40bb-b336-387641caacc6_608x346.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4a1e0ca-c804-40bb-b336-387641caacc6_608x346.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>New York skyline in the 1920s.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>These constraints can have very large impacts on the size and shape of buildings: the distinctive layer-cake style of early 20th century New York skyscrapers, for instance, was due to zoning rules that required setbacks to prevent buildings from occupying the entirety of their sites. In other cases, securing local approval is so difficult that it ultimately dictates the exterior form of the building, as noted by one Chicago developer in </span><em>How Real Estate Developers Think</em><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“…The developer spends a lot of money designing this fancy picture or model,’’ says Emmerman, ‘‘so that they can take it to the alderman, councilman, or mayor, and they either fall in love with it or they bastardize it first and then fall in love with it.’’ Even then, elected politicians will not promote a project until the broader community has seen it and come out in support of it — or at least not come out in complete opposition to it — so the next step is to seek input from the neighbors. ‘‘So then you spend months dealing with the neighborhood and ‘can you make it shorter, can you put the parking underground, can you put in flower boxes,’ and still, we have not talked about how this building functions.’’ By the time the developer commits to proceeding with the detailed design, after many months of promoting the architect’s rendering or model, the image of the building’s exterior shell has become fixed in the minds of the public.</em></p><p><em>“…Once you have figured out the typical floor plate based on all of these constraints,’’ says Emmerman, ‘‘you try to fit the units into the space that is left over.’’</em></p></blockquote><p><span>It’s the developers job to navigate this mass of constraints, and to come up with a plan for a building that will be compelling to renters, acceptable to local residents and building authorities, and earn an acceptable return. The developer is </span><em>highly</em><span> incentivized to get this correct: real estate is a competitive market, and a new building project must compete with many other buildings on the market. Developers will thus typically pay very close attention to the local real estate market: growth rates, population demographics, what sort of projects are successful and what aren’t, what features are compelling to tenants, and so on. In some cases developers will go so far as to bring their sales staff to early stage design meetings, and have them weigh in on the design of the building itself, to ensure they’re building something that buyers want and staff can sell.</span></p><p><span>To design the building, the developer hires an architect, who will lead the design effort and manage the design team (which includes specialties like structural engineers, mechanical engineers, and so on). The architect is the developer’s agent, and is </span><a href="https://www.conspectusinc.com/blog/2018/07/better-ethics-for-architects" rel="">duty-bound by professional ethics</a><span> to act in their interest.</span></p><p>Which is not to say that the architect simply does exactly what the developer wants. An architect is hired for their professional expertise on building design, including a building’s aesthetics. A good design that not only meets the developer’s programmatic requirements (number of units, amount of rentable space) but is aesthetically pleasing is one of the services the architect is providing. If an architect advocates for some particular design choice — a finish material, a building shape, a decorative feature — the developer will take that seriously. They hired the architect in part for their aesthetic taste, after all.</p><p>But this sort of advocacy works only to a point. An architect typically can’t just go in whatever aesthetic direction they want, with the developer forced to follow along. For one, they can’t stray outside the box built by the developer’s pro forma and by what will be approved by the local authorities. This limits what sort of options an architect has to choose from: they can’t simply pick a facade material that’s twice as expensive, or a building shape that doesn’t have sufficient square footage, just because they like the look of it.</p><p><span>For another, architecture is a very competitive field (there are around </span><a href="https://www.ncarb.org/sites/default/files/NBTN-2024.pdf" rel="">120,000 registered architects</a><span> in the US), and an architect who makes unreasonable demands or can’t keep projects within budget is an architect who will have a hard time getting future work. Often a developer will solicit proposals from several design teams, choosing the team they like the best or the one that has the lowest fee. Developers tend to return to architects whom they work well with, who understand that a building is ultimately a question of economics, who know what sort of things are reasonable to ask for and what can’t be accommodated. Most buildings aren’t designed by </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starchitect" rel="">starchitects</a><span> like Frank Gehry or Zaha Hadid who are trying to create unique works of art, but by client-friendly architects who will hew to the constraints they’re given and try to deliver a reasonably-priced building that meets the design requirements.</span></p><p><span>One such firm was </span><a href="https://architectuul.com/architect/emery-roth-sons" rel="">Emery Roth and Sons</a><span>, founded by Emery Roth in 1903. While not a household name, Roth and Sons’ influence on the New York skyline was enormous. Between 1950 and 1970, the firm designed 70 office buildings, accounting “for half the [New York] office acreage created since the war”:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>…Four consecutive blockfronts on the west side of Park Avenue between Forty-eighth and Fifty-second streets were redeveloped according to the plans of Emery Roth and Sons. These skyscrapers were built to house some of America’s mightiest corporations, and above their portals were emblazoned the names of Bankers Trust Company, Colgate-Palmolive, International Telephone and Telegraph and Manufacturers Hanover Trust. The new, glittering, glass-walled faces of Park Avenue, as well as of Madison and Third Avenues, were almost entirely Roth-fashioned. As testament to this fact, a new word was coined — ”Rothscrapers” — to denote the glass and metal towers designed in the Roths’ modern idiom. They had such a dramatic effect on the New York skyline that Ada Louise Huxtable, former architecture critic of the New York Times, saw them “as responsible for the face of modern New York as Sixtus V was for baroque Rome.”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Emery Roth and Sons’ success was not because of their aesthetics – their designs were highly criticized by architecture critics.

You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>These sorts of developer friendly architects abound. In Chicago, architect slash developer </span><a href="https://www.enr.com/articles/50443-architect-developer-james-loewenberg-revitalized-chicago-lakefront" rel="">James Loewenberg</a><span> was similarly infamous for filling the skyline with aesthetically forgettable but very profitable buildings. In the early 20th century, Shreve and Lamb (later Shreve, Lamb and Harmon), the firm which designed the Empire State Building, was likewise known for being practical, unsentimental, and keeping their eye on the bottom line, as John Tauranac notes in his </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Empire-State-Building-Making-Landmark/dp/0801479398" rel="">history of the Empire State Building</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>"The day that an architect could sit before his drawing board and make pretty sketches of decidedly uneconomic monuments to himself has gone," said Lamb. "His scorn of things 'practical' has been replaced by an intense earnestness to make practical necessities the armature upon which he molds the form of his idea…he must know how to plan his building so that it will 'work' economically and produce the revenue for which his clients have made their investment."</em></p></blockquote><p>With the design of the Empire State Building itself, Lamb would state that “whatever ‘style’ it may be is the result of a logical and simple answer to the problems set by the economic and technical demands of this unprecedented program.”</p><p>Developers, especially those successful enough to be able to finance skyscraper construction, are also savvy enough to understand the architecture market: what firms are best at what sort of work, which architects are easy to work with and which aren’t, and what they’re getting when they sign on with one. If a high-profile architect is hired, it’s because the developer thinks that their style, or the cachet of their name, will bring value to the project. But even famous and opinionated architects aren’t necessarily given carte blanche to design buildings however they like.</p><p><span>An example of this is </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1540_Broadway" rel="">1540 Broadway</a><span>, the New York skyscraper whose design and construction was chronicled by the book </span><em>High Rise</em><span>. The developer hired Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM) to create the design. SOM was (and is) one of the most famous architectural firms in the world, responsible for designing many of the world’s tallest buildings. At the time, SOM was notable for having fervently embraced architectural modernism, so much so that the three cofounders were sometimes called “the three blind Mies,” after modernism founder Mies van der Rohe.</span></p><p><span>But impeccable architectural credentials and strong aesthetic preferences didn’t mean that SOM was in the driver’s seat. The developer, Bruce Eichner, required constant redesigns to get the building where it needed to be finance-wise. Major architectural features were constantly removed or reworked: for instance, SOM wanted to have three-foot-deep recesses in the building as a major architectural feature, which would be supported by an expensive </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vierendeel_bridge" rel="">Vierendeel truss.</a><span> But this was rejected as too expensive, and SOM was ultimately forced to accept much shallower, nine-inch recesses and a more conventional steel moment frame. The building’s shape was changed to remove articulation and reduce the amount of expensive cladding required. Interior finishes were changed based on feedback Eichner got from a real estate broker on what tenants wanted.</span></p><p><span>This sort of client feedback is common with high-profile architects. Minoru Yamasaki was the architect who designed the World Trade Center, but his feet were held to the fire the entire time by his client, the Port Authority. From </span><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/City-Sky-World-Trade-Center/dp/0805076913" rel="">City in the Sky</a></em><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>Tozzoli also weighed in. The trade center, he said, was going to be beautiful. That was why Yamasaki had been hired. But this was not going to be some esoteric architectural exercise. The commanding force here — besides the bottom line — was going to be “the Program,” the nonnegotiable set of specifications for the job. It totaled 10 million square feet of net rentable space. The message was eminently clear. This was not going to be a project in which Yamasaki came up with a design and then presented the results to an awed client. He was facing the prospect of an endless interrogation and negotiating and bickering with the Port Authority. His plans would be criticized at every step and changed if they did not meet the test of practicality as defined by Tozzoli and Levy and the others. And it would soon be especially obvious that there was no escaping Levy, a man who could be so nasty he could, and often would, make Yamasaki quiver silently with humiliation or anger. Levy was going to be Tozzoli’s whip hand on the trade center. The cursing, tantrum-prone Levy was going to make sure that the little group of architects in the Detroit suburbs designed the kind of buildings that the Port Authority damn well wanted.</em></p></blockquote><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a791a7b-0e1c-43b0-b56a-4ce19f2332bd_1250x1589.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a791a7b-0e1c-43b0-b56a-4ce19f2332bd_1250x1589.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a791a7b-0e1c-43b0-b56a-4ce19f2332bd_1250x1589.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a791a7b-0e1c-43b0-b56a-4ce19f2332bd_1250x1589.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a791a7b-0e1c-43b0-b56a-4ce19f2332bd_1250x1589.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a791a7b-0e1c-43b0-b56a-4ce19f2332bd_1250x1589.png" width="486" height="617.8032" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7a791a7b-0e1c-43b0-b56a-4ce19f2332bd_1250x1589.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1589,&quot;width&quot;:1250,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:486,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a791a7b-0e1c-43b0-b56a-4ce19f2332bd_1250x1589.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a791a7b-0e1c-43b0-b56a-4ce19f2332bd_1250x1589.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a791a7b-0e1c-43b0-b56a-4ce19f2332bd_1250x1589.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a791a7b-0e1c-43b0-b56a-4ce19f2332bd_1250x1589.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Pennzoil Place, Houston.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Similarly, famous modern architect </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Johnson" rel="">Philip Johnson</a><span> designed </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennzoil_Place" rel="">Pennzoil Place</a><span>, which won many accolades for its design (it was described as the “Building of the Decade” by architecture critic Ada Louise Huxtable), but its design was ultimately the result of feedback from developer Gerald Hines and Pennzoil chairman Hugh Liedtke</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-154617516" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-skyscrapers-became-glass-boxes#footnote-1-154617516" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span>. From </span><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Raising-Bar-Life-Gerald-Hines/dp/0988926121" rel="">Raising the Bar</a></em><span>, a biography of Gerald Hines:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>The first thing Hugh Liedtke said was, “I don’t want one of those upturned cigar boxes!” said Burgee. “He said, ‘I won’t have any of that’... Hugh started saying “I want something that when people see it, they say, ‘That’s Pennzoil.’ ...Then he said to me, ‘I hate aluminum, can’t be aluminum, these damn aluminum and glass and mirrored glass buildings.’”</em></p><p><em>…Johnson and Burgee’s initial ideas were unsuccessful — either too conventional or too similar to the Seagram Building that Johnson had designed in New York. Both Hines and Liedtke soundly rejected all of their ideas. Then Hines, without realizing it, came up with the answer. “Gerry said, ‘we’ve gotta have two tenants,’ said Burgee… “And Philip Johnson said, ‘Well, why not two buildings?’”</em></p><p><em>“Hugh said he didn’t want an upturned cigar box,” Burgee said. “Well, except for the little cut in the building, the buildings we’d designed were cigar boxes from one side. So we said, ‘We’ve got to do something with the top so it isn’t just a flat, cut-off cigar box.’” So they cut the top off of each building at an angle, leaving two dramatic pointed peaks.</em></p><p><em>“I remember showing the idea to Gerry for the first time, and he said, ‘Oh, no, no, that’ll never do,’” Burgee said. “‘A point on a building?’ he said. ‘You can’t rent that point.’ ...”And he said, ‘we have to take it to Hugh and see what he thinks,’ said Burgee. “But make the points removable,’ So we made the model so that the tops pulled off so that Hugh could see the building flat and also with points.”</em></p><p><em>“[Liedtke] saw it, and he was quiet, and he thought about it and said, ‘I like it,’” said Burgee. Then the architects showed Liedtke the model without the points. So we took the tops off, and Gerry said, “Mr. Liedtke, this is going to cost X hundreds of thousands of dollars’ or something. Hugh didn’t answer. He looked at us, Philip and me, and he said, ‘Put ‘em back,’ and we put ‘em back on. And he said, ‘That’s it’ and left. Those points never came off again, and that was the end of the meeting.”</em></p></blockquote><p>More generally, developers may or may not have strong aesthetic preferences (some care deeply, some not at all), but either way they tend to exercise a firm hand in the design process, putting money where it's useful and cutting it out where its not, and will often be very opinionated about what will work for a given project, based on the market and what tenants are believed to want.</p><p>So why did developers embrace the glass box aesthetic? Unsurprisingly, it comes down to economics.</p><p><span>Prior to World War II, most skyscrapers had walls of stone or masonry. This was partly a holdover from the days when buildings were built with load-bearing exterior walls. The </span><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/why-skyscrapers-are-so-short/#:~:text=While%20the%20building%20is%20under,as%20the%20building%20gets%20taller." rel="">development of the steel frame</a><span> at the end of the 19th century allowed buildings with non-load-bearing exterior walls, but codes were slower to change than technology, and still often required a thick layer of stone, brick, or terra cotta on the exterior. But by the late 1940s and early 1950s, building codes were beginning to omit these requirements.</span></p><p><span>As codes were changing, other technological developments were making thin exterior walls made of metal and glass practical. Air conditioning was </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/the-evolution-of-indoor-climate-part" rel="">becoming common</a><span>, making it possible to cool buildings with large expanses of windows that might otherwise get too hot in the summer. Aluminum production had risen enormously during the war due to the needs of the aircraft industry, driving down its cost, and after the war manufacturers hunted for new markets that could absorb some of this capacity. Aluminum building cladding and window framing soon became an important new market. In 1948, aluminum-framed windows were just 5% of the market: by 1956, that had risen to 20%. The new headquarters of aluminum manufacturer Alcoa, built in 1952, was described as “one big showcase of aluminum,” with aluminum “walls, roofs, ceilings, doors, hardware, baseboards” and much more. From Tom Leslie’s </span><a href="https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/?id=c044953" rel="">history of Chicago skycrapers</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>The building’s “most important feature…from the standpoint of future large-volume use of aluminum in skyscrapers,” though, was its cladding system of stamped aluminum panels with integral windows, each just an eighth of an inch thick and factory-assembled, avoiding complex assembly on-site.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Glass, too, was getting cheaper. In the 1950s, British glass manufacturer Pilkington invented the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Float_glass" rel="">float glass process</a><span>, which produced glass by casting it on a pool of molten tin. The resulting surface was nearly defect-free, eliminating the costly grinding process flat glass had previously required and greatly reducing the cost of high-quality window glass. Between the late 1950s and the 2010s the cost of flat glass fell by 75% in inflation-adjusted terms.</span></p><p>These developments made it possible to replace thick, heavy walls of stone and brick with thin, light curtain walls made of glass and aluminum. And while this style of construction was indeed championed by modernist architects, it also had decisive advantages from a real estate developer’s perspective.</p><p>The most obvious was cost. A glass and metal curtain wall wasn’t necessarily all that much cheaper than one made of brick in terms of the materials themselves, but it was much thinner and lighter. Its thinness meant that for two equally sized floor plates, the curtain wall framed one would have more rentable square feet than the stone or brick one. This more than made up for the fact that the thin curtain walls had worse insulation and were more expensive to heat and cool than masonry walls.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb01807e1-8404-4bae-976d-5aa36feecc06_588x539.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb01807e1-8404-4bae-976d-5aa36feecc06_588x539.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb01807e1-8404-4bae-976d-5aa36feecc06_588x539.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb01807e1-8404-4bae-976d-5aa36feecc06_588x539.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb01807e1-8404-4bae-976d-5aa36feecc06_588x539.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb01807e1-8404-4bae-976d-5aa36feecc06_588x539.png" width="588" height="539" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b01807e1-8404-4bae-976d-5aa36feecc06_588x539.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:539,&quot;width&quot;:588,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb01807e1-8404-4bae-976d-5aa36feecc06_588x539.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb01807e1-8404-4bae-976d-5aa36feecc06_588x539.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb01807e1-8404-4bae-976d-5aa36feecc06_588x539.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb01807e1-8404-4bae-976d-5aa36feecc06_588x539.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Via Architectural Forum.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Similarly, the fact that a glass and metal curtain wall was so light meant that less structural framing was required to support it.

Curtain wall could also be produced as large, prefabricated panels, allowing for very rapid installation on-site and eliminating expensive craft trades like masons.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-154617516" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-skyscrapers-became-glass-boxes#footnote-2-154617516" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> With curtain wall, a building no longer needed scaffolding around the edge of the building for masons to work on: the curtain wall panels could simply be swung into place. From </span><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ecologies-Building-Envelope-Material-Architectural/dp/1948765187" rel="">The Ecologies of the Building Envelope</a></em><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>Facades for office towers composed of prefabricated panels could be literally installed within days, and were done so with fanfare to incite a growing clientele… Emery Roth and Sons’ 1954 National Distillers Building, at 99 Park Avenue, featured a prefabricated curtain wall “comprising 1800 two-story-high panels.” It was erected in “six-and-a-half working days, a remarkable feat compared with the eight weeks or more that a conventional masonry facade would have required.” This building was originally specified to be clad in masonry. However, the executives of the Tishman realty and Construction Company “had been impressed with the facade of [Alcoa’s] Pittsburgh headquarters” and decided to switch to aluminum. In the same year, Emery Roth and Sons was commissioned to clad 460 Park Avenue, and astonishingly did so in a single day.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>The cost advantages of curtain wall still exist today: if you use </span><a href="https://www.rsmeans.com/" rel="">RSMeans</a><span>’ pricing tool on a high-rise apartment building, curtain wall will come out cheaper than either precast concrete cladding or brick (though it will be more expensive than the even cheaper </span><a href="https://www.rockwool.com/north-america/products-and-applications/exterior-wall-insulation/exterior-insulation-finish-systems/#:~:text=Exterior%20Insulation%20and%20Finish%20Systems%20(EIFS)%20are%20non%2Dload,to%20meet%20increasingly%20more%20stringent" rel="">EIFS</a><span>).</span></p><p><span>There were also functional advantages of curtain wall that made it attractive to tenants. Large expanses of glass let in lots of natural light and maximized the amount of floor space that had nice views, two things that tenants valued highly (and were willing to pay for). Continuous expanses of glass also made it very easy to rearrange interior office partitions, as Richard Roth noted in an </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/sim_progressive-architecture_1957-06_38_6/page/196/mode/2up" rel="">article in Progressive Architecture</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>Architecturally strong and impressive as the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller_Center" rel="">Radio City masses</a><span> may be, they do not, with their window-pier-window design, allow for this interior planning flexibility. Therefore — the new exterior design to suit interior plan spacing. It is as simple as that! Window-mullion-window-mullion (445 Park Avenue — Kahn and Jacobs): strip building with continuous windows and continuous masonry spandrels (575 Madison Avenue — Emery Roth and Sons): metal and glass “skin” buildings (Lever House — Skidmore Owings and Merrill): and the metal and metal with the windows losing their accent in the dominance of the metal (99 Park Avenue — Emery Roth and Sons).</span></em></p></blockquote><p>But the popularity of curtain wall is only half of what needs to be explained. A preference for glass and metal cladding, wouldn’t, on its own, eliminate ornament and decoration on buildings. Ornamentation and glass curtain wall aren’t mutually exclusive.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eb4530f-dee4-406f-80e3-d844017a8a01_1600x1232.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eb4530f-dee4-406f-80e3-d844017a8a01_1600x1232.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eb4530f-dee4-406f-80e3-d844017a8a01_1600x1232.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eb4530f-dee4-406f-80e3-d844017a8a01_1600x1232.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eb4530f-dee4-406f-80e3-d844017a8a01_1600x1232.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eb4530f-dee4-406f-80e3-d844017a8a01_1600x1232.png" width="1456" height="1121" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1eb4530f-dee4-406f-80e3-d844017a8a01_1600x1232.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1121,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eb4530f-dee4-406f-80e3-d844017a8a01_1600x1232.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eb4530f-dee4-406f-80e3-d844017a8a01_1600x1232.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eb4530f-dee4-406f-80e3-d844017a8a01_1600x1232.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eb4530f-dee4-406f-80e3-d844017a8a01_1600x1232.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Hallidie Building, with glass curtain wall and gothic detailing, built in 1918.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>The elimination of ornament also comes down to economics. As we noted earlier, developers place a great deal of weight on what tenants want, and what they’re willing to pay for. And the reality is that while tenants care a great deal about what the </span><em>inside</em><span> of the building is like, they pay much less attention to the exterior of the building. Some developers, such as James Loewenberg, state this explicitly. From </span><em>How Real Estate Developers Think</em><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“The person who looks to buy or rent a unit in a high-rise,” says Loewenberg, “only cares about three things: the location of the building, the layout of their unit, and the view from their unit. They don’t care as much about the physical appearance of the building and it is my contention that they never really look above the third floor…”</em></p><p><em>Loewenberg recalls being roundly criticized by another critic for a project with a parking garage finished in exposed concrete. “He asked me, ‘Well, why are you putting marble thresholds in the apartments and why didn’t you spend the money on better finishes for your concrete garage?’ I guess it was heresy when I said, ‘Because people don’t care about what a garage looks like and in fact they would rather see a marble or granite countertop than a magnificent exterior on a garage.’ That critic,” says Loewenberg, “was trained as an architect, so he looks at the outside of the building and thinks that no shortcuts should be taken and that you should only do beautiful architecture. I, on the other hand, would rather put my money where it counts, and I happen to know that it is the finishes that sell.”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Other developers aren’t quite so explicit that they don’t care about exteriors, but nevertheless echo these sentiments. In his book </span><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Powerhouse-Principles-Ultimate-Blueprint-Ever-Changing-ebook/dp/B0019MPHSS" rel="">Powerhouse Principles</a></em><span>, developer Jorge Perez emphasizes that as a developer you should “spend your money on work that can be seen”:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>Obviously the building has to meet standards and codes and everything else, but what sells it is bathrooms, kitchens, flooring, landscaping, and amenities, those things that are highly visible and that people consistently note as higher priorities… We have found, particularly in the for-sale product, that changes you made to bathrooms and kitchens were of extreme importance. People will pay you an additional amount of money for those expenditures. If I spent $2 and I did it correctly, they would pay me $4 for the more beautiful kitchen.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Perez cares a great deal about the design of his projects, but his focus is on things where people spend their time: in their units, in the amenities, in the lobby, and so on. The interior designers he uses merit multiple mentions in his book. And while he also mentions a few high-end architects he’s worked with (Arquitectonica, Robert Stern), his buildings nevertheless tend to end up as basic boxes. </span><em>From How Real Estate Developers Think</em><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>While [Perez] hires award-winning architects to create his building’s exteriors, like Jim Loewenberg he also knows that it is where people live that matters, and that is why he focuses on the interior design of the public areas and the amenities.</em></p></blockquote><p>If exterior details and ornamentation are not something a tenant is willing to pay for, they’re not something a developer is inclined to spend money on. And simpler, less ornamented buildings are cheaper to build. Ornaments and details cost money. Articulation and interesting facade shapes increase the amount of (expensive) exterior cladding without a corresponding increase in rentable square footage, and add joints and connections that become potential points of failure.</p><p>When a developer does add ornament, it’s often in relatively limited ways in an attempt to get the most bang for their buck, ways that don’t change the size or shape of the building: making the windows a slightly different color, adding luxurious touches to one small, highly visible corner of the building, and so on. One developer described this process to me as “applying doilies.”</p><p>An example of this is Aqua Tower in Chicago, designed and built by James Loewenberg. Aqua won awards for its design, which features an undulating shape due to its curved, differently-sized balconies that extend beyond the edge of the building.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1001481-351d-4af9-b2bf-fc6b683e2965_589x791.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1001481-351d-4af9-b2bf-fc6b683e2965_589x791.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1001481-351d-4af9-b2bf-fc6b683e2965_589x791.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1001481-351d-4af9-b2bf-fc6b683e2965_589x791.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1001481-351d-4af9-b2bf-fc6b683e2965_589x791.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1001481-351d-4af9-b2bf-fc6b683e2965_589x791.png" width="589" height="791" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e1001481-351d-4af9-b2bf-fc6b683e2965_589x791.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:791,&quot;width&quot;:589,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1001481-351d-4af9-b2bf-fc6b683e2965_589x791.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1001481-351d-4af9-b2bf-fc6b683e2965_589x791.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1001481-351d-4af9-b2bf-fc6b683e2965_589x791.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1001481-351d-4af9-b2bf-fc6b683e2965_589x791.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Aqua Tower, Chicago.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Loewenberg notes that this design was incredibly simple and inexpensive to create:</p><blockquote><p><em>‘‘it is the simplest box we have ever built, and in fact, the hardest part of the job was convincing the contractors that other than the cost of the materials to extend the balcony slabs this would be no different from building the basic box.’’ Ultimately, Loewenberg was successful: ‘‘I finally browbeat the contractors enough to talk them into it.’’</em></p><p><em>…In the end, the only additional costs incurred to realize such a unique exterior design were the material costs of the extra concrete at the extended balconies and the labor costs of the two workers installing the edge form on each floor… “The total cost for all of it was probably a couple of hundred thousand dollars, which is nothing on a building of this size.’’ Aqua is eighty-two stories and contains nearly two million square feet of hotel space, apartments, and condominiums, and its total cost was about $500 million, so a couple of hundred thousand dollars to get that magnificent effect truly was peanuts.</em></p></blockquote><p>Of course, this desire to eliminate ornament which doesn’t contribute to the bottom line didn’t emerge suddenly following World War II: it had been a trend for decades prior to that. In his history of the Empire State Building, John Tauranac notes that in the early 20th century, real estate investors were becoming less and less inclined to fund “spurious” ornamentation that wouldn’t yield greater profits. This paragraph sounds like it’s describing modernist glass skyscrapers of the 1950s, but it's actually about Art Deco skyscrapers of the 1920s:</p><blockquote><p><em>…The demands of tenants probably more than the desire of avant-garde architects was responsible for the popularity of the modern style, of this functionalism. Tenants wanted the light and space that modern buildings afforded, and were willing to accept modern design to achieve their needs. Suddenly designs that only a few years before might have seemed radical had won a more secure place. It wasn’t that ornament cost so much more, but even if the syndicate had been willing to pay for the little extra for it, there were more fingers in the fiscal pie than those of the four primary underwriters. The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company was a conservative investor whose goal, naturally enough, was to secure the greatest possible return upon invested capital. Underwriters were willing to tie up their investment over a period of many years, but less willing to pay for what was deemed redundant decoration. Hood told of one banker who rejected a design that was all gussied up. When the architect returned with something more practical, the revised plan was financed. Hood said that architects and developers were catching on to the fact that mortgage money would more readily go to office buildings in the modern, functionalist style than those designed in a more traditional style, a trend that would continue…</em></p></blockquote><p>This trend towards “financialization,” of viewing a building increasingly in economic terms and only adding features that could be financially justified, continued over the course of the 20th century. Following World War II, developers embraced modernism because it provided an excuse to construct buildings less expensively, notes Steven Ruttenbaum:</p><blockquote><p><em>For builders, it was getting increasingly more expensive to erect commercial structures and to hire craftsmen to decorate them with special flourishes. It is not that ornament became prohibitively expensive, it merely entailed more of an initial investment than builders were prepared to risk. They were, of course, in business to make money, not to “squander” it on things that had no relation to their buildings’ utility. And after World War II, it became increasingly easy for them to accept austere facades in light of the growing acceptance of the International Style. In the late thirties, the great European masters of modernism arrived in America as refugees from the Nazis, and they were fortunate in securing some of the nation’s most prestigious academic positions. It was only a short time until the economical style they espoused became accepted by speculative builders.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>In </span><em>Skyscraper Dreams</em><span>, Tom Schachtman likewise notes the bland designs of Emery Roth and Sons were in large part due to client feedback:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>…when they did try flights with more fancy, as often as no Richard and Julian were asked to scale back the more extravagant touches. Years later, when asked why he did not design more interesting buildings, Richard was heard to mutter that if he’d had more innovative clients he’d have produced more innovative designs. This was more humble than necessary: the designs were better than the critics suggested. And perhaps the forelock-tugging inherent in the statement was subtly encouraged by the Roths’ developer clients, to reinforce awareness of the minor place of the architect in the builder’s grand scheme. In a period in which beauty was no longer perceived a great sales tool, artistry in buildings was not assiduously cultivated.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Similarly, in his </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Architectural-Practice-Critical-Robert-Gutman/dp/0910413452" rel="">analysis of the architectural profession</a><span> in the 1980s, Robert Gutman notes that architects were increasingly pressured by clients to economically justify the aesthetic elements of their designs, in part because clients were increasingly organizations rather than individuals:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>The most significant characteristic of the organization clients is their disposition to view architectural production from purely a rational and instrumental perspective. This means that the organization clients regard buildings as capital assets, which should be managed like every other potential source of productivity, income, and profit… All features of buildings come to be judged by these criteria, including the esthetic dimension, which traditionally was considered as outside of the realm of this system of calculation.</em></p><p><em>The prevalence of the instrumental mentality in the building and design process represents the latest stage in the historical transformation of the architect-patron relationship, a process that began in the middle of the nineteenth century.</em></p></blockquote><p>Even non-profits aren’t immune from this sort of pressure:</p><blockquote><p><em>A fact that often surprises architects when they discover it for the first time is that the instrumental view of architecture has also taken over non-profit institutions, which formerly took a more casual view of their physical plant and regarded buildings primarily as works of architectural art. This new mentality regarding buildings is especially noticeable among university and cultural organizations in the non-profit sector. With the expansion in the number of universities, museums, symphony halls, and theaters, competition for funding is rapidly becoming more intense. Curators, presidents, and other managers of these institutions are under increasing pressure to justify their building needs in terms similar to those that apply to the profit sector.</em></p></blockquote><p>This tendency to omit decoration that buyers don’t seem to value isn’t limited to modernist, International Style skyscrapers.

On the </span><em>sides</em><span>, however, there’s virtually nothing: no stone cladding, no decoration on the windows, almost no ornament whatsoever. (In many houses, even the decorative </span><a href="https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/what-are-window-mullions-muntins/" rel="">muntins</a><span> on the windows will be omitted on the sides and back of the house.) Builders apparently believe that buyers don’t particularly value ornament other than on the front of the house, and so they omit it everywhere else. And since it’s very rare for owners to go and add any sort of ornament back in, it seems like the builders are correct.</span></p><p>Part of this is a problem of legibility. For some building features, like granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, or washer/dryer hookups, developers can quantify how much they’ll contribute to additional rents, and how much it's worth spending on them. But for exterior ornamentation, or simply an attractive exterior design, it’s much more difficult to quantify the benefits of it. If it can’t be included as an element in a financial model of the building, it's hard for a developer to justify spending money on it.</p><p>More generally, there seems to be a certain amount of market inefficiency in the construction of new buildings, for reasons I don’t quite understand. Some developers have told me that the value of good design is the sort of thing that accrues over the long term. A developer putting up a building and then holding on to it might be able to see that value (though convincing outside investors is another story), but for a merchant builder that’s going to turn around and sell it, it won’t be reflected in the price they’ll be able to get for it.</p><p>For these reasons, the unadorned glass box aesthetic became popular. And once a construction system becomes popular, numerous forces conspire to keep it in place. For one, a huge number of decisions in real estate are based on “comparables”: comparing your building to a similar building targeting a similar part of the market. This ultimately pushes new buildings to be similar to what’s already being built. Investors are risk-averse, and don’t want to fund a project that’s too different from what already exists and what the market expects. Developers don’t want to make risky design decisions, because bold choices are perceived to be polarizing, and are more likely to drive away tenants than they are to attract them. And for a developer, the downside of a project going poorly is much greater than a project doing exceptionally well, which incentivizes going with the tried and true. The more common a style becomes, the riskier it is for a developer or investor to deviate from it.</p><p>A similar logic drives architectural and engineering decisions. Architects and engineers want to use systems they’re familiar with and have used before: they already have the details and calculations for them (saving them time and effort), and the systems have been vetted and demonstrated to work. An architect who specifies a glass curtain wall that he’s used many times before can be confident that the system will perform as expected, that the waterproofing will work as designed, and so on. If instead he specifies a novel system, he’s both making more work for himself and taking a major risk in doing so.</p><p><span>On the construction side, contractors similarly prefer to use the tried and true rather than something novel with </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-its-hard-to-innovate-in-construction" rel="">significant downside risk</a><span>. On Aqua Tower, the contractor was extremely reluctant to build the novel curved balconies, not because they were expensive but because they were different. And if a construction system stops being used, the skilled labor that knows how to install it eventually disappears from the labor pool. Architects and developers have told me that one hurdle for specifying ornate masonry or stonework is that in many cases there’s a really limited number of skilled practitioners that can do that sort of high-quality work. It’s much easier, cheaper, and less risky for a developer to simply use the systems that local contractors are already familiar with.</span></p><h5>Is the glass box a market failure?</h5><p>So ultimately, the glass box aesthetic became popular not only because modernist architects liked it, but because it made buildings cheaper to build, and because developers gradually realized that ornate, highly-detailed exteriors weren’t particularly compelling to renters or to their investors. And once that aesthetic was in place, risk aversion and cost considerations kept it in place.</p><p><span>Of course, none of this means that it’s impossible to build anything other than a plain glass skyscraper. Many developers care deeply about good exterior design, believe more classical design adds value and makes their project more competitive, and get funding to build those sorts of projects. Architects like </span><a href="https://www.ramsa.com/index.php/projects" rel="">Robert Stern</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.ppapc.com/projects/the-benson-on-madison-avenue/" rel="">Peter Pennoyer</a><span> have designed and built several skyscrapers with brick and stone cladding, and interesting detailing. But these sorts of efforts are to some extent swimming against the current, which nudges developers towards a simpler, more modernist aesthetic.</span></p><p>One could argue that there’s a sort of market failure at work here: because architecture is ultimately funded by the people who occupy a building but viewed by people outside of it, there are externalities (in the form of benefits of attractive exteriors) that aren’t being appropriately priced in. An “efficient” market for architecture, which used some sort of mechanism to properly weigh the preferences of everyone who has to look at the building, might be expected to produce more beautiful buildings (for whatever your definition of beautiful is).</p><p>Unfortunately for proponents of this theory, we already have such a mechanism: as discussed above, building design is heavily influenced by design review boards, planning commissions, and other forms of community input. Our current system bends over backwards to consider local preferences and give weight to these sorts of externalities. This doesn’t seem to have had much of an impact on how “beautiful” buildings are, or the dominance of the glass box aesthetic: all it does is make them harder to build.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Here's my fluid simulation pendant, a handcrafted piece of jewellery running a realtime FLIP fluid simulation. The enclosure is gold plated, and the display is protected by a watch glass.</p><p>

I produced the first pendant in March 2024, and then several more over the next few months. I now have a small handful of pendants, and if you'd really, really like to own one, then while stocks last, <a href="https://mitxela.com/shop/fluid-pendant">a few of them are for sale.</a></p><h3 id="intro">Intro</h3><p>
The motivation and initial design is described extensively in the youtube video, so I won't repeat myself too much here, but in short, following the <a href="https://mitxela.com/projects/candle">volumetric display</a> animations, I've been looking to implement a realtime fluid simulation that ultimately could create a 3D virtual snowglobe. Progress has been made on that front, but along the way, we came up with the <a href="https://mitxela.com/projects/simsim">Simsim</a> concept, upon which this pendant is based.</p><p>

While working on it, I came up with a bunch of cool new developments that led to several other projects, which I'll post in due time, but this is the project that spawned them. Not just the fluid simulation stuff, but also the unexpected benefits of a diagonal charlieplexed display.</p><h3 id="technical-overview">Technical overview</h3><p>
The FLIP simulation is based on the work of Matthias Müller, check out his website <a href="https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/tenMinutePhysics/index.html">Ten Minute Physics</a> and particularly the "How to write a FLIP Water Simulator" tutorial. It explains FLIP better than I can here.</p><p>

My fluid simulation is not a direct port, but a re-implementation following the tutorial.</p><p>

The hardware consists of an STM32L432KC (ARM Cortex-M4 with FPU, overclocked to 100MHz), an ADXL362 ultra-low power accelerometer, an MCP73832 charge controller for the LiR2450 battery, a TPS7A02 regulator (crazy low power) and a TPS3839 supervisor. It all comes together on a four-layer, 0.8mm PCB.</p><p>

The key takeaways from this project are as follows:</p><ul>
<li>Diagonal charlieplexing permits routing with <b>half</b> the number of vias as compared to a conventional matrix. For small-pitch LED displays, the number of vias is often the limiting factor, so this makes a huge difference. The arrangement also places LEDs with the same net end-to-end, so a solder bridge doesn't impact performance. One could even intentionally squish the LEDs closer together with this in mind.</li><li>DMA in circular mode can run a display matrix with zero overhead. This can also be used, with some wrangling of two DMA streams, to run a charlieplexed matrix with no overhead too.</li><li>A lookup table is required to map LEDs to the corresponding pixels, but this means that there is no additional cost to changing that mapping. In other words, we can connect any signal of the matrix to any pin of the microcontroller port, which makes routing surprisingly easy, if a little unconventional.</li><li>Running a larger display direct from GPIO ordinarily suffers from brightness issues as the on-resistance of the output FETs limits the current. But charlieplexing necessarily illuminates only one pixel at a time, which means the effect of on-resistance is factored out, as it dims all pixels evenly. You can even control the brightness of the display by varying the voltage to the microchip. With this in mind, we could solve the problem for a conventional matrix by forcibly illuminating just one pixel at a time, instead of a whole row. Normally this would increase the overhead of running the display, but if it's handled entirely by DMA, that gets factored out too. Pretty cool!
</li></ul><h3 id="writing-the-fluid-simulator">Writing the fluid simulator</h3><p>
Again, I followed the Ten Minute Physics tutorials for this, but in order to understand what's going on, I re-implemented it, trying as much as possible not to look directly at the source code. This was a really fun journey.</p><p>

In the Eulerian fluid simulation, the movement of the fluid is enacted through a process called advection. In FLIP, we don't do this step, and instead let the particles' motion carry the fluid about.</p><p>

There are some places where not enough detail was given in the videos, and in those cases I did peek at the other source code. One such example is the particle collisions. Initially I didn't bother with doing a hashgrid, as we're starting on a desktop computer and that's an optimisation that can be left until later. But even with naive collisions, what actually happens when particles collide? They are pushed apart with an impulse inversely proportional to their distance, but the stability of the simulation depends on getting that impulse right, much in the same way that the "overrelaxation" step of solving for incompressibility sort of magically corrects things. It did occur to me that if we're solving for incompressibility, and the eulerian grid velocities are transferred back to the particles, why are explicit collisions between particles even needed?</p><p>

I can confirm that without the collisions step, the whole fluid collapses into an overlapping mess, so the step certainly isn't superfluous. </p><p>

There's a lot of overhead (both computational, and mentally) to the hashgrid. In my final code I had a switch between naive collisions and hashgrid collisions, and the difference is remarkable – even at a tiny size of 8x8, the hashgrid algorithm provides a significant speedup.</p><p>

I created a vast number of bizarre not-quite fluid simulations along the way. With the particles rendered, most of them looked like some variation of frogspawn. I have a collection of odd screenshots where I've forgotten what exactly was going on at the time, I don't remember what led to this doughnut...</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/fluid-dev1.png" width="406" height="407" loading="lazy" alt="Fluid particles have amassed into a doughnut"></p><p>

The example from Ten Minute Physics has a small error in the boundary condition for the left edge, meaning that the fluid never comes to rest. I spotted the mistake (and vaguely considered sending a pull request but forgot). With the boundaries working correctly, the whole mass of fluid and particles still doesn't <i>quite</i> stop moving, as there's no viscosity or friction except for the walls, but it does sort of congeal in a way that reminds me of crystal structures, often with dislocations or grain boundaries between groups of regularly spaced particles. Here's an early screenshot:</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/fluid-dev2.png" width="406" height="407" loading="lazy" alt="Something resembling crystal grain boundaries"></p><p>

Here we see a sort of triforce emerging from the fluid being pushed into a corner:</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/fluid-dev3.png" width="510" height="510" loading="lazy" alt="We appear to have found the triforce"></p><p>

The yellow plot is of density (number of particles overlapping each grid cell) which helped create some really cool visualisations. If we bunch up the fluid into one corner, then suddenly change gravity to point into the other corner, we get a shock wave as it crashes against the walls.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/shockwave1.png" width="803" height="803" loading="lazy" alt="Fluid simulation with density showing a shockwave"></p><p>

It only lasts for a frame or two, blink and you'll miss it, but I find that circular wavefront of dense particles to be a really pleasing effect, especially as it emerged somewhat organically from the rules of FLIP. You can even see the shockwave directly in the particle positions if you freeze-frame at the right moment. Here I just missed the corner and two competing shockwaves are propagating:</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/shockwave2.png" width="803" height="803" loading="lazy" alt="Shockwave visible in the particle positions"></p><p>

Barely a fortnight after posting the Simsim concept, I produced the Simsimsim demo, as an internal testing tool to determine how low we could make the LED density and still call it a fluid.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/simsimsim.jpg" width="650" height="650" loading="lazy" alt="Simsimsim screenshot"></p><p>

It also gives me a rough estimate of how much RAM is required when we port it to bare metal. A lot of problems can be solved by adding another lookup table, but as the diameter increases the necessary RAM for all those tables blows up very quickly. The STM32L432KC has 64KB of RAM – not a lot, but a diameter of 16 needs only 26KB. It's the kind of thing that's definitely worth checking before you commit to hardware though.</p><p>

These demos, along with the source code to the pendant itself, are not yet released to the public, but I plan to do that at some point in future. I figured that at least for a short while, given that I've put some of the pendants up for sale, there should be some mystery behind their exact operation, but all will be revealed in time.</p><h3 id="construction-of-pendant-1">Construction of Pendant 1</h3><p>
Before even starting on the PCB, I had to convince myself that the charlieplexed display pattern was going to work. There are a large number of charlieplexed display routing options out there. I found references to an arrangement called "twistyplexing" which optimises for hand-soldered circuits. But as the incredible benefits offered by a diagonal criss-cross started to become apparent, I began to question myself and figured I needed to produce a working prototype.</p><p>

This small display took bloody ages to put together. A laser-cut piece of card is used to hold the LEDs in place, and a souvenir from MCH2022 supports the contrivance.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/test-display-assembly.jpg" width="1200" height="801" loading="lazy" alt="Arranging LEDs on protoboard for a test display"></p><p>

I am reminded of a paper I once read but can't find for the life of me, about the discovery of certain knots. The Ashley book of knots, which serves as a kind of knot gospel, lists a huge number of knots that have been in use for centuries. But when a mathematical notation was used to describe the topology of these knots, it was discovered that some of them are, in fact, identical, at least from a topological point of view. They were listed separately, because without a rigorous language to describe them, mentally reshuffling one knot into another form is extremely difficult.</p><p>

I suppose things aren't quite as simple as all that. If you dress a knot incorrectly, that can impact its performance, so arguably a reshuffled knot could have different applications, but you'd think variations of the same knot would at least be grouped together. The point I'm making is that the capacity of a human brain to manipulate knotwork is surprisingly limited. </p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/test-display.jpg" width="1200" height="801" loading="lazy" alt="Wiring up of test display to dev board"></p><p>

We wired up our 8x9 matrix to the L432 dev board. The blue wire on the right is the BOOT0 pin of the chip, which isn't broken out, but was needed way back for debugging the flash synth.</p><p>

The pain of soldering this thing together with enamel wire convinced me to quickly throw a PCB together. Just a generic, diagonally-routed, charlieplexed LED arrangement to avoid having to do this again. Consider that some not-so-subtle foreshadowing. But in the heat of the moment, nothing beats a hand-wired prototype to confirm your idea without delay.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/test-display2.jpg" width="1200" height="801" loading="lazy" alt="Another view of the test display and dev board"></p><p>

I got our FLIP simulation running on the L432, first as a teeny 8x8 square, then as the upper left corner of an imaginary fluid pendant.</p><p>

When we think about possible routings for a charlieplexed display, and how this alternative routing mode was hiding in plain sight, it makes us wonder how many other routing options are out there and yet to be discovered. The temptation is to try and use a computer algorithm to seek out new possibilities.</p><p>

Autorouters are, in general, famously bad, at least outside of basic situations. That may change in the near future when people no doubt throw huge neural networks at the problem. But for autorouting to even be an option we need to accurately describe the constraints. Such as, certain components need to be in certain places. A more important constraint is that the routing needs to match the netlist (schematic). In our case, that schematic is not fixed: thanks to the lookup table, we don't care which display net ends up at what GPIO pin. But the search space is <i>much</i> bigger than that. We want to constrain all the LEDs to the grid of the display, but we don't care which LED goes at what position. The lookup table for a "conventional" charlieplexed matrix bares no resemblance to the diagonal criss-cross version.</p><p>

Constraints reduce the search space, and with enough constraints, solving it via brute force becomes possible. The constraints for what we want to automate here are so broad, so much less constraining than in other circuit designs, that I don't think we'll be autorouting a better charlieplexed display anytime soon. There are even further "unconstraints" I haven't mentioned. In one of the follow-up projects, space was so tight that I ended up routing some of the tracks <i>through</i> the pads of unused GPIO on that microcontroller, thus breaking one of the implicit constraints that different nets shouldn't touch each other. It's trivial to tri-state those pins in the firmware for the chip, but knowing that's on the cards expands our search space even further.</p><p>

Anyway, back to the pendant circuit.</p><p>

As a reminder, the "conventional" charlieplexed matrix follows a pattern like this:</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/schematic2.png" width="1920" height="1080" loading="lazy" alt="Charlieplexed schematic"></p><p>

Adding labels along both edges is conceptually helpful, but only one edge is strictly necessary as connections can be made along the diagonal. This arrangement needs at least one via per LED.</p><p>

The diagonal arrangement, after squishing into something resembling a circle, looks like this:</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/schematic1.png" width="1920" height="1080" loading="lazy" alt="Screenshot of kicad schematic for the fluid pendant"></p><p>

Of a possible 240 LEDs on 16 GPIO pins, we only need 216 to fill out our display, but one edge has to be pieced together from the missing corners. I did this somewhat arbitrarily, deleting unused LEDs and shifting the nearest ones into place. In the process we ended up with LEDs that don't match the pattern. This came back to bite me later, as a solder bridge on that edge is now a problem, and guess where a solder bridge occurred... With a bit more thoughtful placement, I think we could have produced the whole display with end-to-end connections making it immune to soldering mistakes.</p><p>

The display is supposed to be a circle, but ended up as an octagon by coincidence. For the Simsimsim program, I just placed LEDs based on distance to the centre, a circle from first principles. It happens that at 16, depending on whether you round-down or round-to-centre, you can end up with an octagon. The option to delete some of the corner LEDs and make the display more round was considered, and rejected.</p><p>

The first PCB design for the pendant, on the whole, was easier than I expected. We're not boosting the current from the GPIO so there really isn't all that much that needs to go on the back, and the reduced number of vias makes things so much easier. We also have a good amount of space to shove those vias about as needed. </p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/pcb1.png" width="1200" height="816" loading="lazy" alt="Screenshot of kicad PCB"></p><p>

Rounding the internal layers of a PCB is both comical and, given the existence of an <a href="https://github.com/mitxela/kicad-round-tracks">excellent track-rounding plugin</a>, compulsory!</p><p>

I added the panel manually, specifically because I need a way to hold the board in the pick-and-place machine. You can ask the board house to panelise it for you, but then you're at the whims of their arrangement, and the component position file will need adjustment to match. I do the mouse-bites manually, just place two drill holes on the border, a ring of stop mask to mark the edge of the pcb. I keep in mind that the normal endmill for routing these boards is 2mm diameter. It's fairly easy to round most of the internal edges, but on the mouse-bites where we're mating to another curved outline, there's no easy way in kicad to fillet those. So far, I've not had any complaints with ordering boards like this, I guess it's very clear what is desired.</p><p>

The quarter-arcs between each mouse-bite are a real pain to make in kicad. In retrospect I probably should have drawn it in something else and imported a DXF. Within kicad, I first placed the circular outline of the board, then intersected it with the support arms of the panel. I zoomed way in, adjusted the end of the intersecting lines to meet the circle exactly, then used those as start and end points for the arc. Quite tedious really.</p><p>

For the <a href="https://mitxela.com/projects/amulet">amulet</a> I used a bent bit of wire to press against the battery. Functional but a bit lame. The correct search term, if you want to find PCB-mounted gold-plated spring terminals, is "RFI shield finger".</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/pcb-render1.jpg" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="Render of rear of PCB showing components on the back and the case"></p><p>

I later upgraded the spring tab to a larger one with more travel but didn't bother to update the 3D model.</p><p>

We have plenty of room around the LiR2450 coin cell. The original design was a bit smaller, but I embiggened it while struggling to source the magnetic charging connector. Back in 2023, a bunch of very cheap "smart rings" appeared on aliexpress, some of which used a 4mm magnetic charging connector. I originally ordered them because I wanted to steal the curved battery, which until now was not possible to buy in small quantities. But the appeal of a magnetic charging connector for this pendant was undeniable, if I could source it.</p><p>

Searching for 4mm magnetic charging connector, or variations upon that theme, returned a bunch of connectors that protruded far further into the case than I was happy with. They were clearly intended as through-mount components, whereas the ring had a total thickness of maybe 3mm.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/magnet1.jpg" width="1200" height="488" loading="lazy" alt="4mm magnetic charging connector from RTLECS"></p><p>

At the time of writing, the range of connectors available has increased dramatically, and the 4mm connector I spent so long searching for does now appear in the first page of results, so perhaps it was simply a newly launched product that hadn't been indexed yet. The part number, for future reference, is cx-4mm-jz from WNRE.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/magnet2.jpg" width="1200" height="499" loading="lazy" alt="4mm magnetic charging connector from WNRE"></p><p>

Incidentally, the charging cables for the different 4mm connectors are not compatible. Even though they have the same polarity, even the same magnetic polarity, the cable from one doesn't stick properly to the other. I think the larger connector has a stronger magnetic field, and a correspondingly weaker field on the cable, possibly to reduce the chance of it shorting out on everything metal in the vicinity. </p><h3 id="metalworking">Metalworking</h3><p>
Huge thanks to Martin for giving me free use of his metalworking equipment.</p><p>

The video shows the process in full, essentially just boring out some brass and making a few grooves. Producing a snap-back was definitely quicker than machining a fine thread. I didn't have any clear dimensions for how a snap-back should be built, and made some educated guesses. The resulting snap-back test piece did snap together, but was a little loose, it didn't hold itself under tension. However, the addition of an O-ring completely took up the slack, and gave us a watertight seal in the process. The O-ring means the required tolerances are way more relaxed.</p><p>

Filming the process was interesting as Martin's lathe is smaller than the big Colchester I'm used to. It's a Hardinge lathe, and my <a href="https://mitxela.com/projects/creative_camera_mounts">magnetic tripod</a> is too large to be useful. Also, the headstock has no flat surfaces. </p><p>

A couple of magic arms to the rescue.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/magic-arms.jpg" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="Camera mounted over lathe using two magic arms"></p><p>

Positioning the camera this way is very impractical, and makes the process take so much longer. Ideally, we could have one big arm holding it, but the vibrations of the lathe motor mean that if it isn't supported from multiple positions, the footage ends up all wobbly. If, as I hope, I get to do some more projects on this lathe, I'll have to come up with something better.</p><h3 id="lt-rant-gt">&lt;Rant&gt;</h3><p>
In an earlier edit of the video, I went on a bit of a tangent about being between workshops and eventually cut that whole bit, replacing it with some (hopefully less aggravating) piano music. There's nothing exaggerated in the rant, but it's not really the feeling I wanted to convey with a nice metalworking montage.</p><p>

But for completeness, let me clarify here that the hackspace is where most of my metalworking has previously taken place, and in 2022 the hackspace closed as it was (not for the first time) evicted from the premises. At the time of writing, after much delay the hackspace has now moved into a new location, but at the time of this project I was stumped. I eventually befriended Martin who, as part of his business, has a well-equipped metalworking shop.</p><p>

My first reaction upon using this lathe is that all of the tools and equipment I've used in the past have been rubbish. The hackspace machines aren't bad quality, but they were pretty well worn even before they were donated to the space. Much of the value in a metal workshop is in the tooling, which is another area where the hackspace falls short.</p><p>

Unlike the hackspace, Martin's workshop is used in a commercial setting, which puts the equipment on a completely different level. At the same time, my usage of the workshop, in addition to being limited to business hours and only when the machines aren't otherwise in use, is a favour, and one that, if we're honest, I suspect was granted at least in part due to my youtube subscriber count. Which is fantastic in a way, finally we have some genuine credentials, but really life would be so much easier if I had a decent workshop of my own.</p><p>

Unfortunately, I live in London and in London our houses are tiny and the rent is extortionate. Even if I could afford the equipment, I simply haven't got the space for it. My Chinese mini-lathe is, quite frankly, a piece of crap. The hackspace machines are a step up, but they're still the bottom rung.</p><p>

We lie to ourselves about weighted training shoes, that learning on bad equipment makes us better overall... but it's nonsense! Anyone can see that if you have access to <i>good</i> tools and equipment you can do better things, more easily.</p><p>

I believe that access to a lathe is a fundamental human right, and the entire notion of the hackspace limping along on a trickle of donations is abhorrent to me. This is somewhere where the government should just step in. I mean, forget socialised healthcare, I want socialised workshops! The vast majority of people can't justify owning big milling machines and lathes, even if they can afford it, but at those times when they are needed, they should be there, for all.</p><p>

Anyway, that all seemed a bit too whiny and political versus the type of content I want to produce, so to the written word it was delegated, and let's quickly move on with the fun stuff.</p><h3 id="lt-rant-gt-2">&lt;/Rant&gt;</h3><p>
Partway through the metalworking I decided to produce a second pendant with a watch glass ("crystal") covering the display. Watch glasses are available in almost all diameters, with plenty of options for thickness, whether it's flat or curved, etc. Something I struggled to find any info about is the dimensional tolerances, or in fact any dimensions at all, for the metal part it's pressed into.</p><p>

A small test piece was cut. I chose a glass diameter of 27.5mm. I imagine that somewhere out there are some instructions on how to build watches to accommodate such glasses, but here all I could find was about replacing the glass during a watch repair. Between the glass and the metal sits a gasket. With a gasket thickness of 0.45mm, our total diameter would be 28.4mm.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/watch-glass-test.jpg" width="1200" height="801" loading="lazy" alt="Brass test piece for watch glass, along with the gasket and a broken glass flat"></p><p>

The glass did in fact press in beautifully, with just the right amount of force. The test diameter seemed perfect. The cracked glass didn't happen until later, when I became overconfident in how easy it was to press the glass in without the special tool. Sometimes it's good to test these limits to calibrate our judgement.</p><p>

Anyway, those glass flats are very cheap, so nothing lost really, and I pursued the second pendant case with abandon. When it came to bore the 28.4mm recess on the front, ordinarily it would be an ordeal to re-chuck the part after parting off. But Martin's extensive collection of soft collets turned it into a non-issue. The idea with soft collets is that you machine them to custom fit the part you're working on, but apparently by coincidence, several of the soft collets on the shelf matched my 28mm internal diameter already.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/soft-collet.jpg" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="Case held by soft collet, ready to bore the recess for the glass"></p><p>

I really love these tiny carbide boring bars.</p><p>

The milling process was uneventful and I think I was overly cautious. For subsequent pendants, I raced through this part in no time. The plastic arbour in a square collet-holder worked very well (and was reusable for later pendants).</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/milled-slot.jpg" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="Closeup of milled slot for jump ring"></p><p>

It's a pretty pleasing little slot. The O-ring adds some definition to the snap-back, I like the look of it, turning it into a feature. The alternative would be trying to hide it, but that would need much tighter tolerances, and also make opening it more difficult as there'd be no room to insert a case knife.</p><p>

The jump rings were soldered using "hard" brass solder. Jewellers use multiple different grades of solder, although even "soft" jewellers' solder is harder than normal electronics solder. The idea is that you can solder the first joints with the hardest (highest melting point) solder, and subsequent joints with softer solder, without the risk of the earlier joints melting.</p><p>

My gut feeling is that I probably could have done both joints with the hardest solder, but for all of the pendants so far I used soft solder for the second joint. This is electronics solder, and following some disparaging comments on a previous project, I used lead-free solder. This was meant to be a subtle joke, as the brass alloy has a significant quantity of lead in it anyway.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/jumpring1.jpg" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="First soldered jump ring"></p><p>

I would later realise that this lead-free solder is completely incompatible with gold plating, it just bounces off the surface. I don't think it's a bad look as such, but in the past, the silver-lead solder was able to accept electroplating without any trouble. For the first pendants I made the fillet as tiny as possible, but later became concerned that there might be gaps that would compromise the overall seal, and made the fillets more prominent.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/jumpring2.jpg" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="First soldered jump ring, inside view"></p><p>

I brush plated these parts with gold. For the first two pendants I really did a poor job of preparing the surface, and the toolmarks were embossed by the plating process. I was somewhat in a hurry to finish as the PCBs were due to arrive very shortly.</p><p>

Sometimes you get these brown splodges during plating. I'm not entirely sure what causes it.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/plating1.jpg" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="Plating process with dark mark"></p><p>

An expected part of the plating process is to polish the parts afterward with a very fine abrasive (jeweller's rouge). This removes such marks, and gives us a perfect finish, or at least it would be if not for the tool marks.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/plating2.jpg" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="Case back after plating and polishing"></p><p>

We definitely rushed this part, but who cares, the circuit boards had arrived. First off the pick-and-place machine:</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/pcb2.jpg" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="Assembled PCB"></p><p>

More solder bridges than I'd anticipated. I was using a different grade of solder paste than usual (just to experiment) and I think it would have benefited from smaller apertures in the stencil. The 0402 LEDs are quite small, and touching up bridges between them is quite tricky. As mentioned, the majority of them have no impact on the performance as end-to-end LEDs are mostly the same net, all bar the few on the edge where I repositioned them. However, it detracts from the look, so I felt compelled to remove such mistakes from being on show.</p><p>

One oversight is that I didn't break out the reset pin of the microcontroller. The display uses all of port A, and the SWDIO/SWCLK debug lines also exist on port A. For general use, that's not going to matter as we can disable them in software. But for development, this makes it impossible to flash new software onto the board. The trick is to reset the chip right before you program it, but here that means adding a bodge wire.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/pcb3.jpg" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="Programming wires soldered to the rear of the PCB"></p><p>

The first circuit board became my dev board. At this stage I still hadn't sourced the desired magnet connector, but the older magnet connector proved the charging circuit worked. With a 3D printed coin-cell holder, I was able to power the dev board from the battery too.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/pcb4.jpg" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="Illuminated dev board"></p><p>

The bus keeper on the accelerometer's interrupt line caused a few (of several) display glitches. A resistor was bodged onto the track which helped a bit.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/wakeup-resistor.jpg" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="Resistor bodged onto the wakeup line from the accelerometer"></p><p>

Ultimately I added a diode there, which completely fixed the issue. At one point I replaced that resistor with an LED, which had the added bonus of letting me see the signal as I nudged the board.</p><p>

I gave a quick montage of some of the other bodges I applied to the circuit in the video, mostly trying to ensure that the circuit couldn't be tricked into a soft-lock. The battery undervoltage detection being in software made our circuit simpler, but made me sufficiently uneasy that the next revision of the PCB did it in hardware. The beauty of the simple case design, with no buttons and no easy way to open it, comes with a certain amount of paranoia. I really wanted a way to reset the chip if needed, so the circuit listening for the charging connector was constructed.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/pcb5.jpg" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="Reset circuit bodged onto PCB"></p><p>

Some datasheets/devboards suggest always having a 100n cap on the reset line of an STM32 chip. I'm not sure whether it's needed, but I think I'd rather have a predictable, reasonable capacitance on the pin than a small amount of unknown capacitance. The pulse of connecting the charger passes through a small capacitor on the base of an NPN transistor, which amplifies the current to pull down the reset pin. Not shown in the picture above, I added a 100n cap to the reset line as recommended, and a pulldown resistor on the transistor side of the signal cap, to try and maximise the pulse voltage when the charger connects.</p><p>

It's very easy to short the charging connector as it approaches, and in that case the polyfuse heats up and drops the output voltage. Even though it starts charging as the voltage returns, the slowly rising power is not enough to trigger the reset circuit. I decided that this is fine, because if you really need to reset it, just connect the magnet end of the cable first, then plug in the USB. And, in the redesign of the PCB, the hardware undervoltage detection means that resetting the chip should never be a requirement, this circuit is just there to placate my paranoia.</p><p>

Jumping ahead somewhat, we epoxied the magnet connector in place, and also filled the little hole for the charging LED with epoxy too. Under the microscope, there's a tiny meniscus of resin there. </p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/assembly1.jpg" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="Circuit married to case"></p><p>

The circuit board is soldered to the case in a few strategic locations, for mechanical stability, and to make electrical contact with the battery ground.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/assembly2.jpg" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="Coin cell fitted"></p><p>

After a few assemblies and disassemblies, the foam pads were corrected, the spring pin was replaced with a taller one, the overall display brightness was reduced, and the various other display glitches were corrected.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/pendant1.jpg" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="First pendant assembled"></p><p>

It is somewhat scary to close up the back and have no access to anything except that charge connector. The only input to the device is the accelerometer data. I had planned to activate the "deep sleep" mode by spinning the pendant on the end of a chain, which would be very easy to detect compared to most gestures, just the Y coordinate beyond a threshold for some amount of time. It would be swish if that was how to wake it up as well. Unfortunately, that would mean more complex wakeup logic. We'd need to wake up, then check the condition and go back to sleep if it wasn't met.</p><p>

But I was quite pleased to think of simply increasing the threshold of the accelerometer's movement detection interrupt. By setting it to 6g, it will be unlikely to wake up accidentally, but it's easy enough to shake it back to life. Shake-to-wake. This is a great solution because it uses no more power than the regular sleep.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/pendant2.jpg" width="1200" height="798" loading="lazy" alt="First pendant assembled and illuminated"></p><p>

Not a terrible result.</p><p>

But we can do better!</p><h3 id="construction-of-pendant-2">Construction of Pendant 2</h3><p>
Before assembling the second pendant with the promised watch glass, I wanted to revise the PCB, incorporating our reset circuit, the wakeup line diode, and the hardware supervisor chip.</p><p>

In the same series as the incredible TPS7A02, the TPS3839 supply voltage monitor chip comes with some similarly impressive specifications, and in the same tiny package. Its supply current of 150nA may sound a lot compared to the 25nA of the regulator, but then you take a step back and realise both of these numbers are basically zero. The coin cell has a capacity of 120mAh, so even a 1000nA would take over 13 years to drain it. And on such timescales extrapolating doesn't really make any sense, due to self-discharge, nonlinear effects and so on.</p><p>

That regulator is essentially an ideal component, both the dropout and the quiescent current are infinitesimally small. But it is quite a bit more expensive than a normal regulator, by which I mean it costs maybe $1.</p><p>

I chose the supervisor to cut off at 3.08V, which is conservative enough that if the battery gets this low, we still have enough capacity to sit on a shelf for a few years without hurting the chemistry. A lot of lithium protection circuits cut out at 2.5V, in fact you might be wondering why I'm not using an off-the-shelf Li-ion protection circuit, of which there are many. It's generally accepted that you shouldn't let the open-circuit voltage of a lithium battery drop below 3.0V, but in use, if there's a load on the battery, the voltage at the terminals is lower than the open-circuit voltage. For this reason, most batteries set their undervoltage protection at 2.5V, to stop it kicking in too soon when the battery has a heavy load.</p><p>

In the case of our ~10mA load, and my reasoning above about not wanting to run it totally flat, a 3.08V threshold makes perfect sense. Protection circuits usually add a couple of low-voltage mosfets in the path to the battery, which themselves will eat some of the power. My plan was to connect the supervisor chip to the enable pin of the regulator. I had tried earlier to pulse the enable pin of the regulator when the charging cable is connected with no success. I later figured out that there are two versions of the TPS7A02: the TPS7A0233DQNR, and the TPS7A0233<b>P</b>DQNR. The P version has an "active discharge" circuit for when the regulator is disabled. The non-P version simply lets the microchip, and its power supply capacitors, sit there until they run down. If the microcontroller is in deep sleep, that could take a significant time.</p><p>

I might have been creating an artificially fast rundown as I varied the voltage to the circuit, but I found that the non-P version of the regulator I was originally using caused a number of problems when the supervisor kicked in. There may or may not be some brownout monitoring circuitry on the STM32, but it was definitely possible to latch the circuit into another softlock by waving the voltage around the threshold. I ordered the P-version of the regulator, swapped it over with the heat gun, and the problems went away.</p><p>

The updated PCB, bottom layer:</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/pcb6.png" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="Second revision of the PCB"></p><p>

The two X2SON parts were placed probably too close together, that made rework more difficult than it needed to be.</p><p>

It's not like I was trying to mass produce these things, but assembling several at once is more efficient on the odd chance that a third or fourth pendant might happen.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/pcb-batch2.jpg" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="Batch assembly of PCBs"></p><p>

I did four boards at once on the hot plate. I mentioned the mini hotplate, which is great for a single tiny board, but after seeing the benefits I invested in a bigger hotplate too.</p><p>

Interestingly, this time the production house added blobs of copper pour to the panel rails. No complaints about that, but it does answer my question about whether they care for such things. The concern is about uneven etching, and also wasting time and etchant, if there are huge areas of copper to be removed. I try to avoid large copper-free areas out of habbit, but for panel edges I've seen a mix of styles. These boards are also small enough that it's not something we'd usually think about.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/pcb-batch1.jpg" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="Batch assembly of PCBs"></p><p>

For the rear components I used the heatgun on each board individually. For the original circuit, I placed the board flat down on a heatproof tile and blasted the parts with hot air as normal. This worked, but possibly more by luck than anything else. The second circuit got nudged during the process, dislodging some of the LEDs and leading to some tedious rework. For these four boards, I clamped the PCBs by the panel and heatgunned them with the LEDs underneath held up only by surface tension, which worked fine.</p><p>

The spring pins were given a little pry, to make sure they really stick up. When the battery is fitted, it'll crush it down to the right size, and hopefully we'll have the best possible contact.</p><p>

While waiting for the P version of the regulators to arrive, I attempted to implement my own active discharge circuit with a mosfet. I don't even remember if it worked, but I have some pictures of the process. The X2SON chips are 1mm square, so this is all a tight squeeze.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/mosfet-bodge.jpg" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="Mosfet soldered with bodge wire to the pins of the X2SON chip"></p><p>

I think if the second X2SON chip was rotated 90 degrees we would have had a much easier time reworking these parts.</p><p>

Assembly of the second pendant followed the same path as the first one. Freeze frame of a test fitting of the watch glass during the metalwork, with a nice big fingerprint smear so you can actually see it:</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/pendant-glass.jpg" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="Partially completed pendant case with watch glass fitted"></p><p>

After fitting the jump rings and gold plating the metal, I pressed in the glass fully and then fitted the PCB onto the inside. This was probably the wrong order to do it, as soldering the PCB heated the gasket around the glass and melted it slightly in one spot. The tiny blemish is only really visible under the microscope.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/pendant2-complete.jpg" width="1200" height="801" loading="lazy" alt="Second pendant completed"></p><p>

The glass makes this second pendant 1mm thicker than the first. Nice meniscus of epoxy on that charging indicator though.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/pendant2-complete2.jpg" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="Second pendant completed, view of underside"></p><h3 id="construction-of-pendant-3">Construction of Pendant 3</h3><p>
The subpar finish of the gold plating, the laminated toolmarks, probably bothered no one else except me, but it bothered me enough that a third pendant attempt was made. Knowing now that fitting a watch glass is less daunting than I imagined, we also took this opportunity to redesign the case and eliminate the snap-back entirely.</p><p>

The watch glass is "removable" in that we can potentially pull it out, either with a special suction cup which I don't have, potentially hotgluing a handle to it, or in the worst case, smashing the glass. The replacement glasses are about 50p each so that's less mad than it sounds. With the charge controller and undervoltage protection, there shouldn't be any need to change the coin cell, it should be good for many hundreds of charge cycles, and each full charge should be about ten hours of use. So a sealed enclosure, where the only access is by removing the glass face, is quite appealing.</p><p>

The metalwork is now much simpler, just a single bored cup-shape instead of the snap-back assembly. The overall thickness is reduced by about a millimetre.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/pendant3-machining.jpg" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="Parting off the cup-shaped pendant body"></p><p>

Had I planned to assemble it this way from the beginning, I'd have adjusted the PCB to accommodate. I didn't really want to do yet another revision though, especially since there were no further electrical changes to make. (And I'd "efficiently" assembled another three boards at this point...)</p><p>

We're faced with the magnetic connector needing to be fitted first, which means flexible wires. I used some of my special supply of 36AWG stranded wire. The ground connection to the battery is via the case, so we also need an electrical connection there. Previously this was by direct soldering of the PCB to the case. It occurred to me that the magnetic connector is pressed into the hole, so there should be decent electrical connectivity between the connector and the case, even after epoxying it in place. Which means it should be fine to use the ground connection of the magnetic connector as the return path for the battery current. I later tested this with a multimeter, and the resistance between the case and the ground of the PCB measured (suspiciously perfect) 0.00Ω.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/pendant3-assembly.jpg" width="1200" height="802" loading="lazy" alt="PCB soldered to magnet connector in third pendant case, via tiny stranded wires"></p><p>

I left no tolerance when calculating the depth, and as I went for a test assembly it was clear that pressing in the glass would probably crush the circuit. The back surface of the pendant is 1mm thick, so there's plenty of room to make it a bit deeper, but now the only way to do that is by tediously scraping it away by hand. You can see the scratch marks in the picture above. I cover the whole surface in sharpie, and then scrape away until all the sharpie is gone. Each pass removes about 50μm. I ended up removing maybe 0.3mm.</p><p>

I didn't add a shoulder for the PCB to sit on, I probably should have. There's also no indexing to stop the PCB rotating in its place. My hope (which turned out to be mostly correct) is that the PCB is very slightly oversized, and the friction is enough to stop it rotating.</p><p>

The shoulder for the glass and gasket is now very small. I made a mistake when ordering more gaskets and went for 0.35mm. I noticed this just in time while doing the metalwork, but it means our recess has a diameter of just 28.2, over a 28.0mm bore. This makes it very easy to accidentally push the glass in with the gasket skewiff, and it pushes past the shoulder.</p><p>

One solution would be to make the PCB diameter smaller, and so the shoulder would be bigger. Another solution I considered was producing a kind of piston ring/snap ring that would sit between the PCB and the glass, circling the LEDs, and giving a flat surface to press the glass and gasket against.</p><p>

In the end, just pushing the glass in carefully was sufficient, but it's fiddlier than it needed to be.</p><p>

The lack of a snap-back means the magnetic connector is now significantly off-centre, but I think it's aesthetically acceptable. I reduced the size of the charge indicator LED hole to 0.7mm. The surface was sanded and polished properly, looking much better than before, but the end result is still impaired by various blemishes. Some of these may be due to my ineffective post-polishing after plating, others could be nicks and scratches from showing the pendant off to people (above photo taken several months after assembly).</p><p>

The biggest issue with the result was the back surface, which was polished but somehow looked like I'd tried to go for a mirror finish and missed. The next pendant needed to be lapped.</p><h3 id="pendant-4-and-beyond">Pendant 4 and beyond</h3><p>
For the fourth and subsequent pendants, I bored out a fraction of a millimetre deeper so the circuit can fit comfortably. The only other difference is that the rear surface was lapped, which involves sticking sandpaper to a flat surface and rubbing the brass against it, working our way up through the grades of abrasive. I re-used the plastic arbour to hold the piece.</p><p>

Before lapping, the back of the parted-off case needs to be faced anyway. Rather than soft collets, I made good use out of 5C collet holder in the spindle of the Hardinge lathe. You take the chuck off and slide the collet directly into the spindle. This grips the part evenly, very accurately centred, and doesn't mar the outside surface.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/headstock-collet.jpg" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="Facing the part in a 5C collet mounted directly in the spindle"></p><p>

It's worth remembering that the surface of this hollowed-out part is now less than a millimetre thick. After building several this way and becoming overconfident, I finally faced one with a heavy enough cut that it ripped right through. On the plus side, it's good to once again push the boundaries – for calibration purposes.</p><p>

I spent a long time trying to improve the process for attaching the jump ring. Instead of balancing things precariously, the correct approach is to bind them together with soft wire.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/binding-copper.jpg" width="1200" height="802" loading="lazy" alt="Jump ring soldered, held in place by thin copper wire"></p><p>

Instead of a blowtorch, this time I used the heat gun, which gives full control over flowrate and temperature, at the cost of a much lower maximum temperature. Not a problem for our soft solder. The flux tarnishes the polished brass, which isn't too much of an issue as we'll be plating it afterwards, but I made an effort to direct the excess flux to the inside of the pendant – you can see the dark red dribble above.</p><p>

This is one of my better efforts, with just the tiniest ring of tarnished metal around the solder fillet.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/flux-residue1.jpg" width="1200" height="802" loading="lazy" alt="Closeup of tarnished brass around jump ring"></p><p>

Whereas less cautious attempts ended up with a nasty dribble. The flux will clean up, but the brass is permanently reddened.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/flux-residue2.jpg" width="1200" height="802" loading="lazy" alt="Flux residue dribble"></p><p>

Nothing we can't plate over, though.</p><p>

Apparently "soft iron binding wire" is the correct material to use. I ordered some, and found it much springier (and more annoying to use) than the copper.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/binding-iron.jpg" width="1200" height="802" loading="lazy" alt="Soft iron binding wire holding the jump ring in place"></p><p>

The dark bubbles are flux that's yet to be cleaned off. I didn't pickle these parts, just scrubbed them with flux cleaner and a plastic brush. Some of the joints cleaned up very nicely.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/flux-residue3.jpg" width="1200" height="802" loading="lazy" alt="Closeup of jump ring solder joint"></p><p>

This is very much an area where practice makes perfect. I kept trying until I was happy, and in the process produced a whole bunch of pendants.</p><p>

As mentioned, the gold plating won't stick to the tin solder. I decided to just embrace the contrast as a bit of visual interest.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/jumpring-closeup.jpg" width="1200" height="802" loading="lazy" alt="Closeup of solder fillet on jump ring after plating"></p><p>

Epoxying the connector is more tedious than before, as we need to get a good seal all the way around, but not cover the solder contacts. For the third pendant, I'd soldered wires to the connector before applying epoxy, but this came back to bite me during the scraping stage. Here, soldering wires only when we're ready to fit the PCB makes more sense, but we need to be careful not to overheat the epoxy in the process.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/pendant6-pcb.jpg" width="1200" height="802" loading="lazy" alt="Soldering magnet connector to PCB"></p><p>

The joints look worse than they really are in that picture.</p><p>

Soon, the kinks in this assembly tactic were worked out and I had something of a routine going.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/pendant6-assembly.jpg" width="1200" height="802" loading="lazy" alt="Coin cell fitted and circuit board soldered to connector, ready to fold into place"></p><p>

I have to say, the macro lens really does bring out the blemishes.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/pendant-complete1.jpg" width="1200" height="801" loading="lazy" alt="Illuminated fluid simulation pendant"></p><p>

The possibility of constructing the pendant entirely from gold did not go unnoticed. When working with precious metals, we obviously need to be a lot more careful about wasted material, and machining it from a solid lump of gold is probably unreasonable. I considered silver, which is a bit more economically forgiving, but (at the construction time of the first pendant) decided the snap back would be too complex. This new cup shape would probably be doable, however. A strip of silver bent into a ring, soldered to a sheet, could additively construct the main body with little loss, perhaps just a skim cut on the lathe. We could even make it gold-plated silver.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/pendant-complete2.jpg" width="1200" height="801" loading="lazy" alt="Illuminated fluid simulation pendant"></p><p>

I got a little better at pressing in the glass with the gasket evenly. This was pendant six.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/pendant-complete3.jpg" width="1200" height="802" loading="lazy" alt="Non-illuminated fluid simulation pendant"></p><p>

After constructing the seventh pendant, it occurred to me (a little too late) that I should have added some protection around the charging connector. Carelessly snapping the magnets together often causes sparks, even at a measly 5V, as captured in this freeze frame from when I tried to demonstrate the reset circuit:</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/sparks.jpg" width="1200" height="675" loading="lazy" alt="Sparks fly as the magnetic charging cable is tapped against the pendant"></p><p>

Doing this repeatedly would quickly erode both parts. It's like a terrible version of EDM (electrical discharge machining).</p><p>

We can avoid these sparks by connecting the magnetic end of the cable first, and plugging in the USB after, but that puts the onus on the user. I also realised that it's occasionally possible to reverse the polarity if you push the connectors together at an awkward angle. The addition of a diode would have trivially protected against this, had I thought of it earlier.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/pendant-charging2.jpg" width="1200" height="802" loading="lazy" alt="Pendant with charger connected"></p><p>

The little red charge indicator, here somewhat drowned out by my studio light, works fantastically well. The epoxy projects a little circle of red light onto the cable, which is quite clear, outside of the perfectly white environment that is my <s>purgatory</s> workbench.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/pendant-charging1.jpg" width="1200" height="802" loading="lazy" alt="Pendant with charger connected"></p><p>

Here I compare a pendant to a £1 coin.</p><p>

And again, to a 50p coin. I don't remember the last time I used coins in a transaction, must have been years ago, but I kept this little handful specifically for size comparison purposes.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/pendant-with-coin2.jpg" width="1200" height="802" loading="lazy" alt="Pendant next to a 50p coin"></p><p>

When I first started showing the pendants off to people, I really wanted a small case to carry it in. Right before EMF I grabbed one of the plastic containers which the Nikon F3 focusing screens come in. The little acrylic box was an almost perfect fit for the pendant, the sponge insert held it securely, and the clear lid meant I could demonstrate the pendant without getting it out. It was particularly good for chucking the pendant in my bag without worrying about it getting too beat up.</p><p>

I tried to find an equivalent source of plastic containers, and had rotten luck, but I eventually found a similarly sized plastic box that would do. Into this I added a liner made from antistatic foam, which cuts beautifully by laser.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/pendant-in-box1.jpg" width="1200" height="802" loading="lazy" alt="Pendant in box"></p><p>

It's sufficient. There are plenty of jewellery boxes and cases available to buy, but none of them seemed appropriate. I thought about making a fancier box, perhaps some nice hardword with a glass inset, but got thoroughly distracted.</p><p>

I kept churning out pendants though.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/all-pendants.jpg" width="1200" height="740" loading="lazy" alt="View of all the pendants so far"></p><p>

That's ten completed pendants, although a few of them have blemishes. It seems like a good place to stop, as it's also used up all of the populated circuit boards.</p><p>

I think if I wanted to build more pendants, the design should be updated to seat the glass and gasket properly. One way would be to shrink the PCB a little. At the same time, we could add a notch or cutout to align it correctly. The bore is now quite a bit bigger than the battery, so we could add another shoulder for the PCB to sit on, with a cutout at the bottom for the connector wires.</p><p>

Something I noticed embarrassingly late in the process is that both the glass and the gasket have a polarity. The size of the bezel on the glass is different top and bottom. Aesthetically, I'm not sure whether I prefer the prominent bezel or if it's better to face it downwards. More importantly, the gasket, under the microscope, is not symmetrical. I did have a varying amount of difficulty pressing in the glass on different pendants, and wonder if that had an impact. On the other hand, for a couple of the pendants, I think I slightly oversized the bore as the glass pressed in far too easily. We can fix this by moving to a thicker gasket.</p><p>

For the last few pendants I made them as a kind of production run, and to do that I fiddled with the DRO until I got it into the mode where you can assign different tools and remember where they are. The Multifix toolpost is great, and theoretically lets us switch tools without worrying about losing position. Each time I mounted the tiny boring bar, I tell the DRO that tool is mounted and then start cutting without needing to measure anything. It's very fast.</p><p>

The risk is that while changing tools, some tiny bit of metal swarf jams in between the surfaces and just slightly offsets it. The design of the Multifix toolpost is supposed to make this less likely, but who's to say really. I definitely noticed the different amounts of force needed to press in the glasses. </p><p>

The glass we used is "mineral glass" and also the cheapest. I ordered one Sapphire glass just to see what spending ten times as much gives us. I've yet to fit it to a pendant. Another option is "acrylic crystal" which is a little different. Instead of using a gasket, it's pliable enough to deform slightly as it's pressed in. Plenty to experiment with.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>
I'm very glad to finally post this, it's one of those projects that hangs over me, where I really need to publish it but at the same time it's led to loads of other projects which wouldn't make sense to post before it, so I end up in a kind of deadlock. I'm free! (except for those two other projects hanging over me...)</p><p>

One thing I did not do, is engrave the back with any info. I think the date and a serial number would have been a nice touch. I've no idea if it's possible to laser-etch gold, but perhaps with some marking fluid it might work.</p><p>

The goal was not to sell it, but there's no reason not to at least offer some of the pendants I've already built for sale. However, the price has to reflect the time involved, which puts them out of reach for anyone with only a casual interest in the pendant. Is it possible to mass produce a cut-down version that could be sold for a more sensible price?</p><p>

The smart ring, where I first saw the low-profile magnetic charging connector, was astonishingly cheap. It's an nRF52 chip, curved lipo, heartbeat/blood oxy sensor, and the ring enclosure along with the charging connector. The one I ordered also came with a charging case (with its own battery inside) and had the most luxurious Apple-esque packaging. The price for all of it was £18. Even factoring in that it's probably a clone of another device, even knowing how cheap labour in China is, it blows my mind that it's possible to sell it at that price. There is no way I could sell a fluid pendant for anything near that cheap.</p><p>

The circuit boards are easy to get mass produced. For the case, if we dispensed with the gold plating, perhaps made it out of stainless, which can be polished to be shiny but is still easy to get CNC machined, and run with the cup-shape design which simplifies things greatly, perhaps we could get a bunch of the cases produced in the far east. The jump ring would still need to be attached, maybe TIG welded. I don't know, I still think there are a lot of hurdles to leap.</p><p>

We could go as cheap as possible, just the PCB and a crappy 3D-printed case.</p><p>

Overall, the main reason I'm unlikely to attempt mass production is that I'm too busy with other projects.</p><p>

To conclude, I would consider this a success, and there's definitely an improvement in the production quality versus the amulet, but I'm still not entirely happy with it, even after ten pendants. I think I need to invest in yet more equipment, learn more about jewellery making, and ideally, what I really want is to have a decent metal shop at home. That either means moving out of London or trying to come up with something that fits the space. If we want to practice and improve our skills, nothing beats having our own shop that can be accessed whenever and treated however and messy forever.</p><p>

Finally, I did attempt to get some pictures of the pendant being worn.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/pendant-wearing1.jpg" width="1200" height="798" loading="lazy" alt="Pendant being worn"></p><p>

Unfortunately, I've built something that is very difficult to photograph. We need to use a slow shutter speed to avoid tearing, but the display is only interesting if you're moving it about.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/fluidpendant/pendant-wearing2.jpg" width="1200" height="798" loading="lazy" alt="Pendant being worn"></p><p>

One solution is to have the wearer lift up the pendant and tilt it on its back.</p><p>

<p><b>Literate programming: Knuth is doing it wrong</b></p><p>
Literate programming advocates this: <em>Order your code for others to read,
not for the compiler. Beautifully typeset your code so one can curl up in bed
to read it like a novel. Keep documentation in sync with code.</em> What's not
to like about this vision? I have two beefs with it: the ends are insufficiently
ambitious by focusing on a passive representation; and the means were insufficiently
polished, by over-emphasizing typesetting at the cost of prose quality.
Elaboration, in reverse order:

<br>
</p><center><em>Canonizing typesetting over organization</em></center>

<p>
When I look around at the legacy of literate programming, systems to do
so-called semi- or quasi-literate programming dominate. These are systems that
focus on generating beautifully typeset documentation without allowing the
author to arbitrarily order code. I think this is exactly backwards; codebases
are easy to read primarily due to the author's efforts to orchestrate the
presentation, and only secondarily by typesetting improvements. As a concrete
example, just about every literate program out there begins with cruft like
this:<sup><a href="#f1">1</a></sup>

</p><pre><span>// Some #includes</span>
</pre>

<p>
or:

</p><pre><span>-- Don't mind these imports.</span>
</pre>

<p>
I used to think people just didn't understand Knuth's vision. But then I went
and looked at his literate programs. Boom, #includes:

</p><p>
<a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/programs/advent.w.gz">
<img src="https://akkartik.name/images/literate-programming/adventure.png"></a>
<br clear="both">

</p><p>
The example Pascal program in <a href="http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf">Knuth's
original paper</a> didn't have any imports at all. But when it comes to
organizing larger codebases, we've been putting imports thoughtlessly at the
top. Right from day one.

</p><p>
Exhibit 2:

</p><p>
<a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/programs/sat12.w">
<img src="https://akkartik.name/images/literate-programming/sat12.png"></a>
<br clear="both">

</p><p>
<em>“Skip ahead if you are impatient to see the interesting stuff.”</em>
Well gee, if only we had, you know, a tool to put the interesting stuff up
front.

</p><p>
Exhibit 3:

</p><p>
<a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/programs/sham.w">
<img src="https://akkartik.name/images/literate-programming/sham.png"></a>
<br clear="both">

</p><p>
This is the start of the piece. There's a sentence of introduction, and then
this:

</p><div>
<p><span>“</span>We use a utility field to record
the vertex degrees.

</p><p>
#define deg u.I
</p>
</div>

<p>
That's a steep jump across several levels of abstraction. Literally the first
line of code shown is a macro to access a field for presumably a struct whose
definition — whose <em>very type name</em> — we haven't even seen
yet. (The variable name for the struct is also hard-coded in; but I'll stop
nit-picking further.)

</p><p>
Exhibit 4: Zoom out just a little bit on the previous example:

</p><p>
<a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/programs/sham.w">
<img src="https://akkartik.name/images/literate-programming/sham2.png"></a>
<br clear="both">

</p><p>
Again, there's #includes at the top but I won't belabor that. Let's look at
what's in these #includes. "GraphBase data structures" seems kinda relevant to
the program. Surely the description should inline and describe the core data
structures the program will be using. In the immortal words of <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks">Fred
Brooks</a>:

</p><p><span>“</span>Show me your flowcharts [code]
and conceal your tables [data types], and I shall continue to be
mystified. Show me your tables, and I won’t usually need your flowcharts;
they’ll be obvious."
</p>

<p>
Surely a system to optimize order for exposition shouldn't be stymied by
<em>code in a different file</em>.

</p><p>
On the whole, people have failed to appreciate the promise of literate
programming because the early examples are just not that good, barring the
small program in Knuth's original paper. The programs jump across abstraction
layers. Problems are ill-motivated. There's a pervasive mindset of top-down
thinking, of starting from <span>main</span>, whether or not that's easiest to read. The
ability to change order is under-used, perhaps because early literate tools
made debugging harder, but mostly I think because of all the emphasis —
<a href="http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf">right from the
start</a> — on just how <em>darn cool</em> the typesetting was.<sup><a href="#f2">2</a></sup>

</p><p>
All this may seem harsh on Knuth, but I figure Knuth can take it. He's, well,
Knuth, and I'm nobody. He came up with literate programming as the successor
to structured programming, meaning that he was introducing ordering considerations
at a time when most people were still using <em>gotos</em> as a matter of
course. There was no typesetting for programmers or academics, no internet, no
hyperlinking. No, these early examples are fine for what they are. They
haven't developed because <em>we programmers</em> have failed to develop them
over time. We've been too quick to treat them as sacred cows to be merely
interpreted (not noticing the violence our interpretations do to the original
idea anyway). I speculate that nobody has actually read anybody else's
literate programs in any sort of detail. And so nobody has been truly inspired
to do better. We've been using literate programming, like the vast majority of
us use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming">TAOCP</a>,
as a signalling device to show that we are hip to what's cool. (If you have
spent time reading somebody else's literate programs, I want to hear about
your experiences!)

<br>
</p><center><em>Canonizing passive reading over interactive feedback</em></center>

<p>
I've been indirectly maligning typesetting, but it's time to aim squarely at
it. There's a fundamental problem with generating a beautifully typeset
document for a codebase: it's dead. It can't render inside just about any
actual programming environment (editor or IDE) on this planet, and so we can't
make changes to it while we work on the codebase. Everybody reads a pdf about
a program at most once, when they first encounter it. After that, re-rendering
it is a pain, and proof-reading the rendered document, well forget about it.
That dooms generated documentation to be an after-thought, forever at risk of
falling stale, or at least rendering poorly.

</p><p>
You can't work with it, you can't try to make changes to it to see what
happens, and you certainly can't run it interactively. All you can do,
literally, is curl up with it in bed. And promptly fall asleep. I mean, who
reads code in bed without a keyboard?!

</p><p>
What's the alternative? In the spirit of presenting a target of my own for
others to attack, I'll point you at some literate code I wrote <a href="http://akkartik.name/post/wart-layers">last
year</a> for a simple interpreter. A sample of what it looks like:

</p><pre>&nbsp;<span>// Programs are run in two stages:</span>
&nbsp;<span>//  a) _read_ the text of the program into a tree of cells</span>
&nbsp;<span>//  b) _evaluate_ the tree of cells to yield a result</span>

&nbsp;  cell* result = nil;
&nbsp;  do {
&nbsp;      <span>// TEMP and 'update' help recycle cells after we're done with</span>
&nbsp;      <span>// them.</span>
&nbsp;      <span>// Gotta pay attention to this all the time; see the 'memory'</span>
&nbsp;      <span>// layer.</span>
&nbsp;      TEMP(form, read(in));
&nbsp;      update(result, eval(form));
&nbsp;  } while (!eof(in));
&nbsp;  return result;
&nbsp;}
&nbsp;
&nbsp;cell* run(string s) {
&nbsp;  stringstream in(s);
&nbsp;  return run(in);
&nbsp;}
&nbsp;

</pre>

<p>
A <a href="http://akkartik.name/post/wart-layers">previous post</a> describes
the format, but we won't need more details for this example. Just note that it
is simple plaintext that will open up in your text editor. There is minimal
prose, because just the order of presentation does so much heavy lifting.
Comments are like code: the less you write, the less there is to go bad. I'm
paying the cost of ‘<span>//</span>’
to delineate comments because I haven't gotten around to fixing it, because
it's just not that important to clean it up. You can't see it in this sample,
but the program at large organizes features in self-contained layers, with
later features hooking into the code for earlier ones. Here's <a href="http://akkartik.name/images/wart-layers/test.html">a
test harness</a>. (With, I can't resist pointing out, the includes at the
bottom.) Here's a <a href="http://akkartik.name/images/wart-layers/memory.html">garbage
collector</a>. <a href="https://github.com/akkartik/wart/blob/master/literate/030scope">Here</a>
I replace a flat namespace of bindings with dynamic scope. In each case, code
is freely intermingled with tests to exercise it (like the <span>scenarios</span>
above), tests that can be run from the commandline.

</p><pre>&nbsp;<span>$</span> build_and_test_until 029  <span># exercises the core interpreter</span>
&nbsp;<span>$</span> build_and_test_until 030  <span># exercises dynamic scope</span>
&nbsp;...
</pre>

<p>
Having built the program with just a subset of layers, you're free to poke at
it and run what-if experiments. <em>Why did Kartik write this line like
so?</em> Make a change, run the tests. <em>Oh, that's why.</em> You can add
logging to trace through execution, and you can use a debugger, because you're
sitting at your workstation like a reasonable programmer, not curled up in
bed.

</p><p>
Eventually I'd like to live in a world where our systems for viewing live,
modifiable, interactive code are as adept at typesetting as our publishing
systems are. But until that day, I'll choose simple markdown-like plain-text
documentation that the author labored over the structure of. Every single
time.

<a name="f1">1.</a> Literate Haskell and CoffeeScript to a lesser extent allow
very flexible ordering in the language, which mitigates this problem. But then

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p><i>11 January 2025</i></p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot from the main gameplay view of Oregon Trail, showing a covered wagon drawn by oxen near a river, and cheerfully informing you that Zeke has a broken leg and will die soon." src="https://moral.net.au/writing/2025/01/11/waiting_for_oregon/header.png" title="Goddamnit Zeke I turn my head for ONE SECOND"></p><p>If you're into retro computing, you probably know about Oregon Trail; a simulation of the hardships faced by a group of colonists in 1848 as they travel by covered wagon from Independence Missouri to the Willamette Valley in Oregon. The game was wildly successful in the US education market, with the various editions selling 65 million copies. What you probably <em>don't</em> know is the game's great untold secret.</p>
<p>Two years ago, Twitch streamer <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/albrot">albrot</a> discovered a bug in the code for crossing rivers. One of the options is to "wait to see if conditions improve"; waiting a day will consume food but <em>not</em> recalculate any health conditions, granting your party immortality.</p>
<p>From this conceit the Oregon Trail Time Machine was born; a multiday livestream of the game as the party waits for conditions to improve at the final Snake River crossing until the year 10000, to see if the withered travellers can make it to the ruins of ancient Oregon. The <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1738411118?t=01h04m40s">first attempt ended in tragedy</a>; no matter what albrot tried, the party would succumb to disease and die almost immediately.</p>
<p>A couple of days before New Years Eve 2025, albrot reached out and asked if I knew anything about Apple II hacking. In reality the answer was no, I knew three things about the Apple II:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has a MOS 6502 processor</li>
<li>It was popular in the US educational market</li>
<li>Something something Carmen Sandiego something Prince of Persia?</li>
</ul>
<p>But all old computers are basically the same right? Specialist knowledge is for cowards.</p>
<div id="where-to-start">
<h2>Where to start</h2>
<p>First I loaded Oregon Trail into MAME's Apple II emulator. MAME is an emulator that was originally targeted at arcade hardware, however it has support for hundreds of game consoles and home computer systems thanks to merging with the MESS project. It has one of the nicest debuggers I've ever used, with plenty of documentation, which is why I strongly recommend it for reversing work. You will need a copy of the Apple II ROMs, listed in the MAME ROM index as <tt>apple2e.zip</tt>.</p>
<p>We are using the most common disk image of the game (aka "peperony and chease" edition). To open the game:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>mame<span> </span>apple2e<span> </span>-debug<span> </span>-flop1<span> </span>oregonmod_a.do
</pre></div>
<p>This will open a separate Debug window and pause execution until you start running the machine (F5). In the game window you can activate the MAME menu keys by pressing Scroll Lock; useful ones to know are TAB for the main menu, F6 for saving a state, F7 for loading a state.</p>
<p>This was my thinking for how to get a first toehold into what was going on. As you travel, the game gives your party one of four health ratings:</p>
<ul>
<li>good</li>
<li>fair</li>
<li>poor</li>
<li>very poor</li>
</ul>
<p>It follows that the game code must read the text string "poor" from somewhere in memory so it can be printed on the screen, and this code would be attached to the routine that determines how sick everyone is. So I sent the party off from Independence, Missouri with 1 ox, no food and no clothes. As soon as we were on the road, I made a save state. I then called "Step Into" in the debugger (F11) which paused execution, and made a dump of the Apple II's memory to a file with the following command:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>save<span> </span>/tmp/mem_before,0,0x10000
</pre></div>
<p>I loaded this dump into a hex editor and searched for the word "poor", which I found at address 0xA6AE. Then in the debugger I added a watchpoint for any code attempting to read the first byte of "poor":</p>

<p>As expected, once my party became emaciated enough the debugger halted execution at the following instruction:</p>

<p>The Apple II CPU is a 6502, which has a nice <a href="http://6502.org/users/obelisk/6502/reference.html">instruction reference</a> here. Looking it up, we can see that LDA basically means "load a byte from the address stored at 0x005E into register A". Because the 6502 is a very basic 8-bit CPU, you are limited in how you access the 16-bit address space. Generally speaking you have the choice of using a fixed offset (up to 16-bit, baked in the instruction) plus whatever 8-bit value is in a register, or using a Zero Page pointer. The above instruction is using a Zero Page address; for this mode you have to write a 16-bit pointer containing the location you want to somewhere in the first 0x100 bytes of memory, then use an instruction which references that pointer.</p>
<p>So we know that the pointer to the text describing the player's health is at 0x005E, which we can confirm by opening a memory window in the debugger and see AE A6 at address 0x005E (the 6502 is little endian, so addresses are stored backwards). It's fair to say that this is just for updating the display, and not for checking how ill everyone is.</p>
<p>We need to find the code that sets this status, so I added another watchpoint for any writes to the pointer at 0x005E:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>wpset<span> </span>0x005E,1,w,wpdata<span> </span><span>==</span><span> </span>0xAE
</pre></div>
<p>After reload the save state, the game stopped in another area:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>E630<span>  </span>STX<span> </span><span>$5</span>E<span>       </span><span>;</span><span> </span>mem<span>[</span>0x005E<span>]</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span>X
</pre></div>
<p>I started using the debugger's Step Out feature (Shift+F11) to move up the call stack and see what was calling what. From further poking around it became apparent that we were in some sort of generic high level text printing function. Then a penny dropped, and I started wondering about the memory layout of the Apple II. A <a href="http://apple2.guidero.us/doku.php/mg_notes/general/mem_map">memory map</a> shows the D000–F7FF range to be the part of the ROM containing the BASIC interpreter. Oh.</p>
<p>In fact there's a <a href="https://6502disassembly.com/a2-rom/Applesoft.html#SymFREFAC">very helpful annotated Apple II ROM disassembly</a>, showing that function is indeed a high-level print function for text.</p>
</div>
<div id="well-that-just-got-complicated">
<h2>Well that just got complicated</h2>
<p>So 1985 Oregon Trail is written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applesoft_BASIC">Applesoft BASIC</a>, and the program is stored as some sort of bytecode. My heart sank a little at this news; 6502 assembly is cumbersome to understand at the best of times, and throwing a BASIC virtual machine on top of that makes live debugging even worse. I didn't have time to hack together a way to trace the BASIC code as it executed.</p>
<p>However this did open up a new angle of attack. A BASIC program uses variables, which are stored in a known location in a known format. What if we let the game play, then kept an eye on the debugger's live memory view to see what variables change over time?</p>
<p>The good news is that Applesoft BASIC keeps the original names for each variable; a critical clue. The downside is that those names are (at most) two letters long. Also the memory is managed dynamically, so variables will move around as the program chugs on.</p>
<p>From poking around the ROM disassembly, the pointer to the variable store is at address 0x0069 of the Zero Page (usually 0x9902), followed by a pointer to the array store, and a pointer to all of the string data. Each variable is 7 bytes long; 2 bytes for the name (using the high bits of each to encode type), and 5 bytes data. The default numeric type in Applesoft BASIC is a cursed 40-bit floating point format, with an 8-bit exponent and a 31-bit mantissa.</p>
<p>After a bunch of test runs I found a variable called H, which increased in line with my health status getting worse. Even better, setting the H data to all zeros reset the status back to "good", after which it seemed to decay back to "very poor" at the previous rate. There was also a H1 array that seemed to keep track of party members that had died (0 for alive, -1 for dead), and a H2 array which seemed to keep track of whatever exciting disease each party member had. Easy! Open and shut!</p>
</div>
<div id="did-we-make-it">
<h2>Did we make it?</h2>
<p>New Years Eve 2025 had arrived, and with it attempt 2 to reach the barren wastelands of future Oregon. This time, the time machine stopped at 16120 AD.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of albrot's second Oregon Trail Time Machine attempt, some 5 days after the stream began. There is a tombstone that reads &quot;Here lies ALBROT&quot;. The streamer is facepalming." src="https://moral.net.au/writing/2025/01/11/waiting_for_oregon/rip.jpg" title="RIP albrot, what was he even doing up on the roof"></p><p>A dismal failure. Even when zeroing out the memory, every day H would reset to 139, dooming the party to a short-but-agonizing fate. Cheating death is harder than expected.</p>
</div>
<div id="we-can-still-save-this">
<h2>We can still save this</h2>
<p>Several days later, I tried writing a scrappy decompiler for the Applesoft BASIC bytecode. From past experience I was worried this would be real complex, but in the mother of all lucky breaks the "bytecode" is the original program text with certain keywords replaced with 1-byte tokens. After nicking the list of tokens from the Apple II ROM disassembly I had a half-decent decompiler after a few goes.</p>
<p>(This ultimately turned out to be unnecessary. If I had looked more closely at the options for <a href="https://ciderpress2.com/">CiderPress II</a>, I would've seen that you can use the "<a href="https://github.com/fadden/CiderPress2/blob/main/docs/Manual-cp2.md#importip">import</a>" and "<a href="https://github.com/fadden/CiderPress2/blob/main/docs/Manual-cp2.md#exportxp">export</a>" commands to convert Applesoft BASIC files to and from plain text).</p>
<p>So of <em>course</em> we had to look for the code that calculates the player's health. Here it is, from <tt>OREGON TRAIL</tt>:</p>

</ul>
<p>The inputs were figured out by checking what text the game prints on the screen for those variables; e.g. W is used to fetch a string from an array W$ that looks like this:</p>

<p>The health factors are all conjecture based on the inputs, but I think they make sense. We have the formula for H, and there's only one misery factor which would be affected by waiting 14272 years: the food starvation factor. In case you're wondering what that looks like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>[</span>0x9bb0<span>]</span><span>  </span>4653967e4f4234<span>  </span><span>FS</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>4166608</span>.55078125
</pre></div>
<p>Yikes. We can see that every day after crossing Snake River, H would increase by at least 4.1 million, and then be rounded down to the worst possible health score of 139. It would take 15 days of doing nothing but sitting and eating to bring the food starvation factor down to 127, by which point everyone in the party would be dead.</p>
<p>But finally, FINALLY we know how to distort reality enough to get this train back on the rails. The party is back to full health, all that's left is to get past the final fork at The Dalles and...</p>

<p>The game was kind enough to gift me -170 billion billion billion billion wagons.</p>
<p>Actually this was a red herring. Line 50050 is also on Side B inside END.LIB, aka. the screen before the crash (choosing between floating down the Columbia River or taking the Barlow Toll Road).</p>
<p>And guess what.</p>
<p>It reads the date:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># 50050</span>
<span>[</span>0x023d<span>]</span><span>  </span>POKE<span> </span><span>900</span>,NP

<span>[</span>0x025a<span>]</span><span>  </span>POKE<span> </span><span>903</span>,AD
</pre></div>
<p><tt>AY</tt> is the variable containing the year, and the POKE instruction tries to shove the value of <tt>AY - 1800</tt> into <em>a single byte</em> of the regular Apple II memory, causing a crash as it is much larger than the maximum of 255.</p>
<p>These POKEs seem to be how Oregon Trail saves key information when it switches between BASIC programs. Most of the game is handled by the main program "OREGON TRAIL" (written by John Krenz), which loads in modules like "RIVER.LIB" and keeps access to all the variables. Whenever a new main program is loaded in, all the BASIC variables are lost except for whatever data you happened to copy to regular memory with POKE. At the end of the game you have the option of floating down the river, which uses a new main program "FLOAT" (written by Steven Splinter) before switching again to the "WIN" program, so it follows that the game would need to use the POKEd numbers.</p>
<p>What happens if we mod the BASIC code in memory to say something else?</p>

<p><img alt="A screenshot of the ending screen of Oregon Trail, showing the beautiful Willamette Valley, and the utterly incorrect year of 18255." src="https://moral.net.au/writing/2025/01/11/waiting_for_oregon/badending.png" title="Oh no."></p><p>Finally we have a definitive answer about whether this whole ordeal is possible. Unlike <em>every other progress screen in the game</em>, the ending screen has the year hardcoded to start with "18", followed by the printed text of whatever <tt>PEEK 901</tt> is. The maximum number of years you can take without crashing the game is 207, and any attempts longer than 51 years will end in the wrong century.</p>
<p>Really, there wasn't much point going on; it felt like further trickery went against the spirit of the challenge. Maybe there's closure enough in knowing that if you somehow avoid starvation for 142 centuries, the game dicks you at the last possible moment by expecting the year to be sensible.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of the ending screen of Oregon Trail, showing the beautiful Willamette Valley, and the correct end year of 16120." src="https://moral.net.au/writing/2025/01/11/waiting_for_oregon/success.png" title="Nature has reclaimed post-civilisation Oregon"></p><p>Applesoft BASIC is majestically slow, but thanks to 40-bit floating point and standard commands for drawing and text manipulation, Oregon Trail works much better than I could have expected after running the simulation for 14272 years. The final screen being broken is a bit of a letdown, but understandable given how unlikely it is that you'd take 14272 years to finish the game.</p>
<p>Honestly, one of my aims has been to create a reverse engineering approach that will work for any system, regardless of knowledge or experience, and give you the basic steps for how to understand and modify it. This was a bit of a test run of this, and I think it could be considered a success. Eventually I'll write it down properly, but hopefully this effort will give you some ideas for your next reversing project.</p>
<p>And albrot? Well, he was able to fulfill his dream and become the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/albrot/clip/MushyFlirtyPorcupineOhMyDog-r1PPasYUcpDPTW4e">first person to survive for 15000 years on the Oregon Trail</a>. A well deserved victory.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/13/anexia_vmware_to_kvm_migration/">https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/13/anexia_vmware_to_kvm_migration/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42682671">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Exclusive</span> Broadcom has lost another large customer for its VMware platform: Austrian cloud provider Anexia has moved 12,000 VMs, some of them rented by major European businesses, to an open-source system based on the KVM hypervisor.</p>
<p>Anexia was founded in 2006, is based in Austria, and provides cloud services from over 100 locations around the world by placing equipment in third party datacenters. Clients include remote access and control vendor TeamViewer, and airline Lufthansa – plus plenty more outfits that need reliable hosting and service to match.</p>
<p>CEO Alexander Windbichler told <i>The Register</i> that after Broadcom acquired VMware, increased licensing costs, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/10/broadcom_ends_vmware_partner_program/">made big changes to its partner program</a>, Anexia remained eligible to operate a VMware-powered cloud.</p>

    

<p>But Windbichler felt he couldn’t afford to continue, because Broadcom offered new terms that saw the cost of VMware licenses rise sharply. The CEO preferred not to enumerate the increase precisely however <i>The Register</i> understands it exceeded 500 percent.</p>

        


        

<p>Whatever the actual figure, Windbichler said the cost increase “Would have been existential for us.”</p>
<p>“We used to pay for VMware software one month in arrears,” he said. “With Broadcom we had to pay a year in advance with a two-year contract.” That arrangement, the CEO said, would have created extreme stress on company cashflow.</p>

        

<p>“We would not be able to compete with the market,” he said. “We had customers on contracts, and they would not pay for a price increase.”</p>
<p>Windbichler considered legal action, but felt the fight would have been slow and expensive.</p>
<p>Anexia therefore resolved to migrate, a choice made easier by its ownership of another hosting business called Netcup that ran on a KVM-based platform. Another factor in the company’s favour was that it disguised the fact it ran VMware with an abstraction layer it called “Anexia Engine” that meant customers never saw Virtzilla’s wares and instead worked in a different interface to manage their VM fleets. The hosting company is also a big user of NetApp storage, so customer data was already stored in a resource independent of its VMware rig – any new VMs would just need to be pointed at existing volumes. A further fortuitous circumstance was that KVM can boot virtual machines created with VMware’s VMDK format.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/02/beeks_group_vmware_opennebula_migration/">Broadcom loses another big VMware customer: UK fintech cloud Beeks Group, and most of its 20,000 VMs</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/16/ingram_micro_vmware_broadcom_deal_ends/">Ingram Micro to 'stop doing business' with Broadcom, downgrade to 'limited engagement' on VMware</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/13/broadcom_q4_fy_2024_vmware/">Broadcom says VMware is a better money-making machine than it hoped</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/28/broadcom_vmware_vcdx_snafu/">No, Broadcom did not just end VMware's flagship VCDX certification program</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Windbichler and his team felt that Netcup’s platform could be upgraded to meet the needs of Anexia’s clients, some of whom use it to host mission-critical realtime workloads that demand low latency, and that Anexia engine could be adapted to work with a KVM back end.</p>
<p>But the terms of Anexia’s licenses meant it had a handful of months to get the job done before price rises and a two-year subscription kicked in – and less time to convince customers who signed up for VMware-powered services that the new platform would do the job.</p>
<h3>‘Fighting for a cause’</h3>
<p>Windbichler felt customers would oppose the move, so created a presentation in which he pitched the move as more than a cost-saving migration.</p>
<p>“We said we are fighting for a cause,” he said. “I did not expect that customers would care about that, but they were happy to do it.”</p>

        

<p>Among the factors that he feels got customers over the line were media articles about Broadcom’s actions, including some from <i>The Register</i>.</p>
<p>Through early 2024, Anexia’s developer team worked to improve the Netcup platform and create a simple migration tool. The result was an agent that runs on a guest VM and presents info in Anexia engine that helps customers understand if a VM is ready to move from VMware to KVM.</p>
<p>If a customer agrees to migrate, it takes one click and a brief pause for a VM reboot – an act which maps a VM to storage and converted it to the appropriate virtual disk format– and workloads resume as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Windbichler said the migration tool was delivered in time for all Anexia customers, and their 12,000 VMs, to migrate by May 2024.</p>
<p>The process wasn’t easy, as the migration process meant that for a brief time two instances of a VM would exist, requiring more hardware capacity than the company might possess in some of its locations. Careful resource management planning was needed, as some customers could not easily find a change window and it was hard to ensure servers and storage would be ready for the move. Anexia pulled it off without having to alter its physical fleet, which given its widespread operations would have added enormous complexity to the project.</p>
<h3>Broadcom ‘lost all the trust’</h3>
<p>The CEO rates the project the most complex thing Anexia has done, and in conversation with <i>The Register</i> was full of praise for his team who he said did amazing work and now feel they were part of a once-in-a-lifetime effort.</p>
<p>That team is now growing, as without VMware bills – and all customers still aboard – Anexia’s balance sheet is in good shape.</p>
<p>“We have free budget to work on the open source solution and make us sovereign for us and our customers,” Windbichler said.</p>
<p>The CEO thinks more companies will move from VMware.</p>
<p>“I do not believe Broadcom will be successful,” he told <i>The Register</i>. “They lost all the trust. I have talked to so many VMware customers and they say they cannot work with a company like that.”</p>
<p>Regulators are also interested in Broadcom’s practices, he said. As Anexia tried to understand the impact of the VMware acquisition, it engaged with industry group Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE), which was able to arrange meetings with EU officials. Windbichler believes those engagements led to some of Broadcom’s concessions to its channel. The CEO also found Austria’s competition authorities receptive. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div width="435"><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/the-origins-of-wokeness-1.gif" width="204" height="18" alt="The Origins of Wokeness"><span size="2" face="verdana">January 2025<p>The word "prig" isn't very common now, but if you look up
the definition, it will sound familiar. Google's isn't bad:
</p><blockquote>
  A self-righteously moralistic person who behaves as if
  superior to others.
</blockquote>
This sense of the word originated in the 18th century, and
its age is an important clue: it shows that although
wokeness is a comparatively recent phenomenon, it's an
instance of a much older one.<p>There's a certain kind of person who's attracted to a
shallow, exacting kind of moral purity, and who demonstrates
his purity by attacking anyone who breaks the rules. Every
society has these people. All that changes is the rules they
enforce. In Victorian England it was Christian virtue. In
Stalin's Russia it was orthodox Marxism-Leninism. For the
woke, it's social justice.</p><p>So if you want to understand wokeness, the question to ask
is not why people behave this way. Every society has prigs.
The question to ask is why our prigs are priggish about
these ideas, at this moment. And to answer that we have to
ask when and where wokeness began.</p><p>The answer to the first question is the 1980s. Wokeness is a
second, more aggressive wave of political correctness, which
started in the late 1980s, died down in the late 1990s, and
then returned with a vengeance in the early 2010s, finally
peaking after the riots of 2020.</p><p>This was not the original meaning of woke, but it's rarely
used in the original sense now. Now the pejorative sense is
the dominant one. What <i>does</i> it mean now? I've often been
asked to define both wokeness and political correctness by
people who think they're meaningless labels, so I will. They
both have the same definition:
</p><blockquote>
  An aggressively performative focus on social justice.
</blockquote>
In other words, it's people being prigs about social
justice. And that's the real problem — the
performativeness, not the social justice.<p>Racism, for example, is a genuine problem. Not a problem on
the scale that the woke believe it to be, but a genuine one.
I don't think any reasonable person would deny that. The
problem with political correctness was not that it focused
on marginalized groups, but the shallow, aggressive way in
which it did so. Instead of going out into the world and
quietly helping members of marginalized groups, the
politically correct focused on getting people in trouble for
using the wrong words to talk about them.</p><p>As for where political correctness began, if you think about
it, you probably already know the answer. Did it begin
outside universities and spread to them from this external
source? Obviously not; it has always been most extreme in
universities. So where in universities did it begin? Did it
begin in math, or the hard sciences, or engineering, and
spread from there to the humanities and social sciences?
Those are amusing images, but no, obviously it began in the
humanities and social sciences.</p><p>Why there? And why then? What happened in the humanities and
social sciences in the 1980s?</p><p>A successful theory of the origin of political correctness
has to be able to explain why it didn't happen earlier. Why
didn't it happen during the protest movements of the 1960s,
for example? They were concerned with much the same issues.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><span color="#dddddd">1</span></a>]</span><p>The reason the student protests of the 1960s didn't lead to
political correctness was precisely that — they were
student movements. They didn't have any real power. The
students may have been talking a lot about women's
liberation and black power, but it was not what they were
being taught in their classes. Not yet.</p><p>But in the early 1970s the student protestors of the 1960s
began to finish their dissertations and get hired as
professors. At first they were neither powerful nor
numerous. But as more of their peers joined them and the
previous generation of professors started to retire, they
gradually became both.</p><p>The reason political correctness began in the humanities and
social sciences was that these fields offered more scope for
the injection of politics. A 1960s radical who got a job as
a physics professor could still attend protests, but his
political beliefs wouldn't affect his work. Whereas research
in sociology and modern literature can be made as political
as you like.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><span color="#dddddd">2</span></a>]</span><p>I saw political correctness arise. When I started college in
1982 it was not yet a thing. Female students might object if
someone said something they considered sexist, but no one
was getting <i>reported</i> for it. It was still not a thing when
I started grad school in 1986. It was definitely a thing in
1988 though, and by the early 1990s it seemed to pervade
campus life.</p><p>What happened? How did protest become punishment? Why were
the late 1980s the point at which protests against male
chauvinism (as it used to be called) morphed into formal
complaints to university authorities about sexism?
Basically, the 1960s radicals got tenure. They became the
Establishment they'd protested against two decades before.
Now they were in a position not just to speak out about
their ideas, but to enforce them.</p><p>A new set of moral rules to enforce was exciting news to a
certain kind of student. What made it particularly exciting
was that they were allowed to attack professors. I remember
noticing that aspect of political correctness at the time.
It wasn't simply a grass-roots student movement. It was
faculty members encouraging students to attack other faculty
members. In that respect it was like the Cultural
Revolution. That wasn't a grass-roots movement either; that
was Mao unleashing the younger generation on his political
opponents. And in fact when Roderick MacFarquhar started
teaching a class on the Cultural Revolution at Harvard in
the late 1980s, many saw it as a comment on current events.
I don't know if it actually was, but people thought it was,
and that means the similarities were obvious.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f3n"><span color="#dddddd">3</span></a>]</span><p>College students larp. It's their nature. It's usually
harmless. But larping morality turned out to be a poisonous
combination. The result was a kind of moral etiquette,
superficial but very complicated. Imagine having to explain
to a well-meaning visitor from another planet why using the
phrase "people of color" is considered particularly
enlightened, but saying "colored people" gets you fired. And
why exactly one isn't supposed to use the word "negro" now,
even though Martin Luther King used it constantly in his
speeches. There are no underlying principles. You'd just
have to give him a long list of rules to memorize.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f4n"><span color="#dddddd">4</span></a>]</span><p>
The danger of these rules was not just that they created
land mines for the unwary, but that their elaborateness made
them an effective substitute for virtue. Whenever a society
has a concept of heresy and orthodoxy, orthodoxy becomes a
substitute for virtue. You can be the worst person in the
world, but as long as you're orthodox you're better than
everyone who isn't. This makes orthodoxy very attractive to
bad people.</p><p>But for it to work as a substitute for virtue, orthodoxy
must be difficult. If all you have to do to be orthodox is
wear some garment or avoid saying some word, everyone knows
to do it, and the only way to seem more virtuous than other
people is to actually be virtuous. The shallow, complicated,
and frequently changing rules of political correctness made
it the perfect substitute for actual virtue. And the result
was a world in which good people who weren't up to date on
current moral fashions were brought down by people whose
characters would make you recoil in horror if you could see
them.</p><p>One big contributing factor in the rise of political
correctness was the lack of other things to be morally pure
about. Previous generations of prigs had been prigs mostly
about religion and sex. But among the cultural elite these
were the deadest of dead letters by the 1980s; if you were
religious, or a virgin, this was something you tended to
conceal rather than advertise. So the sort of people who
enjoy being moral enforcers had become starved of things to
enforce. A new set of rules was just what they'd been
waiting for.</p><p>Curiously enough, the tolerant side of the 1960s left helped
create the conditions in which the intolerant side
prevailed. The relaxed social rules advocated by the old,
easy-going hippy left became the dominant ones, at least
among the elite, and this left nothing for the naturally
intolerant to be intolerant about.</p><p>Another possibly contributing factor was the fall of the
Soviet empire. Marxism had been a popular focus of moral
purity on the left before political correctness emerged as a
competitor, but the pro-democracy movements in Eastern Bloc
countries took most of the shine off it. Especially the fall
of the Berlin Wall in 1989. You couldn't be on the side of
the Stasi. I remember looking at the moribund Soviet Studies
section of a used bookshop in Cambridge in the late 1980s
and thinking "what will those people go on about now?" As it
turned out the answer was right under my nose.</p><p>One thing I noticed at the time about the first phase of
political correctness was that it was more popular with
women than men. As many writers (perhaps most eloquently
George Orwell) have observed, women seem more attracted than
men to the idea of being moral enforcers. But there was
another more specific reason women tended to be the
enforcers of political correctness. There was at this time a
great backlash against sexual harassment; the mid 1980s were
the point when the definition of sexual harassment was
expanded from explicit sexual advances to creating a
"hostile environment." Within universities the classic form
of accusation was for a (female) student to say that a
professor made her "feel uncomfortable." But the vagueness
of this accusation allowed the radius of forbidden behavior
to expand to include talking about heterodox ideas. Those
make people uncomfortable too.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f5n"><span color="#dddddd">5</span></a>]</span><p>Was it sexist to propose that Darwin's greater male
variability hypothesis might explain some variation in human
performance? Sexist enough to get Larry Summers pushed out
as president of Harvard, apparently. One woman who heard the
talk in which he mentioned this idea said it made her feel
"physically ill" and that she had to leave halfway through.
If the test of a hostile environment is how it makes people
feel, this certainly sounds like one. And yet it does seem
plausible that greater male variability explains some of the
variation in human performance. So which should prevail,
comfort or truth? Surely if truth should prevail anywhere,
it should be in universities; that's supposed to be their
specialty; but for decades starting in the late 1980s the
politically correct tried to pretend this conflict didn't
exist.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f6n"><span color="#dddddd">6</span></a>]</span><p>Political correctness seemed to burn out in the second half
of the 1990s. One reason, perhaps the main reason, was that
it literally became a joke. It offered rich material for
comedians, who performed their usual disinfectant action
upon it. Humor is one of the most powerful weapons against
priggishness of any sort, because prigs, being humorless,
can't respond in kind. Humor was what defeated Victorian
prudishness, and by 2000 it seemed to have done the same
thing to political correctness.</p><p>Unfortunately this was an illusion. Within universities the
embers of political correctness were still glowing brightly.
After all, the forces that created it were still there. The
professors who started it were now becoming deans and
department heads. And in addition to their departments there
were now a bunch of new ones explicitly focused on social
justice. Students were still hungry for things to be morally
pure about. And there had been an explosion in the number of
university administrators, many of whose jobs involved
enforcing various forms of political correctness.</p><p>In the early 2010s the embers of political correctness burst
into flame anew. There were several differences between this
new phase and the original one. It was more virulent. It
spread further into the real world, although it still burned
hottest within universities. And it was concerned with a
wider variety of sins. In the first phase of political
correctness there were really only three things people got
accused of: sexism, racism, and homophobia (which at the
time was a neologism invented for the purpose). But between
then and 2010 a lot of people had spent a lot of time trying
to invent new kinds of -isms and -phobias and seeing which
could be made to stick.</p><p>The second phase was, in multiple senses, political
correctness metastasized. Why did it happen when it did? My
guess is that it was due to the rise of social media,
particularly Tumblr and Twitter, because one of the most
distinctive features of the second wave of political
correctness was the <i>cancel mob</i>: a mob of angry people
uniting on social media to get someone ostracized or fired.
Indeed this second wave of political correctness was
originally called "cancel culture"; it didn't start to be
called "wokeness" till the 2020s.</p><p>One aspect of social media that surprised almost everyone at
first was the popularity of outrage. Users seemed to <i>like</i>
being outraged. We're so used to this idea now that we take
it for granted, but really it's pretty strange. Being
outraged is not a pleasant feeling. You wouldn't expect
people to seek it out. But they do. And above all, they want
to share it. I happened to be running a forum from 2007 to
2014, so I can actually quantify how much they want to share
it: our users were about three times more likely to upvote
something if it outraged them.</p><p>This tilt toward outrage wasn't due to wokeness. It's an
inherent feature of social media, or at least this
generation of it. But it did make social media the perfect
mechanism for fanning the flames of wokeness.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f7n"><span color="#dddddd">7</span></a>]</span><p>It wasn't just public social networks that drove the rise of
wokeness though. Group chat apps were also critical,
especially in the final step, cancellation. Imagine if a
group of employees trying to get someone fired had to do it
using only email. It would be hard to organize a mob. But
once you have group chat, mobs form naturally.</p><p>Another contributing factor in this second wave of political
correctness was the dramatic increase in the polarization of
the press. In the print era, newspapers were constrained to
be, or at least seem, politically neutral. The department
stores that ran ads in the New York Times wanted to reach
everyone in the region, both liberal and conservative, so
the Times had to serve both. But the Times didn't regard
this neutrality as something forced upon them. They embraced
it as their duty as a <i>paper of record</i> — as one of the big
newspapers that aimed to be chronicles of their times,
reporting every sufficiently important story from a neutral
point of view.</p><p>When I grew up the papers of record seemed timeless, almost
sacred institutions. Papers like the New York Times and
Washington Post had immense prestige, partly because other
sources of news were limited, but also because they did make
some effort to be neutral.</p><p>Unfortunately it turned out that the paper of record was
mostly an artifact of the constraints imposed by print.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f8n"><span color="#dddddd">8</span></a>]</span>
When your market was determined by geography, you had
to be neutral. But publishing online enabled — in fact
probably forced — newspapers to switch to serving markets
defined by ideology instead of geography. Most that remained
in business fell in the direction they'd already been
leaning: left. On October 11, 2020 the New York Times
announced that "The paper is in the midst of an evolution
from the stodgy paper of record into a juicy collection of
great narratives."
<span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f9n"><span color="#dddddd">9</span></a>]</span>
Meanwhile journalists, of a sort,
had arisen to serve the right as well. And so journalism,
which in the previous era had been one of the great
centralizing forces, now became one of the great polarizing
ones.<p>The rise of social media and the increasing polarization of
journalism reinforced one another. In fact there arose a new
variety of journalism involving a loop through social media.
Someone would say something controversial on social media.
Within hours it would become a news story. Outraged readers
would then post links to the story on social media, driving
further arguments online. It was the cheapest source of
clicks imaginable. You didn't have to maintain overseas news
bureaus or pay for month-long investigations. All you had to
do was watch Twitter for controversial remarks and repost
them on your site, with some additional comments to inflame
readers further.</p><p>For the press there was money in wokeness. But they weren't
the only ones. That was one of the biggest differences
between the two waves of political correctness: the first
was driven almost entirely by amateurs, but the second was
often driven by professionals. For some it was their whole
job. By 2010 a new class of administrators had arisen whose
job was basically to enforce wokeness. They played a role
similar to that of the political commissars who got attached
to military and industrial organizations in the USSR: they
weren't directly in the flow of the organization's work, but
watched from the side to ensure that nothing improper
happened in the doing of it. These new administrators could
often be recognized by the word "inclusion" in their titles.
Within institutions this was the preferred euphemism for
wokeness; a new list of banned words, for example, would
usually be called an "inclusive language guide."
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f10n"><span color="#dddddd">10</span></a>]</span><p>This new class of bureaucrats pursued a woke agenda as if
their jobs depended on it, because they did. If you hire
people to keep watch for a particular type of problem,
they're going to find it, because otherwise there's no
justification for their existence.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f11n"><span color="#dddddd">11</span></a>]</span>
But these
bureaucrats also represented a second and possibly even
greater danger. Many were involved in hiring, and when
possible they tried to ensure their employers hired only
people who shared their political beliefs. The most
egregious cases were the new "DEI statements" that some
universities started to require from faculty candidates,
proving their commitment to wokeness. Some universities used
these statements as the initial filter and only even
considered candidates who scored high enough on them. You're
not hiring Einstein that way; imagine what you get instead.<p>Another factor in the rise of wokeness was the Black Lives
Matter movement, which started in 2013 when a white man was
acquitted after killing a black teenager in Florida. But
this didn't launch wokeness; it was well underway by 2013.</p><p>Similarly for the Me Too Movement, which took off in 2017
after the first news stories about Harvey Weinstein's
history of raping women. It accelerated wokeness, but didn't
play the same role in launching it that the 80s version did
in launching political correctness.</p><p>The election of Donald Trump in 2016 also accelerated
wokeness, particularly in the press, where outrage now meant
traffic. Trump made the New York Times a lot of money:
headlines during his first administration mentioned his name
at about four times the rate of previous presidents.</p><p>In 2020 we saw the biggest accelerant of all, after a white
police officer asphyxiated a black suspect on video. At this
point the metaphorical fire became a literal one, as violent
protests broke out across America. But in retrospect this
turned out to be peak woke, or close to it. By every measure
I've seen, wokeness peaked in 2020 or 2021.</p><p>Wokeness is sometimes described as a mind-virus. What makes
it viral is that it defines new types of impropriety. Most
people are afraid of impropriety; they're never exactly sure
what the social rules are or which ones they might be
breaking. Especially if the rules change rapidly. And since
most people already worry that they might be breaking rules
they don't know about, if you tell them they're breaking a
rule, their default reaction is to believe you. Especially
if multiple people tell them. Which in turn is a recipe for
exponential growth. Zealots invent some new impropriety to
avoid. The first people to adopt it are fellow zealots,
eager for new ways to signal their virtue. If there are
enough of these, the initial group of zealots is followed by
a much larger group, motivated by fear. They're not trying
to signal virtue; they're just trying to avoid getting in
trouble. At this point the new impropriety is now firmly
established. Plus its success has increased the rate of
change in social rules, which, remember, is one of the
reasons people are nervous about which rules they might be
breaking. So the cycle accelerates.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f12n"><span color="#dddddd">12</span></a>]</span><p>What's true of individuals is even more true of
organizations. Especially organizations without a powerful
leader. Such organizations do everything based on "best
practices." There's no higher authority; if some new "best
practice" achieves critical mass, they <i>must</i> adopt it. And
in this case the organization can't do what it usually does
when it's uncertain: delay. It might be committing
improprieties right now! So it's surprisingly easy for a
small group of zealots to capture this type of organization
by describing new improprieties it might be guilty of. 
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f13n"><span color="#dddddd">13</span></a>]</span><p>How does this kind of cycle ever end? Eventually it leads to
disaster, and people start to say enough is enough. The
excesses of 2020 made a lot of people say that.</p><p>Since then wokeness has been in gradual but continual
retreat. Corporate CEOs, starting with Brian Armstrong, have
openly rejected it. Universities, led by the University of
Chicago and MIT, have explicitly confirmed their commitment
to free speech. Twitter, which was arguably the hub of
wokeness, was bought by Elon Musk in order to neutralize it,
and he seems to have succeeded — and not, incidentally, by
censoring left-wing users the way Twitter used to censor
right-wing ones, but without censoring either.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f14n"><span color="#dddddd">14</span></a>]</span>
Consumers have emphatically rejected brands that ventured
too far into wokeness. The Bud Light brand may have been
permanently damaged by it. I'm not going to claim Trump's
second victory in 2024 was a referendum on wokeness; I think
he won, as presidential candidates always do, because he was
more <a href="https://paulgraham.com/charisma.html"><u>charismatic</u></a>; but voters' 
disgust with wokeness must have helped.<p>So what do we do now? Wokeness is already in retreat.
Obviously we should help it along. What's the best way to do
that? And more importantly, how do we avoid a third
outbreak? After all, it seemed to be dead once, but came
back worse than ever.</p><p>In fact there's an even more ambitious goal: is there a way
to prevent any similar outbreak of aggressively performative
moralism in the future — not just a third outbreak
political correctness, but the next thing like it? Because
there will be a next thing. Prigs are prigs by nature. They
need rules to obey and enforce, and now that Darwin has cut
off their traditional supply of rules, they're constantly
hungry for new ones. All they need is someone to meet them
halfway by defining a new way to be morally pure, and we'll
see the same phenomenon again.</p><p>Let's start with the easier problem. Is there a simple,
principled way to deal with wokeness? I think there is: to
use the customs we already have for dealing with religion.
Wokeness is effectively a religion, just with God replaced
by protected classes. It's not even the first religion of
this kind; Marxism had a similar form, with God replaced by
the masses.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f15n"><span color="#dddddd">15</span></a>]</span>
And we already have well-established
customs for dealing with religion within organizations. You
can express your own religious identity and explain your
beliefs, but you can't call your coworkers infidels if they
disagree, or try to ban them from saying things that
contradict its doctrines, or insist that the organization
adopt yours as its official religion.<p>If we're not sure what to do about any particular
manifestation of wokeness, imagine we were dealing with some
other religion, like Christianity. Should we have people
within organizations whose jobs are to enforce woke
orthodoxy? No, because we wouldn't have people whose jobs
were to enforce Christian orthodoxy. Should we censor
</p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/02/17/roald-dahl-books-rewritten-offensive-matilda-witches-twits/"><u>writers</u></a> or 
<a href="https://x.com/KoustaStavroula/status/1562034502897106946"><u>scientists</u></a> whose work contradicts woke doctrines?
No, because we wouldn't do this to people whose work
contradicted Christian teachings. Should job candidates be
required to write DEI statements? Of course not; imagine an
employer requiring proof of one's religious beliefs. Should
students and employees have to participate in woke
indoctrination sessions in which they're required to answer
questions about their beliefs to ensure compliance? No,
because we wouldn't dream of catechizing people in this way
about their religion.
<span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f16n"><span color="#dddddd">16</span></a>]</span><p>One shouldn't feel bad about not wanting to watch woke
movies any more than one would feel bad about not wanting to
listen to Christian rock. In my twenties I drove across
America several times, listening to local radio stations.
Occasionally I'd turn the dial and hear some new song. But
the moment anyone mentioned Jesus I'd turn the dial again.
Even the tiniest bit of being preached to was enough to make
me lose interest.</p><p>But by the same token we should not automatically reject
everything the woke believe. I'm not a Christian, but I can
see that many Christian principles are good ones. It would
be a mistake to discard them all just because one didn't
share the religion that espoused them. It would be the sort
of thing a religious zealot would do.</p><p>If we have genuine pluralism, I think we'll be safe from
future outbreaks of woke intolerance. Wokeness itself won't
go away. There will for the foreseeable future continue to
be pockets of woke zealots inventing new moral fashions. The
key is not to let them treat their fashions as normative.
They can change what their coreligionists are allowed to say
every few months if they like, but they mustn't be allowed
to change what we're allowed to say.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f17n"><span color="#dddddd">17</span></a>]</span><p>The more general problem — how to prevent similar outbreaks
of aggressively performative moralism — is of course
harder. Here we're up against human nature. There will
always be prigs. And in particular there will always be the
enforcers among them, the 
</p><a href="https://paulgraham.com/conformism.html"><u>aggressively conventional-minded</u></a>.
These people are born that way. Every society has them. So
the best we can do is to keep them bottled up.<p>The aggressively conventional-minded aren't always on the
rampage. Usually they just enforce whatever random rules are
nearest to hand. They only become dangerous when some new
ideology gets a lot of them pointed in the same direction at
once. That's what happened during the Cultural Revolution,
and to a lesser extent (thank God) in the two waves of
political correctness we've experienced.</p><p>We can't get rid of the aggressively conventional-minded.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f18n"><span color="#dddddd">18</span></a>]</span>
And we couldn't prevent people from creating new
ideologies that appealed to them even if we wanted to. So if
we want to keep them bottled up, we have to do it one step
downstream. Fortunately when the aggressively
conventional-minded go on the rampage they always do one
thing that gives them away: they define new <a href="https://paulgraham.com/heresy.html"><u>heresies</u></a> to
punish people for. So the best way to protect ourselves from
future outbreaks of things like wokeness is to have powerful
antibodies against the concept of heresy.<p>We should have a conscious bias against defining new forms
of heresy. Whenever anyone tries to ban saying something
that we'd previously been able to say, our initial
assumption should be that they're wrong. Only our initial
assumption of course. If they can prove we should stop
saying it, then we should. But the burden of proof is on
them. In liberal democracies, people trying to prevent
something from being said will usually claim they're not
merely engaging in censorship, but trying to prevent some
form of "harm". And maybe they're right. But once again, the
burden of proof is on them. It's not enough to claim harm;
they have to prove it.</p><p>As long as the aggressively conventional-minded continue to
give themselves away by banning heresies, we'll always be
able to notice when they become aligned behind some new
ideology. And if we always fight back at that point, with
any luck we can stop them in their tracks.</p><p>The number of true things we </p><a href="https://paulgraham.com/say.html"><u>can't say</u></a>
should not increase. If it does, something is wrong.<p><b>Notes</b></p><p>[</p><a name="f1n"><span color="#000000">1</span></a>]
Why did 1960s radicals focus on the causes they did?
One of the people who reviewed drafts of this essay
explained this so well that I asked if I could quote him:
<blockquote>
  The middle-class student protestors of the New Left
  rejected the socialist/Marxist left as unhip. They were
  interested in sexier forms of oppression uncovered by
  cultural analysis (Marcuse) and abstruse "Theory". Labor
  politics became stodgy and old-fashioned. This took a
  couple generations to work through. The woke ideology's
  conspicuous lack of interest in the working class is the
  tell-tale sign. Such fragments as are, er, left of the old
  left are anti-woke, and meanwhile the actual working class
  shifted to the populist right and gave us Trump. Trump and
  wokeness are cousins.<p>The middle-class origins of wokeness smoothed its way
  through the institutions because it had no interest in
  "seizing the means of production" (how quaint such phrases
  seem now), which would quickly have run up against hard
  state and corporate power. The fact that wokeness only
  expressed interest in other kinds of class (race, sex,
  etc) signalled compromise with existing power: give us
  power within your system and we'll bestow the resource we
  control — moral rectitude — upon you. As an ideological
  stalking horse for gaining control over discourse and
  institutions, this succeeded where a more ambitious
  revolutionary program would not have.

It helped that the humanities and social sciences also
included some of the biggest and easiest undergrad majors.
If a political movement had to start with physics students,
it could never get off the ground; there would be too few of
them, and they wouldn't have the time to spare.<p>At the top universities these majors are not as big as they
used to be, though. A 
</p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/03/06/the-end-of-the-english-major"><u>2022 survey</u></a> found that only 7% of
Harvard undergrads plan to major in the humanities, vs
nearly 30% during the 1970s. I expect wokeness is at least
part of the reason; when undergrads consider majoring in
English, it's presumably because they love the written word
and not because they want to listen to lectures about
racism.<p>[</p><a name="f3n"><span color="#000000">3</span></a>]
The puppet-master-and-puppet character of political
correctness became clearly visible when a bakery near
Oberlin College was falsely accused of race discrimination
in 2016. In the subsequent civil trial, lawyers for the
bakery produced a text message from Oberlin Dean of Students
Meredith Raimondo that read "I'd say unleash the students if
I wasn't convinced this needs to be put behind us."<p>[</p><a name="f4n"><span color="#000000">4</span></a>]
The woke sometimes claim that wokeness is simply
treating people with respect. But if it were, that would be
the only rule you'd have to remember, and this is comically
far from being the case. My younger son likes to imitate
voices, and at one point when he was about seven I had to
explain which accents it was currently safe to imitate
publicly and which not. It took about ten minutes, and I
still hadn't covered all the cases.<p>[</p><a name="f5n"><span color="#000000">5</span></a>]
In 1986 the Supreme Court ruled that creating a
hostile work environment could constitute sex
discrimination, which in turn affected universities via
Title IX. The court specified that the test of a hostile
environment was whether it would bother a reasonable person,
but since for a professor merely being the subject of a
sexual harassment complaint would be a disaster whether the
complainant was reasonable or not, in practice any joke or
remark remotely connected with sex was now effectively
forbidden. Which meant we'd now come full circle to
Victorian codes of behavior, when there was a large class of
things that might not be said "with ladies present."<p>[</p><a name="f6n"><span color="#000000">6</span></a>]
Much as they tried to pretend there was no conflict
between diversity and quality. But you can't simultaneously
optimize for two things that aren't identical. What
diversity actually means, judging from the way the term is
used, is proportional representation, and unless you're
selecting a group whose purpose is to be representative,
like poll respondents, optimizing for proportional
representation has to come at the expense of quality. This
is not because of anything about representation; it's the
nature of optimization; optimizing for x has to come at the
expense of y unless x and y are identical.<p>[</p><a name="f7n"><span color="#000000">7</span></a>]
Maybe societies will eventually develop antibodies to
viral outrage. Maybe we were just the first to be exposed to
it, so it tore through us like an epidemic through a
previously isolated population. I'm fairly confident that it
would be possible to create new social media apps that were
less driven by outrage, and an app of this type would have a
good chance of stealing users from existing ones, because
the smartest people would tend to migrate to it.<p>[</p><a name="f8n"><span color="#000000">8</span></a>]
I say "mostly" because I have hopes that journalistic
neutrality will return in some form. There is some market
for unbiased news, and while it may be small, it's valuable.
The rich and powerful want to know what's really going on;
that's how they became rich and powerful.<p>[</p><a name="f9n"><span color="#000000">9</span></a>]
The Times made this momentous announcement very
informally, in passing in the middle of an 
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/11/business/media/new-york-times-rukmini-callimachi-caliphate.html"><u>article</u></a> about a
Times reporter who'd been criticized for inaccuracy. It's
quite possible no senior editor even approved it. But it's
somehow appropriate that this particular universe ended with
a whimper rather than a bang.<p>[</p><a name="f10n"><span color="#000000">10</span></a>]
As the acronym DEI goes out of fashion, many of these
bureaucrats will try to go underground by changing their
titles. It looks like "belonging" will be a popular option.<p>[</p><a name="f11n"><span color="#000000">11</span></a>]
If you've ever wondered why our legal system includes
protections like the separation of prosecutor, judge, and
jury, the right to examine evidence and cross-examine
witnesses, and the right to be represented by legal counsel,
the de facto 
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/magazine/title-ix-sexual-harassment-accusations.html">parallel legal system</a>
established by Title IX
makes that all too clear.<p>[</p><a name="f12n"><span color="#000000">12</span></a>]
The invention of new improprieties is most visible in
the rapid evolution of woke nomenclature. This is
particularly annoying to me as a writer, because the new
names are always worse. Any religious observance has to be
inconvenient and slightly absurd; otherwise gentiles would
do it too. So "slaves" becomes "enslaved individuals." But
web search can show us the leading edge of moral growth in
real time: if you search for "individuals experiencing
slavery" you will as of this writing find five legit
attempts to use the phrase, and you'll even find two for
"individuals experiencing enslavement."<p>[</p><a name="f13n"><span color="#000000">13</span></a>]
Organizations that do dubious things are particularly
concerned with propriety, which is how you end up with
absurdities like tobacco and oil companies having higher ESG
ratings than Tesla.<p>[</p><a name="f14n"><span color="#000000">14</span></a>]
Elon did something else that tilted Twitter rightward
though: he gave more visibility to paying users. Paying
users lean right on average, because people on the far left
dislike Elon and don't want to give him money. Elon
presumably knew this would happen. On the other hand, the
people on the far left have only themselves to blame; they
could tilt Twitter back to the left tomorrow if they wanted
to.<p>[</p><a name="f15n"><span color="#000000">15</span></a>]
It even, as James Lindsay and Peter Boghossian
pointed out, has a concept of original sin: privilege. Which
means unlike Christianity's egalitarian version, people have varying
degrees of it. An able-bodied straight white
American male is born with such a load of sin that only by
the most abject repentance can he be saved.<p>Wokeness also shares something rather funny with many actual
versions of Christianity: like God, the people for whose
sake wokeness purports to act are often revolted by the
things done in their name.</p><p>[</p><a name="f16n"><span color="#000000">16</span></a>]
There is one exception to most of these rules: actual
religious organizations. It's reasonable for them to insist
on orthodoxy. But they in turn should declare that they're
religious organizations. It's rightly considered shady
when something that appears to be an ordinary business or
publication turns out to be a religious organization.<p>[</p><a name="f17n"><span color="#000000">17</span></a>]
I don't want to give the impression that it will be
simple to roll back wokeness. There will be places where the
fight inevitably gets messy — particularly within
universities, which everyone has to share, yet which are are
currently the most pervaded by wokeness of any institutions.<p>[</p><a name="f18n"><span color="#000000">18</span></a>]
You can however get rid of aggressively
conventional-minded people within an organization, and in
many if not most organizations this would be an excellent
idea. Even a handful of them can do a lot of damage. I bet
you'd feel a noticeable improvement going from a handful to
none.<span color="888888"><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman,
