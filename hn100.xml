                                        <p>EL PASO, Texas (AP) — The Federal Aviation Administration is closing the airspace around El Paso International Airport in Texas for 10 days, grounding all flights to and from the airport.</p><p>A notice posted on the FAA’s website said the temporary flight restrictions were for “special security reasons,” but did not provide additional details. The closure does not include Mexican airspace.</p><p>The airport said in an Instagram post that all flights to and from the airport would be grounded from late Tuesday through late on Feb. 20, including commercial, cargo and general aviation flights. It suggested travelers contact their airlines to get up-to-date flight information.</p><p>The shutdown is likely to create significant disruptions given the duration and the size of the metropolitan area. El Paso, a border city with a population of nearly 700,000 and larger when you include the surrounding metro area, is hub of cross-border commerce alongside neighboring Ciudad Juarez in Mexico.</p><p>The airport describes itself as the gateway to west Texas, southern New Mexico and northern Mexico. Southwest, United, American and Delta all operate flights there, among others. </p>

<p>by <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploum">Ploum</a> on 2026-02-11</p>
<p>You don’t need to apologize for taking hours, days, or years to reply to one of my emails.</p>
<p>If we are not close collaborators, and if I didn’t explicitly tell you I was waiting for your answer within a specific timeframe, then please stop apologizing for replying late!</p>
<p>This is a trend I’m witnessing, probably caused by the addiction to instant messaging. Most of the emails I receive these days contain some sort of apology. I received an apology from someone who took five hours to reply to what was a cold and unimportant email. I received apologies in what was a reply to a reply I had sent only a couple of days earlier.</p>
<p>Apologizing for taking time to reply to my email is awkward and makes me uncomfortable.</p>
<p>It also puts a lot of pressure on me: what if I take more time than you to reply? Isn’t the whole point of asynchronous communication to be… asynchronous? Each on its own rhythm?</p>
<h2 id="soustitre-1">I was not waiting for your email in the first place.</h2>
<p>As soon as my email was sent, I probably forgot about it. I may have thought a lot before writing it. I may have drafted it multiple times. Or not. But as soon as it was in my outbox, it was also out of my mind. </p>
<p>That’s the very point of asynchronous communication. That’s why I use email. I’m not making any assumptions about your availability.</p>
<p>Most of the emails I send are replies to emails I received. So, no, I was not waiting for a reply to my reply.</p>
<p>My email might also be an idea I wanted to share with you, a suggestion, a random thought, a way to connect. In all cases, I’m not sitting there, waiting impatiently for your answer. </p>
<p>Even if my email was about requesting some help or collaborating with you, I’ve been trying to move forward anyway. Your reply, whenever it comes, will only be a bonus. But, except if we are in close collaboration and I explicitly said so in the email, I’m not waiting for you!</p>
<h2 id="soustitre-2">I don’t want to know all the details of your life.</h2>
<p>Yes, you took several days to reply to my email. That’s OK. I don’t need to know that it’s because your mother was dying of cancer or that you were expelled from your house. I’m not making those up! I really receive that kind of apology from people who took several days to reply to emails that look trivial in comparison.</p>
<p>Life happens. If you have things more important to do than replying to my email, then, for god’s sake, don’t reply to it. I get it! I’m human too. If I sometimes reply to all the emails I receive for several days, I may also archive them quickly for weeks because I don’t have the mental space.</p>
<h2 id="soustitre-3">If you want to reply but don’t have time, put the burden on me</h2>
<p>If I’m asking you something and you really would like to take the time to reply to my email, it is OK to simply send one line like</p>
<blockquote> Hey Ploum, I don’t have the time and mental space right now. Could you contact me again in 6 months to discuss this idea?<br></blockquote>
<p>Then archive or delete my email. That’s fine. If I really want your input, I will manage to remind you in 6 months. You don’t need to justify. You don’t need to explain. Being short saves time for both of us.</p>
<h2 id="soustitre-4">You don’t need to reply at all!</h2>
<p>Except if explicitly stated, don’t feel any pressure to reply to one of my emails. Feel free to read and discard the email. Feel free to think about it. Feel free to reply to it, even years later, if it makes sense for you. But, most importantly, feel free not to care!</p>
<p>We all receive too many messages in a day. We all have to make choices. We cannot follow all the paths that look interesting because we are all constrained by having, at most, a couple billion seconds left to live.</p>
<p>Consider whether replying adds any value to the discussion. Is a trivial answer really needed? Is there really something to add? Can’t we both save time by you not replying? </p>
<p>If my email is already a reply to yours, is there something you really want to add? At some point, it is better to stop the conversation. And, as I said, it is not rude: I’m not waiting for your reply!</p>
<h2 id="soustitre-5">Don’t tell me you will reply later!</h2>
<p>Some people specialize in answering email by explaining why they have no time and that they will reply later.</p>
<p>If I’m not explicitly waiting for you, then that’s the very definition of a useless email. That also adds a lot of cognitive load on you: you promised to answer! The fact that you wrote it makes your brain believe that replying to my email is a daunting task. How will you settle for a quick reply after that? What am I supposed to do with such a non-reply email?</p>
<p>In case an acknowledgement is needed, a simple reply with "thanks" or "received" is enough to inform me that you’ve got the message. Or "ack" if you are a geek.</p>
<h2 id="soustitre-6">If you do reply, remind me of the context</h2>
<p>If you choose to reply, consider that I have switched to completely different tasks and may have forgotten the context of my own message. When online, my attention span is measured in seconds, so it doesn’t matter if you take 30 minutes or 30 days to answer my email: I guarantee you that I forgot about it.</p>
<p>Consequently, please keep the original text of the whole discussion!</p>
<p>Use bottom-posting style to reply to each question or remark in the body of the original mail itself. Don’t hesitate to cut out parts of the original email that are not needed anymore. Feel free to ignore large parts of the email. It is fine to give a one-line answer to a very long question.</p>
<p>I’m trying to make my emails structured. If there are questions I want you to answer, each question will be on its own line and will end with a question mark. If you do not see such lines, then there’s probably no question to answer.</p>
<p>If you do top posting, please remind me briefly of the context we are in.</p>
<blockquote> Dear Ploum,<p>  I contacted you 6 months ago about my "fooing the bar" project after we met at FOSDEM. You replied to my email with a suggestion of "baring the foo." You also asked a lot of questions. I will answer those below in your own email:</p></blockquote>
<p>In short, that’s basic mailing-list etiquette.<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Mailing_list_etiquette">Mailing list etiquette (www.mediawiki.org)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="soustitre-7">No, seriously, I don’t expect you to reply!</h2>
<p>If there’s one thing to remember, it’s that I don’t expect you to reply. I’m not waiting for it. I have a life, a family, and plenty of projects. The chance I’m thinking about the email I sent you is close to zero. No, it is literally zero.</p>
<p>So don’t feel pressured to reply. Should you really reply in the first place? In case of doubt, drop the email. Life will continue.</p>
<p>If you do reply, I will be honored, whatever time it took for you to send it.</p>
<p>In any case, whatever you choose, do not apologize for replying late!</p>

public key</a></p></li></ul><p>The problem isn’t new. In 2017, M. Weissbacher et al. research on malicious browser extensions. In 2018, R. Heaton showed that the popular “Stylish” theme manager was silently sending browsing URLs to a remote server. Those past reports cought our eye and motivated us to dig into this issue.</p><p>Fast forward to 2025: Chome Store now hosts roughly 240 k extensions, many of them with hundreds of thousands of users. We knew that we needed a scalable, repeatable method to measure whether an extension was actually leaking data in the wild.</p><p>It was shown in the past that chrome extensions are used to exfiltrate user browser history that is then collected by data brokers such as Similarweb and Alexa. We try to prove in this report that Similarweb is very much still active and collects data.</p><p>Why does it matter? There is a moral aspect to the whole issue. Imagine that you build your business model on data exfiltration via innocent looking extensions and using that data to sell them to big corporates. Well, that’s how Similarweb is getting part of the data. That should remind us that whatever software you are using for free and it is not open sourced, you should assume you are the product. The second aspect is that it puts the users into danger and potentially this could be used for corporate exfiltration.

It encrypts your data using that AES key. It takes that one-time AES key and encrypts it using a Public RSA Key hardcoded in the script. It bundles the encrypted key and the encrypted data together and sends them to the server. To decrypt the data, we need the AES key. To get the AES key, we need to decrypt the key blockand that is only possible with the RSA Private Key. With altering the code it would be possible to pause service worker and capture this AES generated key. We will leave this as fun exercise to the reader.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>
  Ok, it is over.  End of an era for me.  No more self-hosted git.  I
  had a public git server running since 2011, and a public cvs server
  before that.  AI scrapers have hammered the poor, little server to
  death by flooding the cgit frontend with tons of pointless²
  requests.  Actually a few months ago already.
</p>
<p>
  Now I finally decided to not try rebuild the server, be it with or
  without cgit web frontend.  I don't feel like taking up the fight
  with the scrapers in my spare time, I leave that to people who are
  in a better position to do so.  Most repositories had mirrors on one
  or two of the large gitforges already.  Those are the primary
  repositories now.  Go look
  at <a href="https://gitlab.com/users/kraxel/projects">gitlab</a>
  and <a href="https://github.com/kraxel?tab=repositories">github</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Last week I've fixed all (I hope) dangeling links to the cgit
  repsitories to point to the forges instead.
</p>
<p>
  Now I'm down to one self-hosted service, which is the webserver
  hosting mainly this blog and a few more little things.  In 2018 I've
  migrated the blog from wordpress to jekyll, so it is all static
  pages.  Taking this out by AI scrapers overloading the machine should
  be next to impossible, and so far this has hold up.
</p>
<p>
  Nevertheless AI scrapers already managed to trigger one outage.
  Apparently millions of 404 answers where not enough to convince the
  bots that there is no cgit service (any more).  Apache had no
  problems to deliver those, but the logs have filled up the disk so
  fast that logrotate didn't manage to keep things under control with
  the default configuration.  Fixed config.  Knook wood.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
  ¹ Title inspired by
  the <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/39c3-security-nightmares">2025
  edition of Security Nightmares</a>.  Fun watching if you speak
  german.
  <br>
  ² Most inefficient way to get the complete repo.  Just clone it, ok?

<p>These small boards were built to demonstrate individual devices from pinball machines.&nbsp; They all have 24v (for relays and solenoids) and 6v (for lamps) AC power wired along the back.&nbsp; Each board attaches to its neighbor on the left side to form a string of display boards wired together.&nbsp; The first board in the string attaches to a transformer which supplies power to all boards in the string.&nbsp; Using the same connectors on each board allows the boards to be laid out in any order, and makes it easy to swap out or remove a board if it breaks down.</p>

<p>Each of the display boards is shown below with its instruction card which is typically propped up behind the board.</p>

<p>Click on any thumbnail to jump to the details section for that device.</p>

<h2><a id="TheBasics" name="TheBasics"></a>The Basics</h2>

<p>These devices represent the simplest building blocks of most electromechanical pinball machines.</p>

<h3><a id="Solenoid" name="Solenoid"></a>Solenoid</h3>

<p>Solenoids drive most of the motion in a pinball machine and are featured in most of the other displays.&nbsp; This solenoid is purposely weak and slow moving to show how it can lift the steel plunger when power is applied.&nbsp; Normally solenoids move their plungers so quickly that they are hard to follow.</p>

<p>This video shows how the solenoid works.&nbsp; In this case the steel plunger is attached to a wooden dowel with a round target at the top to better show the motion of the plunger as it is drawn into the solenoid.</p>

<h3><a id="Relays" name="Relays"></a>Relays</h3>

<p>Relays are smaller and weaker than solenoids and are usually only used to activate or hold switches to enable features and lights, or to release mechanisms that were activated by a solenoid (as in the <a href="http://funwithpinball.com/exhibits/small-boards-page-2#DisappearingPost">Disappearing Post</a>, <a href="#ZipperFlippers">Zipper Flippers</a> and others below).&nbsp; This board includes a simple relay, an interlocking relay which can stay in either position indefinitely without power, and a relay configured as a miniature stepper that turns a cam to open and close a switch.</p>

<h3><a id="PopBumpers" name="PopBumpers"></a>Pop Bumpers</h3>

<p>Perhaps the single most recognizable feature of a pinball machine, the Pop Bumper (or Jet Bumper) can kick a ball away that is approaching from any direction.</p>

</p>

<p>Pop Bumpers can fire several times per second and are too fast to easily discern the sequence of events.&nbsp; The version below uses a microcontroller and a couple of small motors to animate the pinball and pop bumper in slow motion.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="Flipper" name="Flipper"></a>Flippers</h3>

<p>While flippers appear on all pinball machines now they weren't invented until the late 1940s.&nbsp; Before then players had to nudge the ball around the playfield without tilting the game or rely on ball kickers that would only fire when the ball closed the appropriate switch.</p>

<p><a id="ZipperFlippers" name="ZipperFlippers"></a>Zipper Flippers work just like the <a href="#Flipper">Flipper</a> above but with the added feature that they can swing towards eachother to close the gap and prevent the ball from draining between them while remaining fully functional.&nbsp; They would open and close during the game based on which targets were hit.&nbsp; Zipper flippers were used on relatively few pinball machines.</p>

<h2><a id="Steppers" name="Steppers"></a>Steppers</h2>

<p>Steppers are used to step through a number of positions sequentially.&nbsp; They use ratcheting mechanisms to advance one step at a time and some use escapement mechanisms similar to those found in clocks to retract their steps either one step at a time, or all the way back to the beginning.</p>

<h3><a id="Stepper" name="Stepper"></a>Stepper Unit</h3>

<p>Stepper units are used to track features that step through a sequence as the game is played.&nbsp; For example the game might have several features that light up one at a time in order.&nbsp; This stepper is similar to the <a href="#ScoreReels">Score Reels</a> below because it advances one step at a time, in one direction only.&nbsp; It differs from the <a href="#CreditUnit">Credit Unit</a> and <a href="#BallCountUnit">Ball Count Unit</a> below because it can only advance; it cannot decrement or reset.</p>

<h3><a id="BallCountUnit" name="BallCountUnit"></a>Ball Count Unit</h3>

<p>The Ball Count Unit keeps track of how many balls the player has played.&nbsp; Lights wired to the Ball Count unit usually indicate the ball in play.&nbsp; The Ball Count Unit is another form of stepper that can step forward one step at a time or reset back to the beginning.&nbsp; It cannot decrement by one step like the <a href="#CreditUnit">Credit Unit</a> below.</p>

<h3><a id="CreditUnit" name="CreditUnit"></a>Credit Unit</h3>

<p>The Credit Unit keeps track of how many game credits the player has and is usually visible through a small window in the backglass.&nbsp; Coins and replays increase the total while each new game decreases the total.&nbsp; The credit unit is a form of stepper unit that can step both forward and backward one step at a time.</p>

<span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></span>
</p>

<p>The video below demonstrates the mechanism that limits the credit unit to one step at a time in either direction.&nbsp; This is done with mechanical lever arms activated by the increment and decrement solenoids.</p>

<p>It also reveals how the credit unit is electrically limited to a range of values (e.g. zero to 14 credits in this case).&nbsp; The video frame below shows two pins mounted to the dark grey gear which rotates to reflect the number of game credits.&nbsp; When there are zero credits remaining, the pin on left opens the two switches in the upper left corner to cut power to the decrement solenoid of the credit unit and to the new game circuit.&nbsp; In this state the credit unit will only allow the player to increment the credit count by winning a replay or depositing a coin.</p>

<p>Similarly, when a maximum number of credits is reached, the other pin (at the bottom of the frame below) opens the third switch which disables the increment solenoid of the credit unit.&nbsp; This prevents the credit unit from over winding.</p>

<h3><a id="ScoreReels" name="ScoreReels"></a>Score Reels</h3>

<p>Score reels are simple counters similar to mechanical odometers in older cars.&nbsp; Each reel can be advanced individually (to add 10 points, or 100 points for example), or advances when it's lower neighbor rolls over from 9 to 0 (from 89 to 90 for example).&nbsp; Each reel also has a separate reset circuit used at the start of a new game that lets it advance only until it reaches 0, where it stops.</p>

</p>

<p>The score reel video below shows how the 9 position and zero position switches open and close as the score reel advances.&nbsp; The 9 position switch is used to advance the next higher score reel and the zero position switch is used when resetting the score reel to 0.&nbsp; Most score reels have no way of knowing what digit is showing other than 0 and 9.</p>

</p>

<p>You may have noticed in the video that when a score reel resets to zero it advances its higher neighbor by one.&nbsp; This is not the normal behavior.&nbsp; A complete pinball machine has extra circuitry not present on this demonstration board to prevent this from happening.</p>

<h3><a id="ProjectionUnit" name="ProjectionUnit"></a>Projection Unit</h3>

<p>The Projection Unit was used to project the available game credits onto a frosted window on the backglass.&nbsp; Light from a bright bulb on the back of the unit shines through a pin hole, through the printed wheel, and through a focusing lens before reaching the glass.&nbsp; On this board the backglass is represented by a small piece of plastic held in a tube in front of the Projection Unit lens so the projection can be seen.</p>

<p>A predecessor to the <a href="#CreditUnit">Credit Unit</a> above, the Projection Unit was used in some games until the late 1940s.</p>

<h3><a id="SpinUnit" name="SpinUnit"></a>Spin Unit</h3>

<p>The Spin Unit is a clever way for the game to randomly change a game feature.&nbsp; Ordinarily steppers can only increment, decrement or reset.&nbsp; The Spin Unit is able to randomly change from any position to any other position.&nbsp; It does this by using a pair of steppers.&nbsp; The first, larger stepper is configured like a <a href="#BallCountUnit">Ball Count Unit</a>; it steps up one step at a time and can reset back to its starting position.&nbsp; During a game this stepper advances periodically as certain targets are hit or switches close.&nbsp; It also resets periodically when other targets are hit.</p>

<p>As the first stepper resets, the teardrop shaped board attached to its axle rotates and kicks the white spinner mounted above it.&nbsp; The spinner spins for an indeterminate number of revolutions, closing a switch once for each revolution.&nbsp; (The spinner mechanism is usually used on the playfield as a target that rewards points for each revolution.)</p>

<p>Each time the switch on the spinner closes, it sends a pulse to the second, smaller stepper which is configured as a simple <a href="#Stepper">Stepper</a> (with no decrement or reset).&nbsp; While the second stepper does advance a single step at a time, it advances a step for each revolution of the spinner which effectively randomizes its final resting position.</p>

<p>The number of steps the second stepper takes is loosely correlated to the number of steps the first stepper took before it kicked the spinner because each step on the first stepper winds its spring a little tighter and will make it kick the spinner a little harder.</p>

<pre><code>A long, long time ago
I can still remember how a protocol
used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those botnets dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But January made me shiver
With every packet I tried to deliver
Bad news on the backbone
I couldn't scan a single ASN

I can't remember if I cried
When my -f root hit an ACL line
But something touched me deep inside
The day the telnet died

So bye, bye mass spreading Mirai
Drove my SYNs down on the fiber line
But the fiber line was dry
And good old bots were passing creds in the clear and dry
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die</code></pre>
<p>On January 14, 2026, at approximately 21:00 UTC, something changed in the internet’s plumbing. The GreyNoise Global Observation Grid recorded a sudden, sustained collapse in global telnet traffic — not a gradual decline, not scanner attrition, not a data pipeline problem, but a step function. One hour, ~74,000 sessions. The next, ~22,000. By the following hour, we were down to ~11,000 and the floor held.</p>
<p>Six days later, on <a href="https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2026/q1/89">January 20</a>, the security advisory for CVE-2026-24061 hit oss-security. By <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2026/01/26/cisa-adds-five-known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">January 26</a>, CISA had added it to the KEV catalog.</p>
<p>We wrote about the <a href="https://www.labs.greynoise.io/grimoire/2026-01-22-f-around-and-find-out-18-hours-of-unsolicited-houseguests/index.html">first 18 hours of exploitation activity</a> back on January 22. This post is about something different: the structural change in global telnet traffic that preceded the CVE, and why we think the two events may not be independent.</p>
<section id="the-drop">
<h2 data-anchor-id="the-drop">The Drop</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.labs.greynoise.io/grimoire/2026-02-10-telnet-falls-silent/media/asn-heatmap.png"></p>
<p>From December 1, 2025 through January 14, 2026, GreyNoise observed an average of ~914,000 non-spoofable telnet sessions per day across 51.2 million total sessions — let’s call that the “baseline”.</p>
<p>On January 14 at 21:00 UTC, hourly volume dropped 65% in a single tick. Within two hours it had fallen 83% below baseline. The new average settled around ~373,000 sessions/day — a <strong>59% sustained reduction</strong> that persists through the time of writing (February 10).</p>
<p>This wasn’t a taper. The hourly data around the inflection point tells the story:</p>
<table>

</table>
<p>That kind of step function — propagating within a single hour window — reads as a configuration change on routing infrastructure, not behavioral drift in scanning populations.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-went-silent">
<h2 data-anchor-id="what-went-silent">What Went Silent</h2>
<p>Eighteen ASNs with significant pre-drop telnet volume (&gt;50K sessions each) went to absolute zero after January 15. Some of the names that stand out:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vultr</strong> (AS20473) — 382K pre-drop sessions, then nothing</li>
<li><strong>Cox Communications</strong> (AS22773) — 150K sessions, gone</li>
<li><strong>Charter/Spectrum</strong> (AS20115) — 141K sessions, gone</li>
<li><strong>BT/British Telecom</strong> (AS2856) — 127K sessions, gone</li>
</ul>
<p>Five entire countries vanished from GreyNoise telnet data: Zimbabwe, Ukraine, Canada, Poland, and Egypt. Not reduced — <em>zero</em>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the major cloud providers were largely unaffected or even increased. AWS went <em>up</em> 78%. Contabo <em>up</em> 90%. DigitalOcean essentially flat at +3%. Cloud providers have extensive private peering at major IXPs that bypasses traditional transit backbone paths. Residential and enterprise ISPs typically don’t.</p>
</section>
<section id="wheres-the-filter">
<h2 data-anchor-id="wheres-the-filter">Where’s the Filter?</h2>
<p>The pattern points toward one or more North American Tier 1 transit providers implementing port 23 filtering:</p>
<p>The timing — 21:00 UTC, which is 16:00 EST — is consistent with a US-based maintenance window. US residential ISPs (Cox, Charter, Comcast at -74%) were devastated while cloud providers on the same continent peered around whatever changed. Verizon/UUNET (AS701) dropped 79%, and as a major Tier 1 backbone, that’s consistent with it either being the filtering entity or sitting directly upstream of one. The 21% residual traffic on AS701 would represent paths that don’t transit the filtered links.</p>
<p>Countries that rely on transatlantic or transpacific backbone routes to reach US-hosted infrastructure got hit hardest. Countries with strong direct European peering (France at +18%, Germany at -1%) were essentially unaffected.</p>
<p>The Chinese backbone providers (China Telecom and China Unicom) both dropped ~59%, uniformly. That uniformity suggests the filter sits on the US side of transpacific links rather than within China. If this were a Chinese firewall action, we’d expect asymmetric impact across Chinese carriers and a harder cutoff.</p>
</section>
<section id="then-came-the-cve">
<h2 data-anchor-id="then-came-the-cve">Then Came the CVE</h2>
<p>CVE-2026-24061 is a critical (CVSS 9.8) authentication bypass in GNU Inetutils telnetd. The flaw is an argument injection in how telnetd handles the <code>USER</code> environment variable during telnet option negotiation. An attacker sends <code>-f root</code> as the username value, and <code>login(1)</code> obediently skips authentication, handing over a root shell. No credentials required. No user interaction. The vulnerable code was introduced in a 2015 commit and sat undiscovered for nearly 11 years.</p>

<p>The six-day gap between the telnet drop and the public CVE disclosure is the interesting part. On its face, the drop can’t have been <em>caused</em> by the CVE disclosure, because the drop happened first. But “caused by” isn’t the only relationship worth considering.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-supposition">
<h2 data-anchor-id="the-supposition">The Supposition</h2>
<p>Responsible disclosure timelines don’t start at publication. The researcher who found this (<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2026/01/critical-gnu-inetutils-telnetd-flaw.html">credited as Kyu Neushwaistein / Carlos Cortes Alvarez</a>) reported the flaw on January 19, per public sources. But the coordination that leads to patches being ready, advisories being drafted, and CISA being prepared to add something to the KEV within six days of publication typically starts earlier than the day before disclosure.</p>
<p>Here’s what we think may have happened: advance notification of a trivially exploitable, unauthenticated root-access vulnerability affecting telnet daemons reached parties with the ability to act on it at the infrastructure level. A backbone or transit provider — possibly responding to a coordinated request, possibly acting on their own assessment — implemented port 23 filtering on transit links. The filtering went live on January 14. The public disclosure followed on January 20.</p>
<p>This would explain:</p>
<ul>
<li>The timing gap (advance notification → infrastructure response → public disclosure)</li>
<li>The specificity of the filtering (port 23/TCP, not a general routing change)</li>
<li>The topology of impact (transit-dependent paths affected, direct-peering paths not)</li>
<li>The sustained nature (the filter is still in place weeks later)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can’t prove this. The backbone drop could be entirely coincidental — ISPs have been slowly moving toward filtering legacy insecure protocols for years (ref: Wannacry), and January 14 could simply have been when someone’s change control ticket finally got executed. Correlation, temporal proximity, and a plausible mechanism <em>absolutely do not</em> equal causation.</p>
<p>But the combination of a Tier 1 backbone implementing what appears to be port 23 filtering, followed six days later by the disclosure of a trivially exploitable root-access telnet vulnerability, followed four days after <em>that</em> by a CISA KEV listing, is worth documenting and considering.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-the-post-drop-world-looks-like">
<h2 data-anchor-id="what-the-post-drop-world-looks-like">What the Post-Drop World Looks Like</h2>
<p>The telnet landscape after January 14 shows a recurring sawtooth pattern — periodic spikes followed by troughs (e.g., January 28 at 806K sessions, then January 30 at 191K). This could indicate intermittent filter application, routing flaps around the filtering infrastructure, or scanner campaigns that happen to use paths not affected by the filter.</p>
<p>The weekly averages tell the sustained story:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Week Starting</th>
<th>Avg Daily Sessions</th>
<th>% of Baseline</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Dec 01</td>
<td>1,086,744</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>We’re now operating at roughly a third of the pre-drop baseline, and the trend is still slightly downward.</p>
</section>
<section id="practical-implications">
<h2 data-anchor-id="practical-implications">Practical Implications</h2>
<p>If you’re running GNU Inetutils telnetd anywhere — and given the 11-year window, there are plenty of embedded systems, network appliances, and legacy Linux installations where it’s still likely present — patch to version 2.7-2 or later, or disable the service entirely. The CISA KEV remediation deadline for federal agencies is February 16, 2026. As noted, GreyNoise observed exploitation attempts <a href="https://www.labs.greynoise.io/grimoire/2026-01-22-f-around-and-find-out-18-hours-of-unsolicited-houseguests/index.html">within hours of disclosure</a> and the campaign peaked at ~2,600 sessions/day in early February before tapering off.</p>
<p>If you’re a network operator and you haven’t already filtered port 23 at your border, the backbone-level filtering we’ve documented here suggests the industry is moving in that direction regardless. Someone upstream of a significant chunk of the internet’s transit infrastructure apparently decided telnet traffic isn’t worth carrying anymore. That’s probably the right call.</p>

            <p>Some time ago, I noted that <a title="Why did the Windows 95 CD have extra fun stuff?" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20060103-52/?p=32853"> the Windows 95 CD contained a variety of multimedia extras</a>, partly because they were fun, and partly to show off Windows 95’s multimedia capabilities.</p>
<p>One of those multimedia extras was the music video for the song <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Holly_(song)">Buddy Holly</a></i> by the band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weezer">Weezer</a>. Acquiring permission to redistribute the video took multiple steps.</p>
<p>First, Microsoft had to secure the rights to the song itself, which was negotiated directly with Weezer’s publisher Geffen Records, and apparently <a title="Knowledge Drop: Weezer Had No Idea The Music Video For " href="https://genius.com/a/weezer-had-no-idea-the-music-video-for-buddy-holly-would-be-included-with-windows-95"> without the knowledge of the band members themselves</a>. They were reportedly upset that they weren’t consulted but later realized that it was “one of the greatest things that could have happened to us. Can you imagine that happening today? It’s like, there’s one video on YouTube, and it’s your video.”</p>
<p>But that only secured the rights to the music. What about the video?</p>
<p>The video takes place in a reconstruction of a location from the <i>Happy Days</i> television program, and clips from that show were spliced into the music video to create the illusion that many of the characters from the show were part of the video. The lawyer responsible for securing the rights to the video had to contact all of the actors from <i>Happy Days</i> to get their permission. That lawyer thoroughly enjoyed the assignment. I don’t know whether he got to talk to the actors directly, or only to their agents, but I can imagine it being an interesting experience trying to find Henry Winkler’s telephone number (or his agent’s telephone number) with a chance of talking to The Fonz himself.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://hazemkrimi.tech/blog/linux-self-hosting-journey/">https://hazemkrimi.tech/blog/linux-self-hosting-journey/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46964159">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>I made the full switch into Linux in 2023 since I started following YouTubers like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LukeSmithxyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luke Smith</a>
and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/MentalOutlaw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mental Outlaw</a>
to name a few and then got into the rabbit hole of self-hosting on a budget therefore it is safe for me to say that I am somewhat experienced in this practice so I will walk you in this post on my setups over those 3 years, what I learned and what are my plans for the future.</p><h2 id="linux-as-my-main-os">Linux As My Main OS</h2><p>Back then I only had a desktop that I bought the year before and was using Windows 10 on it for gaming and work since at that time I was working with Microsoft software. Here are its specs (the only thing that remained till now is the GPU and case as I replaced everything else):</p><ul><li>Intel Core i5 10400.</li><li>16 GB DDR4 RAM.</li><li>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 8GB VRAM.</li><li>1 TB NVMe.</li></ul><p>Here is a picture of my desktop where I first bought it (apologies for the image quality):</p><p><img src="https://hazemkrimi.tech/blog/linux-self-hosting-journey/desktop.webp" alt="Picture of my desktop in 2023"></p><p>For me the main reason for making the switch to Linux is that I wanted to learn it hands on and dedicate my computer for software development, I started out with Debian 11 as my first distro.
I wasn’t doing too much gaming but I came up with a solution for some of the games I was playing with friends that had Anti-Cheat and that was a VM with GPU passthrough thanks to QEMU/KVM which was built in and allowed me to have a config in such a way that Windows and the Anti-Cheat software can’t figure that they are running in a VM.</p><p>Here are guides I used back in 2024 when I updated my VM to use Windows 11 through Qemu/KVM and GPU Passthrough:</p><ul><li><a href="https://sysguides.com/install-kvm-on-linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Installing KVM And QEMU</a></li><li><a href="https://sysguides.com/install-a-windows-11-virtual-machine-on-kvm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Installing Windows 11 On VMs</a></li></ul><p>Other reasons that are still as important are ownership and privacy: I get to use my OS without having to have an account tied to the developers and customize it to my heart’s content all with minimal resource consumption. There are still issues with driver and software compatibility but it is getting better in the recent years thanks to projects like <a href="https://www.winehq.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wine</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proton</a>
.</p><h2 id="self-hosting">Self-Hosting</h2><p>Previously, I had my website deployed on Vercel since back then I made it using Next.js but as I got deeper into the optimization meme I recreated my website in <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hugo</a>
which worked out pretty well and I am now more satisfied with its performance. Naturally, since I migrated away from Next.js I decided to get my own VPS and deploy the website there. I would say I got an overpowered one for my uses but I gained the capability to have more stuff in there like some of my personal projects and my own email through open source tools (check Luke Smith’s <a href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/emailwiz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emailwiz</a>
repo). Here is the VPS specs which I got from Hostinger through a YouTuber’s affiliate link:</p><ul><li>AMD EPYC 9354P 8 Cores.</li><li>32 GB DDR4 RAM.</li><li>400 GB NVMe.</li><li>32 TB Bandwidth.</li></ul><p>Having to manage a server comes with learning more tools related to System Administration like Nginx, Certbot, GitHub Actions, Systemd services, setting up SSH and firewall rules, blocking unwanted traffic through <a href="https://github.com/crowdsecurity/crowdsec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crowdsec</a>
. This made me get a better hands on understanding on how different components work in Linux since nothing is abstracted away like it was with Vercel and had to configure almost everything by hand. Here are some guides that helped me setup my website on my VPS:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmbBgXK8M5M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VPS Setup And Website Deployment</a></li><li><a href="https://curiouscoding.nl/posts/goaccess-setup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Based Website Analytics Written In C</a></li></ul><p>And here is a sneak peek at my latest analytics stats:</p><video autoplay="" muted="" playsinline="" loop="" preload="metadata">
<source src="https://hazemkrimi.tech/blog/linux-self-hosting-journey/analytics.webm" type="video/webm">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><h2 id="my-home-server">My Home Server</h2><p>The next thing I did was to get some sort of personal cloud that is hosted locally mainly to sync and backup files between my devices and block ads in my local network. For that I started out with a Raspberry Pi 4 that had 8 GB of RAM in which I connected a 500 GB SSD external drive and for cooling I got heatsinks and a cpu fan and kept it running 24/7 and it worked surprisingly well for a good amount of time. I used <a href="https://syncthing.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Syncthing</a>
for file synchronization and <a href="https://pi-hole.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PiHole</a>
as my local network DNS server to block unwanted incoming traffic. Here are pictures of my Raspberry Pi and how I mounted it to my old desk in 2024:</p><p><img src="https://hazemkrimi.tech/blog/linux-self-hosting-journey/pi.webp" alt="Picture of my RPi"></p><p><img src="https://hazemkrimi.tech/blog/linux-self-hosting-journey/pi-boxed-ssd.webp" alt="Picture of my RPi mounted to my old desk"></p><p>Then in 2025 I got a new desktop so I used the old one as my home server. I upgraded the RAM to 32 GB and the CPU to an i5 12400 and got an SSD on which I installed <a href="https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proxmox VE</a>
. Thanks to the <a href="https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">community scripts</a>
I was able to get the stuff I had on the Pi migrated to my home server with ease into separate LXCs and VMs. I also added the ability to connect to my home server remotely through VPN using <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wireguard</a>
and since my ip at home is dynamic I registered a subdomain as a DDNS record and used <a href="https://ddclient.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ddclient</a>
on the server to automatically send the new ip every time it changes. Here are some guides I used to configure PCIe passthrough both to VMs and LXCs to pass my GPU for better performance:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hOBAGKLQkI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proxmox PCIe Passthrough</a></li><li><a href="https://digitalspaceport.com/proxmox-lxc-docker-gpu-passthrough-setup-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proxmox LXC GPU Passthrough Written Guide</a></li></ul><p>Here is my home server running 24/7 and connected to a UPS to stay up for a while in case of a power outage (the other UPS is connected to other devices like the router):</p><p><img src="https://hazemkrimi.tech/blog/linux-self-hosting-journey/home-server.webp" alt="Picture of my home server"></p><p>And here is its proxmox dashboard from where I can access LXCs and VMs or monitor and manage resources:</p><p><img src="https://hazemkrimi.tech/blog/linux-self-hosting-journey/proxmox.webp" alt="Proxmox dashboard"></p><h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2><p>Getting into Linux and self-hosting made me better at system administration and got me excited and hopeful about having as much autonomy as possible with the tools I use especially with the current times where almost every commercial software dedicated to normal consumers hoards and sells data to be used for ads even in paid products. Although it is not for everyone since it involves a lot of configuration which requires patience but for me it is so I will continue to incoporate free and open source tools into my “personal cloud” to keep learning as a software engineer and to keep control of my digital footprint.</p><p>One step I recently took in that direction is installing my own search engine using <a href="https://docs.searxng.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SearXNG</a>
on my VPS which I can use on all of my devices. Other steps I plan to take is to get into more Linux distros (I tried debian based, Arch and Nix) and most importantly contribute back to the open source tools in any way I can whether financially or through assistance in development.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://theintercept.com/2026/02/10/google-ice-subpoena-student-journalist/">https://theintercept.com/2026/02/10/google-ice-subpoena-student-journalist/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46963804">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <p><span>Google provided</span> Immigration and Customs Enforcement with a wide array of personal data on a student activist and journalist, including his credit card and bank account numbers, according to a copy of an ICE subpoena obtained by The Intercept.</p>
<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2025/09/16/google-facebook-subpoena-ice-students-gaza/">Amandla Thomas-Johnson</a> had attended a protest targeting companies that supplied weapons to Israel at a Cornell University job fair in 2024 for all of five minutes, but the action got him banned from campus. When President Donald Trump assumed office and issued a series of executive orders targeting students who protested in support of Palestinians, Thomas-Johnson and his friend Momodou Taal went into hiding.</p>
<p>Google informed Thomas-Johnson via a brief email in April that it had already shared his metadata with the Department of Homeland Security, as The Intercept <a href="https://theintercept.com/2025/09/16/google-facebook-subpoena-ice-students-gaza/">previously reported</a>. But the full extent of the information the tech giant provided —&nbsp;including usernames, addresses, itemized list of services, including any IP masking services, telephone or instrument numbers, subscriber numbers or identities, and credit card and bank account numbers — was not previously known.</p>
<p>“I’d already seen the subpoena request that Google and Meta had sent to Momodou [Taal], and I knew that he had gotten in touch with a lawyer and the lawyer successfully challenged that,” Thomas-Johnson said. “I was quite surprised to see that I didn’t have that opportunity.”<ins></ins></p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[0] -->
<p>The subpoena provides no justification for why ICE is asking for this information, except that it’s required “in connection with an investigation or inquiry relating to the enforcement of U.S. immigration laws.” In the subpoena, ICE requests that Google not “disclose the existence of this summons for indefinite period of time.”</p>
<p>Thomas-Johnson, who is British, believes that ICE requested that information to track and eventually detain him — but he had already fled to Geneva, Switzerland, and is now in Dakar, Senegal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation, which is representing Thomas-Johnson, and the ACLU of Northern California sent a letter to Google, Amazon, Apple, Discord, Meta, Microsoft, and Reddit last week calling on tech companies to resist similar subpoenas in the future from DHS without court intervention. The letter asks the companies to provide users with as much notice as possible before complying with a subpoena to give them the opportunity to fight it, and to resist gag orders that would prevent the tech companies from informing targets that a subpoena was issued.</p>
<p>“Your promises to protect the privacy of users are being tested right now. As part of the federal government’s unprecedented campaign to target critics of its conduct and policies, agencies like DHS have repeatedly demanded access to the identities and information of people on your services,” the letter reads. “Based on our own contact with targeted users, we are deeply concerned your companies are failing to challenge unlawful surveillance and defend user privacy and speech.”</p>
<p>In addition to Thomas-Johnson’s case, the letter refers to other instances in which technology companies provided user data to DHS, including a subpoena sent to Meta to “unmask” the identities of users who documented immigration raids in California. Unlike Thomas-Johnson, users in that case were given the chance to fight the subpoena because they were made aware of it before Meta complied.</p>
<p>Lindsay Nash, a professor at Cardozo Law and a former staff attorney with ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project, said that by not giving prior notice, Google deprived Thomas-Johnson of his ability to protect his information.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Your promises to protect the privacy of users are being tested right now.”</p>

<p>“The problem is that it doesn’t allow the person whose personal information is on the line and whose privacy may be being invaded to raise challenges to the disclosure of that potentially private information,” Nash said. “And I think that’s important to protect rights that they may have to their own information.”</p>
<p>Google did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Tech companies’ data sharing practices are primarily governed by two federal laws, the Stored Communications Act, which protects the privacy of digital communications, including emails, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive trade practices.</p>
<p>“Under both federal law and the law of every state, you cannot deceive consumers,” said Neil Richards, a law professor at Washington University St. Louis who specializes in privacy, the internet, and civil liberties. “And if you make a material misrepresentation about your data practices, that’s a deceptive trade practice.”</p>
<p>Whether or not corporations are clear enough with consumers about how they collect and share their <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2019/07/ftc-sues-cambridge-analytica-settles-former-ceo-app-developer">data has been litigated for decades</a>, Richards said, referencing the infamous Cambridge Analytica lawsuit brought by the Federal Trade Commission, alleging that the company misled Facebook users about data collection and sharing.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>Google’s <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#infosharing">public privacy policy acknowledges</a> that it will share personal information in response to an “enforceable governmental request,” adding that its legal team will “frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process.”</p>
<p>According to Google, the <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/user-data/overview">company overwhelmingly complied with the millions of requests</a> made by the government for user information over the last decade. Its data also shows that those requests have spiked over the last five years. It’s unclear how many of those users were given notice of those requests ahead of time or after.</p>
<p>Richards said that cases like these emphasize the need for legal reforms around data privacy and urged Congress to amend the Stored Communications Act to require a higher standard before the government can access our digital data. He also said the federal government needs to regulate Big Tech and place “substantive restrictions on their ability to share information with the government.”</p>
<p>It’s hard to know exactly how tech companies are handling our personal data in relation to the government, but there seems to have been a shift in optics, Richards said. “What we have seen in the 12 months since the leaders of Big Tech were there on the podium at the inauguration,” Richards said, “is much more friendliness of Big Tech towards the government and towards state power.”</p>
<p>From Dakar, Thomas-Johnson said that understanding the extent of the subpoena was terrifying but had not changed his commitment to his <a>work</a>.</p>
<p>“As a journalist, what’s weird is that you’re so used to seeing things from the outside,” said Thomas-Johnson, whose work has appeared in outlets including Al Jazeera and The Guardian. “We need to think very hard about what resistance looks like under these conditions… where government and Big Tech know so much about us, can track us, can imprison, can destroy us in a variety of ways.”</p>

<p>Everyone in <span>San Francisco</span> is talking about the singularity. At dinner parties, at coffee shops, at the OpenClaw meetup where Ashton Kutcher showed up for some reason. The conversations all have the same shape: someone says it's coming, someone says it's hype, and nobody has a number.</p>
<p>This seems like the wrong question. If things are accelerating (and they measurably are) the interesting question isn't <em>whether</em>. It's <em>when</em>. And if it's accelerating, we can calculate <span>exactly when</span>.</p>
<p>I collected five real metrics of AI progress, fit a hyperbolic model to each one independently, and found the one with genuine curvature toward a <span>pole</span>. The date has <span>millisecond precision</span>. There is a countdown.</p>
<p>(I am aware this is <span>unhinged</span>. We're doing it anyway.)</p>

<h2>The Data</h2>
<p>Five metrics, chosen for what I'm calling their <em>anthropic significance</em> (anthropic here in the Greek sense ("pertaining to humans"), not the company, though they appear in the dataset with suspicious frequency):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>MMLU scores</strong>: the SAT for language models</li>
<li><strong>Tokens per dollar</strong>: cost collapse of intelligence (log-transformed, because the Gemini Flash outlier spans 150× the range otherwise)</li>
<li><strong>Frontier release intervals</strong>: shrinking gap between <span>"holy shit"</span> moments</li>
<li><strong>arXiv "emergent" papers</strong> (<span>trailing 12mo</span>): field excitement, measured <span>memetically</span></li>
<li><strong>Copilot code share</strong>: fraction of code written by AI</li>
</ol>
<!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><p>Calibrating instruments...</p><!--/$-->
<p>Each metric <span>normalized</span> to <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mn>0</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="false">]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">[0, 1]</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. Release intervals inverted (shorter = better). Tokens per dollar log-transformed before normalizing (the raw values span <span>five orders of magnitude</span>; without the log, Gemini Flash at 2.5M tokens/$ dominates the fit and everything else is noise). Each series keeps its own scale, no merging into a single ensemble.</p>

<h2>Why Hyperbolic</h2>
<p>Most people extrapolate AI with <span>exponentials</span>. Wrong move!</p>
<p>An exponential <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mi>a</mi><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mi>b</mi><mi>t</mi></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f(t) = ae^{bt}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> approaches infinity only as <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>→</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">t \to \infty</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. You'd be waiting forever. Literally.</p>
<p>We need a function that hits infinity at a <em>finite</em> time. That's the whole point of a singularity: a pole, a <span>vertical asymptote</span>, <span>the math breaking</span>:</p>
<p><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mi>k</mi><mrow><msub><mi>t</mi><mi>s</mi></msub><mo>−</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mi>c</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x(t) = \frac{k}{t_s - t} + c</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></p>
<p>As <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>→</mo><msubsup><mi>t</mi><mi>s</mi><mo>−</mo></msubsup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">t \to t_s^-</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, the denominator goes to zero. <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>→</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x(t) \to \infty</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. Not a bug. <span><em>The</em> feature.</span></p>
<!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><p>Calibrating instruments...</p><!--/$-->
<p><strong>Polynomial</strong> growth (<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>t</mi><mi>n</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">t^n</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>) never reaches infinity at finite time. You could wait until <span>heat death</span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>t</mi><mn>47</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">t^{47}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> would still be finite. Polynomials are for people who think AGI is "decades away."</p>
<p><strong>Exponential</strong> growth reaches infinity at <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">t = \infty</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. Technically a singularity, but an infinitely patient one. Moore's Law was exponential. We are no longer on Moore's Law.</p>
<p><strong>Hyperbolic</strong> growth is what happens when the thing that's growing <em>accelerates its own growth</em>. Better AI → better AI research tools → better AI → better tools. Positive feedback with <span>supralinear dynamics</span>. The singularity is real and finite.</p>

<h2>The Fit</h2>
<p>The procedure is straightforward, which should concern you.</p>
<p>The model fits a separate hyperbola to each metric:</p>
<p><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>y</mi><mi>i</mi><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>j</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mfrac><msub><mi>k</mi><mi>j</mi></msub><mrow><msub><mi>t</mi><mi>s</mi></msub><mo>−</mo><msub><mi>t</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow></mfrac><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>c</mi><mi>j</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">y_i^{(j)} = \frac{k_j}{t_s - t_i} + c_j</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></p>
<p>Each series <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>j</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">j</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> gets its own <span>scale <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>k</mi><mi>j</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">k_j</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> and <span>offset <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>c</mi><mi>j</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">c_j</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>. The singularity time <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>t</mi><mi>s</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">t_s</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is shared. MMLU scores and tokens-per-dollar have no business being on the same y-axis, but they can agree on when the pole is.</p>
<p>For each candidate <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>t</mi><mi>s</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">t_s</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, the per-series fits are <span>linear in <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>k</mi><mi>j</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">k_j</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>c</mi><mi>j</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">c_j</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>. The question is: which <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>t</mi><mi>s</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">t_s</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> makes the hyperbola fit best?</p>
<p>Here's the thing nobody tells you about fitting singularities: most metrics don't actually have one. If you minimize total <span>RSS</span> across all series, the best <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>t</mi><mi>s</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">t_s</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is always at infinity. A distant hyperbola <span>degenerates</span> into a line, and lines fit noisy data just fine. The "singularity date" ends up being whatever you set as the search boundary. You're finding the edge of your search grid, not a singularity.</p>
<p>So instead, we look for the real signal. For each series independently, <span>grid search</span> <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>t</mi><mi>s</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">t_s</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and find the <span>R²</span> peak: the date where hyperbolic fits <em>better</em> than any nearby alternative. If a series genuinely curves toward a pole, its R² will peak at some finite <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>t</mi><mi>s</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">t_s</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and then decline. If it's really just linear, R² will keep increasing as <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>t</mi><mi>s</mi></msub><mo>→</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">t_s \to \infty</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and never peak. No peak, no signal, no vote!</p>
<p><span>One series peaks!</span> arXiv "emergent" (the count of AI papers about emergence) has a clear, unambiguous R² maximum. The other four are <span>monotonically</span> better fit by a line. The singularity date comes from the one metric that's actually going hyperbolic.</p>
<p>This is more honest than forcing five metrics to average out to a date that none of them individually support.</p>
<p>Same inputs → same date. <span>Deterministic</span>. The <span>stochasticity</span> is in the universe, not the model.</p>

<h2>The Date</h2>
<!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><p>Calibrating instruments...</p><!--/$-->
<p>The fit <span>converged</span>! Each series has its own <span>R²</span> at the shared <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>t</mi><mi>s</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">t_s</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, so you can see exactly which metrics the hyperbola captures well and which it doesn't. arXiv's R² is the one that matters. It's the series that actually peaked.</p>
<p>The 95% confidence interval comes from <span>profile likelihood</span> on <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>t</mi><mi>s</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">t_s</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. We slide the singularity date forward and backward until the fit degrades past an <span>F-threshold</span>.</p>

<h2>Sensitivity</h2>
<p>How much does the date move if we drop one metric entirely?</p>
<!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><p>Calibrating instruments...</p><!--/$-->
<p>If dropping a single series shifts <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>t</mi><mi>s</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">t_s</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> by years, that series was doing all the work. If the shifts are zero, the dropped series never had a signal in the first place.</p>
<p>The table tells the story plainly: arXiv is doing all the work. Drop it and the date jumps to the search boundary (no remaining series has a finite peak). Drop anything else and nothing moves. They were never contributing to the date, only providing context curves at the shared <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>t</mi><mi>s</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">t_s</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>Note: Copilot has exactly 2 data points and 2 parameters (<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">k</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">c</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>), so it fits any hyperbola perfectly. Zero RSS, zero influence on <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>t</mi><mi>s</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">t_s</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. It's along for the ride!</p>

<h2>What <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>t</mi><mi>s</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">t_s</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> Actually Means</h2>
<p>The model says <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>y</mi><mo>→</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">y \to \infty</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> at <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>t</mi><mi>s</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">t_s</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. But what does "infinity" mean for arXiv papers about emergence? It doesn't mean infinitely many papers get published on a Tuesday in 2034.</p>
<p>It means the model breaks. <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>t</mi><mi>s</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">t_s</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is the point where the current trajectory's curvature can no longer be sustained. The system either breaks through into something qualitatively new, or it saturates and the hyperbola was wrong. A <span>phase transition marker</span>, not a physical prediction.</p>

<p>But here's the part that should unsettle you: <strong>the metric that's actually going hyperbolic is human attention, not machine capability.</strong></p>
<p>MMLU, tokens per dollar, release intervals. The actual capability and infrastructure metrics. All linear. No pole. No singularity signal. The only curve pointing at a finite date is the count of papers about emergence. Researchers noticing and naming new behaviors. <em>Field excitement, measured memetically.</em></p>
<p>The data says: machines are improving at a constant rate. Humans are freaking out about it at an accelerating rate that accelerates its own acceleration.</p>
<p>That's a very different singularity than the one people argue about.</p>

It's what happens to us.</p>
<p>And the uncomfortable answer is: <span>it's already happening.</span></p>
<figure><img src="https://campedersen.com/_next/static/media/this-is-fine.4256436c.jpg" alt="This is fine dog sitting in a burning room"></figure>
<p><strong>The labor market isn't adjusting. It's snapping.</strong> In 2025, <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/12/09/forever-layoffs-job-security-k-shaped-economy-white-collar-recession-challenger-glassdoor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1.1 million layoffs were announced</a>.

The displacement is anticipatory. The curve doesn't need to reach the pole. It just needs to <span><em>look like it will</em></span>.</p>
<p><strong>Institutions can't keep up.</strong> The EU AI Act's high-risk rules have <a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">already been delayed to 2027</a>. The US <a href="https://www.metricstream.com/blog/ai-regulation-trends-ai-policies-us-uk-eu.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">revoked its own 2023 AI executive order</a> in January 2025, then issued a new one in December trying to preempt state laws. California and Colorado are <a href="https://www.softwareimprovementgroup.com/blog/us-ai-legislation-overview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">going their own way anyway</a>. The laws being written today regulate 2023's problems. By the time legislation catches up to GPT-4, we're on GPT-7. When governments visibly can't keep up, trust doesn't erode. It <a href="https://phys.org/news/2025-10-falters-weak-digital-misinformation.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">collapses</a>. Global trust in AI has dropped to 56%.</p>
<p><strong>Capital is concentrating at dot-com levels.</strong> The top 10 S&amp;P 500 stocks (almost all AI-adjacent) hit <a href="https://www.apolloacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ExtremeAIConcentration-090825.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">40.7% of index weight</a> in 2025, surpassing the dot-com peak. Since ChatGPT launched, AI-related stocks have captured <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/22/your-portfolio-may-be-more-tech-heavy-than-you-think.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">75% of S&amp;P 500 returns, 80% of earnings growth, and 90% of capital spending growth</a>.

The last time it was this high was <span>1999</span>. The money flooding in doesn't require AI to actually reach superintelligence. It just requires enough people to believe the curve keeps going up.</p>
<p><strong>People are losing the thread.</strong> Therapists are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/24/ai-artificial-intelligence-worries-therapy.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">reporting a surge</a> in what they're calling <span>FOBO</span> (Fear of Becoming Obsolete).

<p><strong>The epistemics are cracking.</strong> Less than <a href="https://research.aimultiple.com/reproducible-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">a third of AI research is reproducible</a>. Under 5% of researchers share their code. Corporate labs are publishing less.

The experts who testify before Congress contradict each other, because the field is moving <span>faster than expertise can form.</span></p>
<p><strong>The politics are realigning.</strong> <a href="https://time.com/7371825/trump-data-center-ai-backlash-ai-america-china/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">TIME</a> is writing about populist AI backlash. <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/coming-ai-backlash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Foreign Affairs</a> published "The Coming AI Backlash: How the Anger Economy Will Supercharge Populism." <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-coming-war-over-ai-will-define-the-2026-midterms_n_6953f7fbe4b06a970133dfb7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HuffPost</a> says AI will define the 2026 midterms.

It's when humans lose the ability to make coherent collective decisions about machines. The actual capabilities are almost beside the point. The social fabric frays at the seams of attention and institutional response time, not at the frontier of model performance.</p>
<!-- -->
<h2>Caveats</h2>
<p><strong>The date comes from one series.</strong> arXiv "emergent" is the only metric with genuine hyperbolic curvature. The other four are better fit by straight lines. The singularity date is really "the date when AI emergence research goes vertical." Whether field excitement is a <span>leading indicator</span> or a <span>lagging one</span> is the crux of whether this means anything.</p>
<figure><img src="https://campedersen.com/_next/static/media/honest-work.9594c4e9.jpg" alt="It ain't much, but it's honest work"></figure>
<p><strong>The model assumes <span>stationarity</span>.</strong> Like assuming the weather will continue to be "changing." The curve will bend, either into a <span>logistic</span> (the hype saturates) or into something the model can't represent (genuine phase transition). <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>t</mi><mi>s</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">t_s</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> marks where the current regime can't continue, not what comes after.</p>
<p><strong>MMLU is hitting its ceiling.</strong> Benchmark saturation introduces a <span>leptokurtic compression artifact</span>. MMLU's low R² reflects this. The hyperbola is <span>the wrong shape</span> for saturating data.</p>
<p><strong>Tokens per dollar is <span>log-transformed</span></strong> (values span five orders of magnitude) <strong>and <span>non-monotonic</span></strong> (GPT-4 cost more than 3.5; Opus 4.5 costs more than DeepSeek-R1). The cost curve isn't smooth: it's <span>Pareto advances</span> interspersed with <span>"we spent more on this one."</span></p>
<p><strong>Five metrics isn't enough.</strong> More series with genuine hyperbolic curvature would make the date less dependent on arXiv alone. A proper study would add SWE-bench, ARC, GPQA, compute purchases, talent salaries. I used five because <span>five fits in a table</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Copilot has two data points.</strong> Two parameters, two points, zero <span>degrees of freedom</span>, zero RSS contribution. The sensitivity analysis confirms it doesn't matter.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Real data. Real model. Real date!</p>
<p>The math found one metric curving toward a pole on a specific day at a specific millisecond: the rate at which humans are discovering emergent AI behaviors. The other four metrics are linear. The machines are improving steadily. <span>We are the ones accelerating!</span></p>
<p>The social consequences of that acceleration (labor displacement, institutional failure, capital concentration, epistemic collapse, political realignment) are not predictions for 2034. They are descriptions of 2026. The singularity in the data is a singularity in human attention, and it is already exerting gravitational force on everything it touches.</p>
<p>I see no reason to let <span>epistemological humility</span> interfere with a <span>perfectly good timer</span>.</p>
<span>See you on the other side!</span></article><!--$--><!--/$--></main></div></div>]]></description>

They are just one person in a sea of online hate content. But their explanation of their actions helps shed light on the motivations behind a wider online trend. </p><p>London is being used as the backdrop for inaccurate viral videos that reach enormous audiences around the world by playing into the worst stereotypes about the capital. </p><p><strong>See that story – and what Sadiq Khan has to say about our reporting – below. </strong></p><p><em>Read to the end for Taylor Swift’s visit to a forthcoming Croydon mixed-used redevelopment, the growing number of freemasons in the Met police, and what we missed about Jeffrey Epstein’s London.</em></p><p><strong>By Katherine Denkinson and Jim Waterson</strong></p><p>The man on the recording is baffled. He can’t understand how London Centric traced his anonymous hate-filled London TikTok account back to his employer by geolocating the wheelie bins in his videos.</p><p>“I thought no one’s gonna notice that,” he says. “Why would someone?”</p><p>Last summer, the man says, he found himself sitting in his car, analysing trends on TikTok. His day job was conducting viewings for an estate agency but he was trying to come up with an idea for a viral video account that could be run as a money-making side-hustle.</p><p>“I was thinking of unique videos I can do for people,” he says on the tape. </p><p>That’s when he had a brainwave: “Hate brings views.” </p><p>At that time protests outside asylum hotels were spreading across the country. The man says he noticed “far-right people” were among the most engaged on TikTok. They were easy to rile up: “They hate such videos of illegal migrants. I was like, why not?”</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EuSS!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbae4353c-8b38-46a0-95eb-557b393eb3fc_1236x1088.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EuSS!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbae4353c-8b38-46a0-95eb-557b393eb3fc_1236x1088.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EuSS!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbae4353c-8b38-46a0-95eb-557b393eb3fc_1236x1088.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EuSS!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbae4353c-8b38-46a0-95eb-557b393eb3fc_1236x1088.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EuSS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbae4353c-8b38-46a0-95eb-557b393eb3fc_1236x1088.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EuSS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbae4353c-8b38-46a0-95eb-557b393eb3fc_1236x1088.jpeg" width="1236" height="1088" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bae4353c-8b38-46a0-95eb-557b393eb3fc_1236x1088.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1088,&quot;width&quot;:1236,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:452687,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.londoncentric.media/i/187071963?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbae4353c-8b38-46a0-95eb-557b393eb3fc_1236x1088.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EuSS!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbae4353c-8b38-46a0-95eb-557b393eb3fc_1236x1088.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EuSS!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbae4353c-8b38-46a0-95eb-557b393eb3fc_1236x1088.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EuSS!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbae4353c-8b38-46a0-95eb-557b393eb3fc_1236x1088.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EuSS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbae4353c-8b38-46a0-95eb-557b393eb3fc_1236x1088.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Typical screengrabs of videos from the viral TikTok account.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The result was the account Reform_UK_2025, which co-opted the logo and name of Nigel Farage’s political movement without permission from the party.

He claimed they were a member of the public who had been looking to rent a flat from his company.</p><p>He now accepts that was a lie – and he knew it was a lie when he told us. </p><p>Now, Wasserstrum wants to set out a different version of events. He says the person behind the camera was really a “rogue” contractor he employed for two years as a viewings agent to show potential residents around the properties. Wasserstrum says he had no idea that his employee had been running the hate-filled TikTok account until we first approached his company in November. He says the employee was sacked soon afterwards and he regrets ever telling us that a client was responsible.</p><p>To back up his case, Wasserstrum provided London Centric with multiple lengthy audio recordings of what he says is him confronting the anonymous employee.

He even suggests that Wasserstrum should not be concerned by London Centric’s reporting because </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jimwaterson/video/7599207225571233046?lang=en" rel="">our own video</a><span> didn’t attract anything like as many viewers as his original hate-filled fake uploads. </span></p><p>“Their video didn’t even go that viral,” he offers by way of defence, arguing it could therefore be ignored. “They only got like 200,000 views on TikTok. It’s probably gonna die. It’s not gonna last long.”</p><p>The man tells Wasserstrum that he does not want to own up to running the account because “it’s going to make it much worse” and could “ruin [his] life”. In any case, he says, journalists would simply think he was a “paid actor”.</p><p>Wasserstrum can be heard on the recordings spelling out to the man how London Centric had approached the business. “They came to the office... they had every single fact you can think about,” he says. “They’ve cross referenced everything… We’ve had management companies calling us, councils calling us up, saying you’re putting our clients in danger.”</p><p>The man appears confused by the fuss his actions have caused. He gives the impression that he considered TikTok’s algorithm and the site’s content regulation policies to be the ultimate arbiter of whether a video crossed a line. </p><p>He insists the impact on tenants whose faces are visible in some of the videos was limited because they “didn’t get a lot of views” compared to his other content.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9sZR!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff200f2f0-5de3-46cd-9621-9ee531cdccce_494x229.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9sZR!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff200f2f0-5de3-46cd-9621-9ee531cdccce_494x229.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9sZR!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff200f2f0-5de3-46cd-9621-9ee531cdccce_494x229.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9sZR!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff200f2f0-5de3-46cd-9621-9ee531cdccce_494x229.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9sZR!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff200f2f0-5de3-46cd-9621-9ee531cdccce_494x229.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9sZR!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff200f2f0-5de3-46cd-9621-9ee531cdccce_494x229.jpeg" width="494" height="229" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f200f2f0-5de3-46cd-9621-9ee531cdccce_494x229.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:229,&quot;width&quot;:494,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:10844,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.londoncentric.media/i/187071963?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff200f2f0-5de3-46cd-9621-9ee531cdccce_494x229.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9sZR!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff200f2f0-5de3-46cd-9621-9ee531cdccce_494x229.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9sZR!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff200f2f0-5de3-46cd-9621-9ee531cdccce_494x229.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9sZR!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff200f2f0-5de3-46cd-9621-9ee531cdccce_494x229.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9sZR!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff200f2f0-5de3-46cd-9621-9ee531cdccce_494x229.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>A comment left by the account creator on one of his videos.</figcaption></figure></div><p>“It wasn’t racist,” the man says of his account.

We recognise the very real threat that these videos posed to the individuals filmed and to whom false views were attributed. We have reported the matter to the police.</p><p>“We conducted a thorough investigation as soon as the matter was brought to our attention. We established that the videos were created by a third-party contractor who acted without the authority, knowledge, or consent of the company. We severed all ties with the contractor immediately. We are appalled by his actions and condemn them in the strongest possible terms.</p><p>“We are committed to acting transparently and rebuilding trust with our partners and the communities we serve. We are fully prepared to cooperate with the authorities and to assist with any investigation.”</p><p>Despite fostering online hatred, the man recorded by Wasserstrum insists he doesn’t personally share the views expressed on his TikTok account. Instead, he suggests his fake anti-migrant house tour videos were just a way to game the algorithm, build an audience, and hopefully make money.</p><p>”I didn’t do anything because of hate,” he says on the tape. “I didn’t care. It’s just I wanted the clicks.”</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.londoncentric.media/p/london-tiktok-fake-news-creator-hate-immigrants/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.londoncentric.media/p/london-tiktok-fake-news-creator-hate-immigrants/comments" rel=""><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p><em>All our reporting is funded by our paying subscribers, who receive exclusive investigations.

<p dir="auto"><strong>Open-source AI coworker that turns work into a knowledge graph and acts on it</strong></p>

<p dir="auto">Rowboat connects to your email and meeting notes, builds a long-lived knowledge graph, and uses that context to help you get work done - privately, on your machine.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can do things like:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>Build me a deck about our next quarter roadmap</code> → generates a PDF using context from your knowledge graph</li>
<li><code>Prep me for my meeting with Alex</code> → pulls past decisions, open questions, and relevant threads into a crisp brief (or a voice note)</li>
<li>Visualize, edit, and update your knowledge graph anytime (it’s just Markdown)</li>
<li>Record voice memos that automatically capture and update key takeaways in the graph</li>

<p dir="auto">Rowboat is a <strong>local-first AI coworker</strong> that can:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Remember</strong> the important context you don’t want to re-explain (people, projects, decisions, commitments)</li>
<li><strong>Understand</strong> what’s relevant right now (before a meeting, while replying to an email, when writing a doc)</li>
<li><strong>Help you act</strong> by drafting, summarizing, planning, and producing real artifacts (briefs, emails, docs, PDF slides)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Under the hood, Rowboat maintains an <strong>Obsidian-compatible vault</strong> of plain Markdown notes with backlinks — a transparent “working memory” you can inspect and edit.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Integrations</h2><a id="user-content-integrations" aria-label="Permalink: Integrations" href="#integrations"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Rowboat builds memory from the work you already do, including:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Gmail</strong> (email)</li>
<li><strong>Granola</strong> (meeting notes)</li>
<li><strong>Fireflies</strong> (meeting notes)</li>

<p dir="auto">Most AI tools reconstruct context on demand by searching transcripts or documents.</p>
<p dir="auto">Rowboat maintains <strong>long-lived knowledge</strong> instead:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>context accumulates over time</li>
<li>relationships are explicit and inspectable</li>
<li>notes are editable by you, not hidden inside a model</li>
<li>everything lives on your machine as plain Markdown</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The result is memory that compounds, rather than retrieval that starts cold every time.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Meeting prep</strong> from prior decisions, threads, and open questions</li>
<li><strong>Email drafting</strong> grounded in history and commitments</li>
<li><strong>Docs &amp; decks</strong> generated from your ongoing context (including PDF slides)</li>
<li><strong>Follow-ups</strong>: capture decisions, action items, and owners so nothing gets dropped</li>
<li><strong>On-your-machine help</strong>: create files, summarize into notes, and run workflows using local tools (with explicit, reviewable actions)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Background agents</h2><a id="user-content-background-agents" aria-label="Permalink: Background agents" href="#background-agents"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Rowboat can spin up <strong>background agents</strong> to do repeatable work automatically - so routine tasks happen without you having to ask every time.</p>
<p dir="auto">Examples:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Draft email replies in the background (grounded in your past context and commitments)</li>
<li>Generate a daily voice note each morning (agenda, priorities, upcoming meetings)</li>
<li>Create recurring project updates from the latest emails/notes</li>
<li>Keep your knowledge graph up to date as new information comes in</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">You control what runs, when it runs, and what gets written back into your local Markdown vault.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Bring your own model</h2><a id="user-content-bring-your-own-model" aria-label="Permalink: Bring your own model" href="#bring-your-own-model"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Rowboat works with the model setup you prefer:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Local models</strong> via Ollama or LM Studio</li>
<li><strong>Hosted models</strong> (bring your own API key/provider)</li>
<li>Swap models anytime — your data stays in your local Markdown vault</li>

That means you can plug in (for example) search, databases, CRMs, support tools, and automations - or your own internal tools.</p>
<p dir="auto">Examples: Exa (web search), Twitter/X, ElevenLabs (voice), Slack, Linear/Jira, GitHub, and more.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>How are we to think of the complex numbers? What I mean is, with what fundamental structure at bottom do we take the complex numbers to be endowed? In short, what is the essential structure of the complex numbers? They form the complex field, of course, with the corresponding algebraic structure, but do we think of the complex numbers necessarily also with their smooth topological structure? Is the real field necessarily distinguished as a fixed particular subfield of the complex numbers?

The additional structural features of the richer conceptions, after all, with the topology, the particular copy of ℝ as a distinguished subfield, or with the coordinate structure, are not determined uniquely by the algebraic field structure alone, and the coordinate structure is not determined uniquely by the topology. The automorphism groups of the conceptions are vastly different—the complex field admits crazy wild automorphisms, while the complex field over ℝ has only complex conjugation as a nontrivial automorphism, and the complex plane is rigid, having no nontrivial automorphisms at all. Which of these mathematical structural conceptions do we regard ultimately as the essential structure of the complex numbers? Indeed is there any one such essential structure?</p><p>It turns out that mathematicians do not agree—they do not all have the same conception of the complex numbers. Discussing the issue in various mathematical venues, I found a range of views, split roughly equally amongst the perspectives I discuss in this paper. I should like to discuss these various conceptions and then explain how they engage with several aspects of the philosophy of structuralism in the philosophy of mathematics.</p><p><strong>Different perspectives on the complex numbers</strong></p><p>To my way of thinking, there are at least four natural perspectives to take on the essential structure of the complex numbers, which I shall refer to under the following slogans.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Analytic</strong><span>: The complex field ℂ over ℝ</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Smooth</strong><span>: The topological complex field</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Rigid</strong><span>: The complex plane</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Algebraic</strong><span>: The complex field</span></p></li></ul><p>Two of these perspectives, it will turn out, arise from what amounts to the same underlying structural conception of the complex numbers (do you see which two?), and so those two perspectives are equivalent in this sense. Ultimately, therefore, we have here only three different perspectives in play. Let me elaborate on them.</p><div><p>Please enjoy this extended essay on the topic of the complex numbers. We shall see how  our different various conceptions of them ultimately engage with several issues concerning the philosophy of structuralism in the philosophy of mathematics.  </p><p>Toward the end of the essay we shall see how the complex numbers once made a key appearance in the midst of a contentious philosophical dispute, with many philosophers ultimately taking it decisively to refute what had seemed a promising position in the philosophy of mathematics.</p></div><p><strong>The analytic conception</strong></p><p><span>Many mathematicians like to consider the complex numbers ℂ as a field over ℝ, a view I refer to as the </span><em>analytic</em><span> conception, because it considers the structure of the complex field ℂ as it relates to and extends the real numbers ℝ, sitting with its analytic structure of the real line as a fixed distinguished subfield of ℂ. In particular, on the analytic view the complex field ℂ is conceived as the algebraic closure of ℝ—it is a degree-two extension of ℝ.</span></p><p><span>One common method to introduce the complex numbers as a field over ℝ is to introduce a symbol </span><em>i</em><span> for the imaginary unit and then present the complex numbers as formal sums </span><em>a</em><span> + </span><em>bi</em><span> with real numbers </span><em>a</em><span>, </span><em>b</em><span> ∈ ℝ. The sums obey the expected rules for addition and multiplication, subject to the rule </span><em>i</em><span>² = −1.</span></p><p><span>Since </span><em>i</em><span>² = −1, the complex field thus provides a system of numbers giving sense to expressions like √–1, while obeying the familiar algebraic rules of a field. One may easily observe in the complex numbers, however, that –</span><em>i</em><span> is also a square root of –1, because </span></p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\((–i)\cdot(–i)=(–1)^2\cdot i^2=i^2=-1.\)</span></p></div><p><span>Thus, both </span><em>i</em><span> and –</span><em>i</em><span> have the property of being square roots of –1, and indeed, these are the only square roots of –1 in the complex field.</span></p><p><span>A small conundrum may arise when one realizes that –</span><em>i</em><span> therefore also fulfills what might naively have been taken as the “defining” property of the imaginary unit </span><em>i</em><span>, namely, that it squares to –1. So this property doesn't actually define </span><em>i</em><span>, in light of the fact that there is another distinct object –</span><em>i</em><span> that also has this property. Can we tell </span><em>i</em><span> and –</span><em>i</em><span> apart?</span></p><p><span>Not in the complex field, no, we cannot. The basic fact is that </span><em>i</em><span> and –</span><em>i</em><span> are indiscernible as complex numbers with respect to the algebraic structure of ℂ—any property that </span><em>i</em><span> has in the complex field ℂ over ℝ will also hold of –</span><em>i</em><span>. One way to see this is to observe that complex conjugation, the map </span></p><p><span>is an automorphism of the complex number field over ℝ, an isomorphism of the field structure with itself that fixes every real number. Since this automorphism swaps </span><em>i</em><span> with –</span><em>i</em><span>, it follows that any statement true of </span><em>i</em><span> in the complex numbers, expressible in the language of fields with a predicate for the real subfield ℝ, will also hold of –</span><em>i</em><span>. In short, they are indiscernible in ℂ over ℝ.</span></p><p><span>Thus, the analytic conception admits complex conjugation as a fundamental symmetry of ℂ over ℝ. Even though we have introduced </span><em>i</em><span> as a formal symbol, we do not consider the choice between </span><em>i</em><span> and –</span><em>i</em><span> as part of the underlying structure. To make this precise in the language of first-order logic, we might therefore present the analytic perspective of ℂ over ℝ as embodied by the structure ⟨ℂ, +, ·, 0, 1, ℝ⟩, where the language signature includes the field structure, as well as a predicate ℝ that explicitly picks out the intended copy of ℝ in ℂ. We do not have </span><em>i</em><span> available as a constant symbol or singular term in this language.</span></p><p><span>It is not difficult to see that conjugation is the only nontrivial automorphism of ℂ over ℝ, since if a field automorphism of ℂ fixes every real number, then it will be completely determined by whether it sends </span><em>i</em><span> to itself or to –</span><em>i</em><span>, meaning either that it is the identity automorphism or complex conjugation, respectively.</span></p><p><span>Another common way to present the complex field ℂ as a field over ℝ is as the quotient field ℝ[</span><em>x</em><span>]/(</span><em>x</em><span>² + 1), where we first form the polynomial ring ℝ[</span><em>x</em><span>], consisting of formal polynomial expressions in the indeterminate symbol </span><em>x</em><span>, and then take the quotient by the ideal generated by the irreducible polynomial </span><em>x</em><span>² + 1, thereby in effect treating this polynomial as 0, which means </span><em>x</em><span>² = −1. It follows that every polynomial in the quotient can be represented as </span><em>a</em><span> + </span><em>bx</em><span>, where </span><em>a</em><span>, </span><em>b</em><span> ∈ ℝ. And so ultimately this quotient construction amounts to the same as the </span><em>a</em><span> + </span><em>bi</em><span> conception.</span></p><p>With either presentation of ℂ over ℝ, one proceeds to prove the fundamental theorem of algebra, asserting that the resulting field ℂ is algebraically closed. And we may easily provide a categorical characterization of ℂ over ℝ, which determines it uniquely up to isomorphism, building on the categorical characterization of the real field up to isomorphism as the unique complete ordered field. Namely, the complex field ℂ is simply the algebraic closure of the real field ℝ, a degree-two extension of the complete ordered field ℝ, and any two such extensions are isomorphic by an isomorphism furthermore respecting the real numbers and hence respecting the “over ℝ” aspect of the characterization. Indeed, an alternative characterization of ℂ over ℝ is that ℂ is a nontrivial algebraic extension of ℝ—such an extension must have degree two, since the degree two extension is already algebraically closed.</p><p>At bottom the analytic conception of ℂ is that of an algebraically closed field with a single nontrivial automorphic symmetry, complex conjugation, whose fixed points constitute the distinguished real subfield.</p><p><strong>The smooth conception</strong></p><p><span>Many mathematicians prefer to emphasize what I call the </span><em>smooth</em><span> conception of the complex numbers, viewing the complex field as carrying also its familiar topological structure. On this account, ℂ is a certain topological field, a field that is also a topological space, in which addition and multiplication are continuous operations. With the familiar intended topology of the complex plane, we see easily that ℝ is the closure of the set ℚ of rational numbers. Since the rational numbers are inherent to the algebraic structure, it follows that in the topological complex field we can recover the real subfield ℝ as a distinguished subfield, the closure of ℚ. In this sense, the smooth conception of the complex numbers subsumes the analytic conception.</span></p><p><span>But in fact, I claim, the smooth conception and the analytic conception are equivalent—they arise from the same underlying structure. We have already seen how the topology reveals the distinguished copy of ℝ in ℂ as the closure of ℚ. Conversely, if we have fixed a copy of the real subfield ℝ in ℂ for the analytic conception, then even though we cannot distinguish </span><em>i</em><span> from –</span><em>i</em><span>, we can nevertheless still define the complex norm |</span><em>z</em><span>| of any complex number </span><em>z</em><span>, which is √(</span><em>a</em><span>² + </span><em>b</em><span>²), if </span><em>z</em><span> = </span><em>a</em><span> ± </span><em>bi</em><span> and </span><em>a</em><span>, </span><em>b</em><span> ∈ ℝ. The norm simply does not require us to have chosen between </span><em>i</em><span> and –</span><em>i</em><span>. Using the norm, we can then define the distance between any two complex numbers, and so we can realize the topology by viewing ℂ as a metric space. In short, identifying the real subfield enables us to specify the unique intended topology and vice versa, and so the analytic conception and the smooth conception of the complex numbers amount to having the same underlying structure for the complex field.</span></p><p>When considering automorphisms of the complex numbers under the smooth conception, we should of course require that they also respect the topology. But since any continuous automorphism of ℂ must fix every real number, since it must fix the rational numbers, it follows that the only continuous automorphisms of ℂ are the identity automorphism and complex conjugation, which are indeed homeomorphisms of the topology.</p><p><strong>The rigid conception</strong></p><p><span>Another common conception of the complex numbers is what I call the </span><em>rigid</em><span> conception, which incorporates into the field structure also the full coordinate structure of the complex plane. One elementary approach to this conception of ℂ is simply to identify complex numbers with points (</span><em>a</em><span>, </span><em>b</em><span>) in the plane ℝ × ℝ and define the algebraic operations by reference to the coordinates, like this:</span></p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\((a,b)+(c,d)=(a+c,b+d)\qquad (a,b)\cdot(c,d)=(ac-bd,ad+bc).\)</span></p></div><p><span>Such definitions were presented by </span><a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Hamilton/" rel="">Hamilton to the Royal Irish Academy</a><span> in 1833, and are designed simply to implement the intended arithmetic of complex numbers, with </span></p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\((a+bi)+(c+di)=(a+c)+(b+d)i\)</span></p></div><p>and </p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\((a+bi)(c+di)=ac+adi+bci+bdi^2=(ac-bd)+(ad+bc)i.\)</span></p></div><p><span>With the structure of the complex plane, one can proceed furthermore to define the polar representation </span><em><span>re</span><sup>i</sup></em><sup>θ</sup><span>, with modulus </span><em>r</em><span> and argument θ, and one can translate back and forth definably between cartesian and polar coordinates.</span></p><p><span>In my experience, the complex plane construction is often successful for the pedagogical task of explaining how it could be that there is a field exhibiting the properties claimed of the complex numbers, how it could be, for example, that there is a number </span><em>z</em><span> with </span><em>z</em><span>² = −1. This amounts to the simple calculation with the number </span><em>z</em><span> = (0, 1), of course, following the rule we gave above, since </span></p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\((0,1)\cdot(0,1)=(0\cdot0-1\cdot 1,0\cdot 1+1\cdot 0)=(-1,0),\)</span></p></div><p>and the point (1, 0) is the multiplicative unit, so this is −1 as a complex number. For many mathematical beginners, it is the complex plane construction that de-mystifies the complex numbers.</p><p>The ordered-pair account of the complex field, if one regards the pair information as part of the underlying structure, amounts to viewing the complex field together with the real and imaginary part operators, defined by</p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\(\text{Re}(a+bi)=a\qquad \text{Im}(a+bi)=b.\)</span></p></div><p>So we are considering the complex numbers in effect as the structure ⟨ℂ,+,·,0,1,Re,Im⟩ with the two additional operators.</p><p><span>The coordinate structure carries more information than just the algebraic structure of the complex field, of course, for we can define the intended copy of ℝ in ℂ as those numbers whose imaginary part is zero. From the real field we can define the norm and hence also the topology, as we explained earlier. And we can naturally distinguish </span><em>i</em><span> from –</span><em>i</em><span> in the coordinate conception, since </span><em>i</em><span> has imaginary part 1, while –</span><em>i</em><span> has imaginary part −1. So in this conception we block the symmetry between </span><em>i</em><span> and –</span><em>i</em><span>. Indeed, in this conception the complex plane is rigid—it has no nontrivial automorphisms at all.</span></p><p><span>An equivalent presentation of the rigid conception of the complex plane arises from the </span><em>a</em><span> + </span><em>bi</em><span> presentation of ℂ over ℝ, but where we now fix the imaginary unit </span><em>i</em><span> as part of the structure ⟨ℂ, +, ·, 0, 1, </span><em>i</em><span>, ℝ⟩. In this language we can define the real and imaginary parts of any complex number. Indeed, to my way of thinking, the complex plane understanding of the </span><em>a</em><span> + </span><em>bi</em><span> presentation of ℂ is a more direct reading of that construction, since we take the imaginary constant </span><em>i</em><span> at face value as a distinguished constant, having made a particular choice of orientation, thus blocking the symmetry between </span><em>i</em><span> and –</span><em>i</em><span>.</span></p><p><strong>The algebraic conception</strong></p><p><span>Finally, many mathematicians find it natural to regard the complex numbers at bottom as a field, that is, endowed with its field operations as the (only) essential structure. This is a purely </span><em>algebraic</em><span> conception of the complex numbers, in which they are endowed with the algebraic operations of addition and multiplication to form the familiar complex field ⟨ℂ, +, ·, 0, 1⟩.</span></p><p>Indeed the complex field admits a categorical characterization in terms of this algebraic structure, a characterization determining it uniquely up to isomorphism. Namely, the complex field is, up to isomorphism, the unique algebraically closed field of characteristic zero and size continuum. Any two algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero (which just means that 1 + 1 + ⋯ + 1 is never 0) and size continuum are isomorphic. Equivalently, the complex field arises as the unique algebraically closed field of transcendence degree continuum over the rational field ℚ.</p><p><span>In fact, the first-order theory of algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero, a theory commonly denoted ACF₀ by the model theorists, is categorical in every uncountable power, which is the technical term expressing the fact that for every uncountable cardinality κ, there is up to isomorphism a unique such field of size κ. (An analogous result holds for ACFₚ in any prime characteristic </span><em>p</em><span>.) The reason is that the isomorphism type of an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero is determined by its transcendence degree over the prime subfield ℚ. The theory is not categorical for countable models, since we can form algebraically closed fields exhibiting any desired finite transcendence degree over ℚ, as well as the countably infinite transcendence degree, and these fields are nonisomorphic distinct countable models of the theory. But in the uncountable case, the transcendence degree will have to be the same as the size of the field itself, and thus we get the categoricity result. In this way, the complex numbers are characterized as the unique algebraically closed field of characteristic zero and size continuum.</span></p><p><strong>Summary of the conceptions</strong></p><p>So we have in the end three distinct conceptions of the complex numbers. First, the analytic account, for which we regard ℂ as a field extension of ℝ, specifically, the degree-two algebraic extension of ℝ, which is also the algebraic closure of ℝ, and which admits complex conjugation as the only nontrivial automorphism. That view, it turns out, is structurally equivalent to the smooth account, which endows the complex field ℂ with its familiar topology, since from the topology we can define the intended real subfield ℝ as the closure of the rationals, and conversely from ℝ we can define the topology. Next, we have the rigid account of the complex plane, which gives ℂ its coordinate structure of the real and imaginary parts, and which admits no nontrivial automorphisms. Finally, there is the algebraic conception of the complex field, with a rich, chaotic automorphism group that includes many wild automorphisms. The various conceptions are thereby distinguished from one another by their account of the extent to which the complex numbers exhibit a self-symmetric nature.</p><p><strong>Google AI and ChatGPT weigh in</strong></p><p>I was astounded to see that the Google AI overview in effect takes a stand amongst three conceptions of the complex numbers we have been discussing.

Nevertheless, mathematician </span><a href="https://x.com/RogierBrussee/status/1851165390270824623" rel="">Rogier Brussee</a><span> responds that, “Immoral sure, but, well, you know, the snake and the apple things; it can be a bloody convenient immorality at times.” Mathematician </span><a href="https://x.com/gro_tsen/status/1851164297436492000" rel="">David Madore</a><span> writes:</span></p><blockquote><p>People who study algebraic stacks and such questions are always careful to speak of “an” algebraic closure of a field (or even “a” field with 8 elements) because they are unique up to isomorphism but the isomorphism is non-unique. BUT even these people say “the” field of complex numbers, never “a” field of complex numbers, which suggests that they rigidify ℂ so as not to have any automorphism, so probably as per the complex plane conception in your poll.</p></blockquote><p>So mathematicians hold different conceptions of the complex numbers, and many of them even look upon the alternative conceptions as fundamentally wrong or misguided.</p><p><strong>Interpreting ℝ in the complex field ℂ</strong></p><p>We have seen that the real field ℝ is not definable in the complex field ℂ if one has only the algebraic field structure of ℂ, as with the algebraic conception. I should like to observe, further, that we cannot even interpret ℝ in the field ℂ. To interpret ℝ in ℂ is a much weaker way of finding a copy of ℝ in ℂ, after all, where we find it not necessarily as a subfield, but rather as a definable structure built using whatever algebraic resources are available in ℂ.</p><p><span>What does it mean exactly to interpret one mathematical structure in another? This is a technical term used in model theory and mathematical logic to refer to the situation when one can provide a definable copy of the first structure in the second, by specifying a definable domain of </span><em>k</em><span>-tuples (not necessarily just a domain of individuals) and definable interpretations of the atomic operations and relations, as well as a definable equivalence relation, a congruence with respect to the operations and relations, such that the first structure is isomorphic to the quotient of this definable structure by that equivalence relation. All these definitions should be expressible in the language of the host structure. One may proceed recursively to translate any assertion in the language of the interpreted structure into the language of the host structure, thereby enabling a complete discussion of the first structure purely in the language of the second.</span></p><p><span>For example, we can define a copy of the integer ring ⟨ℤ, +, ·⟩ inside the semi-ring of natural numbers ⟨ℕ, +, ·⟩ by considering every integer as the equivalence class of a pair of natural numbers (</span><em>n</em><span>, </span><em>m</em><span>) under the same-difference relation, by which</span></p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\((n,m)\equiv(u,v)\ \iff\ n-m=u-v\ \iff\ n+v=u+m.\)</span></p></div><p><span>Integer addition and multiplication can be defined on these pairs, well-defined with respect to same difference, and so we have interpreted the integers in the natural numbers. Similarly, the rational field ℚ can be interpreted in the integers as the quotient field, whose elements can be thought of as integer pairs (</span><em>p</em><span>, </span><em>q</em><span>) written more conveniently as fractions </span><em>p</em><span>/</span><em>q</em><span>, where </span><em>q</em><span> ≠ 0, considered under the same-ratio relation </span></p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\(\frac pq\equiv\frac rs\qquad\iff\qquad ps=rq.\)</span></p></div><p>The field structure is now easy to define on these pairs by the familiar fractional arithmetic, which is well-defined with respect to that equivalence. Thus, we have provided a definable copy of the rational numbers inside the integers, an interpretation of ℚ in ℤ.</p><p><span>We can also similarly interpret the complex field ℂ in the real field ℝ by considering the complex number </span><em>a</em><span> + </span><em>bi</em><span> as represented by the real number pair (</span><em>a</em><span>,</span><em>b</em><span>) as in the rigid conception of ℂ we discussed above. By keeping only the field structure on these pairs, we have an interpretation of the complex field in ℝ, but we can also interpret the structures corresponding to the analytic/smooth and rigid conceptions of ℂ as well.</span></p><p><span>Meanwhile, what I claim is that it is not possible conversely to interpret the real field ℝ inside the complex field ℂ with only its algebraic structure. The proof of this is grounded in the fact that the complex field admits only countably many different types of elements up to automorphism, even with respect to finitely many parameters </span><em>p</em><span>. Namely, either an element is algebraic over ℚ(</span><em>p</em><span>), in which case it is determined up to automorphism by its minimal polynomial, or it is transcendental over ℚ(</span><em>p</em><span>), and all transcendental elements are automorphic by an automorphism fixing the parameters. By applying this idea successively, it follows also that there are only countably many types of </span><em>k</em><span>-tuples of elements of ℂ. That is, if two </span><em>k</em><span>-tuples </span><em>a</em><span> and </span><em>b</em><span> from ℂ obey the same minimal-polynomial algebraic relations in ℂ over ℚ(</span><em>p</em><span>), then there is an automorphism of ℂ moving </span><em>a</em><span> to </span><em>b</em><span> and fixing </span><em>p</em><span>. In short, the complex field ℂ with only the algebraic structure makes distinctions amongst only countably many types of </span><em>k</em><span>-tuples with respect to expressible properties.</span></p><p><span>This is enough to see that we cannot interpret ℝ, since any copy of ℝ will exhibit its corresponding rational numbers that arise within it, and these numbers admit uncountably many cuts as realized by points in the interpreted copy of ℝ. But the problem is that these cuts thereby realize different, discernible types of elements in the interpreted copy of ℝ, which are therefore discernible in the host structure ℂ. In short, any interpreted copy of ℝ will require us to have distinguished uncountably many different kinds of </span><em>k</em><span>-tuples, but we have said this is impossible in the complex field. So there is no interpretation of ℝ in ℂ.</span></p><p><strong>Set-theoretic indiscernibility of </strong><em><strong>i</strong></em><strong> and –</strong><em><strong>i</strong></em></p><p><span>The analytic/smooth conception of the complex field ℂ over ℝ highlights the fundamental symmetry between the imaginary unit </span><em>i</em><span> and its negation –</span><em>i</em><span>. It is not possible to distinguish these two complex numbers by any property expressible in the complex field, even when we have fixed the canonical subfield of the real subfield ℝ in ℂ, because complex conjugation swaps these two elements, while preserving all the expressible properties of ℂ as a field extension of ℝ.</span></p><p><span>A few years ago (Hamkins 2022), I realized that it is relatively consistent with ZFC that we can definably construct a copy of the complex numbers ℂ over ℝ in such a way that </span><em>i</em><span> and –</span><em>i</em><span> are not only indiscernible in the field structure of this copy of ℂ, but also the particular set-theoretic objects </span><em>i</em><span> and –</span><em>i</em><span> that are used in this structure are indiscernible in the larger set-theoretic background in which the construction is undertaken.</span></p><p><strong>Goal. </strong><span>A definable copy of the complex field in which the two square roots of −1 are indiscernible not only in the field structure but also in the set-theoretic background in which the construction of the field takes place.</span></p><p>These two aims are in tension, for we want the particular copy of ℂ to be set-theoretically definable (defined with respect to the set-theoretic background as a particular set-theoretic object, not just defined up to isomorphism), but the individual square roots of −1 are to be set-theoretically indiscernible.</p><p><span>The goal is not always possible in ZFC. For example, some models of ZFC are pointwise definable, meaning that every individual set is definable in them by some distinguishing set-theoretic property—see further discussion in (Hamkins, Linetsky, Reitz 2013). More generally, if the </span><em>V</em><span> = HOD axiom holds, then there is a definable global well-order of the set-theoretic universe, and with any such order we could define a linear order on {</span><em>i</em><span>, –</span><em>i</em><span>} in any definable copy of ℂ, which would allow us to define each of the roots. For these reasons, in some models of ZFC, it is not possible to achieve the goal, and the most we can hope for is a consistency result.</span></p><p>But indeed, the goal is achievable, as I shall now explain.</p><p><strong>Theorem. </strong><span>If ZFC is consistent, then there is a model of ZFC that has a definable complete ordered field ℝ with a definable algebraic closure ℂ, such that the two square roots of −1 in ℂ are set-theoretically indiscernible, even with ordinal parameters.</span></p><p><strong>Proof. </strong><span>The proof makes use of what are known as Groszek-Laver pairs, definable pair sets having no ordinal-definable element. See (Groszek, Laver 1987) for a very general version of this. The result also appears as theorem 4.6 in my 2018 paper with Gunter Fuchs and Victoria Gitman. The arguments provide a model of set theory with a definable pair set </span><em>A</em><span> = {</span><em>i</em><span>, </span><em>j</em><span>}, such that neither element </span><em>i</em><span> nor </span><em>j</em><span> is definable from ordinal parameters. The pair set is definable, but neither element is definable.</span></p><p>To undertake the construction, we start with one of the standard definable constructions of the real field ℝ. For example, we could use Dedekind cuts in ℚ, where ℚ is constructed explicitly as the quotient field of the integer ring ℤ in some canonical definable manner, and where the integers are definably constructed from a definable copy of the natural numbers ℕ, such as the finite von Neumann ordinals. So we have a set-theoretically definable complete ordered field, the real field ℝ.</p><p><span>Given this and the set </span><em>A</em><span> = {</span><em>i</em><span>, </span><em>j</em><span>}, we follow a suggestion of Timothy Gowers in the discussion of this problem </span><a href="https://x.com/JDHamkins/status/1589018820777488384" rel="">on Twitter</a><span>. Namely, we use the elements of </span><em>A</em><span> as variables to form the polynomial ring ℝ[</span><em>A</em><span>], meaning ℝ[</span><em>i</em><span>, </span><em>j</em><span>], where </span><em>i</em><span> and </span><em>j</em><span> are the two elements of </span><em>A</em><span>. It is not necessary to distinguish the elements of </span><em>A</em><span> to form this ring of polynomials, since we take all finite polynomial expressions using real coefficients and elements of </span><em>A</em><span> raised to a power. (In particular, although I have referred to the elements as </span><em>i</em><span> and </span><em>j</em><span>, there is to be no suggestion that I am somehow saying </span><em>i</em><span> is the “real” </span><em>i</em><span>; I am not, for I could have called them </span><em>j</em><span>, </span><em>i</em><span> or </span><em>j</em><span>, </span><em>k</em><span> or </span><em>a</em><span>, </span><em>a</em><span>′, and so on.) Then we quotient by the ideal (</span><em>i</em><span>² + 1, </span><em>j</em><span>² + 1, </span><em>i</em><span> + </span><em>j</em><span>), which is defined symmetrically in the elements of </span><em>A</em><span>. Let ℂ be the quotient ℝ[</span><em>i</em><span>, </span><em>j</em><span>]/(</span><em>i</em><span>² + 1, </span><em>j</em><span>² + 1, </span><em>i</em><span> + </span><em>j</em><span>), which will make </span><em>i</em><span> and </span><em>j</em><span> the two square roots of −1, and so by the fundamental theorem of algebra this is a copy of the complex numbers.</span></p><p><span>Since ℝ and </span><em>A</em><span> were definable, and we didn’t need ever to choose a particular element of </span><em>A</em><span> in the construction to define the polynomial ring or the ideal, this copy of ℂ is definable without parameters. But since </span><em>i</em><span> and </span><em>j</em><span> are set-theoretically indiscernible in the model of set theory in which we are undertaking the construction, it follows that their equivalence classes in the quotient are also indiscernible. And so we have a definable copy of the complex field ℂ, extending a definable copy of ℝ, in which the two square roots of −1 are indiscernible not just in the field structure, but fully in the set-theoretic background in which the fields were constructed. □</span></p><p>In particular, in this model of set theory, there will be absolutely no way to distinguish the two roots by any further definable structure, whether using second-order or higher-order definitions of the field ℂ or using any definable set-theoretic property whatsoever. (However, we clearly can distinguish them if we allow parameters, since we can just choose one of them and use it to define the rigid complex plane.)</p><p>The analysis suggests a natural further inquiry. Namely,</p><p><strong>Question. </strong><span>Is there a model of set theory with a definable copy of the complex field ℂ, such that the hierarchy of relative definability and indiscernibility in ℂ matches the set-theoretic relative definability and indiscernibility of the objects?</span></p><p><span>That is, we would want to mimic the phenomenon of </span><em>i</em><span> and –</span><em>i</em><span> in the above construction with all complex numbers, so that √2 and −√2 were also indiscernible, not just in this copy of ℂ but also in the set-theoretic background, and the 4th roots of 2 would be set-theoretically indiscernible, but each can set-theoretically define both √2 and −√2. In other words, I would want the set-theoretic definability hierarchy to match the complex-number-theoretic definability hierarchy.</span></p><p><span>This question remains open, although I believe that perhaps it might be answerable via iterated Sacks forcing in a manner similar to that used in many papers by Marcia Groszek, and in particular, in my 2019 paper with her, </span><em>The Implicitly constructible universe</em><span>.</span></p><p><strong>The complex field as a problem for singular terms</strong></p><p>I should like briefly to relate the story of how the complex field ℂ came to play a decisive role in a certain philosophical dispute in the philosophy of mathematics—many philosophers took it ultimately to refute a certain otherwise tempting position regarding the philosophy of structuralism.</p><p>To be sure, one finds diverse and often incompatible accounts of structuralism in the philosophy of mathematics, for we have abstract structuralism, ante-rem structuralism, eliminative structuralism, in-re structuralism, post-rem structuralism, modal structuralism, structuralism in mathematical practice, the structuralist imperative, and more—see my overview in (Hamkins 2021, p.27-36).</p><p>I have emphasized what I see as two parallel threads of structuralism, developing largely independently in mathematics and philosophy. Namely, the philosophical treatment of structuralism is often seen as growing out of Benacerraf's influential work (1965, 1973), and it is concerned with core philosophical issues, such as the ontology of mathematics and the problem of reference to abstract mathematical objects. Meanwhile, structuralism in mathematics, as I see it, grows mainly out of the much-earlier categoricity results of Dedekind and others in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, leading to the idea currently pervasive in mathematical practice that a mathematician rightly considers mathematical objects only up to isomorphism—this is perhaps the single most widely held philosophical position in mathematics held by mathematicians. The philosophical treatment of structuralism, by my lights, has often been little connected with actual mathematics, and likewise mathematicians talking even at length about structuralism rarely mention Benacerraf or the other philosophical literature on structuralism. In my experience, the two threads of structuralism are thus often focused on fundamentally different matters. However, the situation is improving in recent years.</p><p>On the mathematical side of structuralism, I state the structuralist imperative as follows:</p><p><strong>The structuralist imperative. </strong><span>For mathematical insight, investigate mathematical structure, the relations among entities in a mathematical system, and consider mathematical concepts only as being invariant under isomorphism. Therefore, do not concern yourself with the substance of individual mathematical objects, for this is mathematically fruitless as structure arises with any kind of object.

And whether or not these objects are definable or discernible in their structures, it is precisely the objects appearing in the isomorphism orbit that play the same structural role in those structures that </span><em>a</em><span> plays in </span><em>A</em><span>.</span></p><p>Meanwhile, according to Shapiro (1996, 1997), the slogan of structuralism is that “mathematics is the science of structure.” This view leads ultimately to the position of ante-rem or abstract structuralism, the view that what mathematical objects are, at bottom, is the structural roles that those objects play in a mathematical system. Thus, what the real number 1 is, at bottom, is the structural role of being the multiplicative identity. What the number √2 is, is the structural role played by a number that is positive and whose square is 1 + 1, where 1 is the multiplicative identity. And so forth.</p><p><span>The position may be initially attractive. But I have criticized it on the grounds that it is ultimately anti-structuralist. Yes, I argue that abstract structuralism is anti-structuralist. The reason is that it is preoccupied with answering the question of what the mathematical objects really are at bottom. But the structuralist imperative implores us specifically against that—it is not a structuralist undertaking. According to the structuralist imperative, to try to find out what mathematical objects </span><em>really</em><span> are is an anti-structuralist endeavor, a fruitless quest, as well as mathematically irrelevant. It just doesn’t matter what the objects really are, as structure can arise with any kind of object, and so it is anti-structuralist to provide an answer, even if the answer that is provided is that the objects are at bottom purely structural. (Hamkins 2021, p. 35-36)</span></p><p><span>And now let us observe how the complex field made its entrance into the philosophical dispute (see Shapiro 2012). The main observation to make is that the structural role played by </span><em>i</em><span> in the complex field ℂ is identical to the structural role played by –</span><em>i</em><span> in ℂ, precisely because complex conjugation is an automorphism that swaps them. In short, the numbers are distinct, but the role played by them in the relevant structure ℂ is exactly the same. So we cannot coherently identify the mathematical objects with the structural role that they play in a mathematical system, because </span><em>i</em><span> and –</span><em>i</em><span> play exactly the same role in the complex field ℂ, and yet they are not the same object. Isn’t this a clear refutation of that philosophical position?</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, there was nothing special about </span><em>i</em><span> and –</span><em>i</em><span> in the argument, since if we are considering ℂ under the algebraic conception, then every single irrational complex number admits distinct automorphic images. The number √2 plays the same role in the complex field ℂ as does −√2, and </span><em>e</em><span> and π play the same role, and so forth. We have mentioned that indeed there are only countably many structural roles played by numbers in ℂ, since there are the roles played by specific algebraic numbers, while all transcendental numbers are automorphic with each other. But there are uncountably many complex numbers.</span></p><p><strong>The problem of nonrigid structuralist existence</strong></p><p>Let me conclude this essay by turning to another related philosophical problem concerning the complex field and the philosophy of structuralism.</p><p>In my view, in light of the categoricity results characterizing all our familiar mathematical structures, the structuralist practice is what enables a direct structuralist reference to abstract mathematical objects. Namely, in structuralist mathematics, when referring to the real field ℝ, we don’t point at a particular field, kept like the iron rod in a cabinet in Paris, to serve as the canonical instance of this structure. Rather, we simply say, “take any complete ordered field.” Since we only care about ℝ up to isomorphism and any such field is isomorphic to any other, any such field will serve in our argument. Our structuralist argument will not depend on the underlying substance out of which that field had been formed. In this way, the structuralist practice in mathematics relies on our having categorical characterizations for all our core mathematical structures in the first place, since the categorical characterizations are what enable the direct structuralist reference to them.</p><p>In regard to the complex numbers, since we have categorical characterizations of the complex field ℂ under each of the several conceptions—the analytic/smooth conception, the rigid conception, and the algebraic conception—we can thus make direct structuralist reference to the complex numbers under any of the three conceptions, whichever is desired.</p><p>But now a certain problem arises. Suppose we want to make structuralist reference to the complex field under the analytic conception, say, as the field ℂ over ℝ. The categorical characterization is that ℂ is the algebraic closure of ℝ, and so we make structuralist reference to it by saying, “take the algebraic closure ℂ of a complete ordered field ℝ.” That is fine.</p><p><span>But in order for this to work in mathematical proof, we must earlier have proved that indeed there is such a structure, that there is an algebraic closure of a complete ordered field. But now we come to the crux of the issue. Namely, all the constructions of ℂ over ℝ of which I am aware break the symmetry between </span><em>i</em><span> and –</span><em>i</em><span> during the course of the construction—the constructions themselves provide a way of choosing between </span><em>i</em><span> and –</span><em>i</em><span> at an early stage of the process, even if this extra structure is eventually omitted in the end.</span></p><p><span>Take the presentation of ℂ over ℝ using formal sums of the form </span><em>a</em><span> + </span><em>bi</em><span>, say, where </span><em>i</em><span> was introduced as a purely formal symbol. Obviously, this construction enables us to choose that this symbol represents </span><em>i</em><span> and not –</span><em>i</em><span>. We specifically had to forget this constant term in the final field in order to reintroduce the symmetry between </span><em>i</em><span> and –</span><em>i</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>Similarly, in the quotient construction ℝ[</span><em>x</em><span>]/(</span><em>x</em><span>² + 1), the polynomial construction itself obviously distinguishes </span><em>x</em><span> from –</span><em>x</em><span> and thus ultimately distinguishes </span><em>i</em><span> from –</span><em>i</em><span>. We cast that extra structure aside at the end by keeping only the field structure over ℝ and not the distinction between </span><em>x</em><span> and –</span><em>x</em><span>.</span></p><p>When we construct ℂ over ℝ from the complex plane, with the coordinate structure, it is just the same. We construct the rigid complex plane, but then keep only the real-part operator Re, while forgetting the imaginary part operator Im. Our field ℂ over ℝ arises from a process of forgetting from what was the rigid structure of the complex plane.</p><p>In every case, therefore, when proving that there is such a thing as the complex field ℂ over ℝ, what we actually do first is construct a rigid structure, in effect the complex plane, and then take a suitable reduct to forget some of the structure in order to admit the symmetry of complex conjugation.</p><p><span>Earlier I had quoted Daniel Litt, who described it as mathematically immoral to break the symmetry between </span><em>i</em><span> and –</span><em>i</em><span>. My problem with this is that I don’t know any construction of ℂ over ℝ that doesn’t break this symmetry during the course of the construction. In order to build such a field in the first place, we first build a rigid structure and then afterward drop the extra structure in order to recover the desired symmetry. Must we be immoral?</span></p><p><span>Indeed, I claim that this structure-forgetting step is inherent to the process, and I don’t believe we can provide (in ZFC set theory, say) a construction of the complex field ℂ over ℝ that does not during the course of the construction introduce a symmetry-breaking choice between </span><em>i</em><span> and –</span><em>i</em><span>. The final steps of the construction will invariably apply a forgetful operation to remove this extra structure and thereby reintroduce the desired symmetry.</span></p><p>I have argued  that this phenomenon is inherent in mathematic practice, by which nonrigid structure invariably arises always as a reduct substructure of a previously constructed rigid structure. It is simply too difficult ever to specify or refer directly to a nonrigid structure, in which objects of the conception are indiscernible, without first being able to discern them in a richer structural context.</p><blockquote><p><span>We don't start with a naked copy of ℂ and then seek to impose an orientation on it that will enable us to resolve </span><em>i</em><span> from -</span><em>i</em><span>. Rather, we proceed oppositely: instances of mathematical structures are obtained from richer contexts where the objects were already individuated. We might build a copy of ℂ from ordered pairs of real numbers, for example, where we can discern (0,1) from (0,-1) and therefore </span><em>i</em><span> from -</span><em>i</em><span> in this particular copy of ℂ. Every particular copy of ℂ and indeed every particular mathematical structure of any kind arises similarly from a context in which the objects are individuated. (Hamkins 2021, p. 46-47)</span></p></blockquote><p>And then I point out how this philosophical observation becomes a mathematical theorem in set-theoretic foundations. </p><blockquote><p>When using ZFC set theory as a foundation of mathematics, this philosophical observation becomes a mathematical theorem: every set is a reduct substructure of a rigid structure, a structure in which every individual plays a distinct structural role. The reason is that every set is a subset of a transitive set, and every transitive set is rigid with respect to the ∈-membership relation. Indeed, the set-theoretic universe ⟨V,∈⟩ as a whole is rigid—any two objects in the set-theoretic universe are therefore distinguishable as sets and play different set-theoretic roles… Therefore, every mathematical structure that can be realized in set theory at all can be realized as a reduct substructure of a rigid structure. We can refer to distinct individuals in the original structure by the distinct structural roles they play in the larger context.  (Hamkins 2021, p. 47)</p></blockquote><p><span>The earlier results on set-theoretic indiscernibility, however, can be seen as pushing back against the inherency argument above, by showing that it is at least consistent with ZFC that one can definably undertake a construction of ℂ over ℝ without having any set-theoretically definable method of discerning </span><em>i</em><span> from -</span><em>i</em><span>. Nevertheless, although the sets used in the Groszek-Laver pair set {</span><em>i</em><span>, </span><em>j</em><span>} in that construction are set-theoretically indiscernible, they do play different structural roles in the set-theoretic universe, which is rigid, and so in this sense we can still view the polynomial ring ℝ[</span><em>i</em><span>,</span><em>j</em><span>] used in the construction as rigid.</span></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>I began with the question, how shall we view the complex numbers? With which fundamental structure is it to be endowed? Ultimately, my answer to this question is that the complex field exhibits all three of the structural conceptions I have discussed, each considered on its own for a purpose, and although these structures are different and inequivalent, it is wrong to insist on only one conception.</p><p>In particular, the rigid conception plays an important seminal role for the other conceptions of the complex field. Even though the rigid conception is rejected as misguided by many mathematicians, sometimes strongly so, nevertheless all the usual constructions of the structures instantiating the other conceptions have at their heart a rigid presentation of the complex plane, with the symmetries reintroduced only afterward by forgetting the extra structure used in the construction.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.infinitelymore.xyz/p/complex-numbers-essential-structure?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.infinitelymore.xyz/p/complex-numbers-essential-structure?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p><span>Paul Benacerraf. “What Numbers Could not Be”.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.ablg.io/blog/competition-is-not-validation">https://www.ablg.io/blog/competition-is-not-validation</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46961726">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>February 4, 2026</p><article><p><em>It’s 1 AM and you’ve been in pivot hell for weeks. Suddenly, you see it: a market where everyone is raising money and the competitor list is a mile long. You breathe a sigh of relief. Look at all that competition, you think, the market is clearly validated. You tick the PMF checkbox and start coding...</em></p>
<p>As a startup, building in a large total addressable market (TAM) often implies having a lot of competitors. It follows that, if you don't have much competition, there is a high chance you are building in too small a market, unless you are the first-mover in a soon-to-explode market.</p>
<p>However, what <em>does not</em> logically follow is that a high level of competition implies a large market. Yet, many founders (including myself, once upon a time) and investors may fall for the fallacy that competition makes finding PMF easier. Founders in the process of pivoting are at the highest risk of believing this fallacy. At best, competition is a pre-requisite for a large market, not a proof of one; in many cases, it's a signal founders should probably disregard.</p>
<p>In the rest of the article, I'll walk through a few patterns I've seen (meaning, high competition but a small or undesirable market). I have found that it's easier to reason about this problem if you consider that the startup, not its product, is the good being produced. It makes these patterns a lot easier to spot as a founder.</p>
<h2 id="why-every-startup-vertical-is-crowded-the-supply-side"><a href="#why-every-startup-vertical-is-crowded-the-supply-side"></a>Why every startup vertical is crowded: the supply-side</h2>
<p>Hint: it's not because every startup vertical has tremendous demand from customers.</p>
<p>Startups operate in at least 3 markets:</p>
<ul>
<li>their actual market, where they transact with their users for cool features</li>
<li>their investment market, where they trade equity for cash</li>
<li>their founder market, which represents the supply and demand of founders excited about and able to build in the actual market</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="oversupply-of-money"><a href="#oversupply-of-money"></a>Oversupply of money</h3>
<p>If investors have relatively too much money to deploy (for example, because interest rates are historically low, like during the past decade), they need to deploy it regardless of demand in the actual market. You could suddenly see 20 companies doing new-age task management, because one company raised a round 6 months ago and since then, investors have been thinking new-age task management is the next big thing.</p>
<p><em>As an aside, it does not mean investors are investing in everything, and it may still be very hard to raise a seed round in that environment. Even if there is an oversupply of money on average, the distribution of that money remains skewed towards the "currently hot" startups.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The lower the prevailing interest rates, the hotter the space, the higher the <em>mechanical</em> competition level.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="oversupply-of-founders-and-ideas"><a href="#oversupply-of-founders-and-ideas"></a>Oversupply of founders and ideas</h3>
<p>If it is relatively easy to come up with an idea and to build it fast, there will be more companies in that space. A famous example is event discovery or event management startups: almost anyone can relate to and therefore think of this idea in their personal lives, and the app is largely a CRUD wrapper. It does not mean that there is a gigantic market for event discovery (as far as I know).</p>
<p>Similarly, there may be times and areas where more people decide to found companies. A common scenario is highly-paid executives getting laid off during periods of economic contraction: they have more incentives to start a company, because the opportunity cost (their high salary) has tanked.</p>
<h3 id="oversupply-of-infrastructure"><a href="#oversupply-of-infrastructure"></a>Oversupply of infrastructure</h3>
<p>More recently, low-code tools, vibecoding, and cheap cloud infra mean that an MVP can be built in a weekend, so the barrier of entry for almost any idea is much lower than it used to be.</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Markets with <em>not enough constraints</em> (too many founders, easy to have ideas, too much money, infrastructure that is too cheap, etc.) will have higher levels of competition purely because the supply-side is so unbalanced with respect to the demand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly, demand-side conditions can lead to a lot of startups in a market, without making this market large.</p>
<h3 id="startups-that-should-be-consulting-firms"><a href="#startups-that-should-be-consulting-firms"></a>Startups that should be consulting firms</h3>
<p>There is a specific type of market where users have real pain-points that <em>almost</em> look the same from 10,000 feet but have material differences when you zoom in. One example that comes to mind is high-level project / resource planning software for verticals like healthcare, auto parts, etc. Each company has idiosyncratic ways of planning, which means the main ways to win are hyper-specialized software (which I would call consulting) or bloated, customizable bricks of software (also implemented by consulting firms). It is particularly painful to build in such a market unknowingly, because at first it can look scalable: you found a real problem, real users who pay you, etc. The lack of standardization and network effects, i.e. the lack of scaling potential, only shows up later in the story. You may still be able to build a huge company, but it will look very different (more labor-intensive, lower margins) from a typical software startup.</p>

<p>A market might have 100 competitors because it’s actually 100 tiny, disconnected markets better served by consulting-type software</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are markets that are so mature that they reach a state of perfect competition: all the companies make a good-enough product that users buy, but nobody really makes money anymore. If there are 500 email marketing tools, it’s often because customers don't care which one they use as long as it’s cheap. These markets are usually easy to spot, because the <em>dominant design</em> in terms of product has been around for many years, PE firms have started to buy and consolidate incumbents, etc. The main trap here is to think that your idea is very differentiated and to enter these markets anyway.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways-for-founders"><a href="#takeaways-for-founders"></a>Takeaways for founders</h2>
<p>Hopefully this little supply/demand framework can help avoid the most obvious <em>high-competition / bad market</em> situations. To be clear: I am not suggesting you should only build in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ocean_Strategy">"Blue Oceans"</a> where no one else exists. A total lack of competition can indeed be a signal that a market is too small or the timing is decades off. Instead, view competition as just one signal among others, and keep focusing on users and their pain-points.</p>
<p>I'll conclude with a few litmus tests you can use if you are preparing to pivot into a seemingly crowded market:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Ease of Entry Test: could a motivated pair of engineers replicate my core value prop in a month?</li>
<li>The Hot Space Test: are startups in that space being funded based on a recent narrative, or because of a real user pain-point?</li>
<li>The Consulting / Lack of Scale Test: would my potential users actually be better served by a consulting company?</li>
<li>The "Budget Elasticity" Test: does this solve a problem that is currently budgeted, or am I tapping into a new pain that will force them to find new money? The former implies a zero-sum battle for an existing slice of the pie.</li>
<li>The Me-Too Test: am I building this because it feels safer to follow ten other founders, or because I have a unique insight into why those ten people will fail?</li>
