<p>I wouldn't mind this <strong>huge</strong> ad so much if the pancake mix was made with lentil flour...on second thought, that doesn't sound good:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/walmart-1.png" alt="walmart search result showing ads instead of results">

<p>And if I complain about not being able to sort by price/quality (or weight), I assume some people will point out that choice adds complexity. But it's hard to understand what value this choice is adding:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/walmart-2.png" alt="facet with a single option">

<p>Since we're talking about facets, I'm curious what category those other 632 products fall under:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/walmart-3.png" alt="category facets showing 16 total products despite having 648 results">

<p>At costco, a search for "rice" yields this amazing facet:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/costco-1.png" alt="Each facet contains all the products">

<p>Surprise, the search returned 25 results (seriously).</p>

<p>I'm particularly intrigued by rice that isn't vegan, lactose free, or gluten free:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/costco-2.png" alt="Rice facet showing only 1 vegan option">

<p>The sorting made me check wiki to see how much revenue they have ($242 billion):</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/costco-3.png" alt="Case-sensitive sorting of brands">

<p>There must be a term in information theory that describes what's going on here:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/redmart-1.png" alt="Search for 'alcohol' returns non-alcohol results">

<p>You can't tell, but the 2nd result <em>is also</em> alcohol free (the first 10 results are). For any Singaporean thinking that Alibaba ruined Lazada who ruined Redmart: no.</p>

<p>I don't think anyone would be offended if I said e-commerce in the Philippines has a lot of catching up to do. But this first page search result is something else (yes, they sell a lot of other laundry detergent):</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/landers-1.png" alt="Search for 'laundry detergent' returns umbrellas">

<p>The inspiration for this post is that nintendo.com lets you filter for <code>2+</code> players, but that includes single system, local wireless and online. So there's no way to get a list of games that supports couch coop. Unless you want to check 1680 games that is:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/nintendo-1.png" alt="1680 2+ player games">

<p>Haha, J/K. The search won't return more than 1000 records.</p>

<p>And while we're talking about nintendo.com, if you goto Games &gt; Nintendo Switch Games:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/nintendo-2.png" alt="nintendo.com homepage top nav">

<p>You'll get 120 games and only 120 games. Of course the list of switch games isn't under Games &gt; Nintendo Switch Games that would be silly. But, for days I've tried and failed to figure out what these 120 games have in common and why they get this special treatment. I can't sleep.</p>

<p>A pretty major milestone has been achieved: Britain has become the first major country to halve its carbon emissions. The rapid pace of UK environmental progress means that our output is now below 319 million tonnes&nbsp;– half the 652 million tonnes at our 1970 peak. This is in spite of Britain now having a far larger population and economy than 50 years ago.</p>

<header>
  <p><time>25 December, 2023</time>
    
  </p>
</header>



<p>The Thanksgiving long weekend (23-26 November) in 2023 was an interesting one for OpenZFS, that I managed to land myself in the middle of. The short version of events is that an apparent silent data corruption bug was discovered, which is kind of the worst case scenario for a data storage system.</p>
<p>It was a pretty intense few days for me, initially one of a few people looking into the bug, and then later being involved in working out a fix, talking to downstream vendors, responding to private and public messages with users, my own customers and the press, and doing damage control. It was mostly done with by the end of the weekend, though took a couple of weeks to mop up, and overall I’d rate it a qualified success for the project.</p>
<p>I’ve been writing this post on and off since then. A lot happened, and I have a lot of thoughts, and I wanted to get them all down, but it got too much. So this post just covers the bug itself, and I’m hoping to write more about the fuzzier stuff soon. If you’re reading this months later and I still haven’t, maybe <a href="https://despairlabs.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8fe7eae3e3e0cfebeafcffeee6fde3eeedfca1ece0e2">ping me</a> and remind me that I promised!</p>
<h2 id="free-filesystem-lesson">Free filesystem lesson</h2>
<p>To understand what happened, you need to know a little bit about OpenZFS internals. If you have been paying attention to <a href="https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/15526">the whole kerfuffle</a>, then you might recognise some of the moving parts as we go along!</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-file-really">What is a file, really?</h3>
<p>If you lift the lid on a OpenZFS filesystem (or volume!) you’ll find that OpenZFS is an object store. The top-level object is called an “object set” (or just “objset”), and can be thought of as just a giant array of objects. In turn, each object has two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>the “dnode”, which is a kind of metadata header that describes the object’s type, size, etc, and carries a pointer to its first data block</li>
<li>the object data, which is a tree of blocks, either an “indirect” block that just points to more blocks, or a “data” block, which is, well, data.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the purposes of this discussion, we can consider a simplified view of the world, with the objset at the top, a list of dnodes, each with a count of attached data blocks, and then a list of data blocks.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/dnodes.png" alt="">
    


<p>There isn’t more to it in concept. Higher-level filesystem concepts are just built out of more objects, for example, a directory is just a special kind of object (internally called a “ZAP”) that is just a dictionary of name → object index.</p>
<h3 id="not-all-data-is-data">Not all data is data</h3>
<p>If a data block contains all zeroes, we can use a little optimisation. Instead of allocating real space on the disk just to store a whole bunch of zeroes, we can instead keep a note to say “this block is all zeroes”. We don’t have to store anything then, because we can recreate it on request. This note is called a “hole”, and is what gives a “sparse file” its “sparseness”.</p>
<p>So here are our files again, with some holes:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/holes.png" alt="">
    


<p>In every way, these look like they did before: the dnode still reports how many blocks they have. All that changes is that if something tries to read from one of the hole blocks, OpenZFS will create a data buffer as normal, but instead of actually going to disk and getting the data to put in the buffer, it will just zero the buffer. Less space required, fewer IO operations to spend. Lovely!</p>
<h3 id="the-fastest-disks-are-memory">The fastest disks are memory</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, disks are slow, even very fast ones. Memory, however, is very fast. So, when you make a change to a file, say, write some new data to the end of it, OpenZFS makes that change in memory only, and later writes it (and any other changes) down to disk. This is fast, because it only touches memory, and can make the later disk part even faster, eg your program may have written over part of a file, then written over the same part again, so when it comes to to write the change to disk, it only has to write the final state, not both changes.</p>
<p>Of course, keeping changes in memory means we need extra housekeeping information to know that we have changes to write out when the time comes. We call the changed things “dirty”, and to track this, we keep some lists.</p>
<p>The objset has a list of dirty dnodes, and each dnode has a list of dirty blocks. So after our write, we have some nice linked lists of dirty things, ready to be written out.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/dirty.png" alt="">
    


<p>There is one crucially important detail, of course: until that data is written to disk, the version in memory is the latest, and what the application believes exists (applications don’t really know a whole lot about this disk stuff). So anything inside OpenZFS that wants to consider the current state of an object has to look at the dirty information as well, to know if its looking at the latest or not.</p>
<h3 id="data-first">Data first</h3>
<p>When it comes time to write everything out, first the blocks are written:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/data-written.png" alt="">
    


<p>And then the dnodes go out, and everything is on disk.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/dnode-written.png" alt="">
    


<p>I’ve of course left out a million tiny details, not least of which is the whole copy-on-write thing. This is a useful conceptual model though; in this part of the code you can largely take for granted that the layers below you will take care of all that.</p>
<h2 id="beware-of-holes">Beware of holes</h2>
<p>The crux of this bug is around hole detection.</p>
<p>Sometimes an application wants to know where the holes in a file are. A file copying program is a good example: its whole job is to read all the data from one file, and write it to another. If it can find out that there’s a hole, then it saves itself the trouble of reading that block, and it also tell the filesystem to make a hole in the copy too. Even less space and fewer IO operations to think about. Extra lovely!</p>
<p>For a program to find out about holes, it can call <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/lseek.2.html"><code>lseek()</code></a> with the <code>SEEK_HOLE</code> or <code>SEEK_DATA</code> options, which say “tell me the position of the next hole” or “next data”.</p>
<p>Holes are actually stored on disk in OpenZFS as a zero-length block pointer. There’s also a clever optimisation, which is that if a program writes a full list of zeroes, the compression system will notice and “compress” it down to a hole. However, block pointers and compression belong to the IO layer, which is quite a way away from the object layer (the DMU).</p>
<p>As a result, there’s no way currently to discover if a dirty block will eventually be stored as a hole. For this reason, <code>lseek()</code> checks if the dnode is dirty, and if so, it waits for it to be written out before it goes looking for holes.</p>
<h3 id="hidden-dirt">Hidden dirt</h3>
<p>So now we come to the actual bug: the dirty check. Recall how we track dirty things:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/dirty.png" alt="">
    


<p>Before <a href="https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/pull/15571">we fixed it</a>, the dirty check for <code>lseek()</code> used to be “is this dnode on the dirty list?”. Note that this is a subtly different question from what we actually want to know, which is “is this dnode dirty?”.</p>
<p>And there’s the bug. There is a moment in the dnode write process where the dnode is taken off the “dirty” list, and put on the “synced” list. This happens before the data blocks are written out, so there is a moment where the dnode looks like this:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/dirty-gap.png" alt="">
    


<p>This gap is <em>tiny</em>. Hard to estimate, but we’re talking tens of CPU instructions. But if <code>lseek()</code> comes along in that moment, the dirty check fails, so it goes into the “search for data/holes” stage. And because that only sees fully allocated and written blocks, it actually sees something more like this:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/not-clean.png" alt="">
    


<p>And so, if a program asks about holes, it may well end up wrongly finding them in the last couple of blocks of the file.</p>
<h3 id="the-idea-of-data">The idea of data</h3>
<p>Of course, the data is there, and if the program had only read it, it would have found this, but OpenZFS gave it reason to believe that it wasn’t there, so it didn’t bother.</p>
<p>This whole madness started because <a href="https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/15526#issuecomment-1823575126">someone posted an attempt at a test case</a> for a different issue, and then that <a href="https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/15526#issuecomment-1823633960">test case started failing</a> on versions of OpenZFS that didn’t even have the feature in question. The key part of that test was that it used the <code>/bin/cp</code> program from <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html">GNU Coreutils</a>, which is almost ubiquitous on Linux systems. In v9.2 it started using <code>lseek()</code> to discover holes in source files.</p>
<p>When a new file is created, it starts life as:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/new-file.png" alt="">
    


<p>That is, just the metadata, no data.</p>
<p>When we add some data, it becomes:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/new-dirty.png" alt="">
    


<p>If we manage to catch it just right though, it looks like:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/new-hole.png" alt="">
    


<p><code>cp</code>’s opening move is <code>lseek(…, 0, SEEK_DATA)</code>, which is to say, “find the first data item from position 0”. When it works, it returns <code>0</code>, because that’s where the data is. If it fails, it sets error <code>ENXIO</code>, that is: no data here. So <code>cp</code> doesn’t read, and it writes zeroes (or a hole!) to the output.</p>
<p>Incidentally, that’s why this isn’t “corruption” in the traditional sense (and why a scrub doesn’t find it): no data was lost. <code>cp</code> didn’t read data that was there, and it wrote some zeroes which OpenZFS safely stored.</p>
<h2 id="the-long-way-home">The long way home</h2>
<p>In the course of exploring the problem, we found that setting the config parameter <code>zfs_dmu_offset_next_sync=0</code> defanged the reproducer. This quickly became the recommended workaround. It also brought some confusion of its own, as it appeared to improve performance, leading some to wonder if they should just leave it off permanently. It also turns out that it doesn’t actually stop the bug from occurring, just makes it vastly more difficult to hit. All this has been extremely difficult to explain, which naturally means I should expect success if I have one more go at it.</p>
<h3 id="transaction-pipeline">Transaction pipeline</h3>
<p>To understand this part we need to know a little about the transaction pipeline.</p>
<p>At any point in time, OpenZFS has three transactions in flight.</p>
<ul>
<li>The OPEN transaction, which receives new changes as they arrive.</li>
<li>The QUIESCING transaction, where the changes are combined and prepared to be written to disk.</li>
<li>The SYNCING transaction, which is being written out to disk right now.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the SYNCING transaction is written, everything is moved along. QUIESCING becomes the new SYNCING, OPEN moves to QUIESCING, and a new OPEN transaction is created. There’s more details of course, but this is the basic idea.</p>
<p>Changes are only added to the OPEN transaction. Once it moves to the next state, it can’t be modified again. So a busy object can end up with changes on multiple transactions. And this means that when we ask “is this object dirty?”, what we’re actually asking is “is this object dirty on transaction N?” or “is this object dirty on any transaction?”</p>
<h3 id="diary-of-a-change">Diary of a change</h3>
<p>Here’s a visual representation of how changes flow through the transaction pipeline. This is conceptual, of course - “clean” objects are not on any transaction, but then again, “transactions” are not a real thing either.</p>
<p>So lets imagine a nice normal clean object, on the current transaction.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/txg0.png" alt="">
    


<p>We append a block to it, which makes it dirty in memory in memory on the current transaction.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/txg1.png" alt="">
    


<p>On the next transaction, we append another block to it. Yellow here shows the changes that aren’t on disk yet but are considered “unchanged” on this transaction.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/txg2.png" alt="">
    


<p>This time we don’t make any modifications, so this object is “clean” on the OPEN transaction. The first change we made is now on the SYNCING transaction, and starts getting written out.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/txg3.png" alt="">
    


<p>The transactions move along again and the second change starts getting written out.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/txg4.png" alt="">
    


<p>All changes are are now written.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/txg5.png" alt="">
    


<h3 id="everywhere-is-dirty">Everywhere is dirty</h3>
<p>Earlier I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The objset has a list of dirty dnodes, and each dnode has a list of dirty blocks. So after our write, we have some nice linked lists of dirty things, ready to be written out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But with multiple transactions in flight, we actually need a dirty dnode list and a dirty block list for each transaction, which means things actually look more like this:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/dnode-lists.png" alt="">
    


<p>This of course means the dirty check is more complex too. I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a result, there’s no way currently to discover if a dirty block will eventually be stored as a hole. For this reason, <code>lseek()</code> checks if the dnode is dirty, and if so, it waits for it to be written out before it goes looking for holes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The user’s view of the object (via system calls like <code>lseek()</code> is whatever is on the OPEN transaction. Because looking for holes means looking at the on-disk state, that means we have to wait until <em>all</em> pending changes are on disk. So our dirty check here has to be “is this object dirty on any transaction?”, which means checking if the dnode is on <em>any</em> dirty list.</p>
<h3 id="wait-for-service">Wait for service</h3>
<p>Recall that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>lseek()</code> checks if the dnode is dirty, and if so, it waits for it to be written out before it goes looking for holes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if the object is dirty only on a single transaction, that wait can be long if the pool is very busy. So OpenZFS has a config option, <code>dmu_offset_next_sync</code> which controls what the <code>dmu_offset_next()</code> function (one of the work functions implementing <code>lseek()</code>) does when the dnode is dirty.</p>
<p>If set to <code>0</code>, and the object is dirty, then instead of waiting, the function simply returns an error, which causes <code>lseek()</code>  to return “data here”. This is allowed; its always safe to say there’s data where there’s a hole, because reading a hole area will always find “zeroes”, which is valid data. It can mean a loss of efficiency, because the application can’t do special things for holes, but at least the data is always intact. And because its a simple dirty check, its fast.</p>
<p>If its set to <code>1</code> (the default), it will wait instead. Specifically, it will do a dirty check, and if its dirty, it will wait until the currently-syncing transaction is written out. Then it will do another dirty check; if the object is still dirty, it will return an error (and so <code>lseek()</code> returns “data here”), and if clean, it will go into hole detection as normal.</p>
<p>So now we understand the apparent performance gain with <code>dmu_offset_next_sync=0</code> (it just never waits). But why does that also appear to mitigate the bug?</p>
<h3 id="doubly-dirty">Doubly dirty</h3>
<p>Recall that the bug occurs in the moment where the dnode is taken off the dirty list, but not yet put on the syncing list, and in that moment its not a list, so its erroneously considered to be clean.</p>
<p>Since there’s actually multiple lists, but this gap only occurs on the SYNCING list, it gives some idea of where the window you have to hit is. Its not a change “just made”, but actually made two transactions ago (from the perspective of the user). On a quiet system that can be whole seconds ago. On a busy object, with changes on multiple in-flight transactions, a single dirty check (ie <code>dmu_offset_next_sync=0</code>) is always going to result in “dirty”, and so <code>lseek()</code> returning “data here”, because even if there’s a gap on the SYNCING list, the dnode will also be on the OPEN or QUIESCING dirty lists, and so still be dirty. So the only time we can hit a gap is for the “some time later” case. Not out of the question, but incredibly difficult for any non-contrived workload (or even contrived - to my knowledge its <a href="https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/15526#issuecomment-1826104073">only been seen on a quite large and unusual ARM64 system</a>, and even then its hard to hit).</p>
<p>In the “wait for sync” mode (<code>dmu_offset_next_sync=1</code>), we have two dirty checks, and either of them can go wrong. For the first check to fail its the same as above, the “some time later” case. Its the second that is more interesting, with a wait in between.</p>
<p>To get the wrong answer, the dnode must only be on the SYNCING list, so that when its removed, its not on any other lists. The two dirty checks are one transaction apart, so for the second to <em>incorrectly</em> return “clean”, the dnode must be dirty on two consecutive transactions. That’s not hard to arrange of course, but that alone isn’t really going to make much difference.</p>
<p>The difference is just the timing. The first (or only) dirty check can happen any time; whenever <code>lseek()</code> is called. The second however is always called just the after the transaction has synced and the next one is beginning sync. The object in question is dirty there, and is removed from the dirty list and added to the syncing list before it starts syncing, which means there’s a better-than-usual chance that its happening just as <code>dmu_offset_next()</code> loops and does the dirty check. Overall, it raises the chances of hitting the gap and getting the wrong answer.</p>
<h2 id="a-clone-in-time">A clone in time</h2>
<p>The original bug appeared to point to block cloning as being the cause of the problem, and it was treated as such until the problem was reproduced on an earlier version of OpenZFS without block cloning. This didn’t end up being the case, and it initially being blamed is perhaps a symptom of a deeper problem, but that’s for another post.</p>
<p>However some people did report that disabling block cloning entirely appeared to helped. So far we haven’t really found any reason why it would make a difference, other than at a distance by changing the timing - its faster to apply a clone than a write, because there’s no actual data to copy or write, so that allows more dirty dnodes and/or more transactions to be processed in a shorter amount of time. This alone means nothing, as the gap is still the same amount of time, but with other variables like hardware and workload, it could change it in the right way.</p>
<p>Another reason cloning was implicated was that the bug had been seen on FreeBSD. Its <code>/bin/cp</code> is not the Coreutils one, and doesn’t look for holes, but does call <code>copy_file_range()</code>, which hands off copying to the kernel to do the copy however it would like. This function has become known as “the cloning function” because the kernel might choose to service the copy via clones. However on FreeBSD it will also use <code>lseek()</code> under the hood to try to replicate holes in the file, and so can run into the same problem. <code>copy_file_range()</code> on Linux doesn’t do this, and that’s most peoples experience of cloning, leading to confusion.</p>
<p>That’s not to say there isn’t problems with block cloning at all - there’s a few known, which is why its currently disabled by default in OpenZFS releases. The upcoming 2.2.3 release will fix some significant issues with block cloning, and a comprehensive test suite is coming together. How block cloning became the whole thing it is, and the interaction with this and other issues in the public perception, is something I want to write more about, but this has gone on long enough.</p>
<h2 id="history-of-a-bug">History of a bug</h2>
<p>This bug has a long history, as can be seen by reading multiple earlier patches that made changes around it. All had seen <em>something</em> wrong, but hadn’t fully understood it.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>The proto-bug seems to go back even further, to <a href="https://github.com/illumos/illumos-gate/commit/c543ec060d#diff-9a7602b987a5c727d34def47076cc6fce32bdd5bdb114eb3c05c413595cc6116L1641">a 2006 commit</a> in early Sun ZFS. Among other changes, we see:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="diff"><span><span>diff --git usr/src/uts/common/fs/zfs/dmu.c usr/src/uts/common/fs/zfs/dmu.c

That alone is not a bug; it might be that there’s something else preventing the off-list gap being hit (eg another lock), so maybe the bug was never in this version of ZFS. What has changed is that its no longer possible to understand the dirty state directly; its now reliant on what’s happening elsewhere in the system.</p>
<p>I’m not really blaming anyone - complex problems sometimes require complex solutions! Its just one of those things that the details of are long forgotten, so its on the reader to make sure they understand it, without much external guidance. There’s more to say about this, but not here.</p>
<h2 id="turn-tape-over">Turn tape over</h2>
<p>In the end its not a data corruption bug <em>as such</em>, but possibly that’s splitting hairs. As you see though, it has existed a long long time, and is fiendishly difficult to hit in almost all real-world scenarios, and even harder to hit <em>undetected</em>. It does reinforce the standard mantras about storage though: take backups, test your backups.</p>
<p>I’ll never exactly be happy about a data-loss bug, but what I am happy about is the way that a whole group of people appeared over a holiday weekend and worked together to solve an ancient mystery. I loved being a part of it, and I’m now looking for ways to get that happening in more proactive and less desperate situations.</p>
<p>That’s all for now. Hopefully more soon about all the other thoughts I had while working on this!</p>

  <task-lists disabled="" sortable="">
    <div>
      <p dir="auto">'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the code<br>
Not a core dev was merging, not even Guido;<br>
The CI was spun on the PRs with care<br>
In hopes that green check-markings soon would be there;<br>
The buildbots were nestled all snug under desks,<br>
Even PPC64 AIX;<br>
Doc-writers, triage team, the Council of Steering,<br>
Had just stashed every change and stopped engineering,</p>
<p dir="auto">When in the "PRs" tab arose such a clatter,<br>
They opened GitHub to see what was the matter.<br>
Away to CPython they flew like a flash,<br>
Towards sounds of <code>PROT_EXEC</code> and <code>__builtin___clear_cache</code>.<br>
First <a href="https://github.com/brandtbucher/cpython/blob/justin/Tools/jit/README.md">LLVM was downloaded, unzipped</a><br>
Then the Actions were running <a href="https://github.com/brandtbucher/cpython/blob/justin/Tools/jit/build.py">a strange new build script</a>,<br>
When something appeared, they were stopped in their tracks,<br>
<a href="https://gist.github.com/brandtbucher/d6397b1d106c55164b32df27d53eb7b8"><code>jit_stencils.h</code></a>, generated from <a href="https://github.com/brandtbucher/cpython/blob/justin/Tools/jit/template.c">hacks</a>,<br>
With their spines all a-shiver, they muttered "Oh, shit...",<br>
They knew in a moment it must be a JIT.</p>
<p dir="auto">More rapid than interpretation it came<br>
And it copied-and-patched every stencil by name:<br>
"Now, <code>_LOAD_FAST</code>! Now, <code>_STORE_FAST</code>! <code>_BINARY_OP_ADD_INT</code>!<br>
On, <code>_GUARD_DORV_VALUES_INST_ATTR_FROM_DICT</code>!<br>
To the top of the loop! And down into the call!<br>
Now cache away! Cache away! Cache away all!"<br>
But why now? And how so? They needed a hint,<br>
Thankfully, Brandt gave a great talk at the sprint;<br>
So over to <a href="https://youtu.be/HxSHIpEQRjs" rel="nofollow">YouTube</a> the reviewers flew,<br>
They read <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3485513" rel="nofollow">the white paper</a>, and <a href="https://sillycross.github.io/2023/05/12/2023-05-12" rel="nofollow">the blog post</a> too.</p>
<p dir="auto">And then, after watching, they saw its appeal<br>
Not writing the code themselves seemed so unreal.<br>
And the platform support was almost too easy,<br>
ARM64 Macs to 32-bit PCs.<br>
There was <a href="https://github.com/brandtbucher/cpython/blob/justin/Python/jit.c">some runtime C</a>, not too much, just enough,<br>
Basically a loader, relocating stuff;<br>
It ran every test, one by one passed them all,<br>
With not one runtime dependency to install.<br>
Mostly build-time Python! With strict static typing!<br>
For maintenance ease, and also nerd-sniping!</p>
<p dir="auto">Though dispatch was faster, the JIT wasn't wise,<br>
And the traces it used still should be optimized;<br>
The code it was JIT'ing still needed some thinning,<br>
With code models small, and some register pinning;<br>
Or <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-exposing-ghccc-calling-convention-as-preserve-none-to-clang/74233" rel="nofollow">new calling conventions</a>, shared stubs for paths slow,<br>
Since this JIT was brand new, there was fruit hanging low.<br>
It was awkwardly large, parsed straight out of the ELFs,<br>
And they laughed when they saw it, in spite of themselves;</p>
<p dir="auto">A <code>configure</code> flag, and no merging this year,<br>
Soon gave them to know they had nothing to fear;<br>
It wasn't much faster, at least it could work,<br>
They knew that'd come later; no one was a jerk,<br>
But they were still smart, and determined, and skilled,<br>
They opened a shell, and configured the build;<br>
<code>--enable-experimental-jit</code>, then made it,<br>
And away the JIT flew as their "+1"s okay'ed it.<br>
But they heard it exclaim, as it traced out of sight,<br>
"Happy JIT-mas to all, and to all a good night!"</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
  

  
  <p>written on Monday, December 25, 2023
  

  </p><p>You likely know that I've contributed <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/projects">significantly to the Open Source community</a>, that I work <a href="https://sentry.io/welcome/">for an Open Source Company</a>, that we got <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36971490">shit for calling ourselves
Open Source</a> and that we
subsequently created <a href="https://fsl.software/">a new license</a> to address
at least some of these concerns.  I also shared <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2023/11/19/cathedral-and-bazaaar-licensing/">my personal thoughts</a> on that license recently
which unfortunately promptly <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38331173">attracted a bunch more negative comments</a> for that.  That
introduction might make me sound a tad bitter, so let's talk about
something else.</p>
<p>This Christmas I <a href="https://twitter.com/mitsuhiko/status/1738930820998369593">received a 3D printer</a> and I love
it for two reasons.  Firstly, it was an unexpected gift from my wonderful
wife, who chose it.  She organized me a brand new <a href="https://bambulab.com/en/a1">Bambu Lab A1</a> 3D printer.  It has been a few years since
I toyed around with 3D printing and it was mostly in the context of other
people assembling printers.  That's because even though I love toying
around with software, I cannot say the same for hardware.  This printer,
however, is remarkably easy to set up and use, significantly boosting my
enjoyment in this hobby.  For this purchase she had to balance my love for
Open Source with user friendly technology and I think given the good
experience, she chose well.</p>
<p>The printer comes with a brief guide for the initial setup.  In about 15
minutes of removing some screws and mounting some components we were off
to the races.  The cloud account appears optional but after scanning a QR
code I could operate it from my phone too.  It's quick, it's super plug and
play and it just feels like an incredibly well put together product.</p>
<p>Since I've had to leave the printer at home over the holidays, I've been
engaging in related activities like reading up, creating models, and
exploring the slicer software.  Emotions surrounding this printer are
<em>charged</em>.  If you step into the wrong parts of the internet you find a
lot of hate.  Some of it might be warranted, but others just feels
incredibly out of proportion.  I've noticed a fair amount of controversy
surrounding the printer online, largely centered on its Chinese origins,
its optional cloud service, and its impact on the Open Source 3D printing
community.  I won't talk much about the China part <a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a> here, but I do
want to talk about the cloud and license aspect.</p>
<p>The reason I even write about this printer is the licensing situation and
a bit of a rant about Open Source communities.  Here is what I believe is
currently happening, and I'm saying this as a person that knew next to
nothing until a few days ago about 3D printing: Bambu Labs is making some
other players in that space reconsider Open Source.</p>
<p>Bambu entered the industry in a very different way than anyone else
before.  They offer a user friendly experience at a very attractive price
point (lower than some of the competition).  They also added built-in
cloud service stuff and with a really good quality.  But it's a space
dominated by Open Source hardware and software.  And they don't really do
that.  Bambu seems to add new people into the 3D printing community who
don't don't care (or not as much) about Open Source.  Yet Bambu heavily
relied on Open Source software to put them on the map.</p>
<p>If you open their Bambu Studio, you can see that it's built on top of
<a href="https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer">PrusaSlicer</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer">SuperSlicer</a>, both of
which are Open Source.  As both of those are licensed under AGPL (which is
a very viral license), <a href="https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio">so is Bambu Studio</a>.  But none of the firmware or
hardware designs of the Bambu printer are.  In fact, Bambu apparently is
also loading itself up with patents over in China, so they probably don't
care about Open Source much at all.  If I were Prusa (which in many ways
was the user friendly, dominant player before) I wouldn't be very happy.</p>
<p>So let's discuss Prusa: The Bambu A1 competes with Prusa's MK4 model
but is signficantly cheaper, faster and does more.  For the price of one
Prusa MK4 with shipping I could buy three Bambu A1 printers or two Bambu
A2 printers plus the AMS addon which adds multi-color printing.  There is
absolutely no reason to buy a Prusa MK4 today unless you want to support
Open Source or a European company (Prusa is from Czechia).</p>
<p>I was able tell that Prusa is reconsidering their Open Source approach and
that with a few days as a member of this community because people are
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/prusa3d/comments/10g6fgv/prusa_giving_up_on_its_open_source_roots/">complaining</a>
(The MK4 firmware is not Open Source).  Prusa is not hiding that they are
reconsidering their ways thanks to a blog post by their founder about how
they are <a href="https://blog.prusa3d.com/the-state-of-open-source-in-3d-printing-in-2023_76659/">reconsidering their Open Source ways</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] things we’ve been doing at Prusa Research for over ten years were
only possible thanks to the great <strong>3D printing community</strong> and
<strong>open-source philosophy</strong>. However, the new printers and software
releases have made me think again about the current state of open
source in the 3D printing world. How sustainable it is, how our
competitors deal with it, what it brings to the community, and what
troubles us as developers.  Consider this article as a <strong>call for
discussion</strong> – as a kick-off that will (hopefully) open up a new
perspective on the connection between open-source licensing, consumer
hardware, and software development.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>The open-source movement relies on the fact that <strong>everyone involved
plays by the same rules</strong>.</p>
<p>—Josef Průša in <a href="https://blog.prusa3d.com/the-state-of-open-source-in-3d-printing-in-2023_76659/">The state of open-source in 3D printing in 2023</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I strongly recommend reading that entire post, because it captures quite
well the challenging situation that Open Source companies are in.  My take
on this is very much the same as for our own situation at Sentry: building
a true Open Source company is hard.  Under the OSI definition of Open
Source you are put at a massive disadvantage as you are prevented from
putting protections in place that shield you from other competitors in
that place that chose not to play by the same rules but can leverage your
source.</p>
<p>Historically the GPL has provided some protections here, but in all
reality in the modern world it doesn't.  That's because distribution is
really no longer the defining element.  Yes, Bambu Studio has to be AGPL
licensed because so is what it's built on, but in many ways that's just the
enabler for a proprietary system that they have in place.  They have
reaped years of benefits from this, benefiting from the work of others.
Some paid, but also from many who contributed for free.</p>
<p>Here is what I think would be a negative outcome: if this situation forces
companies like Prusa to abandon their Open Source practices.</p>
<p>However, I believe this situation reaffirms my belief that licenses like
our <a href="https://fsl.software/">FSL</a> (TL;DR: it includes a two-year
commercial non-compete period, after which it transitions to either MIT or
Apache 2, depending on the choice) are a viable alternative, even though
they are not considered Open Source by today's definition.  Because one
thing is absolutely clear to me: Bambu carries inherent risk for me as a
user.  They manufacture the parts and provide the firmware.</p>
<p>If they go out of business, owning their device becomes much riskier than
owning printers from the Open Source community.  For an end-user, having an
Open Source license is a far stronger proposition.  That's why I find the
comparison of the FSL to a “source available” or even “proprietary”
license somewhat insulting. A hypothetical FSL-inspired license for Open
Source hardware would grant a hardware company a limited-time non-compete
advantage over other players in the space, while giving users and the
community the assurance that they hold the keys after two years.</p>
<p>The world around us is changing, and so must we as the Open Source
community.  Software distribution is no longer the main focus, with much
emphasis now on services.  The situation also changes for successful Open
Source hardware communities.  Their innovations are slowly reaching more
users, many of whom do not value Open Source as much. In some ways, the
protections in Open Source that worked in a commercial context are no
longer effective.</p>
<p>What Bambu has done — and which I believe will be appreciated in the long
term — is to make their products more accessible to a broader audience.  They
introduced 3D printing to people who were previously unwilling to invest
the time.  This means there's more potential for profit for everyone
involved, but it also means that it will be harder for Open Source to
compete, especially if Open Source entities don't get a grip of their user
experience and business models.  As a user, I wish I could have the Bambu
experience with an Open Source-like model, where the risk is managed over
the long term, while allowing the companies that create these products to
pay their employees and continue innovating.</p>

cause a lot more problems to me.  If I were to never be able to go to
China again, very little in my life would change.</td></tr>

<p><b>Check out the second sequel too: <a href="https://austinhenley.com/blog/challengingalgorithms.html">Challenging algorithms and data structures every programmer should try</a>.</b></p>

<p>I talk to a lot of students and professional developers that often want to start a side project, but aren't sure what to build. Below is a handful of software projects that taught me a lot. In fact, they're great because you could build them multiple times and learn new things each time. So whenever I don't know what to build or I want to learn a new programming language or framework, I start with one of these:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Text editor</li>
    <li>2D game - Space Invaders</li>
    <li>Compiler - Tiny BASIC</li>
    <li>Mini operating system</li>
    <li>Spreadsheet <small>(<i>hard!</i>)</small></li>
    <li>Video game console emulator <small>(<i>hard!</i>)</small></li>
</ul>


<br><h3>Text Editor</h3>

<p>We use text editors everyday, but do you know how it really works? Ignoring all of the fancy features that your favorite editor has, how would you implement a textbox that supports a movable text cursor and selecting, inserting, and deleting text? No, you can't use the builtin textbox component from your favorite GUI framework!</p>

<p>The biggest challenge is figuring out how to store the text document in memory. My first thought was to use an array, but that has horrible performance if the user inserts text anywhere other than the end of the document. Luckily, there are some nice data structures to learn to solve this.</p>

<p>Another hurdle was learning how a text cursor behaves in popular editors. For example, if I press the up arrow key with the cursor in the middle of the document, where will the cursor move? Same column? Not if that line is shorter. Keep pressing up. The cursor will snap back to the original column once a line is long enough. It turns out that the cursor has a memory for the column and tries to get back to it. It is these details that I never noticed until I tried to implement it.</p>

<img src="https://austinhenley.com/blog/images/textcursor.gif">

<p>After implementing the basic editor, I challenge you to implement two more features: undo/redo and word wrapping. Implementing undo/redo in an efficient way was mind blowing to me! I first tried keeping an array of previous states, then tried the Memento pattern, before finally settling on the Command pattern. Word wrapping forces you to separate the <i>visual</i> aspects of a text line from the memory aspects.</p>


<p>Things to learn:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Data structures for storing the text: array, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(data_structure)">rope</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_buffer">gap buffer</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piece_table">piece table</a>.</li>
    <li>Behavior and implementation of the text cursor.</li>
    <li>Design patterns for undo/redo: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_pattern">memento</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern">command</a>.</li>
    <li>Abstractions to separate the visual and memory aspects of the text.</li>
</ul>

</ul>


<br><h3>2D game - Space Invaders</h3>

<p>Even the most simple games require some unique data structures and design patterns. The idea here is to implement a well-defined game from start to finish without getting bogged down on the other fun stuff (e.g., game design and art). Also, it is best if you use a barebones 2D graphics library (e.g., SDL, SFML, PyGame), not a big game engine that'll hide all of the interesting bits from you.</p>

<img src="https://austinhenley.com/blog/images/spaceinvaders.png">

<p>First, you'll have to learn to draw to the screen. I had no idea how this worked. You are actually clearing the screen then drawing each portion of the screen in rapid succession, many times a second, to create the effect that objects are moving.</p>

<p>Second, you'll learn all about the game loop. A game is effectively looping between drawing, getting user input, and processing the game logic.</p>

<p>Third, you'll learn how to process user input. I never paid attention to the subtlties of initially pressing, holding, and releasing keys or mouse buttons, let alone handling things like a double click. And how often do you check for user input? If you are constantly checking then that means the rest of the game is frozen!</p>

<p>Fourth, you'll learn how to create and manage all of your game objects and their state. For example, how do you generate a dynamic number of enemies? The factory pattern helps a lot.</p>

<p>Fifth, you'll learn how to apply the game's logic. When do bullet positions get updated? When do more enemies come onscreen? How do you know when an enemy is destroyed? When is the game over? I had never used the modulo operator prior to making games but it is littered all over my games' code.</p> 

<p>Once you get the basic game working, add a title screen menu, a game over screen, make sure the game runs at the same speed even on different computers, and explore how to implement more interesting enemies with AI. Still not enough? Add shader effects, sound, and online multiplayer!</p>


<p>Things to learn:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Drawing to the screen.</li>
    <li>Handling user input.</li>
    <li>Game loop.</li>
    <li>Creating and managing a dynamic number of objects (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_(object-oriented_programming)">factory pattern</a>).</li>
    <li>State machines for enemy AI.</li>
    <li>Playing sound.</li>
    <li>Using shaders.</li>
    <li>Networking for online features.</li>
</ul>

<br><h3>Compiler - Tiny BASIC</h3>

<p>The most-eye opening projects I have worked on are compilers. Even now, if I have a free Sunday afternoon to do some coding, chances are it is a compiler. It is a great feeling when you create something that enables others to create more things. By implementing one I had to learn so much more about the intricacies of compilers that I normally would never think about (e.g., when do expressions get implicitly type converted).</p>

<p>I suggest writing the compiler from scratch for a very small BASIC-like language (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_BASIC">Tiny BASIC</a>) and compile to any other language that you know well. For example, you could write a Tiny BASIC compiler in Python that outputs C# code. It does <b>not</b> have to output assembly or C! Avoiding those will let you focus on the compiler itself.</p>

<img src="https://austinhenley.com/blog/images/peaybasic.png">

<p>The first hurdle is figuring out how to lex (or tokenize) the input code. Then you will parse the code, that is check the structure of the input and produce a tree representation of the code. The recursive descent parsing technique is beautiful! Next you will semantically check the input, ensuring the code makes sense and that the type rules are being followed. Finally, you can generate output!</p>

<p>This project has a ton of existing resources to help you, and a simple compiler can be completed in a few days. Don't let the jargon scare you. Plus the possibilities are endless to what you can add! Once you have the basic compiler working, you can add a standard library (in PeayBASIC I added simple 2D graphics functionality), optimization passes, and improve the error messages. Finally, you should write some example programs in your own language to show off to the world!</p>

<br><h3>Mini Operating System</h3>

<p>Over the years I have found myself applying fundamental concepts from operating systems to a variety of domains, like games and even predictive models of human behavior. In a classroom setting the algorithms and data structures used by operating systems might seem abstract or useless, but they really are useful. Implementing an operating system also helped me understand far more about what is going on under the hood.</p>

<p>There is a bit of a learning curve and some barriers to get started since it is dependent on hardware. However, by following a book or tutorial then you should be able to get a bootable OS working that can run your own programs. I highly recommend my colleague's free online book, <a href="http://osblog.stephenmarz.com/index.html">Making a RISC-V Operating System using Rust</a>.</p>

<p>Things to learn:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_compiler">Cross compiling</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booting#Modern_boot_loaders">Bootloading</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS_interrupt_call">BIOS interrupts</a></li>
    <li>x86 modes</li>
    <li>Memory management and paging</li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing)">Scheduling</a> (e.g., round robin)</li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system">File systems</a> (e.g., FAT)</li>

</ul>

<h3>Spreadsheet</h3>

<p>A spreadsheet application, like Excel, combines some of the challenges from a text editor with those of a compiler. You'll have to learn how to represent the cell contents in memory and implement an interpreter for the programming language used for equations.</p>

<br><h3>Video game console emulator</h3>

<p>Writing an emulator (or virtual machine) for a video game console combines the challenges of writing a compiler, an operating system, and a compiler all into one. It is quite rewarding to play a real game made by someone else with your emulator!</p> 

<p>Emulating a real video game console means writing a virtual machine that pretends to function just like the actual CPU and other hardware components. This allows you to run games designed for the video game console with your emulator.</p>

<p>I recommend starting by emulating CHIP-8, which is a simple, fictitious console, before moving on to a real video game console. The NES, SNES, Gameboy, and Gameboy Advance are all quite feasible to emulate, with a far amount of documentation and open source emulators already, though they each have their own quirks to make things interesting (e.g., certain games may rely on undocumented bugs/features of the specific hardware). There is also the PICO-8, which has become a very profitable "fantasy" console.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article> <div id="markdown-content"> <p>In a <a href="https://devos50.github.io/blog/2022/ipod-touch-qemu/">previous blog post</a>, I described how I managed to get an iPod Touch 1G up and running using the QEMU emulator. While I’m very happy that the emulator runs smoothly overall, its functionality is limited to some stock apps, not all of which are fully functional. Moreover, I received a few questions on whether it would be possible to run third-party apps. Unfortunately, the iPod Touch 1G (and iPhoneOS 1.0) do not come with the App Store or an SDK; thus, the amount of third-party apps that can run on this particular device and OS is limited.</p> <p>Therefore, I decided to shift focus to emulating an iPod Touch 2G, arguably one of the most popular and iconic iPod Touch devices. This device was also my first Apple product, and it motivated me to pursue iOS development. I targeted iOS 2.1.1, the lowest version of iOS that this device can run. This time, I started by emulating the bootrom and working towards userland emulation and executing SpringBoard, hoping to re-use most of the emulated hardware devices from the iPod Touch 1G. In this blog post, I will describe some challenges I encountered, architectural differences between the iPod Touch 2G and the iPod Touch 1G, and my further plans for emulation. All source code and instructions on how to run the emulator can be found <a href="https://github.com/devos50/qemu-ios" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in this GitHub repository</a>.</p> <p>For reverse engineering and understanding the components, I gratefully used <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/munnerz/379924/raw/056b17f912d76f40d90b0bb8044dd6478d9c885d/iPod%2520Touch%25202G%2520IOReg%2520dump" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this device tree dump</a>, which has been tremendously helpful.</p> <h2 id="ipod-touch-2g-schematic">iPod Touch 2G Schematic</h2> <p>For reference, I created the schematic below to show some of the hardware components this device uses and grouped related elements. However, this schematic still needs to be completed since there are some components I still need to start looking at, such as components related to video encoding/decoding. However, I have some QEMU logic for all components in this diagram, and I believe it highlights how complicated these kinds of embedded devices are from an architectural perspective.</p> <p><a href="https://devos50.github.io/assets/img/ipod_touch_2g_schematic.jpeg"><img src="https://devos50.github.io/assets/img/ipod_touch_2g_schematic.jpeg" width="100%"></a></p> <h2 id="the-first-steps-with-securerom-and-llb">The First Steps with SecureROM and LLB</h2> <p>I started by emulating the 240.4 SecureROM bootrom, which I downloaded from <a href="https://securerom.fun/" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>. Similar to the iPod Touch 1G, the iPod Touch 2G uses the ARMv6 instruction set, so fortunately, I didn’t have to make significant changes to the emulated CPU in QEMU. The bootrom puts the device in DFU mode when a particular button combination is pressed or loads the low-level bootloader (LLB) stored on the NOR memory. Here, things started to be different from the iPod Touch 1G.</p> <p>The first difference is that the iPod Touch 2G has NOR memory accessed through the SPI controller. In comparison, the iPod Touch 1G used CFI flash, the functionality of which was already provided by QEMU. Therefore, I had to reverse engineer the communication protocol with the NOR, which was relatively easy as this protocol is rather straightforward. Its implementation can be found <a href="https://github.com/devos50/qemu-ios/blob/ipod_touch_2g/hw/arm/ipod_touch_nor_spi.c" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> <p>The second, more challenging difference is that the iPod Touch 2G uses the more secure IMG3 file format (instead of IMG2) to store binaries on the NOR/NAND. Luckily, IMG3 has been <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/IMG3_File_Format" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">well-documented</a>, but it involves quite a bit of cryptographic operations, including RSA signatures and hashes to guarantee authenticity and integrity. Since I aim to get an emulator as close to the hardware as possible, I wanted to avoid patching the binaries to turn off signature verification. Therefore, I had to get the PKE engine up and running, which is responsible for modulo arithmetic when verifying RSA signatures. I computed the resulting numbers using OpenSSL’s <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/bn_mod_exp" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BIGNUM functionality</a>. Even though my implementation is <a href="https://github.com/devos50/qemu-ios/blob/ipod_touch_2g/hw/arm/ipod_touch_pke.c#L85" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a bit hacky</a>, it seems to pass the signature verification of all IMG3 images that are loaded.</p> <p>Some IMG3 images also rely on <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/UID_key" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the UID key</a>, a key unique to each Apple device and fused into the application processor during manufacturing. Since I don’t have access to this key, I generated one myself and used that one <a href="https://github.com/devos50/qemu-ios-generate-nor/blob/ipod_touch_2g/generate_nor.c#L34" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">when storing IMG3 files on the NOR/NAND</a>. I then define the same key in the AES engine.</p> <p>I re-used many iPod Touch 1G emulator hardware components, including the timers, clocks, and vector interrupt controllers. It was straightforward to get past LLB as its main responsibility was initializing hardware components and loading iBoot, the main bootloader.</p> <h2 id="iboot-and-the-nand">iBoot and the NAND</h2> <p>For several months, I have been stuck in various functions of iBoot. The first challenge came from the LCD, which uses a different underlying communication protocol (MIPI-DSIM) than the iPod Touch 1G. The second challenge, which was much more difficult, was to get the NAND working where iBoot loads the kernel image from. The NAND in the iPod Touch 2G has two main differences from the iPod Touch 1G. First, the NAND driver uses a different communication protocol, referred to as FMSS in the kernel. Second, there were some significant differences in the VFL/FTL specifications, so I had to spend quite some time understanding the mapping function that translates a logical block number to a physical one.</p> <p>In the iPod Touch 1G and iPhoneOS 1.0, I could easily pass boot args to the kernel. However, Apple has turned off this functionality in production mode for the iPod Touch 2G. Therefore, I had to manually write this string to the appropriate location in kernel memory. There are probably better solutions than this, but some boot flags were necessary to set to get debug output printed to the terminal.</p> <div><pre><code>const char *boot_args = "kextlog=0xfff debug=0x8 cpus=1 rd=disk0s1 serial=1 pmu-debug=0x1 io=0xffff8fff debug-usb=0xffffffff";
cpu_physical_memory_write(0x0ff2a584, boot_args, strlen(boot_args));
</code></pre></div> <p>I also spent quite some effort getting past the kernel image’s signature verification. For some reason, my decryption algorithm does not correctly decrypt the final block when the length of the data is not a multiple of the key size, causing the CRC computation to fail. I am still unsure what I am doing wrong here, but to work around this, I patched the expected CRC code with the code I get during decryption. This workaround correctly validates the kernel image but should still be revised.</p> <h2 id="booting-the-kernel-and-springboard">Booting the Kernel and SpringBoard</h2> <p>The kernel boots most of the hardware components defined in the device tree. I did not have too many difficulties getting past the initialization of the remaining hardware components. IOKit, Apple’s framework for implementing drivers, is very well-structured, and its debug output makes it easy to identify when and where a driver gets stuck.</p> <p>When the kernel has booted, it launches <code>launchd</code>, which executes different system daemons, including SpringBoard. The configuration of most of these daemons is located in <code>/System/Library/LaunchDaemons.</code> The iPod Touch 2G has many different daemons, including ones related to media, DNS, FairPlay, and iTunes. To simplify things, I only enabled the necessary daemons to get SpringBoard operational and disabled all others for the time being.</p> <p>I was very happy that the multitouch driver worked out of the box since I spent quite some time getting it functional for the iPod Touch 1G. With that, I now have a basic iPod Touch 2G emulator!</p> <p><a href="https://devos50.github.io/assets/img/ipod_touch_2g_home.png"><img src="https://devos50.github.io/assets/img/ipod_touch_2g_home.png" width="400"></a></p> <h2 id="working-towards-wifi">Working towards WiFi</h2> <p>After SpringBoard became operational, I wanted to know how difficult it would be to get the WiFi controller functional. The iPod Touch 2G uses a Broadcom BCM4325, and one can communicate with that device through the SDIO controller. This driver is included in the kernel as a kernel module. I noticed that the kernel would not automatically load the BCM4325 kernel module, and to date, I’m still trying to figure out where and how exactly this module is loaded. To work around this issue, I <a href="https://github.com/devos50/qemu-ios/blob/ipod_touch_2g/hw/arm/ipod_touch_mbx.c#L33" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">patched the kernel</a> and added some instructions to load this kernel module manually. Again, it’s not ideal, but at least these drivers are loaded now.</p> <p>The SDIO standard is well-documented, and it took little time to get that part up and running. The BCM4325 hardware is more complicated, and the iOS kernel uploads a Linux kernel image to the device as part of the boot procedure. The hardware also has many registers, and their content is unclear. However, with some hacking, I could get past the initialization procedure, as seen in the screenshot below. The initialization procedure sometimes hangs, probably because of race conditions or other timing issues. However, full WiFi emulation is far from functional as basic primitives such as SSID scanning or connecting to a network are still not implemented.</p> <p><a href="https://devos50.github.io/assets/img/bcm4325.jpeg"><img src="https://devos50.github.io/assets/img/bcm4325.jpeg" width="100%"></a></p> <h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2> <p>I enjoyed working on this next step in emulating legacy Apple devices and improving my understanding of the hardware components in the iPod Touch 2G. I believe the iPod Touch 2G is more stable and easier to work with than the iPod Touch 1G and has quite some potential since it can natively run third-party applications. Below, I list some follow-up steps that would improve the usability of the emulator.</p> <ul> <li>Running <code>bash</code> would make debugging processes, executing applications, and collecting statistics from the device much easier. I have yet to look into this.</li> <li>I would also like to make installing third-party apps on the emulator much easier, which now requires a full rebuild of the NAND memory.</li> <li>Some compilation issues need to be resolved for the emulator to run on other platforms, including Windows and Linux.</li> <li>NAND persistence still needs to be fixed, e.g., writes to the NAND are not stored across sessions.</li> </ul> <p>I’m also happy to announce that I will give a talk about this project at FOSDEM’24 in Brussels, also see <a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2826-breathing-life-into-legacy-an-open-source-emulator-of-legacy-apple-devices/" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.

<h2 id="the-shutdown">The Shutdown</h2>
<p>In October of 2023, Nintendo <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/63227/~/announcement-of-discontinuation-of-online-services-for-nintendo-3ds-and-wii-u">announced the shutdown of Nintendo Network</a> for April of 2024. It was stated that a specific date and time would be announced later, and as of this post that has not happened yet. There have been no public announcements of any services shutting down early, though Nintendo stated they reserve they right to do so if:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"an event occurs that would make it difficult to continue online services for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U software"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, it appears that Nintendo has begun a slow rollout of shutdowns. Intentional or not.</p>
<h2 id="super-mario-maker">Super Mario Maker</h2>
<p>This information was also detailed in a <a href="https://twitter.com/PretendoNetwork/status/1736325668412031255">Twitter thread</a>. You may read this there if you wish, or read the repost below.</p>
<p>Some time in early December 2023, Super Mario Maker began throwing error <code>106-0502</code> very often when trying to connect. It is unclear when this truly began, but the earliest occurrences we could find were around the 8th of December. Upon inspection, the cause for this error was clear: the server the game was attempting to connect to no longer existed. Our first assumption was that this was the beginning of the shutdown early, that Nintendo may have started turning off games without notice. After some more research, however, we discovered some users able to still connect.</p>
<p>Games on Nintendo Network function using 3 servers:</p>
<ol>
<li>The account server, which tells the client the location of the game's authentication server and provides the client with a token to connect with.</li>
<li>The game's authentication server, which logs the user in using the internal NEX account (details on this in the <a href="#new-accounts-prerequisite">New Accounts (Prerequisite)</a> section), and tells the client the location of the game's secure server.</li>
<li>The game's secure server, which is where all the game play content happens at.</li>
</ol>
<p>Every game on Nintendo Network uses the same 2 authentication servers. However each game has many dedicated secure servers. When logging in, the authentication server gives one of many randomly selected addresses to connect to. We believe this is some form of load balancing, splitting connections between many servers. The issue resulting in <code>106-0502</code> is that the authentication server is now giving clients addresses to dead servers. So far, we have only been able to identify a single working address for the game.</p>
<p>We believe this is due to Nintendo attempting to scale back how many servers are running for each game, to save on costs as the shutdown date approaches. They most likely made an error in their presumed load balancer to not remove these now dead servers from the pool of available addresses. We believe this was done completely unintentionally, however Nintendo shows no signs of fixing this error.</p>
<h2 id="new-accounts-prerequisite">New Accounts (Prerequisite)</h2>
<p>As briefly touched on in <a href="#super-mario-maker">Super Mario Maker</a>, Nintendo actually uses a series of internal accounts for several services. For games, these are called "NEX accounts". Some background knowledge is required for this section, which will be gone over now.</p>
<p>NEX is the software Nintendo uses for all 3DS and WiiU games (and some Switch games). It is based on a library called Rendez-Vous, made by Canadian software company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040610104624/http://www.quazal.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Sections&amp;file=index&amp;req=viewarticle&amp;artid=101&amp;page=1">Quazal</a>. Quazal, before being bought out by Ubisoft, would license Rendez-Vous to anyone. Many games, on many platforms, by many developers, all use some variation of Rendez-Vous as it was highly extensible. This is why our server libraries are <a href="https://twitter.com/PretendoNetwork/status/1727016210435641508">theoretically compatible with Ubisoft games</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo licensed Rendez-Vous and modified it quite a bit, stripping out some more complex features and adding in some custom protocols, rebranding it to NEX. The important takeaway here is that Nintendo did not build this system from scratch, and instead modified a system made for generic game server usage.</p>
<h2 id="new-accounts">New Accounts</h2>
<p>Some time in late December 2023, new accounts could no longer go online in any games on both the WiiU and 3DS.</p>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="#new-accounts-prerequisite">New Accounts (Prerequisite)</a>, Nintendo did not make their game server software from scratch. Rendez-Vous comes with its own account system, likely due to it being designed for use in one-off games. At the time of its development, online multiplayer games were still very new and the concept of a unified account system (such as Nintendo Network or Uplay) spanning many different games made by the same company, was not a thing. Therefore, Nintendo needed to cope with this existing account system in some way.</p>
<p>On the 3DS, the console registers a new NEX account on the Friends server once during the console's setup process. Each 3DS, under normal circumstances, will only ever have a single account at a time (though this is not <em>always</em> true, but not relevant). This is why a NNID is not required to play most games online on the 3DS, as games use your NEX account to login to all game servers. Because of this, a new NEX account will never be created again unless the old one is removed using CFW or by factory resetting the console.</p>
<p>On the WiiU, a new NEX account is created automatically when the NNID is registered, and the NEX account is linked to this NNID. The console then alerts the Friends server of the new NEX account, much like 3DS. Despite using NNIDs, the WiiU also uses these NEX accounts to go online in all games.</p>
<p>Once a NEX account has been created, the Friends server synchronizes this account with all other game servers on Nintendo Network. This is due to the aforementioned account system provided by Rendez-Vous. Due to each game having their own server, and Rendez-Vous not having the concept of a unified account system, each game server has its own account system internally, which is synchronized with other games. It is actually possible to create accounts in other servers besides the Friends server if using a modified client, and those accounts will be usable in other games.</p>
<p>This synchronization process has been stopped. New NEX accounts are no longer being synchronized with any other servers on the network. This affects all games. Because of this, any attempt to connect to any game using an account made after this change was made will result in error <code>106-0303</code> on the WiiU and <code>006-0303</code> on the 3DS, internally called <code>RendezVous::InvalidUsername</code>.</p>
<p>It is not clear at this time whether this was intentional or not.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We ask that you do not spam Nintendo's support lines with these issues. Doing so may cause Nintendo to pull the plug entirely early. There are only 3 possible scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nintendo is aware of these issues already, and spam would annoy them to the point of pulling the plug.</li>
<li>Nintendo is not aware of these issues, and alerting them may cause them to pull the plug. They have already stated that anything making things "difficult" may come with an early shutdown.</li>
<li>These issues were intentional, and spam would annoy them to the point of pulling the plug.</li>
</ol>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How to View</h2>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Open a web browser and navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080/</code></li>
<li>Use the application by following the instructions on the website.</li>
</ol>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Customisation</h2>
<p dir="auto">Stirling PDF allows easy customization of the app.
Includes things like</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Custom application name</li>
<li>Custom slogans, icons, images, and even custom HTML (via file overrides)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">There are two options for this, either using the generated settings file <code>settings.yml</code>
This file is located in the <code>/configs</code> directory and follows standard YAML formatting</p>
<p dir="auto">Environment variables are also supported and would override the settings file
For example in the settings.yml you have</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="system:
  defaultLocale: 'en-US'"><pre><code>system:
  defaultLocale: 'en-US'
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">To have this via an environment variable you would have <code>SYSTEM_DEFAULTLOCALE</code></p>
<p dir="auto">The Current list of settings is</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="security:
  enableLogin: false # set to 'true' to enable login
  csrfDisabled: true

system:
  defaultLocale: 'en-US' # Set the default language (e.g. 'de-DE', 'fr-FR', etc)
  googlevisibility: false # 'true' to allow Google visibility (via robots.txt), 'false' to disallow
  customStaticFilePath: '/customFiles/static/' # Directory path for custom static files

#  homeDescription: I am a description # Short description or tagline shown on homepage.
#  appNameNavbar: navbarName # Name displayed on the navigation bar

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Extra notes</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Endpoints. Currently, the endpoints ENDPOINTS_TO_REMOVE and GROUPS_TO_REMOVE can include comma separate lists of endpoints and groups to disable as example ENDPOINTS_TO_REMOVE=img-to-pdf,remove-pages would disable both image-to-pdf and remove pages, GROUPS_TO_REMOVE=LibreOffice Would disable all things that use LibreOffice. You can see a list of all endpoints and groups <a href="https://github.com/Frooodle/Stirling-PDF/blob/main/Endpoint-groups.md">here</a></li>
<li>customStaticFilePath. Customise static files such as the app logo by placing files in the /customFiles/static/ directory. An example of customising app logo is placing a /customFiles/static/favicon.svg to override current SVG. This can be used to change any images/icons/css/fonts/js etc in Stirling-PDF</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Environment only parameters</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>SYSTEM_ROOTURIPATH</code> ie set to <code>/pdf-app</code> to Set the application's root URI to <code>localhost:8080/pdf-app</code></li>
<li><code>SYSTEM_CONNECTIONTIMEOUTMINUTES</code> to set custom connection timeout values</li>
<li><code>DOCKER_ENABLE_SECURITY</code> to tell docker to download security jar (required as true for auth login)</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">API</h2>
<p dir="auto">For those wanting to use Stirling-PDFs backend API to link with their own custom scripting to edit PDFs you can view all existing API documentation
<a href="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/Frooodle/Stirling-PDF/" rel="nofollow">here</a> or navigate to /swagger-ui/index.html of your stirling-pdf instance for your versions documentation (Or by following the API button in your settings of Stirling-PDF)</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Login authentication</h2>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Frooodle/Stirling-PDF/blob/main/images/login-light.png"><img src="https://github.com/Frooodle/Stirling-PDF/raw/main/images/login-light.png" alt="stirling-login"></a></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Prerequisites:</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>User must have the folder ./configs volumed within docker so that it is retained during updates.</li>
<li>Docker uses must download the security jar version by setting <code>DOCKER_ENABLE_SECURITY</code> to <code>true</code> in environment variables.</li>
<li>Then either enable login via the settings.yml file or via setting <code>SECURITY_ENABLE_LOGIN</code> to <code>true</code></li>
<li>Now the initial user will be generated with username <code>admin</code> and password <code>stirling</code>. On login you will be forced to change the password to a new one. You can also use the environment variables <code>SECURITY_INITIALLOGIN_USERNAME</code> and  <code>SECURITY_INITIALLOGIN_PASSWORD</code> to set your own straight away (Recommended to remove them after user creation).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Once the above has been done, on restart, a new stirling-pdf-DB.mv.db will show if everything worked.</p>
<p dir="auto">When you login to Stirling PDF you will be redirected to /login page to login with those default credentials. After login everything should function as normal</p>
<p dir="auto">To access your account settings go to Account settings in the settings cog menu (top right in navbar) This Account settings menu is also where you find your API key.</p>
<p dir="auto">To add new users go to the bottom of Account settings and hit 'Admin Settings', here you can add new users. The different roles mentioned within this are for rate limiting. This is a Work in progress which will be expanding on more in future</p>
<p dir="auto">For API usage you must provide a header with 'X-API-Key' and the associated API key for that user.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">FAQ</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Q1: What are your planned features?</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Progress bar/Tracking</li>
<li>Full custom logic pipelines to combine multiple operations together.</li>
<li>Folder support with auto scanning to perform operations on</li>
<li>Redact text (Via UI not just automated way)</li>
<li>Add Forms</li>
<li>Multi page layout (Stich PDF pages together) support x rows y columns and custom page sizing</li>
<li>Fill forms mannual and automatic</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Q2: Why is my application downloading .htm files?</h3>
<p dir="auto">This is a issue caused commonly by your NGINX congifuration. The default file upload size for NGINX is 1MB, you need to add the following in your Nginx sites-available file. <code>client_max_body_size SIZE;</code> Where "SIZE" is 50M for example for 50MB files.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Q3: Why is my download timing out</h3>
<p dir="auto">NGINX has timeout values by default so if you are running Stirling-PDF behind NGINX you may need to set a timeout value such as adding the config <code>proxy_read_timeout 3600;</code></p>

<p>This map story is about one specific map, the only one remaining from the Roman Empire. The map is 6.8 meters long, 33 centimeters tall and spans from today’s western France to Sri Lanka and from Aswan in the south to The Hague in the north — almost the entire extent of the known world. It shows the routes of the <strong>Cursus Publicus,</strong> the state-administered road network for couriers and official transportation. We know it as the <strong><a href="https://www.omnesviae.org/de/viewer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tabula Peutingeriana</a></strong>.</p>

facsimile of Peutinger’s copy of the map</figcaption></figure>



<p>Its name comes from the 16th century collector <strong>Konrad Peutinger,</strong> who owned the only copy of the map to survive the Middle Ages; it was made in the 1200s and consists of <strong>11 separate parchment panels</strong>. There was most likely a 12th panel showing the westernmost parts of the empire, including Britain, the Iberian Peninsula, and Morocco, but it hasn’t survived to the present day.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3>Traveling the Cursus Publicus</h3>



<p>The Cursus Publicus was initiated by Emperor Augustus in 27 BC to 14 AD as a fast, secure service for <strong>government and military communication</strong> and <strong>official travel around the empire.</strong> Stations were located at intervals of one day's travel along its roads, with all stations providing <strong>facilities</strong> to repair vehicles, change horses (or mules, or donkeys), and rest for the night. Some also offered <strong>extra amenities,</strong> such as baths, luxurious lodging, temples, or fortifications. This made it possible for Augustus to introduce a system of one courier carrying each parcel or message all the way to its destination, instead relaying them from person to person as in earlier times.</p>



<p>The roads carried traffic as well as messengers, but they weren’t open to just anyone; <strong>travelers had to carry a permit</strong> from the government or military stating their name, dates of travel, and the route and lodgings to be taken. Forging of permits was not uncommon.</p>



<h3>A closer look at the Tabula Peutingeriana</h3>



<p>At first glance, it’s hard to recognize the shape of Europe on this map. To fit the format of the panels, the geography is <strong>heavily stretched and distorted:</strong> the Italian peninsula, for example, takes up a third of the entire map and is rotated so that its length seems to run from east to west instead of north to south. Some elements of the natural geography such as water, forests and rivers are present, but all are very distorted. This isn’t because ancient people didn’t know what the world really looks like — the Ptolemy world map was well known at this time and cartography was a recognized field of science.</p>

<p>But if you just <strong>focus on the roads,</strong> which are drawn in red, it’s clear where they lead and how various cities are connected. In other words, the Tabula Peutingeriana does look like a modern map — a modern transit map.</p>



<h3>The math of transit maps</h3>



<p>A public transit map is usually not geographically correct; it shows only what you need to get from station A to station B. Any other information — <strong>scale, distance, the exact position of the stops, and features of the city other than its transit lines</strong> — is stripped off the map to make it as easy as possible for passengers to find their route. The most abstract transit maps, showing only lines and stations, can be described as mathematical <strong>graphs.</strong></p>

<p>A graph is a mathematical object in which certain points, or <strong>vertices</strong>, are connected by lines, or <strong>edges</strong>. The nature of the graph is determined by the number of vertices and the particular way that the edges connect them. Everything else about it — <strong>where exactly we place the vertices, how long the edges are, whether they’re straight or curved or loopy</strong> — is irrelevant, mathematically speaking.</p>



<p>In fact, maps have been part of graph theory from the very beginning, ever since Leonard Euler introduced it as a field of mathematics in the late 1700s. In his paper on the seven bridges of Königsberg, he proved that in that city, where <strong>four land masses</strong> were connected by <strong>seven bridges</strong>, it was impossible to cross all seven bridges without crossing any bridge twice. What Euler did was to remove all features of the landscape except the land masses and bridges, and consider the <strong>land masses as vertices</strong> and <strong>bridges as edges connecting them.</strong> Since that graph preserves all the important information about how to get from one land mass to another (just like a transit map!), he could use it as a simple representation of the city in his proof.</p>







<p>Neither a modern transit map nor the Tabula Peutingeriana are cartographic maps — they are visualizations of graphs. The couriers’ stations are the graph’s vertices and each stretch of road connecting two stations is an edge. (In fact, the word tabula is a Latin term that can also mean chart, diagram, or figure.)</p>



<p>Just like in a modern transit map, <strong>zones with a lot of roads might be enlarged or distorted</strong> to show the network more clearly. This “distorted” view makes it easier to display the most important information: what route leads to your destination and which stations it passes along the way.</p>

<h3>Reading and using the Tabula Peutingeriana</h3>



<p>The map names 555 cities and 3500 other waystations. Each stop is marked with symbols showing the facilities on offer, including <strong>temples, harbors, public baths, and fortified walls</strong>. The most important cities — Rome, Constantinople, and Antioch — are marked with more decorated symbols.</p>







<p>Scholars think that travelers in the Roman Empire <strong>didn’t actually carry their maps on the road.</strong> They would have been inconvenient to copy out, and carrying around a seven meter long map sounds very impractical anyway. Instead, travelers would bring an <strong>itinerarium</strong> — a written list of destinations and their connections and distances to other cities nearby. These would have been cheaper to produce, so a traveler could easily get hold of an itinerary for the direction they were heading.</p>



<p>So when would the map have been used? Since there are no classical sources that mention the Tabula Peutingeriana, or any other road map, it’s hard to know exactly. It might have been used to <strong>plan longer trips in advance</strong>, or for <strong>political and military planning</strong> purposes.</p>



<p>The map also includes some information that doesn’t seem practical at all. For example, over India is a note reading <em>In hic locis elephanti nascuntur</em> (“Elephants are born here”). The furthest extent of the empire of Alexander the Great, in modern Tajikistan, is also marked with the note <em>Hic Alexander responsum accepit usq. quo Alexander</em> (“Here Alexander received an answer [to the question]: How far, Alexander?”) Some researchers argue that the map was not only a tool for navigating, but also a way to <strong>display the power of the Roman Empire.</strong> Roads were more important than conquered cities; without roads, there would be no way to send messages, move military troops, transport food and trade goods, and keep the entire Empire together.</p>







<h3>Life of the map</h3>



<p>There is no exact date for the first version of the map. It must have been copied many times, but the only copy to have survived to our days was made around the year 1200, 700 years after the fall of the Roman Empire. Every time the map was copied, the person drawing it had a chance to make their own additions and mistakes. The result is that the map <strong>mixes different centuries,</strong> showing a reality that never existed at any single point in time.</p>



<p>For example, the city of <strong>Pompeii</strong> is marked on the map even though it was abandoned after the volcanic eruption of 79 CE. But the map also has “Constantinople” instead of <strong>Byzantinum</strong> (its common name until 500 CE) and “Jerusalem” instead of <strong>Aelia Capitolina</strong> (as it was known to the Romans from 135–324 CE). Sometimes roads even appear duplicated because the same city is shown multiple times under different historical names. Certain additions were clearly made by Christian copyists, like the spot in the Sinai desert reading <em>Hic legem acceperunt i(n) monte Syna</em>&nbsp;(“Here on Mount Sinai they received the law”).</p>



<p>There is no information on the whereabouts of the map from the time it was first produced until the surviving copy was made. That copy was <strong>rediscovered <strong>in the library of the city Wor</strong>ms in 14<strong>94</strong>, </strong>and most probably stolen from  there by Conrad Celtes, a scholar and poet of the German Renaissance. Before Celtes died, he gave the map to his good friend Konrad Peutinger, whose family kept it for the next 200 years, giving it their name. For noble families in the Holy Roman Empire, artifacts that <strong>connected their empire to the ancient Romans</strong> had a special significance. The Peutinger family sold the map in 1714 and eventually in 1737 it was bought by the Habsburg Imperial Court Library in Vienna — now the Austrian National Library — <a href="https://digital.onb.ac.at/RepViewer/viewer.faces?doc=DTL_2764184" target="_blank" rel="noopener">where it still lives today.</a></p>

<p>There are lots of commercial alarm clocks with integrated clock projector on the market but I thought, it would be fun to build one myself.</p>
<p>Moreover it was a good project for becoming&nbsp;accustomed to the process of 3d-designing cases which can be 3d printed and to learn about designing tolerances.</p>
<p>The principle is easy – basically it works like a video beamer (or any other projecting clock^^).</p>

<h2>LCD and Calculations</h2>
<p>I choosed a small negative (background black) 64×32 LCD which has the dimensions of just 15mm x 12mm (active area 11.18mm x 5.58mm).</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="53" data-permalink="https://microengineer.eu/2018/05/01/diy-night-clock-projector/lcd/" data-orig-file="https://microengineer332294991.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/lcd.png" data-orig-size="398,347" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="lcd" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://microengineer332294991.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/lcd.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://microengineer332294991.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/lcd.png?w=398" src="https://microengineer332294991.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/lcd.png?w=1000" alt="lcd" srcset="https://microengineer332294991.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/lcd.png 398w, https://microengineer332294991.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/lcd.png?w=150&amp;h=131 150w, https://microengineer332294991.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/lcd.png?w=300&amp;h=262 300w" sizes="(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px"></p>
<p>The goal was to build a complete projector with not more than 50mm x 50mm x 50mm (which I didn’t managed … But close to^^).</p>
<p>A small LCD has the advantage that everything becomes smaller and cheaper – this influences heavily costs for optics because a smaller LCD needs smaller optics to project an low distorted image.</p>
<p>Moreover a smaller LCD needs smaller focal length for a decent sized imaged on the ceiling. A good distance would be 2m from LCD to ceiling.</p>
<p>The formula for image width depending from the focal length is defined as:</p>

– S1 distance from lens to ceiling<br>
– W2 is the width of the LCD<br>
– W1 is the width of the projected image</p>
<p>The formulas show that the smaller the focal length the larger the projected image will be.</p>
<p>I decided to go for 25mm because there are cheap lenses which can be obtained for about $12 in china.</p>
<p>For our values that would magnify the image by about x80 – 11.1mm LCD width would become 88.1cm image width on the ceiling in a distance of 2m.</p>
<h2>Light and Condensor Lens</h2>
<p>It was not really clear how strong a LED has to be in order to get a reasonable well readable picture in the night on the ceiling.</p>
<p>To be sure – actually I wasn’t really – I decided to use a high power LED with 1W and use a cheap chinese condensor lense to parallelize the light before it passes the LCD (this has do be done anyway but a condensor lens makes it possible to use more light because condensors are shaped in a way that allowes to get the lens as near to the LED as possible – so catching more light).</p>

<p>The two pictures show the condensor-lense which is directly mounted to the PCB the resulting light spot on the ceiling. It is a really gread lens which is made for my LED – so it fits perfectly and parallelizes the light nicely.</p>
<h2>Electronics Construction</h2>
<p>Two PCBs were designed – one holding the LCD and the actual projecting board.</p>

<p>The latter is equipped with 1W LED driver, STM32F103 Cortex ARM, a rotary encoder (for changing settings like brightness, standby-timer, time, …), USB, IR (both not used yet).</p>
<h2>Mechanics Construction</h2>
<p>Originally, I aimed for 50mm x 50mm x 50mm but I only managed to get to 60mm x 60mm x 60mm 😥 😉</p>
<p>Here an overview about all I designed:</p>

<p>From left to right: Case with DIY projection lens (I skip this part – it worked but not really well), Sony E-Mount, C-Mount. In the middle the rest.</p>
<h3>LCD-Holder</h3>
<p>A custom LCD-holder was designed to perfectly mount the LCD on the right place on the PCB.</p>

<h3>Case – C-Mount Variant</h3>
<p>There are incredibly cheap chinase C-Mount lenses with a focal length of 25mm. They are sooo cheap that image quality is really really bad when using for fotography.</p>

<p>The pillow-effect (optical distortion where the edges are not straight but bent outwards) is almost neglectable – resulting a much better image than I expected (after reading reviews to this lense)</p>

<h3>Case – Sony E-Mount Variant</h3>
<p>Just for fun – and because I have a 3d printer which works reliably without much attention – I did a variant for Sony E-Mount.</p>

                  <p><span>The biggest missing element, in my mind, of the pro-"classicist" and anti-"mockist" view is that the practice of writing unit tests with mocking leads to refactoring your code until it works with that approach, which in turn leads to better-designed code. I don't like the emphasis of "yeah but refactoring code leads to needing to rewrite mocked tests", because if you've designed your code well, then the need to adjust an api boundary should be less frequent than the need to adjust the internal implementation details. Focusing on integration tests means you can get away with poorly designed code full of corner cases that your integration tests can't catch. Besides, "we can keep the fast feedback loop with parallel tests" really increases the demands on complicated tooling that breaks often.</span></p></div></td></tr>

<p>AI has undoubtedly made waves in 2023 and here we spotlight the most significant stories of the year poised to shape the future of this groundbreaking industry:</p>



<p><em>Correction: In the original blog post published on December 22, 2023, the title “AI Releases” caused confusion as the content encompassed announcements and updates in addition to releases. We clarified the title of the text and infographic. The mention of Stability AI open-sourcing its LLM was excluded from the infographic but left in the article, underscoring its significance in promoting accessibility rather than focusing on tech improvement. The infographic initially featured the establishment of the xAI startup, now removed because of irrelevance. Additionally, the mention of Apple Vision Pro was excluded as the article focuses on software. We also included Midjourney V.6 in the list as it is a very recent release.</em> <em>These adjustments aim to improve accuracy and coherence. We apologize for any confusion and appreciate your understanding!</em></p>



<h4><strong>AI Advancements</strong></h4>



<p>In the landscape of AI advancements this year, notable progress was made, refining existing technologies rather than introducing groundbreaking innovations akin to the&nbsp;<a href="https://journal.everypixel.com/ai-highlights-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">ChatGPT or image generators of the previous year</a>. While there was no wow effect and the real Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is still far away, this year marked an intermediate stage between prior breakthroughs and something even more powerful to come. To showcase this evolution, we crafted a visual timeline, highlighting the most remarkable AI advancements that have shaped this year of AI:</p>

<h4><strong>Legal Landscape</strong></h4>



<p>In the ever-evolving legal realm of AI, 2023 finds itself amidst a landscape filled with uncertainties and ongoing debates. As new challenges emerge, discussions surrounding copyright, corporate policies, and the broader regulatory framework continue, shaping the contours of AI’s legal landscape. Here are the most important legal issues of the year 2023:</p>



<p><strong>European AI Act</strong></p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="">European Union introduced the AI Act</a>, the world’s first comprehensive law, to regulate the use of AI. The act classifies AI systems based on the risk they pose and sets forth regulations accordingly. Although the AI Act has been provisionally agreed upon, its implementation faces delays, and the enforcement won’t commence until 2025.</p>



<p><strong>U.S. Copyright Office Stance on Registration of AI-Generated Content</strong></p>



<p>The U.S. Copyright Office took a decisive stance,&nbsp;<a href="https://journal.everypixel.com/top-ai-news-february-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">denying copyright</a>&nbsp;registration for images created by the AI algorithm Midjourney. The rejection set a precedent, asserting that AI artworks solely created by AI, without human involvement, are ineligible for copyright protection. In the same vein, the&nbsp;<a href="https://journal.everypixel.com/top-ai-news-march-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">U.S. Copyright Office issued guidance</a>&nbsp;on AI-assisted works, clarifying that works created by humans using AI tools may be eligible for copyright protection. The guidance confirmed that works created by humans using AI tools should be evaluated based on whether the human role in the creation of those works was determinative.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>“Currently, the existing legal system is not prepared to acknowledge copyright for works created with AI, given that AI learns from existing data, the rights to which belong to other people, challenging the attribution of ownership. The practice for addressing this issue is expected to develop next year, facilitated by public participation through <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/policy/artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="state-conducted surveys">state-conducted surveys</a>. Resolving this matter independently is now difficult without broader public engagement.” </em></p>
<cite>Daria Kuznetsova, Corporate Lawyer of Everypixel</cite></blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/2023-year-in-review/2023-the-year-in-charts" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="">McKinsey</a>&nbsp;also released a comprehensive graph capturing the most important AI governance-related policy and regulatory efforts in 2023. The visual representation highlights the significant contributions of 2023 in shaping the legal landscape of AI.</p>

    <p>
      December 2023
    </p>

    <p>
      As part of a backup script for my entire system I wanted to back up all my git repositories.
      Some of them don't have a remote anywhere, so I cannot rely on implicit backups in The Cloud.
      The naive solution of simply backing up the entire file-system tree is clearly not desirable since that would clutter the backup with useless build artifacts.
      One solution is to create a fresh clone (with <kbd>--mirror</kbd>), but that will typically consist of many small files which isn't ideal for backups, either.
      Conveniently git can create a single-file archive of a repository via <kbd>git bundle create</kbd> which appears to be the perfect fit for backups.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a few test runs of my backup I noticed that a small but fixed subset of repositories are getting backed up despite having no changes made.
      That is odd because I would think that repeated bundling of the same repository state should create the exact same bundle. However:
    </p>

    <pre>$ git bundle create -q /tmp/a --all
$ git bundle create -q /tmp/b --all
$ md5sum /tmp/a /tmp/b
44891a87b08b75c1b518889fcba73204  /tmp/a
a37a81710313cdbb5f065ddb2c797630  /tmp/b</pre>

    <p>
      Huh?
    </p>
    <p>
      Turns out that for <em>some repositories</em> bundling is nondeterministic.
      After browsing some vaguely-related Stackoverflow answers and several AI hallucinations later I decided to dig into the bundles to see what the differences are.
      Bundling reorganizes all git objects into a single <em>pack</em>, which is an internal git data structure to aggregate many objects into one file and apply some optimizations like delta coding along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both bundles contained a single pack in my case but each pack had a fairly different structure, as revealed by <kbd>git verify-pack -v</kbd>!
      At this point, having looked at many outputs from <kbd>git bundle create</kbd>, I had a suspicion:
    </p>

    <pre>Enumerating objects: 733, done.
Counting objects: 100% (733/733), done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (598/598), done.
Writing objects: 100% (733/733), 97.15 KiB | 6.48 MiB/s, done.
Total 733 (delta 419), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0</pre>

    <p>
      What caught my eye was <kbd>Delta compression using up to 8 threads</kbd>—parallelism is a classic source of inherent (as opposed to accidental) nondeterminism.
      Testing this hypothesis should be quite simple.
      Having browsed my fair share of git manpages in the past I knew that many commands have a <kbd>--threads</kbd> option, but git bundle does not.
      Luckily any git subcommand can be run with ad-hoc configuration options, and the relevant option here turns out to be <kbd>pack.threads</kbd>.
    </p>

    <pre>$ for i in $(seq 1 100); do \
&gt; git -c 'pack.threads=1' bundle create -q /tmp/bundle-$i --all; \
&gt; done
$ md5sum /tmp/bundle-* | cut -f 1 -d ' ' | uniq -c
    100 4898971d4d3b8ddd59022d28c467ffca</pre>

    <p>
      Success!
    </p>
    <p>
      Forcing git to be single threaded makes the output deterministic.
      In case you are wondering, using just one thread instead of eight does not have any discernible performance impact on my personal repositories, so I'm very happy to trade performance for reproducibility.

<p><span>Feature</span> Digging into stories of 1980s OSes, a forgotten war for the future of computing emerges. It was won by the lowest bidders, and then the poor users and programmers forgot it ever happened.</p>
<p>Retrocomputing is a substantial, and still growing, interest for many techies and hobbyists, and has been for a decade or two now. There's only so much you can write about a game that's decades old, but operating systems and the different paths they've taken still have rich veins to be explored.</p>
<p>Anyone who played with 1980s computers remembers the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2015/07/24/amiga_turns_30/">Amiga versus the Atari ST</a> and other battles. But digging down past the stratum of cheap home computers and gaming reveals bigger, more profound differences. The winners of the battles got to write the histories, as they always do, and that means that what is now received wisdom, shared and understood by almost everyone, contains and conceals propaganda and dogma. Things that were once just marketing BS are now holy writ, and when you discover how the <em>other</em> side saw it, dogma is uncovered as just big fat lies.</p>
<h3>The biggest lie</h3>
<p>The first of the big lies is the biggest, but it's also one of the simplest, one that you've probably never questioned.</p>
<p>It's this: <em>Computers today are better than they have ever been before.</em> Not just that they have thousands of times more storage and more speed, but that everything, the whole stack – hardware, operating systems, networking, programming languages and libraries and apps – are better than ever.</p>

    

<p>The myth is that early computers were simple, and they were replaced by better ones that could do more. Gradually, they evolved, getting more sophisticated and more capable, until now, we have multi-processor multi-gigabyte supercomputers in our pockets.</p>

        


        

<p>Which gives me an excuse to use my favorite German quote, generally attributed to physicist Wolfgang Pauli: "Das ist nicht nur nicht richtig; es ist nicht einmal falsch!" (That is not only not right, it is not even wrong!)</p>
<p>Though probably apocryphal, someone asked John Glenn, America's first person in space, what it felt like just before launch. Supposedly, he replied: "I felt about as good as anybody would, sitting in a capsule above a rocket that were both built by the lowest bidder."</p>

        

<p>Well, that is where we are today.</p>
<p>The story about evolution is totally wrong. What really happened is that, time after time, each generation of computers developed until it was very capable and sophisticated, and then it was totally replaced by a new generation of relatively simple, stupid ones. Then those were improved, usually completely ignoring all the lessons learned in the previous generation, until the new generation gets replaced in turn by something smaller, cheaper, and far more stupid.</p>
<h3>Evolution</h3>
<p>The first computers, of course, were huge room-sized things that cost millions. They evolved into mainframes: very big, very expensive, but a whole company could share one, running batch jobs submitted on punched cards and stuff like that.</p>
<p>After a couple of decades, mainframes were replaced by minicomputers, shrunk to the size of filing cabinets, but cheap enough for a mere department to afford. They were also fast enough that multiple users could use them <em>at the same time</em>, using interactive terminals.</p>
<p>All the mainframes' intelligent peripherals, networked to their CPUs, and their sophisticated, hypervisor-based, operating systems, with rich role-based security just thrown away.</p>

        

<p>Then, it gets more complicated. The conventional story, for those who have looked back to the 1970s, is that microcomputers came along, based on cheap single-chip microprocessors, and swept away minicomputers. Then they gradually evolved until they caught up.</p>
<p>But that's not really true.</p>
<p>First, and less visibly because they were so expensive, department-scale minicomputers shrank down to desk-sized, and then desk-side, and later desk-<strong>top</strong>, <em>workstations</em>. Instead of being shared by a department, these were single-user machines. Very powerful, very expensive, but just about affordable for one person – as long as they were someone important enough.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, though, in the course of being shrunk down to single-user boxes, most of their ancestors' departmental-scale sophistication was thrown away. Rich file systems, with built-in version tracking, because hard disks cost as much as cars: gone. Clustering, enabling a handful of machines costing hundreds of thousands to work as a seamless whole? Not needed, gone. Rich built-in groupware, enabling teams to cooperate and work on shared documents? Forgotten. Plain-text email was enough.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, down at the budget end and at the same time as these tens-of-thousands-of-dollar single-user workstations, dumb terminals evolved into microcomputers. Every computer in the world today is, at heart, a "micro."</p>
<p>At first, they were feeble. They could hardly do anything. So, this time around, we lost <em>tons</em> of stuff.</p>
<p>Hard disks? Too expensive. Dropped. Multitasking? Not enough memory. Removed. Choice of programming languages? Retained in the 1970s CP/M machines, then when they got cheaper still in the early '80s, dropped: kids don't need that. Shove BASIC in a ROM, that will do. The machines mostly got used for playing games anyway.</p>
<p>Early micros could handle floppy disk drives and had a DOS, but over the longer run, even those got eliminated: too expensive. Instead, you got an audio cassette recorder.</p>
<h3>How we got here</h3>
<p>Those early-1980s micros, the weakest, feeblest, most pathetic computers since the first 1940s mainframes, the early eight-bit micros, <em>those</em> are the ancestors of the computers you use today.</p>
<p>In fact, of all the early 1980s computers, the one with the most boring, unoriginal design, the one with <em>no</em> graphics and <em>no</em> sound – that, with a couple of exceptions, is the ancestor of what you use today. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2007/11/17/tob_ibm_personal_computer/">The IBM PC</a>, which got expanded and enhanced over and over again to catch up and eventually, over about 15 years, exceed the abilities of its cheaper but cleverer rivals.</p>
<p>It is <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollo%27s_law_of_irreversibility" rel="nofollow">a sort of law of nature</a> that when you try to replace features that you eliminated, the result is never as good as if you designed it in at the beginning.</p>
<p>We run the much-upgraded descendants of the simplest, stupidest, and most boring computer that anyone could get to market. They were the easiest to build and to get working. Easy means cheap, and cheap sells more and makes more profit. So they are the ones that won.</p>
<p>There's a proverb about choosing a product: "You can have good, fast, and cheap. Choose any two!"</p>
<p>We got "fast" and "cheap." We lost "good", replaced by "reliable," which is definitely a virtue, but one that comes with an extremely high price.</p>
<h3>What we lost</h3>
<p>Like many a middle-aged geek, there was a time when I collected 1980s hardware, because what was inaccessible when it was new – because I couldn't afford it – was being given away for free. However, it got bulky and I gave most of it away, focusing on battery-powered portable kit instead, partly because it's interesting in its own way, and partly because it doesn't take up much room. You don't need to keep big screens and keyboards around.</p>
<p>That led me to an interesting machine: the <em>other</em> line of Apple computers, the ones that Steve Jobs had no hand in at all.</p>
<p>The machine that inspired Jobs, which led to the Lisa and then the Mac, was of course <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/16/the_xerox_alto_50_years/">the Xerox Alto</a>, a $30,000 deskside workstation. In Jobs' own words, he saw three amazing technologies that day, but he was so dazzled by one of them that he missed the other two. He was so impressed by the GUI that he missed the object-oriented graphical programming language, Smalltalk, and the Alto's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/30/ethernet_50th_birthday/">built-in ubiquitous networking, Ethernet</a>.</p>
<p>The Lisa had none of that. The Mac had less. Apple spent much of the next 20 years trying to put them back. In that time, Steve Jobs hired John Sculley from PepsiCo to run Apple, and in return, Sculley fired Jobs. What Apple came up with during Sculley's reign was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2010/07/26/newton_messagepad_120/">the Newton</a>.</p>
<p>I have two Newtons, an Original MessagePad and a 2100. I love them. They're a vision of a different future. But I never used them much: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2014/03/07/bugger_my_jetpack_wheres_my_21stcentury_psion/?page=2">I used Psions</a>, which had a far simpler and less ambitious design, meaning that they were cheaper but did the job. This should be an industry proverb.</p>
<p>The Newton that shipped was a pale shadow of the Newton that Apple originally planned. There are traces of that machine out there, though, and that's what led to me uncovering the great computing war.</p>
<p>The Newton was – indeed, still is – a radical machine. It's designed to live in your pocket, store and track your information and habits. It had an address book, a diary, a note-taking app, astonishing handwriting recognition, and a primitive AI assistant. You could write "lunch with Alice" on the screen, and it would work out what you wrote, analyze it, work out from your diary when you normally had lunch, from your call history where you took lunch most often and which Alice you contacted most often, book a time slot in your diary and send her a message to ask her if she'd like to come.</p>
<p>It was something like Siri, but 20 years earlier, and in that time, Apple seems to have forgotten all this: It had to buy Siri in.</p>
<p>NewtonOS also had no file system. I don't mean it wasn't visible to the user; I mean there wasn't one. It had some non-volatile memory on board, expandable via memory cards – huge PCMCIA ones the size of half-centimetre-thick credit cards – and it kept stuff in a sort of OS-integrated object database, segregated by function. The stores were called "soups" and the OS kept track of what was stored where. No file names, no directories, nothing like that at all.</p>
<p>Apps, and some of the OS itself, were written in a language called NewtonScript, which is very distantly related to both AppleScript on modern macOS and JavaScript. But that was not the original plan. That was for a far more radical OS, in a more radical language, one that could be developed in an astounding graphical environment.</p>
<p>The language was called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/1992/09/dylan_a_new_language.html" rel="nofollow">Dylan</a>, which is short for Dynamic Language. It <a target="_blank" href="https://opendylan.org/" rel="nofollow">still exists</a> as a FOSS compiler. Apple seems to have forgotten about it too, because it reinvented that wheel, worse, with Swift.</p>
<p>Have a look. Dylan is amazing, and its <a target="_blank" href="https://opendylan.org/history/apple-dylan/eulogy.html" rel="nofollow">SK8 IDE</a> even more so (a few <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macintoshrepository.org/2625-apple-sk8" rel="nofollow">screenshots and downloads</a> are left). Dylan is very readable, very high-level, and before the commercial realities of time and money prevailed, Apple planned to write an OS, and the apps for that OS, in Dylan.</p>
<p>Now <em>that</em> is radical: Using the same, very high-level, language for both the OS and the apps. It was feasible because Dylan is built as a layer on top of one of the oldest programming languages that's still in active use, Lisp.</p>
<p>Both Smalltalk and Lisp are very much still around. For both, there are commercial and FOSS versions. Both can run on the .NET CLR and on the JVM. There's even a Smalltalk that <a target="_blank" href="https://amber-lang.net/" rel="nofollow">runs in your browser</a> on the JavaScript engine. The primary text editor of the Lisp environment is still widely used today, mostly by old-timers.</p>
<p>But these are only traces. They are faint memorials left after the war. Because once, these things were not just slightly weird languages that ran on commodity OSes.</p>
<h3>They were OSes in their own right</h3>
<p>I started digging into that, and that's when the ground crumbled away, and I found that, like some very impressive CGI special effects, I wasn't excavating a graveyard but a whole, hidden, ruined city.</p>
<p>Once, Lisp ran on the bare metal, on purpose-built computers that ran operating systems written in Lisp, ones with GUIs that could connect to the internet.</p>
<p>And if you find the people who used Lisp machines ... wow. They loved them, with a passion that makes Amiga owners look like, well, amateurs, hobbyists. This level of advocacy makes Vi versus Emacs look like a playground squabble.</p>
<p>Some of the references are easy to find. There's a wonderful book called <a target="_blank" href="https://web.mit.edu/~simsong/www/ugh.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Unix-Haters Handbook</a> [PDF] which I highly recommend. It's easy to read and genuinely funny. It's a digest of a long-running internet community from the time when universities were getting rid of Lisp machines and replacing them with cheaper, faster Unix workstations – Sun boxes and things like that.</p>
<p>Lisp machine users were not impressed. For them, Unix was a huge step <em>backwards</em>. The code was all compiled, whereas Lisp OSes ran a sort of giant shared dynamic environment (it's hard to explain something when the words for it have been lost). On a Unix machine, if you didn't like the way a program did something, you had to go find the source code, edit it, save it in a new file, compile that file, restart the program to try it ... and if it worked, find your existing binary, and replace it with the new one. Then you would probably find that you'd made a mistake and it didn't work, and try again.</p>
<p>This is why, apart from the hardcore Gentoo users, we all outsource this stuff to OS vendors and Linux distributors.</p>
<p>On the Lisp machines, your code wasn't trapped inside frozen blocks. You could just edit the live running code and the changes would take effect immediately. You could inspect or even change the values of variables, as the code ran. Developer and blogger Steve Yegge called it "<a target="_blank" href="https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/01/pinocchio-problem.html" rel="nofollow">living software</a>."</p>
<p>Lisp machines booted slowly, but that didn't matter much because you rarely cold booted them. At the end of the day, the OS wrote the values of all its objects and variables to disk – called "saving a world" – and then just stopped. When you turned it back on, it reread these values into memory, and resumed exactly where it was.</p>
<p>Most of this, incidentally, also applies to Smalltalk machines. That's why these two are sometimes called <a target="_blank" href="http://onsmalltalk.com/languages-of-the-gods" rel="nofollow">languages of the gods</a>.</p>
<p><em>This</em> is what Steve Jobs missed. He was distracted by the shiny. He brought the world the GUI, but he got his team to reimplement it on top of fairly conventional OSes, originally in a mixture of assembly and Pascal.</p>
<p>He left behind the amazing rich development environment, where it was objects all the way down.</p>
<h3>And we never got it back</h3>
<p>We got networking back, sure, but not this.</p>
<p>Now Lisp and Smalltalk are just niche languages – but once, both of them were whole other universes. Full-stack systems, all live, all dynamic, all editable on the fly.</p>
<p>The closest thing we have today is probably JavaScript apps running in web browsers, and they are crippled little things by comparison.</p>
<p>The difference, though, is where the biggest losses in the war came.</p>
<p>Smalltalk machines ran on relatively normal processors. Smalltalk is all about objects, and you can't really handle objects at hardware level.</p>
<p>(Well, you <em>can</em> – a very expensive Hi-Fi manufacturer called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/10/jony_ive_linn_turntable/">Linn</a> tried with a machine called the Rekursiv, but it flopped badly. So did Intel's attempt to do a chip that implemented high-level stuff in hardware – not the Itanium, no, long before that, the iAPX 432.)</p>
<p>But <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lispmachine.net/" rel="nofollow">Lisp machines</a> ran on dedicated chips, and this is where stuff gets real. As in, the <em>stuff</em> that hits the fan.</p>
<p>There were several big vendors of Lisp machines. As <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/23/medley_interlisp_revival/">we covered recently</a>, Xerox sold them, and its Lisp OS is now FOSS.</p>
<p>But the bigger one, and the most influential, was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ifis.uni-luebeck.de/~moeller/symbolics-info/index.html" rel="nofollow">Symbolics</a>. At risk of sounding like a hipster, "you've probably never heard of it." Forgotten as it is now, as an indication of how significant the company was, it owned <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2008/dec/22/internet-domains" rel="nofollow">the first ever dot-com domain</a> on the internet. It launched in 1980 with a commercial version of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/31/mit_cadr_software_recovered/">MIT CADR Lisp machine</a>, and made dedicated Lisp hardware until 1993.</p>

<p>The company's dead, but the OS, OpenGenera, is still <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/OpenGenera" rel="nofollow">out there</a> and you can <a target="_blank" href="https://jaoswald.blogspot.com/2020/05/open-genera-vlm-on-linux.html" rel="nofollow">run it on an emulator</a> on Linux. It's the end result of several decades of totally separate evolution from the whole Mac/Windows/Unix world, so it's kind of arcane, but it's out there.</p>
<p>There are a lot of accounts of the power and the productivity possible in Lisp and on Lisp machines.</p>
<p>One of the more persuasive is from a man called Kalman Reti, the last working Symbolics engineer. So loved are these machines that people are still working on their 30-year-old hardware, and Reti maintains them. He's made some YouTube videos demonstrating OpenGenera on Linux.</p>
<p>He <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Bw4Wz8Ir0pl1cmNRaHYwdU1wdXM/" rel="nofollow">talks about</a> [video] the process of implementing the single-chip Lisp machine processors.</p>

<p>Now that is significant.</p>
<p>When different people tell you that they can achieve such a huge differential in productivity – one tenth of the people taking one tenth of the time to do the same job – you have to pay attention.</p>

<h3>'Better is the enemy of good'</h3>
<p>I am <em>not</em> here to tell you that Lisp machines were some ultimate super workstation. An environment that is mostly semi-interpreted code, running in a single shared memory space, is not very stable ... and when it crashes, if you don't have a snapshot to go back to, you have pain in store.</p>
<p>The point here is not that this long-gone technology was better in every way. It wasn't. But it did have advantages, and it's instructive to look at some of these that were shared by both Lisp and Smalltalk machines.</p>
<p>They were written in one language, or mostly in one, all the way down. As original Smalltalk implementer Dan Ingalls put it: "An operating system is a collection of things that don't fit inside a language; there shouldn't be one."</p>
<p>They had a pervasive model of data, all the way down the stack. In Smalltalk, everything is objects. In Lisp, everything is lists. What the Unix&nbsp;model offers by comparison is weak stuff: Everything is a file.</p>
<h3>More big lies</h3>
<p>The Unix model of computation was designed in response to Multics, the original all-singing, all-dancing 1960s OS. Unix was intended, in contrast, to be the ultimate in minimalism (although it very much&nbsp;is not anymore).</p>
<p>This shows up another of the big lies that everyone just takes as read, but this one has layers like a cabbage:</p>
<ul>
<li>For speed, you need a language that's close to the metal. That means it must be very simple. This has costs, but they're worth it: the programmer must manually manage their memory, meaning that they must be very, <em>very</em> careful.</li>

<li>But that's hard, so to keep life easier, you layer simpler languages on top. Early on, AWK and SED and so on; later, Perl and Python; then later still, runtimes such as the JVM and WASM, and languages on top of that, such as Clojure or Scala.</li>

<li>As the stack matures, it grows ever more layers. The higher layers are ever further from the metal.</li>

<li>Many of these languages are much easier but slower. In the old days, you needed to rewrite code in a lower-level language for speed, such as C++. So what if it's huge? You don't need all of it! So what if it's hard to read? It was hard to write!</li>

<li>Then, in time, computers keep getting faster, so you can retain the inefficient implementation and keep going.</li>
</ul>
<p>The result is a folk belief that there is a necessary, implicit contrast between "readable" and "fast." This is one of the big assumptions behind both the Unix and Windows schools of OS design, that different languages are best for different jobs, and so you need a mixture of them. That means that the layers are sealed off from one another, because of different models of variable storage, of memory management, etc.</p>
<p>That's one big lie.</p>
<p>Firstly, because the layers are <em>not</em> sealed off: higher-level languages are usually implemented in lower-level ones, and vulnerabilities in those permeate the stack.</p>
<p>For instance, a common way of trying to make stuff safer is to wrap it in a runtime or VM, but that doesn't solve the problem, it creates new ones. Problem: The language eliminates whole types of error, but they persist in the VM. Problem: Now, your code is dependent on the performance of the VM. Problem: Try to fix either of these, you risk breaking the code. Problem: Because the VM isn't part of the OS, you end up with multiple VMs, all sharing these issues.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.millersville.edu/bikenaga/math-proof/existence-proofs/existence-proofs.html" rel="nofollow">existence&nbsp;proof</a> that multiple projects and products, successful in their time, show that if you pick the right language, you can built your entire stack all in one.</p>
<p>Lisp code is structured as lists, which is the data structure that Lisp is designed to manipulate. That is the reason for its <a target="_blank" href="https://toggl.com/blog/save-princess-8-programming-languages" rel="nofollow">legendary plethora of parentheses</a>. It also makes it very easy to write macros that manipulate program code, meaning programs can modify themselves. This sort of thing is why Neal Stephenson <a target="_blank" href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs81n/command.txt" rel="nofollow">referred to it</a> thus:</p>

<p>It is highly readable, and vastly powerful. Alan Kay, the designer of Smalltalk, <a target="_blank" href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1039523" rel="nofollow">said of Lisp</a>:</p>

<p>These are powerful qualities – but possibly only to a certain type of mind.</p>
<p>Dylan, however, shows that it need not be like that. If you lose the list-based notation, yes, there is a price in efficiency and power, but the result is readable by mere mortals. Dylan was not the only attempt to do this. There are quite a few – <a target="_blank" href="http://users.rcn.com/david-moon/PLOT/" rel="nofollow">PLOT</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/41951" rel="nofollow">CGOL</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://readable.sourceforge.io/" rel="nofollow">sweet expressions</a>, the cancelled <a target="_blank" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1464291.1464362" rel="nofollow">Lisp 2 project</a>, and more.</p>
<p>The plan was that the Newton would be a Dylan-based Lisp machine in your pocket. The Newton was Sculley's baby. Jobs didn't invent it, so he didn't like it, derided it as a "<a target="_blank" href="https://allthingsd.com/20120113/former-apple-ceo-says-newton-scribble-thing-was-15-years-ahead-of-its-time/" rel="nofollow">scribble thing</a>," and on his return to Apple he killed it <a target="_blank" href="http://www.loper-os.org/?p=568" rel="nofollow">along with Hypercard</a>.</p>
<p>In 1993, the Newton was Apple's first Arm-powered computer, a CPU architecture it returned to 17 years later. It was planned to be the a pocket Lisp workstation, and it launched the same year that Symbolics quit making Lisp processors and <a target="_blank" href="http://pt.withington.org/publications/VLM.pdf" rel="nofollow">moved to the DEC Alpha</a> [PDF] instead.</p>
<p>In the end, the big fight was between dedicated hardware, with custom processors running custom operating systems, versus a shared, lowest-common-denominator technology: UNIX, running at first on off-the-shelf chips such as the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=960" rel="nofollow">Sun-1's Motorola 68000</a> and later on RISC chips such as Sun's SPARC and the MIPS R2000, launched the same year as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/21/risc_os_35/">Acorn's RISC OS 2 on its ARM chips</a>. A cross-platform OS, its development sponsored by Bell Labs and refined at the University of California, compiled from source written in a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/05/15/algol_60_at_60/">cut-down form of BCPL</a>.</p>
<p>As is usually the way, the cheaper, simpler solution won. Commodity chips were replaced with faster RISC chips, broadly speaking designed to run compiled C code efficiently. Then, decades later, the PC caught up: 32-bit x86 processors became comparable in performance to the RISC chips, and we ended up with a few varieties of Unix on x86, plus Windows NT. Unix, of course, was originally developed on the DEC PDP-7, moved to the PDP-11, and later its 32-bit successor the VAX. Windows NT, meanwhile, was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/30/arm_intel_comment/">designed by the chief architect</a> of the VAX's native OS, VMS. That's why it's so visibly influenced by it. Instead of DEC's BLISS language, NT is implemented in Unix's native language, C.</p>
<p>From the perspective of a Smalltalk or Lisp machine, they are siblings, almost twins, with deep roots in DEC. They are representatives of a school of design called the "New Jersey approach" by Lisp luminary Richard Gabriel in his essay "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/LispGoodNewsBadNews.pdf" rel="nofollow">Lisp: Good News, Bad News, How to Win Big</a>" [PDF]. He compares it to what he calls the "MIT approach," and his summary of the New Jersey way is called "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html" rel="nofollow">Worse is Better</a>."</p>
<p>It's well worth reading at least the summary, but the key points are this.</p>

<p>He continues:</p>

<p>The conclusion, though, is the stinger:</p>

<p>Time has certainly proved Dr Gabriel correct. Systems of the New Jersey school so dominate the modern computing industry that the <em>other</em> way of writing software is banished to a tiny niche.</p>
<p>Smalltalk&nbsp;evolved into Self, which begat JavaScript, which in the hands of a skilled Smalltalker <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/23/croquet_for_unity/">can do amazing things</a> – but only its visual design transformed the computer industry.</p>
<p>The Lisp text editor is now just one of the more arcane options on Linux boxes. Lisp itself is a fringe programming language, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html" rel="nofollow">beloved by some industry heroes</a> but ignored by most – even those who <a target="_blank" href="https://flownet.com/gat/jpl-lisp.html" rel="nofollow">need the very best tools</a>. As one famous Lisp programmer <a target="_blank" href="https://www.marktarver.com/bipolar.html" rel="nofollow">put it</a>:</p>

<p>If you want to become a billionaire from software, you don't want rockstar geniuses; you need <a target="_blank" href="http://www.loper-os.org/?p=69" rel="nofollow">fungible cogs</a>, interchangeable and inexpensive.</p>
<p>Software built with tweezers and glue is not robust, no matter how many layers you add. It's terribly fragile, and needs armies of workers constantly fixing its millions of cracks and holes.</p>
<p>There was once a better way, but it lost out to cold hard cash, and now, only a few historians even remember it existed. ®</p>
<h3>Bootnote</h3>
<p>For a look at a Lisp machine in action, as well as BTRON and IBM i, this talk from the Chaos Computer Congress entitled "<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://media.ccc.de/v/rc3-525180-what_have_we_lost#l=eng&amp;t=0">What have we lost?</a>" is worth a watch.</p>

<p>Matter, as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/matter-and-thread-could-fix-smart-home-compatibility-but-dont-get-excited-yet/">a smart home standard</a>, would make everything about owning a smart home better. Devices could be set up with any phone, for either remote or local control, put onto any major platform (like Alexa, Google, or HomeKit) or combinations of them, and avoid being orphaned if their device maker goes out of business. Less fragmentation, more security, fewer junked devices: win, win, win.</p>
<p>Matter, as it exists in late 2023, more than a year after its 1.0 specification was published and just under a year after the first devices came online, is more like the <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">xkcd scenario</a> that lots of people might have expected. It's another home automation standard at the moment, and one that isn't particularly better than the others, at least how it works today. I wish it was not so.</p>
<p>Setting up a Matter device isn't easy, nor is making it work across home systems. Lots of devices with Matter support still require you to download their maker's specific app to get full functionality. Even if you were an early adopting, Matter-T-shirt-wearing enthusiast, you're still buying devices that don't work quite as well, and still generally require a major tech company's gear to act as your bridge or router.</p>

<h2>Lights that Matter, but do less</h2>
<p>Jennifer Pattison Tuohy at The Verge has done more Matter writing, and testing, than just about anybody out there who doesn't work for the Connectivity Standards Alliance that oversees the spec. As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23997548/matter-smart-home-2023-platforms">she puts it</a>:</p>                                            
                                                        
<blockquote><p>I’ve been testing Matter devices all year, and it has been the most frustrating year of my decade-plus experience with smart home devices. Twelve months in, I do not have one Matter-based device working reliably in my home. To make matters worse (yeah, I know), the one system that’s always been rock solid, my Philips Hue smart lights, is basically unusable in any of my smart home platforms since I moved it to Matter.</p></blockquote>
<p>When the Matter upgrade for Hue lights rolled out in September, I didn't move to switch my bulbs over. For one thing, it wouldn't result in a net loss of limited-purpose hardware (i.e. hubs). If you wanted to move your Hue bulbs over to Matter and control them through Google's Home app, you'd need a Google Home Hub or Home Mini to act as a Matter bridge device. The same goes for Alexa (Echo devices), Samsung SmartThings (a Hub), or Apple Home (an Apple TV or HomePod/mini). You also lose some Hue-specific function, like gradient lighting and scenes (like holiday green/red schemes). And, as Tuohy has noted, it's likely not a more reliable network than the proprietary Zigbee setup that Hue ran on before.</p>
<p>The smart home and automation market is like that pretty much everywhere. Aqara offers a <a href="https://www.aqara.com/en/product/led-strip-t1/">Matter-compliant light strip, the T1</a>, but it requires a hub, and using Matter means you can't use Apple's light-sensing adaptive brightness, because Matter doesn't support that yet. The same goes for Nanoleaf's Matter-friendly <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C1JD5YXW/?tag=arstech20-20">bulbs</a> and <a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/products/essentials/lightstrips/?category=lightstrips&amp;standard=matter&amp;pack=smarter-kit&amp;size=2">strips</a>, which are Matter and Thread capable but require Nanoleaf's own app to provide Nanoleaf's version of adaptive lighting.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/12/stupid-patent-month-selfie-contests">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/12/stupid-patent-month-selfie-contests</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38763566">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <article role="article">
  
  
  <div><p><span>Patents are supposed to be an incentive to invent. Too often, they end up being a way to try to claim “ownership” of what should be basic building blocks of human activity, culture, and knowledge. This is especially true of </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/patents"><span>software patents</span></a><span>, an area EFF has been speaking out about for more than 20 years now.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This month’s Stupid Patent, No. </span><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US8655715B2/"><span>8,655,715</span></a><span>, continues the tradition of trying to use software language to capture a monopoly on a basic human cultural activity–in this case, contests.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A company called Opus One, which does business under the name “Contest Factory,” claims this patent and </span><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US10891642B2/en"><span>a related one</span></a><span> cover a huge array of online contests. So far, they’ve filed five lawsuits against other companies that help build online contests, and even threatened a small photo company that organizes mostly non-commercial contests online.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The patents held by Contest Factory are a good illustration of why EFF has been concerned about out-of-control software patents. It’s not just that wrongly issued patents extort a vast tax on the U.S. economy (although they do—one study </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2014/07/the-evidence-is-in-patent-trolls-do-hurt-innovation"><span>estimated $29 billion in annual direct costs</span></a><span>). The worst software patents also harm peoples’ rights to express themselves and participate in online culture. Just as we’re free in the physical world to </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/01/stupid-patent-month-digital-verification-systems-patents-e-signatures"><span>sign documents</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/12/how-patent-sorting-photos-got-used-sue-free-software-group"><span>sort photos</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/10/east-texas-judge-throws-out-168-patent-cases-in-one-fell-swoop/"><span>store and label information</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/02/stupid-patent-month-clocking-work-app"><span>clock in to work</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/05/patent-troll-uses-ridiculous-people-finder-patent-sue-small-dating-companies"><span>find people to date</span></a><span>, or </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/07/effs-help-language-teacher-responds-ridiculous-patent-threat"><span>teach foreign languages</span></a><span>, without paying extortionate fees to others, we must also be free to do so online.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong><span>Patenting Contests</span></strong></h3>
<p><span>Claim 1 of the ‘715 patent has steps that claim:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Receiving, storing, and accessing data on a computer;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Sorting it and generating “contest data”;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Tabulating votes and picking a winner.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The patent also uses other terms for common activities of general purpose computers, such as “transmitting” and “displaying” data.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In other words, the patent describes everyday use of computers, plus the idea of users participating in a contest. This is a classic abstract idea, and it never should have been eligible for a patent.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In a </span><a href="https://gamification.cioreview.com/vendor/2017/contest_factory"><span>2017 article in CIO Review</span></a><span>, the company acknowledges how incredibly broad its claims are. Contest Factory claims it patented “voting in online contests long before TV contest shows with public voting components made their appearance,” and that it holds patents “associated with online contests and integrating online voting with virtually any type of contest.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Lawsuit Over Radio Station Contest&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p><span>In its most recent lawsuit, Contest Factory says that a Minneapolis radio station’s “Mother’s Day Giveaway” for a mother/daughter spa day infringed its patent. The radio station asked people to post mother-daughter selfies online and share their entry to collect votes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Contest Factory sued Pancake Labs (</span><a href="https://www.eff.org/document/contest-factory-v-pancake-labs"><span>complaint</span></a><span>), the company that helped the radio station put the contest online. Contest Factory also claimed a </span><a href="https://www.shortstack.com/blog/how-pbs-maximizes-shortstacks-scalability-versatility-and-customizability-when-creating-digital-marketing-campaigns"><span>PBS contest</span></a><span> in which viewers created short films and voted on them was an example of infringement.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For the “Mother’s Day Giveaway” contest, the patent infringement accusation reads in part that, “the executable instructions … cause the generation of a contest and the transmission of the first and second content data to at least one user to view and rate the content.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Contest Factory has sued over quite a few internet contests, dating back more than a decade. Its 2016 lawsuits, based on the ‘715 patent and two earlier related patents,&nbsp;were filed against three small online marketing firms: Vancouver-based </span><a href="https://www.strutta.com/about/"><span>Strutta</span></a><span>, Florida-based </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/elettro"><span>Elettro</span></a><span>, and California-based </span><a href="https://www.votigo.com/"><span>Votigo</span></a><span>, for contests that go back to 2011. We don’t know how many more companies or online communities have been threatened in all.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sharing user-generated content like photos—cooperatively or competitively—is the kind of sharing that the digital world is ideal for. When patent owners demand a toll for these activities, it doesn’t matter whether they’re patent “trolls” or operating companies seeking to extract settlements from competitors. They threaten our freedoms in unacceptable ways.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The government shouldn’t be issuing patents like these, and it certainly shouldn’t be making them </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/11/publics-right-fight-bad-patents-must-be-protected"><span>harder to challenge</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<li><span>Opus One d/b/a Contest Factory v. Pancake Labs </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/document/contest-factory-v-pancake-labs"><span>complaint</span></a></li>

<p>Companies increasingly aim to control how users interact with their 
content online, threatening user freedom. As more companies crack down 
on browser extensions and other third-party software used by internet 
users to customise their experiences, two recent German court cases on 
adblockers could strengthen the legal case for user control over 
technology.</p>

<p>Advertisements are a part of our lives, including our digital ones. 
They are in the websites we browse, the search results we receive, and 
the online news we read. Tired of receiving so many ads, some users try 
to avoid them by installing an adblocker. But is this a legal practice? 
Is using adblockers an act of restricting market autonomy, or do they 
help achieve user freedom?</p>

<p>Imagine a scenario where website owners hold copyright over their 
websites, including whatever ads they place, and could effectively sue 
for copyright infringement if users were to remove or suppress ads when 
visiting these websites. This hypothetical situation would enable any 
website copyright holder to use the legal system to stop any ordinary 
user on the internet who tries to bypass these ads. This would 
lead to an internet where unsolicited information 
and advertisements are imposed on users. Fortunately, recent court 
decisions have at least prevented this hypothetical from becoming a 
reality in Germany.</p> 

<h2 id="id-is-it-legal-to-use-adblockers-the-lawsuit-in-question">Is it legal to use adblockers? The lawsuit in question</h2>

<p>Using an adblocker is the main way in which many internet users 
bypass ads and pop-ups when accessing websites. Adblockers usually come 
in the form of browser extensions and plugins that filter out unwanted 
ads for an ad-free internet browsing experience.</p> 

<p>As the use of these adblockers increases, some companies have begun 
considering whether it is legal for  users to be able to block their 
ads. This was the case in Germany when Axel Springer SE (Axel 
Springer), one of Germany’s largest publishing companies, engaged in 
lawsuits against Eyeo GmbH (Eyeo), the creator of <a href="https://adblockplus.org/en/about#whymoney">Adblock Plus</a> (a 
Free 
Software adblocking tool licensed under the GPLv3). These lawsuits have 
resulted in a legal battle for user freedom and an open internet.</p>

<p>In the case of Adblock Plus, ads are blocked according to filter rules 
maintained in a so-called “black list”, which users use as a default 
setting. The extension offers ad providers the possibility of having 
their ads excluded from this black list (and included in a “white 
list”) by complying with <a href="https://acceptableads.com/standard/">“acceptable advertising 
standards”,</a> disclosing 
their annual turnover, and paying a sum to Eyeo. Users will only see 
ads that have been included in the white list, but they also have the 
option of blocking ads from both white and black lists altogether.</p>

<div>
<p>Axel Springer filed several suits in Germany against Eyeo on the grounds 
that the Adblock Plus extension interfered with their business, 
alleging that by blocking its advertisements, Eyeo had engaged in 
anti-competitive measures. According to Axel Springer, Eyeo’s business 
model constituted:</p>
<ol>
<li>Targeted obstruction and aggressive business practice; and </li>
<li>A violation of freedom of the press.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h3 id="id-the-right-not-to-be-advertised-to">The right not to be advertised to</h3> 
<p>After ruling that the option to use adblockers is a decision that internet users should be able to make, 
the courts in Germany ruled that user rights not only include the 
freedom to express an opinion and to receive information, but also the 
rights to refrain from expressing an opinion and to refuse to receive 
imposed information. In doing so, the rulings considered a user’s 
interest in being spared from obtrusive advertising.</p>

<p>Accordingly, internet users are simply exercising their right to not 
have certain forms of advertising displayed when visiting internet 
websites when they choose to make use of an adblocker. Adblock Plus’s 
business model, according to the courts, was therefore a marketable 
service offer which was not primarily aimed at impairing the 
competitive development of Axel Springer. In the opinion of the courts, 
Adblock Plus also does not directly interfere with the business, as 
users retain autonomy to do as they wish with the settings of the 
add-on after installation. Users can block or wish to see only the ads 
in the whitelist. Adblock Plus is therefore merely a product whose use 
is decided solely by the internet user.</p>

<h3 id="id-the-html-argument-does-the-use-of-adblockers-constitute-a-modification-of-a-computer-program">The HTML argument: does the use of adblockers constitute a modification of a computer program?</h3>

<p>Axel Springer also submitted an argument to the German courts that their
websites would be protected under German copyright law as a copyrighted 
computer program, and that their HTML code would similarly be covered 
under this ambit because of the control components it included. Because 
of how Adblock Plus interacts with its website, Axel Springer therefore 
claimed that copies and adaptations of the code in its website were 
violations of copyright made without permission.</p>

<p>In both the initial court ruling and the decision on the subsequent appeal in favour 
of Eyeo, the court disagreed with Axel Springer and held that the use 
of Adblock Plus solely affects the program flow through external 
commands, without altering the program’s essence or generating a 
changed version. Thus, the use of the extension results in a mere 
browser configuration carried out by users according to their 
preferences.</p>

<p>The courts noted that internet users do not require permission from 
website owners when they want to make the website look better for 
themselves. Modern websites are made up of many separate parts that can 
be technically distinguished from each other, including text, images, and 
videos, as well as software that is embedded in the HTML page. For the 
courts, it wasn’t enough that these software components were used in 
the website’s HTML page to mean that the website itself was a 
protectable computer program. We can therefore infer that adblockers 
do not infringe upon a program’s protections.</p>

<h2 id="id-downsides-of-the-case">Downsides of the case</h2> 
<p>Nevertheless, some aspects in the judgments are still not ideal in 
promoting the average user’s rights. While user freedom  means that 
users are able to use the tools that they wish to when browsing the 
World Wide Web, the court nevertheless preserved Axel 
Springer’s right to exclude users with an activated adblocker from 
accessing its content. This can be understood as an approval on the use 
of adblock detection tools by companies like Axel Springer.</p> 

<p>Unfortunately, the court also mentioned that Axel Springer can convert 
its content into a paid access model, justifying this measure as an 
element inherent for competition. We fear that this tacit approval can 
result in paywalls and adblock detection tools becoming the basic 
standard on the internet.</p> 

<p>More importantly, tools to detect the use of adblockers go against <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32002L0058">Art. 
5(3) of the ePrivacy directive</a>, which mandates that websites must seek 
consent before accessing or storing information about a user’s device. 
The EU commission has confirmed that, Art. 5(3) of the ePrivacy directive 
<a href="https://forum.adblockplus.org/viewtopic.php?t=45001">is not 
just limited to cookies but ‘all types of information’ stored or 
accessed</a> in the user’s terminal device. This applies to the storage by 
websites of scripts in users’ terminal equipment to detect if users 
have installed or are using adblockers.</p> 

<h2 id="id-a-win-for-user-freedom">A win for user freedom?</h2> 

<p>With many service providers and websites on the internet following the 
trend of restricting users with adblockers from accessing their services, these court 
decisions in Germany help build precedents that uphold and recognize 
principles of user freedom.</p> 

<p>Indeed, these decisions support the principles of a <a href="https://fsfe.org/activities/ngi/ngi.en.html">Next Generation 
Internet</a>, including ensuring that internet users can make individual 
choices and exercise their freedom of expression, in ways in which they 
can freely develop and use new extensions and browser features to 
enhance their online experience and user control.</p>  

<p>Despite the steps forward for user control found in these judgments, 
they do not go as far as we would hope to secure user freedom when 
using the internet, and are still subject to appeals and therefore may 
not be final. We will keep an eye on the legal proceedings in this case 
and keep you updated when new developments occur. In the meantime, the 
court cases can be read on the <a href="https://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bgh&amp;Art=en&amp;nr=8849">Bundesgerichtshof</a> 
and <a href="https://www.landesrecht-hamburg.de/bsha/document/JURE220021753">Landesgerichts</a> 
websites. If you are aware of any similar cases or other developments to 
support user freedom in any other member states in the EU, then please
