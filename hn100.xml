<p dir="auto">This is a script to download emails from Gmail and store them in a SQLite database for further analysis. I find it extremely useful to have all my emails in a database to run queries on them. For example, I can find out how many emails I received per sender, which emails take the most space, and which emails from which sender I never read.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2><a id="user-content-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation"></a></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Clone this repository: <code>git clone https://github.com/marcboeker/gmail-to-sqlite.git</code>.</li>
<li>Install the requirements: <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></li>
<li>Create a Google Cloud project <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</li>
<li>Open <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/gmail.googleapis.com" rel="nofollow">Gmail in API &amp; Services</a> and activate the Gmail API.</li>
<li>Open the <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent" rel="nofollow">OAuth consent screen</a> and create a new consent screen. You only need to provide a name and contact data.</li>
<li>Next open <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/oauthclient" rel="nofollow">Create OAuth client ID</a> and create credentials for a <code>Desktop app</code>. Download the credentials file and save it under <code>credentials.json</code> in the root of this repository.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Here is a detailed guide on how to create the credentials: <a href="https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python#set_up_your_environment" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python#set_up_your_environment</a>.</p>

<ol dir="auto">
<li>Run the script: <code>python main.py sync --data-dir path/to/your/data</code> where <code>--&lt;data-dir&gt;</code> is the path where all data is stored. This creates a SQLite database in <code>&lt;data-dir&gt;/messages.db</code> and stores the user credentials under <code>&lt;data-dir&gt;/credentials.json</code>.</li>
<li>After the script has finished, you can query the database using, for example, the <code>sqlite3</code> command line tool: <code>sqlite3 &lt;data-dir&gt;/messages.db</code>.</li>
<li>You can run the script again to sync all new messages. Provide <code>--full-sync</code> to force a full sync. However, this will only update the read status, the labels, and the last indexed timestamp for existing messages.</li>

<i>"I once read a lot of Baudelaire + my Angel kid has read every translation — apparently, if you don't know french (I do) you have to read all the translations to get a good idea."</i> — Allen Ginsberg, Letter to David Cope, 25 Jan 1977.
</p>
  
<p>
Fleursdumal.org is dedicated to the French poet Charles Baudelaire (1821 - 1867) and his poems <i>Les Fleurs du mal</i> (Flowers of Evil). The definitive online edition of this masterpiece of French literature, Fleursdumal.org contains every poem of each edition of <i>Les Fleurs du mal,</i> together with multiple English translations.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>It looks like the end of an era for the U.S. dollar.</p>



<p>In his new book “Our Dollar, Your Problem: An Insider’s View of Seven Turbulent Decades of Global Finance, and the Road Ahead,” <a href="https://rogoff.scholars.harvard.edu/">Kenneth Rogoff</a> looks back on the currency’s dominant run in global trade and central bank reserves for a host of other countries. Today, he argues, that lofty status is on the wane.</p>



<p>“My thesis is that the U.S. dollar is about to get knocked down a couple pegs,” said Rogoff, a professor of economics and the Maurits C. Boas Chair of International Economics. “It will still be first in global finance, because nothing is poised to fully replace it. The dollar just won’t be as unique as it once was.”</p>



<p>Written entirely before the 2024 election, the book weaves first-person reflections with a history of the U.S. economy and its currency topping a succession of challengers. As a teen chess pro in the late 1960s and early ’70s, Rogoff traveled to tournaments in the Eastern Bloc provided him with rare insight on America’s Communist rivals. As a visiting scholar at the Bank of Japan in 1991, he glimpsed a booming economy on the precipice of disaster. He went on to serve as chief economist at the International Monetary Fund in the early ’00s, the nascent days of Europe’s common currency.</p>



<p>“The book is not a memoir,” Rogoff said. “But I do link in anecdotes from my experiences with world leaders, policymakers, former students, and chess players.”</p>



<p>The Gazette met up with Rogoff in his office for a preview of the book’s personal tales and macroeconomic prophesy. The interview was edited for length and clarity.</p>

<hr>



<p><strong>This release feels extraordinarily well-timed, given the recent sell-off of U.S. Treasuries and the dollar’s decline following President Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement. What events compelled you to revisit the dollar’s incredible rise and offer predictions for its future?</strong></p>



<p>It wasn’t a single event. Based on my research, I thought the dollar peaked in its global footprint in 2015 and was in gentle decline. But I also thought this trend might accelerate. I was particularly concerned with our fiscal deficit and rising interest rates. I recently <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w33079">published a paper</a> showing that if you look at the long history of interest rates, they tend to revert to trend.</p>



<p>I was also <a href="https://rogoff.scholars.harvard.edu/publications/beginning-end-central-bank-independence">very concerned</a> about the Federal Reserve losing independence. I actually wrote the <a href="https://rogoff.scholars.harvard.edu/publications/optimal-degree-commitment-intermediate-monetary-target">first paper</a> on the importance of central bank independence almost 45 years ago; it’s maybe my most famous paper. But in recent years, I started noticing rhetoric on both the left and the right about reining that in. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell wouldn’t get pushed aside out of the blue. It would take another crisis. During wartime, for example, central banks are commonly made subservient to the government.</p>



<p><strong>That covers some of the internal pressures on dollar dominance. What about external factors?</strong></p>



<p>We’ve been able to use economic sanctions in place of military intervention. It saves us lives; it saves us money. But dollar dominance also gives us access to financial data that no other country has. If you were to go to the CIA today, you would see somebody on a laptop instead of somebody like James Bond.</p>



<p>So there’s quite an appetite, particularly in Asia, to reduce the dollar’s grip. China couldn’t help but notice when the U.S. placed economic sanctions on Russia following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. China, of course, has designs on Taiwan.</p>



<p><strong>For most of us in the U.S., our currency’s almighty position isn’t exactly top of mind. Can you illustrate how dollar dominance impacts daily life for everyday Americans?</strong></p>



<p>For one thing, we’re all paying lower interest rates. It’s not a huge amount. You don’t like paying 6 percent on your mortgage, but you’d dislike it even more if you were paying 7 percent. And for the national government, which owes $36 trillion, every additional 1 percent is $360 billion.</p>



<p>Another thing is that, in times of crisis like the pandemic or the global financial crisis of 2008, the U.S. has been able to borrow promiscuously. Interest rates do rise as our debt rises, but the effect is very gentle compared with the U.K. or France. If this privilege is lost, we will notice it.</p>

<p><strong>Tell me about the book’s title.</strong></p>



<p>The U.S. dollar used to be as good as gold. If you were a foreign country holding the equivalent to what is today hundreds of billions of dollars, as many Asian central banks do now, you could just take them to the U.S., and we would give you gold. But then President Richard Nixon decided, in 1971, that we weren’t going to do that anymore.</p>



<p>Leaders from around the world were in a state of shock. As a global financial incident, it was just as dramatic as the introduction of President Trump’s tariffs earlier this year. Nixon sent Treasury Secretary John Connally to meet with these leaders in Rome. They asked, “What do we do? Now that you’re not on gold, you can just inflate this stuff, and we’re stuck with it.” And Connally replied, “Well, it’s our dollar, but it’s your problem.”</p>



<p><strong>What do Connally’s words call to mind for you today?</strong></p>



<p>Connally’s remark captures the arrogance of American leaders that foreign leaders so often feel. I feel our role in the world comes with responsibility, and we should recognize that.</p>



<p>The book’s title is also ironic. After we went off gold, we lost a kind of price anchor. Nixon started beating up on Federal Reserve Chairman Arthur Burns as brutally as Trump beats up on Powell today. It just wasn’t in public; he was doing it in the Oval Office. We only know about it now because of the Watergate tapes. Burns got pressured into printing a lot of money. The result was the worst inflation the U.S. had seen since in a long while. So although Connally was saying “It’s your problem,” the resulting inflation proved a disaster for the U.S., too.</p>



<p><strong>Other economies have emerged as challengers to U.S. power over the years. But you open the book with a surprising example, at least for those who came of age after the Cold War. You start with the post-World War II rise of the Soviet Union. Can you talk about that choice?</strong></p>



<p>By the ’80s, it was becoming clear that the Russian ruble would not outpace the dollar. But in the ’60s and ’70s, we had no idea. I write about the different professors I met as an undergraduate at Yale, as well as textbooks by leading economists such as Paul Samuelson. Samuelson was convinced the Soviet economy would catch up to the U.S. The greatest economic historian of that era was Angus Maddison. He didn’t think the Soviet Union would catch up, but he thought it would do pretty well. These economists were not Marxists!</p>



<p>Later on, we didn’t know Japan would falter. We didn’t know Europe would fizzle. We never imagined the heights the U.S. dollar ultimately reached. My book hits these themes again and again.</p>



<p><strong>How did your experiences as a globe-hopping teen chess master shape your views on the subject?</strong></p>



<p>My professors at Yale talked about how great the Soviet Union was doing. But I had lived on my own abroad, primarily in the former Yugoslavia. I had visited some of my chess-player friends in their homes. Chess was a very big deal in the Communist bloc, so these players had privileged lives and nicer dwellings than the typical resident. But these nice dwellings consisted of little cement blocks in these humorless buildings. They barely had modern plumbing by U.S. standards. It made me very skeptical about Samuelson’s claim.</p>



<p><strong>You write in this book that era of dollar dominance is in “late middle-age, but still in good health.” Is that still true in light of Trump’s second-term trade war?</strong></p>



<p>Well, the dollar is starting to experience more serious health issues under Trump. When you’re an academic, the goal is never to write a book that’s true tomorrow. After coming to Harvard in 1999, I went for a walk across campus with former Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2008/04/jeremy-r-knowles/">Jeremy Knowles</a>. I’ll never forget what he told me. He said, “The perfect paper is one that everybody thinks is wrong, but in five or 10 years it’s proven right.”</p>



<p><strong>You’ve achieved that in the past.</strong></p>



<p>Carmen Reinhart and I were ridiculed in early 2009 when we presented <a href="https://rogoff.scholars.harvard.edu/publications/aftermath-financial-crises">a paper</a> showing that recoveries from financial crises tend to be much slower and weaker than conventional recoveries. Of course that is exactly what happened. I had a similar experience in 2020 when <a href="https://rogoff.scholars.harvard.edu/sites/g/files/omnuum5901/files/rogoff/files/nber_27697_peak_china_housing_1.pdf">my work suggested</a> a deep problem in Chinese real estate.</p>



<p>My new book also contains some out-of-consensus forecasts that I believe will ultimately prove correct — on interest rates, inflation, and the role of the dollar. I don’t argue that dollar dominance will fall sharply tomorrow. But Trump has been an accelerant. He has been a catalyst. Parts of the world were already moving away from the dollar. Now they’re moving much faster.</p>	<!-- wp:harvard-gazette/share -->

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                            
                            <p>Raw identifiers, backtraces, task naming, and more.</p>
                        </div><div>
                            <p>Brace yourselves, folks: Swift 6.2 contains another gigantic collection of additions and improvements to the language, while also adding some important refinements to Swift concurrency that ought to make it much easier to adopt everywhere.</p>
<p>Many changes are small, such as the addition of raw identifiers, default values in string interpolation, or <code>enumerated()</code> conforming to <code>Collection</code>, but these are all likely to spread quickly across projects because they are just so darned <em>useful</em>.</p>
<p>It's also great to see Swift Testing going from strength to strength, with three major improvements coming in Swift 6.2, including exit tests and attachments.</p>
<p>In short, it feels like Swift 6.2 is delivering what many imagined Swift 6.0 would be – increasingly rounded support for concurrency, backed up by a number of pragmatic choices that help smooth out the language's learning curve.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> At the time of writing, Swift 6.2 is available only as a test release from <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.swift.org/install/macos/">Swift.org</a>. The list below represents my best guess for what's coming up –&nbsp;don't be surprised if something slips to a later or release or something else arrives by surprise!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sponsor">Sponsor Hacking with Swift and reach the world's largest Swift community!</a></p>
<h3>Control default actor isolation inference</h3>
<p><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0466-control-default-actor-isolation.md">SE-0466</a> introduces the ability for code to opt into running on a single actor by default –&nbsp;to effectively go back to being a single-threaded program, where most code runs on the main actor until you say otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Yes, this is exactly as good as you're thinking:</strong> with one single change many app developers can more or less avoid thinking about Swift concurrency until they are ready to do so, because unless they say otherwise all their types and functions will behave as if it were annotated with <code>@MainActor</code>.</p>
<p>To enable this new feature, add <code>-default-isolation MainActor</code> to your compiler flags, and code like this becomes valid:</p>
<pre><code>@MainActor
class DataController {
    func load() { }
    func save() { }
}

struct App {
    let controller = DataController()

    init() {
        controller.load()
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the <code>App</code> struct creates and uses a main actor-isolated type without itself being marked <code>@MainActor</code>, but that's okay because it's automatically applied for us –&nbsp;we could even remove the lone <code>@MainActor</code> annotation and it would still apply.</p>
<p>Before you start panicking that this is going to cause all sorts of concurrency problems, there are five important things you know.</p>
<p>First, this new configuration option is applied on a <em>per-module basis</em>, so if you bring in external modules they can still run on other actors. This ought to allow UI-focused modules to switch to running on the main actor by default, while letting background-focused modules operate with concurrency as before.</p>
<p>Second, you can still use things like networking in your apps just fine –&nbsp;code such as <code>URLSession.shared.data(from:)</code> will run on its own task rather than blocking your code.</p>
<p>Third, a single CPU core in a modern iPhone runs at over 4GHz, so a huge number of iOS apps can get all their work done serially without a second thought.</p>
<p>Fourth, a lot of developers were already using "make it all @MainActor" as their default approach to concurrency, changing only when needed.</p>
<p>Fifth and perhaps most importantly, this change along with others form part of a larger <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/visions/approachable-concurrency.md">Improving the approachability of data-race safety</a> vision document published by the Swift team – it's not just one change in isolation, but instead part of a cohesive package of improvements to reduce the learning curve for concurrency.</p>
<p>So, although this change might seem antithetical to all the Swift concurrency work that has taken place from Swift 5.5 and on, ultimately it solves a significant problem that was only growing: Swift concurrency is not easy to learn, and many apps simply don't need it.</p>
<p>Of course, the real question is whether Apple will enable this feature by default for new app projects in Xcode. I sincerely hope so, because it would also allow Xcode to default to the Swift 6 language version without introducing errors and warnings that many developers just don't need to think about.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Another Swift Evolution proposal, <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0478-default-isolation-typealias.md">SE-0478</a>, is currently being discussed, and if it is approved would allow us to declare the default actor isolation on a per-file basis using syntax like <code>private typealias DefaultIsolation = MainActor</code>. The feedback so far has been broadly negative, so it might be returned for revision.</p>
<h3>Raw identifiers</h3>
<p><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0451-escaped-identifiers.md">SE-0451</a> dramatically expands the range of characters we can use to create identifiers – the names of variables, functions, enum cases and similar –&nbsp;so we can name them pretty much however we want when placed inside backticks.</p>
<p>So, this kind of code is legal in Swift 6.2 and later:</p>
<pre><code>func `function name with spaces`() {
    print("Hello, world!")
}

`function name with spaces`()</code></pre>
<p>If you're wondering why such naming might be useful, consider this:</p>
<pre><code>enum HTTPError: String {
    case `401` = "Unauthorized"
    case `404` = "Not Found"
    case `500` = "Internal Server Error"
    case `502` = "Bad Gateway"
}</code></pre>
<p>That makes each HTTP error code a case in our enum, which would previously need to be written as something else such as <code>case _401</code> or <code>case error401</code>.</p>
<p>If you're using numbers like this, you either need to qualify the type each time you use it, to avoid Swift getting confused, or you need to place the backticks carefully.</p>
<p>For example, in the code below we use <code>HTTPError</code> each time, to avoid Swift thinking <code>401</code> refers to a malformed floating-point literal:</p>
<pre><code>let error = HTTPError.401

switch error {
case HTTPError.401, HTTPError.404:
    print("Client error: \(error.rawValue)")
default:
    print("Server error: \(error.rawValue)")
}</code></pre>
<p>The alternative is to wrap the numbers themselves in the backticks –&nbsp;<em>not</em> including the dot beforehand – like this:</p>
<pre><code>switch error {
case .`401`, .`404`:
    print("Client error: \(error.rawValue)")
default:
    print("Server error: \(error.rawValue)")
}</code></pre>
<p>The biggest benefactor of this change is likely to be Swift Testing, where test names can now directly be written in a human-readable form rather than using camel case and adding an extra string description above.</p>
<p>So, rather than writing this:</p>
<pre><code>import Testing

@Test("Strip HTML tags from string")
func stripHTMLTagsFromString() {
    // test code
}</code></pre>
<p>We can instead write this:</p>
<pre><code>@Test
func `Strip HTML tags from string`() {
    // test code
}</code></pre>
<p>It's less duplication, which is always welcome.</p>
<p>One small detail that might catch you out is this: "A raw identifier may start with, contain, or end with operator characters, but it may not contain only operator characters." So, you can put operators such as <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> into your identifier names, but only if they aren't the only things in there.</p>
<h3>Default Value in String Interpolations</h3>
<p><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0477-default-interpolation-values.md">SE-0477</a> makes a small but beautiful change to string interpolation with optionals, allowing us to provide an additional <code>default</code> value to use if the optional is nil.</p>
<p>In its simplest form this means we would write the following code:</p>
<pre><code>var name: String? = nil
print("Hello, \(name, default: "Anonymous")!")</code></pre>
<p>Instead of this:</p>
<pre><code>print("Hello, \(name ?? "Anonymous")!")</code></pre>
<p>At first glance this might not seem like a great improvement, but the kicker is that nil coalescing doesn't work with different types. So, this kind of code is allowed:</p>
<pre><code>var age: Int? = nil
print("Age: \(age ?? 0)")</code></pre>
<p>But this kind of code will not compile when uncommented:</p>
<pre><code>// print("Age: \(age ?? "Unknown")")</code></pre>
<p>That attempts to mix an optional integer with a string default value, which isn't allowed. Fortunately this <em>is</em> possible from Swift 6.2 onwards:</p>
<pre><code>print("Age: \(age, default: "Unknown")")</code></pre>
<h3>Add Collection conformances for enumerated()</h3>
<p><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0459-enumerated-collection.md">SE-0459</a> makes the type returned by <code>enumerated()</code> conform to <code>Collection</code>.</p>
<p>The most immediate benefit of this is that it's now much easier to use <code>enumerated()</code> with a SwiftUI <code>List</code> or <code>ForEach</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code>import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var names = ["Bernard", "Laverne", "Hoagie"]

    var body: some View {
        List(names.enumerated(), id: \.offset) { values in
            Text("User \(values.offset + 1): \(values.element)")
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>The <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0459-enumerated-collection.md">proposal</a> also mentions various performance benefits, including making <code>(1000..&lt;2000).enumerated().dropFirst(500)</code> a constant-time operation.</p>
<h3>Method and Initializer Key Paths</h3>
<p><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0479-method-and-initializer-keypaths.md">SE-0479</a> extends Swift's key paths to support methods alongside the existing support for properties and subscripts, which, along with <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0438-metatype-keypath.md">SE-0438</a> introduced in Swift 6.1, promises to round out what key paths can do.</p>
<p>Code to access properties has always worked just fine with key paths:</p>
<pre><code>let strings = ["Hello", "world"]
let capitalized = strings.map(\.capitalized)
print(capitalized)</code></pre>
<p>With this change we can now access methods too, but be sure to actually <em>invoke</em> the method like this:</p>
<pre><code>let uppercased = strings.map(\.uppercased())
print(uppercased)</code></pre>
<p>If you <em>don't</em> invoke the method then you get back an uninvoked function that you can call later on like this:</p>
<pre><code>let functions = strings.map(\.uppercased)
print(functions)

for function in functions {
    print(function())
}</code></pre>
<p>In that code, the <code>functions</code> constant contains an array of calls to <code>uppercased()</code> on each string we passed in – <code>functions[0]</code> would be a reference to <code>"HELLO".uppercased()</code>, which we could call directly using <code>functions[0]()</code>.</p>
<p>If two methods have the same name, you can add their argument labels to clarify which overload you mean, like this:</p>
<pre><code>let prefixUpTo = \Array&lt;String&gt;.prefix(upTo:)
let prefixThrough = \Array&lt;String&gt;.prefix(through:)</code></pre>
<p>However, you <em>can't</em> make key paths to methods that are marked either <code>async</code> or <code>throws</code>; it's just not supported.</p>
<h3>Opt-in Strict Memory Safety Checking</h3>
<p><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0458-strict-memory-safety.md">SE-0458</a> introduces opt-in support for flagging unsafe Swift code as warnings unless specifically desired, which will make it significantly easier to audit unsafe code usage.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> To be clear, <em>unsafe</em> code is not the same as <em>crashing</em> code – things like force unwraps or reading index -1 in an array will both crash your code but are considered safe because that's expected behavior. <em>Unsafe</em> code is code where you bypass Swift's guardrails to poke around in memory in such a way to cause undefined behavior, and usually if not always includes the word "unsafe" somewhere in the name, e.g. <code>UnsafeRawPointer</code> or <code>unsafelyUnwrapped</code>.</p>
<p>Strict memory safety checking introduces new <code>@safe</code> and <code>@unsafe</code> attributes that mark code as safe or unsafe to use respectively, with <code>@safe</code> being the default –&nbsp;it's only required when you need to override <code>@unsafe</code> in specific circumstances.</p>
<p>When strict memory safety is enabled, and code marked <code>@unsafe</code> must be called with a new <code>unsafe</code> keyword, like this:</p>
<pre><code>let name: String?
unsafe print(name.unsafelyUnwrapped)</code></pre>
<p>Failing to use <code>unsafe</code> will throw up a warning, so you can either adjust the code to use a safe variant or add the <code>unsafe</code> key to acknowledge that the code is unsafe.</p>
<p>This is very similar to the way both <code>try</code> and <code>await</code> work –&nbsp;the compiler knows that certain code will throw, that certain other code is asynchronous, or that certain other code is marked <code>@unsafe</code>, so really these keywords are acknowledgements for other people to see.</p>
<h3>Swift Backtrace API</h3>
<p><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0419-backtrace-api.md">SE-0419</a> introduces a new <code>Backtrace</code> struct, which is capable of capturing data about the call stack of our app at any given moment –&nbsp;the exact sequence of function calls leading up to the current point.</p>
<p>By default backtraces are not symbolicated, which means they won't include the names of each function in the call stack, but you can use <code>symbolicated()</code> to get that extra data.</p>
<p>So, as an example we could write a small chain of functions where the last one prints a backtrace:</p>
<pre><code>import Runtime

func functionA() {
    functionB()
}

func functionB() {
    functionC()
}

func functionC() {
    if let frames = try? Backtrace.capture().symbolicated()?.frames {
        print(frames)
    } else {
        print("Failed to get backtrace.")
    }
}

functionA()</code></pre>
<p>That will print exactly which functions were on the call stack – <code>functionC()</code>, <code>functionB()</code>, and <code>functionA()</code> – along with the files and line numbers of each call, which is really helpful for debugging.</p>
<h3>weak let</h3>
<p><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0481-weak-let.md">SE-0481</a> introduces the ability to use <code>weak let</code> when declaring properties of a type, complementing the existing support for <code>weak var</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> <code>weak let</code> means that a property cannot be changed after creation, but it can still be <em>destroyed</em>, so you need to use it carefully.</p>
<p>As an example, we could create two classes like this:</p>
<pre><code>final class User: Sendable {
    let id = UUID()
}

final class Session: Sendable {
    weak let user: User?

    init(user: User?) {
        self.user = user
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>We could then make and use them like so:</p>
<pre><code>var user: User? = User()
let session = Session(user: user)
print(session.user?.id ?? "No ID")</code></pre>
<p>Because the <code>user</code> property a <code>weak</code> reference to a class, we can destroy the original and have the property be destroyed too. So, this will print "No ID":</p>
<pre><code>user = nil
print(session.user?.id ?? "No ID")</code></pre>
<p>What we <em>can't</em> do is <em>reassign</em> the <code>user</code> property, which means both of these two would fail to compile if uncommented:</p>
<pre><code>// session.user? = User()
// session.user = nil</code></pre>
<p>Another big advantage of <code>weak let</code> can also be seen in the code above: we can mark both those classes as conforming to <code>Sendable</code>, which would not have been possible using <code>weak var</code>.</p>
<h3>Transactional Observation of Values</h3>
<p><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0475-observed.md">SE-0475</a> creates a new <code>Observations</code> struct that is created with a closure, and provides an <code>AsyncSequence</code> that emits new values whenever any any <code>@Observable</code> data changes – it effectively gives us the same power to monitor changes that SwiftUI gets, just in a free-form way.</p>
<p>As an example, we could make a trivial <code>@Observable</code> class for a player with a score:</p>
<pre><code>@Observable
class Player {
    var score = 0
}

let player1 = Player()</code></pre>
<p>We can ask to be notified when that score changes using <code>Observations</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code>let playerScores = Observations { player1.score }</code></pre>
<p>In that code, <code>playerScores</code> is an instance of <code>Observations&lt;Int, Never&gt;</code>, meaning that it emits integers and will never throw errors.</p>
<p>We can then queue up a bunch of example changes, and watch for those happening with a <code>for await</code> loop:</p>
<pre><code>for i in 1...5 {
    Task {
        try? await Task.sleep(for: .seconds(i))
        player1.score += 1
    }
}

for await score in playerScores {
    print(score)
} </code></pre>
<p>That will print six values in total: the initial score, plus increments through 5.</p>
<p>There are a handful of important usage notes you should be aware of when using <code>Observations</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>It will emit the initial value as well as all future values.</li>
<li>If multiple changes come in at the same time, they might be coalesced into a single value being emitted. For example, if our <code>Task</code> code incremented <code>score</code> twice, the values emitted would go up in 2s.</li>
<li>The <code>AsyncSequence</code> of values being emitted can potentially run forever, so you should put it on a separate task or otherwise handle it carefully.</li>
<li>If you want iteration to stop – to end the loop – you should make the value being observed optional, then set it to nil.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Global-actor isolated conformances</h3>
<p><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0470-isolated-conformances.md">SE-0470</a> resolves a small but important concurrency problem by making it possible to restrict a protocol conformance to a specific global actor.</p>
<p>For example, we can now say "this <code>@MainActor</code>-restricted type conforms to <code>Equatable</code> only when it's being used on the main actor, like this:</p>
<pre><code>@MainActor
class User: @MainActor Equatable {
    var id: UUID
    var name: String

    init(name: String) {
        self.id = UUID()
        self.name = name
    }

    static func ==(lhs: User, rhs: User) -&gt; Bool {
        lhs.id == rhs.id
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Notice the use of <code>@MainActor Equatable</code> –&nbsp;if we had tried to conform without using <code>@MainActor</code> on the protocol, Swift would be free to run the <code>==</code> method on any task, including in the background, which is explicitly disallowed thanks to the whole type being marked <code>@MainActor</code>. As a result, our code would not build.</p>
<h3>Starting tasks synchronously from caller context</h3>
<p><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0472-task-start-synchronously-on-caller-context.md">SE-0472</a> introduces a new way to create tasks so they start immediately if possible, rather than the existing behavior that only allows tasks to be queued to run at the next opportunity.</p>
<p>You can see the difference with code like this:</p>
<pre><code>print("Starting")

Task {
    print("In Task")
}

Task.immediate {
    print("In Immediate Task")
}

print("Done")
try await Task.sleep(for: .seconds(0.1))</code></pre>
<p>That creates two unstructured tasks: a regular unstructured task followed by an immediate unstructured task. When it runs, it will print Starting, In Immediate Task, Done, and then finally In Task.</p>
<p>To really understand the distinction between immediate tasks and regular tasks, remember that all potential suspension points in Swift must be marked with <code>await</code>. Creating a regular, non-immediate task doesn't use <code>await</code> because it doesn't mark a suspension point, but it <em>doesn't</em> run immediately because it gets queued up to run at the next available opportunity.</p>
<p>The new ability to create <em>immediate</em> tasks unlocks important new functionality: the code in an immediate task starts executing immediately if it's already on the target executor, perhaps providing important data that a UI control is waiting for, but after that initial immediate response the task can then use <code>await</code> like a regular task and potentially trigger suspension as normal. So, everything in an immediate tasks runs straight away until the first suspension point is reached.</p>
<p>Both <code>Task</code> and <code>Task.immediate</code> are <em>unstructured</em> tasks, however task groups have also been upgraded to support immediate child tasks with <code>addImmediateTask()</code> and <code>addImmediateTaskUnlessCancelled()</code>.</p>
<h3>Run nonisolated async functions on the caller's actor by default</h3>
<p><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0461-async-function-isolation.md">SE-0461</a> adjusts the way nonisolated async functions are called so that they run on the same actor as their caller. This sounds like a really abstract change, but it is important so I would recommend you spend the time to understand what's changing and why.</p>
<p>As an example, here's a simple struct that knows how to download and decode an array of <code>Double</code> values that represents various temperatures:</p>
<pre><code>struct Measurements {
    func fetchLatest() async throws -&gt; [Double] {
        let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/readings.json")!
        let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
        return try JSONDecoder().decode([Double].self, from: data)
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>That isn't isolated to any particular actor, so it can run its code anywhere.</p>
<p>Next, we could use that with another struct called <code>WeatherStation</code>, which will download all the readings and return their mean average. This time, though we'll mark the struct as being isolated to the main actor:</p>
<pre><code>@MainActor
struct WeatherStation {
    let measurements = Measurements()

    func getAverageTemperature() async throws -&gt; Double {
        let readings = try await measurements.fetchLatest()
        let average = readings.reduce(0, +) / Double(readings.count)
        return average
    }
}

let station = WeatherStation()
try await print(station.getAverageTemperature())</code></pre>
<p>So, we have one struct that is nonisolated, and another that <em>is</em> isolated, and this demonstrates the change perfectly: before Swift 6.2 the call to <code>measurements.fetchLatest()</code> will not run on the main actor, but from Swift 6.2 and later it <em>will</em>.</p>
<p>The old behavior caused some confusion, not least because <code>measurements</code> is a main actor-isolated property in <code>WeatherStation</code>, and the call to <code>measurements.fetchLatest()</code> takes place in the main actor-isolated <code>getAverageTemperature()</code> method.</p>
<p>That old behavior wasn't an accident – <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0338-clarify-execution-non-actor-async.md">SE-0338</a> from Swift 5.7 specifically states that async functions that aren't isolated to a particular actor "do not run on any actor's executor."</p>
<p>The new behavior introduced by SE-0461 means that nonisolated async functions will now run on the same actor as their caller unless you say otherwise. In the code above, that means the call to <code>measurements.fetchLatest()</code> will run on the main actor because <code>getAverageTemperature()</code> does.</p>
<p>If you want the old behavior to return –&nbsp;if you wanted <code>fetchLatest()</code> to switch away from the caller's actor automatically – you would need to mark it with the new <code>@concurrent</code> attribute, like this: <code>@concurrent func fetchLatest()…</code>.</p>
<h3>Isolated synchronous deinit</h3>
<p><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0371-isolated-synchronous-deinit.md">SE-0371</a> introduces the ability to mark the deinitializers of actor-isolated classes as being isolated, which allows them to safely access data elsewhere in the class.</p>
<p>For example, this class is isolated to the main actor, and I've marked its <code>deinit</code> as being isolated so that it can safely call <code>cleanUp()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>@MainActor
class DataController {
    func cleanUp() {
        // free up memory
    }

    isolated deinit {
        cleanUp()
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Without that <code>isolated</code> keyword in there, the deinitializer wouldn't be isolated to the main actor –&nbsp;that's just not how global actors work. <em>With</em> it there, your code will move to the actor's executor before running the code, so it's all safe.</p>
<p>This will be particularly useful for times when your deinitializer needs to access non-<code>Sendable</code> state belonging to a class. For example, we might have a <code>User</code> class like this one:</p>
<pre><code>class User {
    var isLoggedIn = false
}</code></pre>
<p>We can then wrap that in a <code>Session</code> class that runs on the main actor, which automatically marks the user being logged in or out as the session is created and destroyed:</p>
<pre><code>@MainActor
class Session {
    let user: User

    init(user: User) {
        self.user = user
        user.isLoggedIn = true
    }

    isolated deinit {
        user.isLoggedIn = false
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Again, that <code>isolated</code> keyword is required to make the code work – without that the deinitializer would run without being isolated to the main actor, but it would try to access the <code>user</code> property that <em>is</em> isolated to the main actor, causing a compile error.</p>
<h3>Task Priority Escalation APIs</h3>
<p><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0462-task-priority-escalation-apis.md">SE-0462</a> introduces the ability for tasks to detect when their priority has been escalated, and also for us to manually escalate task priority if needed.</p>
<p>To watch for priority escalation, use the <code>withTaskPriorityEscalationHandler()</code> function like this:</p>
<pre><code>let newsFetcher = Task(priority: .medium) {
    try await withTaskPriorityEscalationHandler {
        let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/messages.json")!
        let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
        return data
    } onPriorityEscalated: { oldPriority, newPriority in
        print("Priority has been escalated to \(newPriority)")
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, that gives us both the old and new task priorities, and it's up to us to respond to the change however we want. If you want to use that opportunity to escalate the priority of other tasks, you should use the new <code>escalatePriority(to:)</code> method like this:</p>
<pre><code>newsFetcher.escalatePriority(to: .high)</code></pre>
<p>Because there are several task priorities available to us, it's possible your <code>onPriorityEscalated</code> code will be triggered multiple times –&nbsp;your priority might start at low then move to medium, then move to high, for example. However, task priority can only ever be <em>raised</em>, never lowered.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Task priority escalation usually happens automatically, such as when a high-priority task finds itself waiting on the result of a low-priority task – Swift will automatically raise the priority of the low-priority task so it’s able to complete faster. Although this API gives us extra control, it's still best to let priority escalation happen automatically where possible.</p>
<h3>Task Naming</h3>
<p><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0469-task-names.md">SE-0469</a> introduces a useful change to the way we create tasks and child tasks: we can now give them <em>names</em>, which is ideal for debugging when one particular task goes rogue.</p>
<p>The API here is simple: when using <code>Task.init()</code> and <code>Task.detached()</code> to create new tasks, or using <code>addTask()</code> and <code>addTaskUnlessCancelled()</code> to create child tasks in a task group, you can now pass an optional <code>name</code> parameter string to identify the task uniquely. These name strings can be hard-coded or use string interpolation; either one works.</p>
<p>In its simplest form, the new API looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>let task = Task(name: "MyTask") {
    print("Current task name: \(Task.name ?? "Unknown")")
}</code></pre>
<p>To show you a more real-world example, we might have a <code>NewsStory</code> struct that knows how to load some basic information about a news article:</p>
<pre><code>struct NewsStory: Decodable, Identifiable {
    let id: Int
    let title: String
    let strap: String
    let url: URL
}</code></pre>
<p>Now we could use a task group to fetch several news story sources and combine them into a single array, while also printing a log message if any child task hits a problem:</p>
<pre><code>let stories = await withTaskGroup { group in
    for i in 1...5 {
        // Give each child task a unique name
        // for easier identification.
        group.addTask(name: "Stories \(i)") {
            do {
                let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/news-\(i).json")!
                let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
                return try JSONDecoder().decode([NewsStory].self, from: data)
            } catch {
                // This child failed – print a log
                // message with its name then return
                // an empty array.
                print("Loading \(Task.name ?? "Unknown") failed.")
                return []
            }
        }
    }

    var allStories = [NewsStory]()

    for await stories in group {
        allStories.append(contentsOf: stories)
    }

    return allStories.sorted { $0.id &gt; $1.id }
}

print(stories)</code></pre>
<h3>InlineArray, a fixed-size array</h3>
<p><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0453-vector.md">SE-0453</a> introduces a new array type called <code>InlineArray</code> that stores an exact number of elements, combining the fixed-size nature of tuples with the natural subscripting of arrays, while adding in some welcome performance improvements at the same time.</p>
<p>Creating an <code>InlineArray</code> can be done with an explicit size or type, or you can let type inference figure out both by the usage. This is made possible by a separate Swift 6.2 improvement, <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0452-integer-generic-parameters.md">SE-0452</a>, which adds integer generic parameters.</p>
<p>So, we can create an inline array of names by specifying both the size and element type:</p>
<pre><code>var names1: InlineArray&lt;4, String&gt; = ["Moon", "Mercury", "Mars", "Tuxedo Mask"]</code></pre>
<p>Or you can let Swift figure it out by passing in exactly four strings:</p>
<pre><code>var names2: InlineArray = ["Moon", "Mercury", "Mars", "Tuxedo Mask"]</code></pre>
<p>Either way, these arrays are fixed in size, so they don't have <code>append()</code> or remove(at:)` methods. However, you <em>can</em> still read and write values at a specific index, like this:</p>
<pre><code>names1[2] = "Jupiter"</code></pre>
<p><code>InlineArray</code> does <em>not</em> conform to either <code>Sequence</code> or <code>Collection</code>, so if you want to loop over their values you should use the <code>indices</code> property along with subscripting like this:</p>
<pre><code>for i in names1.indices {
    print("Hello, \(names1[i])!")
}</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Another Swift Evolution proposal, <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0483-inline-array-sugar.md">SE-0483</a>, is currently being discussed, and if it is approved would add an <code>InlineArray</code> literal syntax in the style <code>var names: [5 x String] = .init(repeating: "Anonymous")</code> to mean "exactly five strings in this array." The feedback so far has been broadly negative, so it might be returned for revision.</p>
<h3>Regex lookbehind assertions</h3>
<p><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0448-regex-lookbehind-assertions.md">SE-0448</a> expands Swift's regular expression support to include <em>lookbehind assertions</em>, which allow us to check if a specific pattern appears immediately before the current position in the string, <em>without</em> including it in the matched text.</p>
<p>For example, we might want to match all prices inside a string by looking for any numbers that come after a dollar sign, <em>without</em> matching the dollar sign itself:</p>
<pre><code>let string = "Buying a jacket costs $100, and buying shoes costs $59.99."
let regex = /(?&lt;=\$)\d+(?:\.\d{2})?/

for match in string.matches(of: regex) {
    print(match.output)
}</code></pre>
<p>Swift's regular expression system is remarkably powerful, and it's great to see it continue to evolve. Maybe <code>?R</code> recursion will come next…</p>
<h3>Swift Testing: Exit Tests</h3>
<p><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/testing/0008-exit-tests.md">ST-0008</a> introduces a testing feature that has been in demand for as long as I can remember: the ability to test code that results in a critical failure that terminated the app.</p>
<p>For example, code like this is going to fail <em>hard</em> if we call it with a <code>sides</code> value of 0:</p>
<pre><code>struct Dice {
    func roll(sides: Int) -&gt; Int {
        precondition(sides &gt; 0)
        return Int.random(in: 1...sides)
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Running <code>roll(sides: 0)</code> will literally crash the app, which in turn will cause tests to collapse around it. </p>
<p>From Swift 6.2 and later we can use <code>#expect(processExitsWith:)</code> to look for and catch such critical failures, allowing us to check they happened rather than causing our test run to fail.</p>
<p>Here's how it looks in code:</p>
<pre><code>@Test func invalidDiceRollsFail() async throws {
    let dice = Dice()

    await #expect(processExitsWith: .failure) {
        let _ = dice.roll(sides: 0)
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Notice how it must be executed using <code>await</code> – behind the scenes this starts a dedicated process for that test, then suspends the test until that process completes and can be evaluated.</p>
<p>This improvement opens up a range of things that were hard if not impossible to test before, including a range of hacks designed to test things like <code>fatalError()</code> get called at specific times.</p>
<h3>Swift Testing: Attachments</h3>
<p><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/testing/0009-attachments.md">ST-0009</a> adds the ability to add attachments to tests, so that if a test fails you can attach a debug log or generated data files directly to the failing test.</p>
<p>As an example, we could define a simple <code>Character</code> struct such as this one:</p>
<pre><code>import Foundation
import Testing

struct Character: Codable, Attachable {
    var id = UUID()
    var name: String
}</code></pre>
<p>That conforms to the new <code>Attachable</code> protocol, and because it also imports Foundation <em>and</em> conforms to <code>Codable</code>, Swift Testing can automatically encode instances of our struct to be attached to tests.</p>
<p>We can then use that in a trivial function in our production code:</p>
<pre><code>func makeCharacter() -&gt; Character {
    Character(name: "Ram")
}</code></pre>
<p>When it comes to writing a test, we'll make sure the default name matches the value we expect, but we'll also make whatever character we got back from <code>makeCharacter()</code> an attachment with the label "Character":</p>
<pre><code>@Test func defaultCharacterNameIsCorrect() {
    let result = makeCharacter()
    #expect(result.name == "Rem")

    Attachment.record(result, named: "Character")
}</code></pre>
<p>When that test runs, Xcode should in theory automatically surface those attachments for us as part of the test results, although we'll need to wait for an Xcode update in order for that to happen.</p>
<p>Out of the box, Swift Testing provides support for attaching <code>String</code>, <code>Data</code>, and anything that conforms to <code>Encodable</code>. It does <em>not</em> support (at least not in Swift 6.2) attaching images, which is an annoyance –&nbsp;it would be great to attach a SwiftUI image to a failing test, for example.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Unlike the XCTest equivalent, Swift Testing's attachments do not support lifetime controls in Swift 6.2. If this feature gets added in a future release, it would allow us to automatically delete attachments if a test succeeds, which helps keep tests lightweight.</p>
<h3>Swift Testing: Public API to evaluate ConditionTrait</h3>
<p><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/testing/0010-evaluate-condition.md">ST-0010</a> introduces a new <code>evaluate()</code> method to test condition traits, meaning that it's possible to write non-test functions that evaluate the same conditions as test functions.</p>
<p>It's still possible to use condition traits in the <code>@Test</code> macro, like this:</p>
<pre><code>import Testing

struct TestManager {
    static let inSmokeTestMode = true
}

@Test(.disabled(if: TestManager.inSmokeTestMode))
func runLongComplexTest() {
    // test code here
}</code></pre>
<p>In Swift 6.2 and later you can now evaluate those same conditions <em>outside</em> of tests by creating a condition trait then calling its <code>evaluate()</code> method:</p>
<pre><code>func checkForSmokeTest() async throws {
    let trait = ConditionTrait.disabled(if: TestManager.inSmokeTestMode)

    if try await trait.evaluate() {
        print("We're in smoke test mode")
    } else {
        print("Run all tests.")
    }
}</code></pre>
<h3>And there's more!</h3>
<p>If all the above wasn't enough for you, even more changes are likely also be arriving with Swift 6.2, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0446-non-escapable.md">SE-0446</a> introduces non-escapable types that cannot outlive the scope of the function where they are created, so they can't be returned or assigned elsewhere.</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0447-span-access-shared-contiguous-storage.md">SE-0447</a> builds upon the non-escapable types proposal to add a new <code>Span</code> struct designed to make it easier to safely access contiguous memory.</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0457-duration-attosecond-represenation.md">SE-0457</a> upgrades the <code>Duration</code> type to expose the total number of attoseconds (one quintillionth of a second) as an <code>Int128</code>.</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0463-sendable-completion-handlers.md">SE-0463</a> changes the rules for Objective-C imports so that completion handler parameters are considered <code>@Sendable</code> unless otherwise request.</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0473-clock-epochs.md">SE-0473</a> adds properties to <code>SuspendingClock</code> and <code>ContinuousClock</code> to provide the exact start point for those clocks – the time they consider to be zero.</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0474-yielding-accessors.md">SE-0474</a> adds yielding accessors to allow values to be read and written without requiring copies to be made.</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0480-swiftpm-warning-control.md">SE-0480</a> builds on the diagnostic groups work done in Swift 6.1 so that we can set warning and error levels directly inside Swift packages.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's one more I want to mention briefly, and although it's hard to provide meaningful examples that are easy to understand, I still think this proposal deserves an extra mention because it's just so darned clever. It's <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0476-abi-attr.md">SE-0476</a>, which introduces a new <code>@abi</code> attribute that makes it easier for ABI-stable library authors to make changes to their libraries without breaking things. This might be something small such as changing from <code>rethrows</code> to typed throws, or, in the words of the evolution proposal, "to rename an API whose name is felt to be catastrophically confusing."</p>
<p>This change is going to be hugely popular with library authors who made small mistakes they wanted to correct afterwards, <em>without</em> breaking code that relies on old behavior.</p>
<p>So, again Swift 6.2 is another gigantic collection of additions and improvements to the language –&nbsp;new features, yes, but also a range of refinements that will continue to help smooth over adoption of Swift concurrency. </p>
<p>As usual, not all features will apply to every project, but I think certainly at least one or two of these changes will grow to become standard practice, and it might not even be the ones you expect –&nbsp;keep an eye on <code>InlineArray</code>!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Odin is a general-purpose systems programming language authored by Bill “gingerBill” Hall.
Designed as a modern alternative to C, Odin emphasizes simplicity, performance, and readability
without sacrificing control over low-level details.</p>

<p>The website says it’s “data-oriented”, and features such as SOA (structs-of-arrays) and implicit zero initialization tie into that. Despite this focus, the language surprisingly has dynamic
maps and arrays built into the language itself. While the memory is still manually managed,
it’s uncommon to see such built-ins.</p>

<p>This perhaps sets the tone of Odin: it tries to be ergonomic and easy to write by offering a lot out of the box. Odin also comes with “vendor”, containing bindings to a wide variety of popular libraries. This makes the language very easy to get into.</p>

<h2 id="design-philosophy">Design Philosophy</h2>

<p>Odin focuses on practical solutions to real-world programming challenges—in other words, it favours pragmatism over idealism (I’ll return to this when I later discuss Zig). Rather than introducing complex features, Odin focuses on code that is simple and clean to read and reason about. This is the polar opposite of Zig’s embracing of metaprogramming for as much as possible.</p>

<p>Odin also has a fairly old-fashioned view of types. The current trend is to make programming languages increasingly more complex so that they can describe more and more types in the language itself. Odin instead harkens back to older languages where built-in types flourished. Consequently, Odin does not just offer the aforementioned hashmaps and dynamic arrays, but also numerical types
such as complex numbers, vectors, matrices, and even quaternions. This makes up for its rejection of operator overloading by a wide margin. It’s not a coincidence that the flagship app to demonstrate Odin’s capabilities, EmberGen, is a math- and graphics-heavy tool.</p>

<h2 id="a-quick-look-at-the-syntax">A quick look at the syntax</h2>

<p>Odin has a fairly straightforward syntax for a beginner. The fact that there is no excessive nagging about mutability or constness makes things just work as expected.</p>

<p>The declaration is otherwise very inspired by Jai and fairly minimal. Odin’s concession to modern fashion shows up in its removal of the traditional <code>;</code>.</p>

<p>Odin produces code anyone used to C or other low level languages can read at a glance. Here is a short “move the dot around the screen” using Raylib:</p>

<pre><code>package test

import rl "vendor:raylib"

main :: proc() 
{
    rl.InitWindow(1280, 720, "Testing")
    pos : rl.Vector2 = { 640, 320 }
		
    for !rl.WindowShouldClose() {
        rl.BeginDrawing()
        rl.ClearBackground(rl.BLUE)
        rl.DrawRectangleV(pos, {32, 32}, rl.GREEN)
        
        if rl.IsKeyDown(.LEFT) {
            pos.x -= 400 * rl.GetFrameTime()
        }
        if rl.IsKeyDown(.RIGHT) {
            pos.x += 400 * rl.GetFrameTime()
        }
        if rl.IsKeyDown(.UP) {
            pos.y -= 400 * rl.GetFrameTime()
        }
        if rl.IsKeyDown(.DOWN) {
            pos.y += 400 * rl.GetFrameTime()
        }
        rl.EndDrawing()
    }
    rl.CloseWindow()
}
</code></pre>

<p>All in all, Odin’s syntax mostly feels familiar, even with changes to things like function declaration syntax. There are no deep quirks; the changes are superficial.</p>

<p>This conservative streak in Odin is echoed by others. Dale Weiler, at JangaFX, was an early adopter. He wrote on his blog:</p>

<p>All in all, Odin’s syntax mostly feel familiar, even with changes to things like function declaration syntax. There are no deep quirks, the changes are superficial.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Odin is a systems programming language that is more conservative in its design than other newer programming languages such as Rust, Zig, and Carbon. The design ideology around Odin is to provide some greatly needed quality of life improvements over the lingua-franca of systems languages: C, while still staying as simple as C.”</em> <a href="https://graphitemaster.github.io/odin_review/">link</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s clear that Odin has pulled off the trick of feeling familiar even if the syntax is much different from C.</p>

<h2 id="error-handling">Error handling</h2>

<p>Odin’s most controversial choice is probably the error handling, which uses multiple returns in the fashion of Go. And while Odin offers better ergonomics with <code>or_else</code> and <code>or_return</code>, it can feel clunky compared to other solutions.</p>

<p>As far as first impressions go, this choice is probably not ideal. It seems like a common thing to criticize. On the other hand, this conceptual simplicity goes hand in hand with the straightforwardness that is the trademark of Odin’s design.</p>

<h2 id="the-joy-of-programming">The Joy of Programming</h2>

<p>Odin shares the “joy of programming” slogan with Jai, but the appreciation seems to be real. To quote one user:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Odin has renewed my joy of programming. Built-in bounds checking, slices, distinct typing, no undefined behavior, consistent semantics between optimization modes, minimal implicit type conversions, context system, and the standard library tracking allocator combine together to eliminate the majority of memory bugs I found use for sanitizers in C/C++.”</em> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32799499">link</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another user writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>*“[…] moving from C to Odin was quite a pleasant and rather easy experience. The languages are rather similar but Odin takes the painful bits away, letting you to focus on the problem instead of wondering why something is going weirdly wrong again.” <a href="https://akselmo.dev/posts/moving-from-c-to-odin/">link</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just taking the language for a spin, it’s friendly and does what you think. It’s essentially an approachable language that just feels nice to use.</p>

<h2 id="comparisons">Comparisons</h2>

<h3 id="jai">Jai</h3>

<p>Odin and Jai share syntactic similarities, but their approaches differ. Where Jai emphasizes compile-time execution and metaprogramming, offering powerful abstractions, Odin instead focuses
on simplicity and lots of features out of the box.</p>

<p>While on a syntactic level Odin clearly took inspiration from Jai, the two languages have evolved very differently. Jonathan Blow stated in a video that Jai has grown more complex than he planned.</p>

<p>Odin, on the other hand, is clearly a language that feels simple to learn and use.</p>

<h3 id="zig">Zig</h3>

<p>Both Odin and Zig aim to modernize systems programming, but they clearly diverge in philosophy. Zig offers extensive compile-time metaprogramming (although not to the level of Jai), whereas Odin only retains the necessary functionality needed for conditional compilation.</p>

<p>Odin, like Jai, has runtime reflection. Zig’s reflection, on the other hand, is generally limited to compile time. In practice, this means Zig relies on a lot of metaprogramming to do things like serialization through type inspection, whereas in Odin it’s available at runtime, so the code is magnitudes easier to understand.</p>

<p>The biggest difference is its attitude toward the programmer’s experience. Odin tries to be simple and make it fun and pleasant to program in; it has a straightforward, no-fuss syntax.</p>

<p>Zig, on the other hand, cares little about the user experience and prefers verbose explicitness over convenient abstractions.</p>

<p>A developer compared the two:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Zig is very verbose… Odin in comparison is very minimal in terms of typing while communicating basically the same info.”</em> <a href="https://forum.odin-lang.org/t/comparing-zig-with-odin/740/2">link</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="criticisms">Criticisms</h2>

<p>While Odin has been in use by projects for quite a while, the official documentation is still lacking in depth and examples. On top of this, it seems that the primary community platform is Discord, which may not be accessible to all.</p>

<p>There have been people criticizing the lack of more extensive metaprogramming. But with access to type information at runtime and a fairly wide array of built-ins, it is not clear whether this has any merit.</p>

<p>For example, both Zig and Jai offer support for struct-of-arrays through metaprogramming. In Odin, however, this feature is built into the language.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Odin presents a compelling option for developers seeking a modern, efficient, and readable systems programming language. That it is successful in graphics-intensive applications like EmberGen demonstrates its robustness and performance. While it has areas for growth—particularly in documentation and community accessibility—Odin’s pragmatic design and focus on developer experience make it a worthy alternative to C for contemporary systems programming needs.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hey HN, we’re Claire and Christophe from nao Labs (<a href="https://getnao.io/">https://getnao.io/</a>). We just launched nao, an AI code editor to work with data: a local editor, directly connected with your data warehouse, and powered by an AI copilot with built-in context of your data schema and data-specific tools.</p><p>See our demo here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmG6X-5ftZU" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmG6X-5ftZU</a></p><p>Writing code with LLMs is the new normal in software engineering. But not when it comes to manipulating data. Tools like Cursor don’t interact natively with data warehouses — they autocomplete SQL blindly, not knowing your data schema. Most of us are still juggling multiple tools: writing code in Cursor, checking results in the warehouse console, troubleshooting with an observability tool, and verifying in BI tool no dashboard broke.</p><p>When you want to write code on data with LLMs, you don’t care much about the code, you care about the data output. You need a tool that helps you write code relevant for your data, lets you visualize its impact on the output, and quality check it for you.</p><p>Christophe and I have each spent 10 years in data — Christophe was a data engineer and has built data platforms for dozens of orgs, I was head of data and helped data teams building their analytics &amp; data products. We’ve seen how the business asks you to ship data fast, while you’re here wondering if this small line of code will mistakenly multiply the revenue on your CEO dashboard by x5. Which leaves you 2 choices: test extensively and ship slow. Not test and ship fast. That’s why we wanted to create nao: a tool really adapted to our data work, that would allow data teams to ship at business pace.</p><p>nao is a fork of VS Code, with built-in connectors for BigQuery, Snowflake, and Postgres. We built our own AI copilot and tab system, gave them a RAG of your data warehouse schemas and of your codebase. We added a set of agent tools to query data, compare data, understand data tools like dbt, assess the downstream impact of code in your whole data lineage.</p><p>The AI tab and the AI agent write straight away code matching your schema, may it be for SQL, python, yaml. It shows you code diffs and data diffs side by side, to visualize what your change did to the data output. And you can leave the data quality checks to the agent: detect missing or duplicated values, outliers, anticipate breaking changes downstream or compare dev and production data differences.</p><p>Data teams usually use nao for writing SQL pipelines, often with dbt. It helps them create data models, document them, test them, while making sure they’re not breaking data lineage and figures in the BI. In run mode, they also use it to run some analytics, and identify data quality bugs in production. For less technical profiles, it’s also a great help to strengthen their code best practices. For large teams, it ensures that the code &amp; metrics remain well factorized and consistent.</p><p>Software engineers use nao for the database exploration part: write SQL queries with nao tab, explore data schema with the agent, and write DDL.</p><p>Question we often get is: why not just use Cursor and MCPs? Cursor has to trigger many MCP calls to get full context of the data, while nao has it always available in one RAG. MCPs stay in a very enclosed part of Cursor: they don’t bring data context to the tab. And they don’t make the UI more adapted to data workflows. Besides, nao comes as pre-packaged for data teams: they don’t have to set up extensions, install and authenticate in MCPs, build CI/CD pipelines. Which means even non-technical data teams can have a great developer experience.</p><p>Our long-term goal is to become the best place to work with data. We want to fine-tune our own models for SQL, Python and YAML to give the most relevant code suggestions for data. We want to enlarge our comprehension of all data stack tools, to become the only agnostic editor for any of your data workflow.</p><p>You can try it here: <a href="https://sunshine.getnao.io/releases/">https://sunshine.getnao.io/releases/</a> - download nao, sign up for free and start using it. Just for HN Launch, you can create a temporary account with a simple username if you’d prefer not to use your email. For now, we only have Mac version but Linux and Windows are coming.</p><p>We’d love to hear your feedback — and get your thoughts on how we can improve even further the data dev experience!</p></div></td></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Here’s the elephant in the room: Sorbet’s syntax is ugly.</p>
<p>When people start complaining about Sorbet’s syntax, I have to spend a lot of time deflecting or even defending it, which is annoying: I’m right there with you, the syntax is ugly! It’s verbose. It’s foreign. It doesn’t resemble any typed language, <strong>nor</strong> does it complement Ruby’s unique style.</p>
<p>My counter is that when it comes to language design, <strong>semantics</strong>—what the types mean—are easily 10 times more important than <strong>syntax</strong>. This is <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/15-312/phil.html">what I was taught</a>; it’s also <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/sorbet-stripes-type-checker-for-ruby">what I’ve seen</a>. <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/cs/algorithm/1985-naur.pdf">Programming is an act of theory building</a>, and when you sit down to write <em>code</em>, you’re trying to codify how you’re thinking about a problem as much as instructions for the machine. Types become a tool to help get the semantics from your head into the codebase. That’s a lossy process, and types fill a role kind of like “error correcting codes” for brain dumping.</p>
<p>So I try <em>very</em> hard to not get sucked into debates about syntax—in no small part because from where I stand, tons of the people complaining about the syntax <em>also</em> don’t like the semantics, they just don’t know how to say it. And not only do they not like Sorbet’s semantics, they don’t like <strong>statically typed</strong> semantics in the first place! Even if I changed their mind on Sorbet’s syntax, there’s basically no way I’ll change their mind on the idea of static types. So why bother? They’re not prospective Sorbet users no matter what I say.</p>
<p>But in thinking that way, I ignore the cohort of committed, enthusiastic Sorbet users who actually love the semantics but tolerate the syntax.</p>
<p>So that’s who this talk is for: I’m not here to convince you to start liking typing or to start using Sorbet! Instead, I want to lay everything out there, so that the people who are motivated by syntax more than me have a view of problem space and can channel their complaints into action.</p>
<p>We’re going to cover a lot of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The historical context at Stripe that gave rise to Sorbet</li>
<li>The goals and constraints which sprung from that historical context</li>
<li>Various problems we discovered over time, forcing redesigns of the type syntax</li>
<li>Potential future changes to the syntax, ranging from “yeah we should probably have done that yesterday” to “that sounds like it’ll never happen… but wouldn’t it be cool?”</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-before-times">The before times</h2>
<p>Before we get too much further, I’ve forgotten to introduce myself: my name is Jake, and I’ve been working full time on Sorbet for almost 7 years.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>I started at Stripe a month before the Ruby type checker project kicked off, and I joined the team 1 year later. Most of what I have to say here is from direct experience, from chatting with people over lunch, or from combing old emails. That means some of the things that happened before 2017 are a little hazy, but I’m going to do my best.</p>
<p>In mid 2017 (when I joined, and when Sorbet was starting) there were about 750 people at Stripe, of whom about 300 were engineers.</p>
<p>Every 6 months (to this day), Stripe runs a survey of all engineers at the company, asking them about about their productivity. In the first survey of 2017, engineers were asked to pick priorities for the Developer Productivity team by choosing three things from this list:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Better technical documentation</li>
<li>Static type checking for Ruby</li>
<li>Unattended deploys</li>
<li>CI flakiness on feature branch builds</li>
<li>CI flakiness on master builds</li>
<li>Async programming primitives and libraries</li>
<li>Seamlessly start multiple services in development</li>
<li>GUI for running database migrations</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s in order by their responses: the top two were “better docs” and “static type checking.” Also, when looking at the free-form responses, the number of complaints mentioning themes of “code organization, interfaces, and modularity” had doubled from 6 months prior. Test speed, while substantially improved from the prior survey, was still a widespread call out.</p>
<p>One of those open-ended questions was: “What are the top 1-2 things we could do to make you more productive?” It got answers like these:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>mono-repoing all the things; better, more intuitive code/documentation (clearer interfaces, <strong>static typing</strong>, stronger assurances from linting)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>static types</strong> / less magic in [Stripe’s Ruby codebase]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>builds being faster, tests on branches passing meaning you wont break master, <strong>static types</strong> in [Stripe’s Ruby codebase]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mention all this to drive home that we didn’t build Sorbet because we wanted to, we built it because people were asking for it!</p>
<p>Which is also the reason it’s hard for me to give advice to people adopting Sorbet. They’ll ask me, “How did you convince people?” and I’ll say, “we didn’t: <em>they</em> convinced <em>us</em>!” But I’m getting off track, because I’m not trying to convince people to use Sorbet today.</p>
<h2 id="appetite-for-typing-at-stripe">Appetite for typing at Stripe</h2>
<p>We can dig a little deeper and see where this appetite for typing came from. As early as 2013, Stripe had developed its own object-database mapper for defining database models:<span><label for="sn-0">⊕</label><span>Why didn’t Stripe use mongoid, the official MongoDB ODM? I have no clue. The first mongoid commit predates the first Odin commit by about 4 years, so it’s not like there was no alternative.</span></span></p>
<figure>
<img src="https://blog.jez.io/assets/img/odin-model-2013-03-18.png" alt="Documentation for Odin::Model, a precursor to Chalk::ODM, and later T::Struct">

</figure>
<p>For anyone who uses Sorbet, this should look remarkably familiar: it’s the exact same code you’d use to define a <a href="https://sorbet.org/docs/tstruct"><code>T::Struct</code></a> today. Like any good ODM (or ORM), it did type validation at runtime to ensure that database write operations don’t store bad data.</p>
<p>Stripe also had a library for defining interfaces, circa 2013:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.jez.io/assets/img/chalk-interface-2013-10-15.png"></p>
<p>The idea was that an interface would expose a specific set of required methods. Then you’d box up a value of that interface, like</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1">animal <span>=</span> <span>Animal</span><span>.from_instance</span>(<span>Dog</span><span>.new</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>and the library would check that you implemented all the required methods. Also, it prevented calling methods <strong>not</strong> in the interface at runtime. So for example, <code>animal.bark</code> would raise a <code>NoMethodError</code>, because <code>bark</code> isn’t in the public interface of <code>Animal</code>. If you needed to call a <code>Dog</code>-specific method, you’d have to explicitly downcast to a dog:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1">animal<span>.bark</span> <span># 💥</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"></span>
<span id="cb2-3">dog <span>=</span> <span>Chalk</span><span>::</span><span>Interface</span><span>.dynamic_cast</span>(animal, <span>Dog</span>)</span>
<span id="cb2-4">dog<span>.bark</span>    <span># ✅</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you called <code>dynamic_cast</code> on something that was not a <code>Dog</code>, you get back <code>nil</code>, like how <code>dynamic_cast</code> works in C++.</p>
<p>You should be seeing a pattern here: most of Stripe’s appetite for typing manifested as Ruby DSLs for runtime checking and declaring explicit interfaces. This came to an inflection point in November 2016—almost a year before Sorbet—when Stripe implemented what it called “interface constraints.”</p>
<p><span><label for="sn-1">⊕</label><span>For the Stripe employees playing “spot the anachronism,” this screenshot should have been of a <a href="https://github.com/dropbox/hackpad">Hackpad</a>, but that’s now long gone.</span></span></p>
<figure>
<img src="https://blog.jez.io/assets/img/interface-constraints-proposal-2016-11-08.png" alt="The proposal for declare_method, the earliest predecesor of sig, c.&nbsp;Nov 2016">

</figure>
<p>It was a library for wrapping methods with runtime type checking, mimicking a primitive form of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract">design by contract</a>.”<span><label for="sn-2">⊕</label><span>In a recurring theme, there were already libraries for “design by contract” in Ruby, like <a href="https://github.com/egonSchiele/contracts.ruby">contracts.ruby</a>, that Stripe chose not to use. I can’t find mention of them influencing Stripe’s “interface constraints proposal,” but in retrospect I think it was important for Stripe to have control over the evolution of Sorbet’s type syntax.</span></span></p>
<p>This library directly evolved into Sorbet’s <code>sig</code> syntax, and it worked the same way: the library allowed declaring a specification for a method, and then wrapped the following method with runtime type checks.</p>
<p>The proposal mentions maybe one day building static checking for these annotations, but that was mostly hypothetical: runtime checking was the point from the beginning. Ruby is a language all about the neat things you can do at runtime!</p>
<p>Later, this <code>declare_method</code> library gained support for declaring overridable and abstract methods, which let it replace the <code>Chalk::Interface</code> library (so that interfaces could talk about required signatures, not just required methods):</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://blog.jez.io/assets/img/standard_method-2017-10-12.png" alt="Email announcing declare_method → standard_method et al.">

</figure>
<p>Throw in the fact that the JavaScript codebase powering Stripe’s dashboard gained support for static typing in July 2016 (via <a href="https://flow.org/">Flow</a><span><label for="sn-3">⊕</label><span>While researching, I came across the <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2014/11/18/web/flow-a-new-static-type-checker-for-javascript/">original Flow announcement</a> from 2014, which is interesting in understanding its original design goals.</span></span>), and the stage was set. Desire for Ruby static typing came to a flash point in the first half of 2017. A particular email (which has been lost to the sands of retention) from an influential engineer at Stripe called out the difficulty of making sense of Stripe’s Ruby codebase given its size and evolution, alongside specific, high-profile instances where a static type checker would have eliminated those problems.</p>
<h2 id="the-design-of-a-type-syntax">The design of a type syntax</h2>
<p>The team evaluated various approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Rewriting to a typed language wouldn’t work: Stripe had almost 2 million lines of Ruby code at the time, and as we’d say at Stripe, “<a href="https://stripe.com/jobs/culture#:~:text=classic%E2%80%9D%20Stripe%20slogans%3A-,We%20haven%E2%80%99t%20won%20yet,-Efficiency%20is%20leverage">we haven’t won yet</a>,” which is a way of saying the work never stops. There’s no time to pause all feature development and rewrite to another language, because that wouldn’t make our users’ lives better.</p></li>
<li><p>There mostly weren’t any existing type checkers for Ruby. There’s a project called <a href="https://github.com/tupl-tufts/rdl">RDL</a>, but it’s kind of a hybrid static+runtime checker. RDL’s “static” checking happens after eagerly loading all the code and using the Ruby VM to do most of the symbol lookup. At the time, eagerly loading all of Stripe’s code (not even asking RDL to check types) took a few minutes—by comparison, the first version of Sorbet ran in a few seconds.</p></li>
<li><p>There was also a project called <a href="https://github.com/typedruby/typedruby">TypedRuby</a>, largely a passion project of an engineer working at GitHub. After a few weeks of evaluation, it seemed that there were enough bugs in the project that fixing them would involve a near complete rewrite of the project anyways.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So the team decided to write something from scratch, which meant being tasked with designing a type syntax. Let’s look at some approaches.</p>
<h2 id="the-typescript-approach-add-types-on-top-compile-them-away">The TypeScript approach: add types on top, compile them away</h2>
<p>The most obvious approach in retrospect is the approach that has worked spectacularly for TypeScript: build our own syntax, free of any constraints in the source language, and compile it away with a build step.</p>
<p>For Sorbet this would have meant a <strong>massive break with Ruby compatibility</strong>. In the JavaScript world, minifiers, tree shakers, transpilers, and compile-to-JS languages were everywhere. Most developers gave up the “save file, reload page” development paradigm ages before TypeScript became popular: CoffeeScript predated TypeScript by 4 years.</p>
<p>But even today, I’m not aware of a single Ruby codebase of significant size that has a source transform build step that blocks running the tests or reloading the service. Ruby engineers expect to run tests directly and to be able to reload a service immediately after saving a file. Introducing a mandatory build step that blocked running a test would have been a big point of friction.</p>
<p>Even if <em>Stripe</em> was okay self-imposing a build step, it would break virtually all Ruby dev tools. Linters, syntax highlighting, and code formatting would break. Observability tools would show backtraces in the wrong spots, because the Ruby VM doesn’t have source mapping. IDEs like RubyMine would fall back to being text editors.</p>
<p>Let’s say we built all those tools, too. We wanted to open source Sorbet one day: this was a top-line goal right in the project brief. If anyone were ever to adopt Sorbet, it would need to be gradual: to not require fundamentally reworking how the codebase builds, tests, and deploys code just to try it out. Adopting a build step is a huge “all or nothing” decision for a codebase.</p>

<p>If we can’t change the source syntax, maybe we make our own syntax for declaring types? Every source file could be paired with a kind of “header” type definition file that declares the types.</p>
<p>Basically all gradual languages end up supporting this anyways: TypeScript has <code>*.d.ts</code>, Python has <code>*.pyi</code>. Sorbet has <code>*.rbi</code> files, and Ruby eventually shipped <code>*.rbs</code>. You need these files to declare types for files completely outside your control: third-party gems, things defined in native extensions, etc.</p>
<p>The problem is that they’re only half of a solution: even if you use RBS files to annotate methods, you’ll still need <strong>explicit type casts</strong> inside method bodies. RBS files alone don’t have a way to say, “trust me, right here I know that this variable is an <code>Integer</code>.”</p>
<p>I will say: the nice thing about this approach is that you’re free to choose a syntax that’s as clean as you want: it’s a blank slate on type syntax design, with virtually zero constraints, even more blank than the transpiler approach. We’ll come back to this later.</p>

<p>If the types needs to be in the source, and we can’t change the syntax, maybe we’ll invent our own syntax in comments? Google’s Closure Compiler chose this strategy well before TypeScript appeared, and Ruby already had a history of comment-based type annotations via tools like YARD. Sorbet could have formalized a rigid type-based comment syntax, and used that for both method signatures and inline type casts.</p>
<p>But here we return to the issue of runtime checking: Stripe engineers were asking for <strong>static and runtime type checking</strong>, not static instead of runtime!</p>
<p>You get a lot for free if you decorate a method with runtime checking, most important being the guarantee that no one can <a href="https://www.hyrumslaw.com/">Hyrum’s Law</a> your method:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With a sufficient number of users of an API,<br>
it does not matter what you promise in the contract:<br>
all observable behaviors of your system<br>
will be depended on by somebody.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consider code like this:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>def</span> get_mcc(charge, merchant)</span>
<span id="cb3-2">  <span>return</span> charge<span>.mcc</span> <span>if</span> charge</span>
<span id="cb3-3">  merchant<span>.default_mcc</span></span>
<span id="cb3-4"><span>end</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If <code>charge</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, we return early before checking whether <code>merchant</code> is <code>nil</code> or not. Now suppose we need to edit the method to implement a new “merchant override MCC” feature:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span>def</span> get_mcc(charge, merchant)</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a>  override <span>=</span> merchant<span>.override_mcc</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3"></a>  <span>return</span> override <span>if</span> override</span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-5"><a href="#cb4-5"></a>  <span>return</span> charge<span>.mcc</span> <span>if</span> charge</span>
<span id="cb4-6"><a href="#cb4-6"></a>  merchant<span>.default_mcc</span></span>
<span id="cb4-7"><a href="#cb4-7"></a><span>end</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This new override is meant to take precedence over any “MCC” on a charge. Is this change safe? Callers were supposed to be passing in a non-<code>nil</code> merchant into this method, but maybe some weren’t? If we aren’t sure, now we have to be defensive, which is annoying and maybe causes other problems!</p>
<p>But this problem vanishes when making a changes in methods with runtime-checked signatures.</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a>sig <span>{</span> params(<span>charge:</span> <span>Charge</span>, <span>merchant:</span> <span>Merchant</span>)<span>.returns</span>(<span>MCC</span>) <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2"></a><span>def</span> get_mcc(charge, merchant)</span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3"></a>  override <span>=</span> merchant<span>.override_mcc</span></span>
<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4"></a>  <span>return</span> override <span>if</span> override</span>
<span id="cb5-5"><a href="#cb5-5"></a></span>
<span id="cb5-6"><a href="#cb5-6"></a>  <span>return</span> charge<span>.mcc</span> <span>if</span> charge</span>
<span id="cb5-7"><a href="#cb5-7"></a>  merchant<span>.default_mcc</span></span>
<span id="cb5-8"><a href="#cb5-8"></a><span>end</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If the signature says it’s non-<code>nil</code>, we can rely on that invariant throughout the method body, in all conditionals. Adding a new call to <code>merchant.override_mcc</code> cannot cause <em>net new</em> uncaught <code>NoMethodError</code> exceptions as long as the method already had a runtime-checked <code>sig</code>. In a growing codebase with changes from hundreds of people, runtime checking ensures code remains flexible without fear.</p>
<p>A comment-based approach to type syntax would have meant giving up on runtime-checked signatures. Again: runtime checking is a unique strength of Ruby’s dynamism!</p>
<h2 id="the-dsl-approach-declare_method-becomes-sig">The DSL approach: <code>declare_method</code> becomes <code>sig</code></h2>
<p>The approach that Sorbet picked was to repurpose Stripe’s <code>declare_method</code> DSL. As a benefit, it meant that the project immediately gained thousands of trustworthy annotations to use as a proving ground for the implementation.</p>
<p>Before we dive into specific considerations for the DSL approach, I want to take a second to marvel at the fact that this approach even works at all. It’s wild, isn’t it? Decorate a method with a single line—in a language that doesn’t have first-class decorators!—and the following method gets runtime checking. You can try to approximate this with higher-order functions in JavaScript, but it doesn’t look anywhere near as good.</p>
<p>At the same time that <code>declare_method</code> shortened to <code>sig</code>, type syntax shortened from things like <code>Opus::Types.any(NilClass, String)</code> to just <code>T.nilable(String)</code>.</p>
<p>The specific syntax that <code>sig</code> uses evolved a handful of times<span><label for="sn-4">⊕</label><span>Truly, while I was researching this topic, I found so many wacky old syntaxes, far too many for this post. If you want the details feel free to ask me.</span></span> and I want to talk about those changes, but not before considering one final approach.</p>
<h2 id="the-python-approach-first-party-type-hints">The Python approach: first-party type hints</h2>
<p>Support for typing in Python went differently. Way back in 2007, a proposal for “<a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-3107/">Function Annotations</a>” was accepted:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>def</span> foo(a: expression, b: expression <span>=</span> <span>5</span>):</span>
<span id="cb6-2">    ...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The idea was that annotations would be completely devoid of meaning, so that various tools could ascribe their own. As in: you could stash arbitrary strings there and use them for documentation, or you could put class names there and use them as types, etc. Even at the time it was accepted, people were <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2007-January/000032.html">already discussing</a> interoperability of various project’s annotations, and eventually in 2015 a follow up proposal formalized <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/">Type Hints</a>, saying essentially, “You don’t have to use Function Annotations for types, but if you’re going to, you should follow these conventions for what the types mean.”</p>
<p>The annotations play to the strengths of Python as a dynamic, runtime-focused language. They’re not static-only annotations that get compiled away like TypeScript: they’re present at runtime via the <code>__annotations__</code> property, and annotations can evaluate arbitrary code! The Python VM does not use them for runtime checking, but <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/validation_decorator/">multiple</a>, <a href="https://typeguard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">third-party</a> <a href="https://beartype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">libraries</a> provide decorators that do.</p>
<p>For Python, this approach has a lot going for it:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s a first class syntax that feels at home with other parts of the language’s syntax.</li>
<li>Individual projects can choose whether they want runtime checks or not.</li>
<li>The annotations are always present at runtime for third-party tools to consume them directly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The obvious downside is that it requires a change to the VM. In the planning phase of Sorbet, it would have been a non-starter to ask the Ruby team to invent syntax for us.</p>
<p>… but if you squint, Sorbet’s DSL approach is almost the same as this type hint approach!</p>
<ul>
<li>Both treat annotations as completely optional.</li>
<li>Both treat annotations as runnable syntax, allowing the full flexibility of the language.</li>
<li>Both allow for optional static and optional runtime checking.</li>
<li>Both provide a reflection API to get the annotations at runtime.</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest difference is just the syntax—both offer the <strong>semantics</strong> that we need! When Sorbet started with the DSL approach, a selling point was that it would be easy to migrate to a blessed, upstream type hint approach if that ever became an option.</p>
<p>The type hint approach has unfortunately stalled for Ruby. I have more thoughts on this, but for now let’s keep retracing the evolution of Sorbet’s DSL syntax.</p>
<h2 id="types-are-expressions">Types are expressions</h2>
<p>Both the DSL approach and the type hint approach share the feature that types are expressions. This leads to three big constraints on the design of a syntax.</p>
<h2 id="when-the-syntax-we-want-is-taken">When the syntax we want is taken</h2>
<p>When types are expressions, sometimes type syntax you want already has another meaning.</p>
<p>It would be really nice to use <code>|</code> for union types, <code>&amp;</code> for intersection types, and <code>[]</code> for generic types, directly on class or module names:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>Integer</span> <span>|</span> <span>String</span>         <span># Module#|</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><span>Runnable</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>HasOwner</span>      <span># Module#&amp;</span></span>
<span id="cb7-3"><span>Box</span><span>[</span><span>Integer</span><span>]</span>             <span># Module#[]</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are two problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It would involve monkey patching <code>Module</code>, which would be controversial, and thus need to be opt-in: this syntax could not be the sole accepted syntax.</p></li>
<li><p>Some singleton classes may already define these methods. <code>Array</code> and <code>Set</code> are examples from the standard library:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><span>Array</span><span>[</span><span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span><span>]</span>           <span># Array.[]</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2"><span># =&gt; [1, 2, 3]</span></span>
<span id="cb8-3"></span>
<span id="cb8-4"><span>Set</span><span>[</span><span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span><span>]</span>             <span># Set.[]</span></span>
<span id="cb8-5"><span># =&gt; #&lt;Set: {1, 2, 3}&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>So <code>Array[Integer]</code> would not make a generic type, but rather a length 1 array: <code>[Integer]</code>.<span><label for="sn-5">⊕</label><span>While we’re in the realm of the wacky, we could have “block-scoped” monkey patches where we replace the meaning of certain methods when evaluating the <code>sig</code> block to make this work, but the earlier point stands: some people won’t want that.</span></span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Something similar comes up for tuples: the <code>|</code> and <code>&amp;</code> methods already mean something for Arrays:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>[</span><span>1</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>5</span><span>]</span> <span>|</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>6</span><span>]</span>    <span># Array#|</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2"><span># =&gt; [1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6]</span></span>
<span id="cb9-3"></span>
<span id="cb9-4"><span>[</span><span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span><span>]</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span><span>]</span>    <span># Array#&amp;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-5"><span># =&gt; [2, 3]</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In this case, it might be easier to abandon using raw <code>Array</code> literals for tuples, and instead use a syntax like <code>T[Integer, String]</code> to define a tuple, freeing up <code>|</code> and <code>&amp;</code>.</p>
<p>While building Sorbet, our goal was to have one way to do things, for consistency. Maybe it’s time to relax that? If Ruby is okay having three names for filtering a list, maybe Sorbet can be okay having more than one way to specify union types. We could let individual codebases decide which syntax they want to use.</p>
<h2 id="forward-references">Forward references</h2>
<p>When types are expressions, you have to worry about forward references in type syntax. The evolution of the DSL syntax looked like this:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1">declare_method(<span>{</span><span>x:</span> <span>Integer</span><span>}</span>, <span>returns:</span> <span>String</span>)</span>
<span id="cb10-2"></span>
<span id="cb10-3">standard_method(<span>{</span><span>x:</span> <span>Integer</span><span>}</span>, <span>returns:</span> <span>String</span>)</span>
<span id="cb10-4"></span>
<span id="cb10-5">sig<span>.params</span>(<span>x:</span> <span>Integer</span>)<span>.returns</span>(<span>String</span>)</span>
<span id="cb10-6"></span>
<span id="cb10-7">sig <span>{</span> params(<span>x:</span> <span>Integer</span>)<span>.returns</span>(<span>String</span>) <span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The most recent change switched to specifying types inside a block, which was done so that adding a <code>sig</code> wouldn’t cause load-order problems. For example:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1"></a><span>class</span> <span>A</span></span>
<span id="cb11-2"><a href="#cb11-2"></a>  sig<span>.params</span>(<span>x:</span> <span>MyData</span>)<span>.void</span></span>
<span id="cb11-3"><a href="#cb11-3"></a>  <span>def</span> <span>self</span><span>.example</span>(my_data)</span>
<span id="cb11-4"><a href="#cb11-4"></a>    <span>puts</span>(my_data<span>.foo</span>)</span>
<span id="cb11-5"><a href="#cb11-5"></a>  <span>end</span></span>
<span id="cb11-6"><a href="#cb11-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb11-7"><a href="#cb11-7"></a>  <span>MyData</span> <span>=</span> <span>Struct</span><span>.new</span>(<span>:foo</span>)</span>
<span id="cb11-8"><a href="#cb11-8"></a><span>end</span></span>
<span id="cb11-9"><a href="#cb11-9"></a></span>
<span id="cb11-10"><a href="#cb11-10"></a><span>A</span><span>.example</span>(<span>MyData</span><span>.new</span>(<span>42</span>))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There’s no problem loading this file, until you add a <code>sig</code> (pictured using the old, eager syntax). Even though the <code>MyData#foo</code> method is called on line 4, above its definition on line 7, that doesn’t matter because <code>example</code> isn’t called until line 10.</p>
<p>But adding the <code>sig</code> breaks that: there’s now a forward reference to <code>MyData</code> which the sig evaluates eagerly, causing an exception at load time. This kept causing problems as people added more <code>sig</code>’s. The problem was worse because of autoloading: in development everything might have looked fine, because you only evaluated things in a certain order, but then in CI or production things loading in a different order would bite you.</p>
<p>Hiding all the types inside a block switches signatures from evaluating eagerly to lazily: the runtime implementation defers forcing the block until the first call of the method. These days, you basically only get a load-order issue if the code already had a load order issue.</p>
<p>It’s interesting to point out that Python type hints went through a very similar growing pain, and in newer versions of Python you can write:</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1"><span>from</span> __future__ <span>import</span> annotations</span></code></pre></div>
<p>to convert type hints from being evaluated eagerly to lazily. The <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0649/">proposal introducing it</a> is very well written and has a great summary of the history and problems.</p>
<h2 id="sometimes-you-really-want-custom-syntax">Sometimes you really want custom syntax</h2>
<p>When types are expressions, you’re limited by what’s valid Ruby syntax. There’s a lot of alternative syntaxes that would be really nice for type syntax:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Integer?</code> instead of <code>T.nilable(Integer)</code></li>
<li><code>(Integer) -&gt; String</code> instead of <code>T.proc.params(arg0: Integer).returns(String)</code></li>
<li><code>|</code> and <code>&amp;</code> without monkey patches</li>
</ul>
<p>The other approaches (transpiler, RBS files, documentation comments) don’t have this limitation: with those approaches you’re free to pick any syntax you want.</p>
<p>There’s a lot that can still be done while operating under the “types as expressions” constraint, but there’s no denying that if you give that up, you can get some really terse type syntaxes.</p>
<h2 id="where-we-go-from-here">Where we go from here</h2>
<p>What’s next for Sorbet’s type syntax? We’ve learned a bunch of constraints in the design space:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can’t break compatibility with Ruby, or no one will use it.</li>
<li>We need a syntax that works for runtime checking too, because Ruby is a runtime-focused language at its core.</li>
<li>There’s only so far you can go with “types as expressions,” but we could probably go a little further with optional monkey patches.</li>
<li>Adding a signature can’t cause code to load out of its usual order.</li>
</ul>
<p>So this leads to a few next steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Probably we should build opt-in support for syntax that requires monkey patches?</li>
<li>We can think about some backwards-incompatible changes, like to how tuple types are declared.</li>
<li>We can think about making some super-verbose things (like generic methods) less verbose.</li>
</ul>
<p>But I want to suggest one more option, which is a bit more radical: what if the Ruby VM parsed RBS comments and associated them with method definitions?</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1"><span>class</span> <span>A</span></span>
<span id="cb13-2">  <span>#: (Integer) -&gt; String</span></span>
<span id="cb13-3">  <span>def</span> <span>self</span><span>.foo</span>(x)</span>
<span id="cb13-4">  <span>end</span></span>
<span id="cb13-5"><span>end</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Soutaro introduced this comment-based syntax for RBS <a href="https://youtu.be/26sbpaGbU-0?t=1143">at RubyKaigi in 2024</a>. It’s a syntax that both Steep and TypeProf understand, and that Sorbet is gaining support for. Right now it’s just in comments… but what if the Ruby VM actually parsed these comments and exposed them at runtime?</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><span>A</span><span>.method</span>(<span>:foo</span>)<span>.rbs_annotation</span></span>
<span id="cb14-2"><span>A</span><span>.rbs_annotation</span>(<span>:foo</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If RBS comments were exposed by the Ruby VM like this, it wouldn’t force people to choose between Ruby’s elegant RBS syntax and Sorbet’s powerful runtime type checking.</p>
<p>It also solves some of the problems with “types as expressions,” because types wouldn’t be expressions anymore: the Ruby VM would choose how to parse these annotations, meaning that we still get terse syntax, able to use <code>|</code> and <code>[]</code> free of other constraints. It would also fix the forward reference problem because the VM wouldn’t be evaluating these comments, just parsing them for other tools to consume. Those tools might attempt to resolve constant names, but that’s up to each tool to figure out when and how to do that.</p>
<p>Having RBS annotations available at runtime would be useful for more than just Sorbet:</p>
<ul>
<li>IRB could use these annotations to show completion results, without having to parse RBS comments separately and associate them with the methods.</li>
<li>Gems could get creative with how they use it. For example, you could imagine a JSON Schema library where the schemas are defined by collecting all the type hints in a <code>Struct</code> or <code>Data</code> class.</li>
<li>Linters could piggy back off the Ruby VM’s parser and be able to pass along the parsed RBS annotations to custom linter rules, so that lint rules don’t have to parse the annotations themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given that it starts from a comment-based syntax, you could still make it be optional, something that doesn’t affect you at all unless you want it to.</p>
<p>This solution isn’t a silver bullet: it wouldn’t do anything for <code>T.let</code> assertions where you want to make an assertion for a specific value at runtime, but it’s a great start!</p>
<p>In the end, all I’m trying to say is: we don’t have to think of Sorbet’s syntax as “done.” Even if Ruby never adds support for type hints, we can keep improving Sorbet. But also it’s an exciting time for type annotations in Ruby itself, and I remain optimistic for the future of the wider Ruby typing ecosystem.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
        Near-miss collisions between high-energy lead nuclei at the LHC generate intense electromagnetic fields that can knock out protons and transform lead into fleeting quantities of gold nuclei
      </p><div>
        <p>In a paper published in <a href="https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevC.111.054906">Physical Review Journals</a>, the <a href="https://www.home.cern/science/experiments/alice">ALICE collaboration</a> reports measurements that quantify the transmutation of lead into gold in CERN’s <a href="https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider">Large Hadron Collider </a>(LHC).</p>

<p>Transforming the base metal lead into the precious metal gold was a dream of medieval alchemists. This long-standing quest, known as <em>chrysopoeia</em>, may have been motivated by the observation that dull grey, relatively abundant lead is of a similar density to gold, which has long been coveted for its beautiful colour and rarity. It was only much later that it became clear that lead and gold are distinct chemical elements and that chemical methods are powerless to transmute one into the other.</p>

<p>With the dawn of nuclear physics in the 20th century, it was discovered that heavy elements could transform into others, either naturally, by radioactive decay, or in the laboratory, under a bombardment of neutrons or protons. Though gold has been artificially produced in this way before, the ALICE collaboration has now measured the transmutation of lead into gold by a new mechanism involving near-miss collisions between lead nuclei at the LHC.</p>

<p>Extremely high-energy collisions between lead nuclei at the LHC can create quark–gluon plasma, a hot and dense state of matter that is thought to have filled the universe around a millionth of a second after the Big Bang, giving rise to the matter we now know. However, in the far more frequent interactions where the nuclei just miss each other without “touching”, the intense electromagnetic fields surrounding them can induce photon–photon and photon–nucleus interactions that open <a href="http://cerncourier.com/a/the-other-99/">further</a> avenues of exploration.</p>

<p>The electromagnetic field emanating from a lead nucleus is particularly strong because the nucleus contains 82 protons, each carrying one elementary charge. Moreover, the very high speed at which lead nuclei travel in the LHC (corresponding to 99.999993% of the speed of light) causes the electromagnetic field lines to be squashed into a thin pancake, transverse to the direction of motion, producing a short-lived pulse of photons. Often, this triggers a process called electromagnetic dissociation, whereby a photon interacting with a nucleus can excite oscillations of its internal structure, resulting in the ejection of small numbers of neutrons and protons. To create gold (a nucleus containing 79 protons), three protons must be removed from a lead nucleus in the LHC beams.</p>

<p>“It is impressive to see that our detectors can handle head-on collisions producing thousands of particles, while also being sensitive to collisions where only a few particles are produced at a time, enabling the study of electromagnetic ‘nuclear transmutation’ processes,” says Marco Van Leeuwen, ALICE spokesperson.</p>

<p>The ALICE team used the detector’s zero degree calorimeters (ZDC) to count the number of photon–nucleus interactions that resulted in the emission of zero, one, two and three protons accompanied by at least one neutron, which are associated with the production of lead, thallium, mercury and gold, respectively. While less frequent than the creation of thallium or mercury, the results show that the LHC currently produces gold at a maximum rate of about 89&nbsp;000 nuclei per second from lead–lead collisions at the ALICE collision point. Gold nuclei emerge from the collision with very high energy and hit the LHC beam pipe or collimators at various points downstream, where they immediately fragment into single protons, neutrons and other particles. The gold exists for just a tiny fraction of a second.</p>

<p>The ALICE analysis shows that, during Run 2 of the LHC (2015–2018), about 86 billion<strong> </strong>gold nuclei were created at the four major experiments. In terms of mass, this corresponds to just 29 picograms (2.9 ×10<sup>-11 </sup>g). Since the luminosity in the LHC is continually increasing thanks to regular upgrades to the machines, Run 3 has produced almost double the amount of gold that Run 2 did, but the total still&nbsp;amounts to trillions of times less than would be required to make a piece of jewellery. While the dream of medieval alchemists has technically come true, their hopes of riches have once again been dashed.</p>

<p>“Thanks to the unique capabilities of the ALICE ZDCs, the present analysis is the first to systematically detect and analyse the signature of gold production at the LHC experimentally,” says Uliana Dmitrieva of the ALICE collaboration.</p>

<p>“The results also test and improve theoretical models of electromagnetic dissociation which, beyond their intrinsic physics interest, are used to understand and predict beam losses that are a major limit on the performance of the LHC and future colliders,” adds John Jowett, also of the ALICE collaboration.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/nietras/Sep/releases/tag/v0.10.0">Sep 0.10.0 was released April 22nd,
2025</a> with optimizations
for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVX-512">AVX-512</a> capable CPUs like the AMD
9950X (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_5">Zen 5</a>) and updated benchmarks
including the 9950X. Sep now achieves a staggering <strong>21 GB/s on the 9950X</strong> for
the low-level CSV parsing. 🚀 Before 0.10.0, Sep achieved ~18 GB/s on 9950X.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/nietras/Sep/releases/tag/v0.10.0">v0.10.0 release</a> for
all changes for the release, and <a href="https://github.com/nietras/Sep">Sep README on
GitHub</a> for full details.</p>

<p>In this blog post, I will dive into how .NET 9.0 machine code for AVX-512 is
sub-optimal and what changes were made to speed up Sep for AVX-512 by
circumventing this, showing interesting code and assembly along the way, so get
ready for SIMD C# code, x64 SIMD assembly and tons of benchmark numbers.</p>

<p>However, first let’s take a look at the progression of Sep’s performance from
early 0.1.0 to 0.10.0, from .NET 7.0 to .NET 9.0 and from AMD Ryzen 9 5950X (Zen
3) to 9950X (Zen 5), as I have also recently upgraded my work PC.</p>

<h2 id="sep-performance-progression">Sep Performance Progression</h2>

<p><img src="https://nietras.com/images/2025-05-sep-0.10.0/sep-perf-progression-0.1.0-to-0.10.0.png" alt="Sep Perf Progression 0.1.0 To 0.10.0"></p>

<p>The benchmark numbers above are for the package assets CSV data and the low
level parse <code>Rows</code> only scope, see <a href="https://github.com/nietras/Sep">Sep README on
GitHub</a> or code on GitHub for details on this.
Note that all numbers here are single-threaded and are also shown in the table
below. Note that there can be a few percentage points variation in the numbers,
so for a given release Sep might see minor regressions.</p>

<p>The main take away is that Sep has seen incremental improvements to performance
driven by both major (e.g. almost complete rewrite of <a href="https://nietras.com/2023/08/07/sep-0-2-0/">internals in 0.2.0</a>) and minor code changes. While also
seeing improved performance on new .NET versions. And finally here showing
improvement for going from the AMD 5950X (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_3">Zen
3</a>) to AMD 9950X (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_5">Zen
5</a>). Hence, this showcases how software
together with hardware improvements can boost performance to the next level.</p>

<p>We can see Sep progressing:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>~ 7 GB/s</code> (0.1.0, 5950X and .NET 7.0)</li>
  <li><code>~12 GB/s</code> (0.3.0, 5950X and .NET 8.0)</li>
  <li><code>~13 GB/s</code> (0.6.0, 5950X and .NET 9.0)</li>
  <li><code>~18 GB/s</code> (0.9.0, 9950X and .NET 9.0)</li>
  <li><code>~21 GB/s</code> (0.10.0, 9950X and .NET 9.0)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a staggering <strong>~3x</strong> improvement in just under 2 years since <a href="https://nietras.com/2023/06/05/introducing-sep">Sep was
introduced June, 2023</a>.</p>

<p>The improvement from <code>5950X w. Sep 0.9.0</code> to <code>9950X w. Sep 0.10.0</code> is <strong>~1.6x</strong>
which is a pretty good improvement from Zen 3 to Zen 5. Note the 9950X has a 5.7
GHz boost frequency vs 4.9 GHz for 5950X, so this alone probably explains 1.2x.</p>

<h2 id="avx-512-code-generation-and-mask-register-issues">AVX-512 Code Generation and Mask Register Issues</h2>

<p>Sep has had support for AVX-512 since <a href="https://nietras.com/2023/09/05/sep-0-2-3/">0.2.3</a> and back then I noted that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>different here is the use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVX-512">mask registers (<code>k1-k8</code>) introduced with
AVX-512</a>. However, .NET 8 does not have
explicit support for these and the code generation is a bit suboptimal, given
mask register are moved to normal registers each time. And then back.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did not have direct access to an AVX-512 capable CPU then, so I could not test
the performance of the AVX-512 in detail, but did verify it on the Xeon Silver
4316 which based on some quick tests showed the AVX-512 parser to be the fastest
on that CPU despite the issues with the mask registers.</p>

<h2 id="9950x-upgrade-and-avx-512-vs-avx2-performance">9950X Upgrade and AVX-512 vs AVX2 Performance</h2>

<p>Recently, I then upgraded from an AMD 5950X (Zen 3) CPU to an AMD 9950X (Zen 5)
CPU. Zen 3 does not support AVX-512, but Zen 5 does. One of the first things I
did on the new CPU was of course to run the Sep benchmarks, and this showed,
that Sep hit ~18 GB/s on the 9950X for the low-level parsing of CSV files. This
was great and ~1.4x faster than on the 5950X. A pretty good improvement from Zen
3 to Zen 5.</p>

<p>However, I still wanted to compare AVX-512 to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions">AVX2</a>. Sep has,
unofficial, support for overriding the default selected parser via an
environment variable. This is also used for testing all possible parsers fully
no matter which parser is selected as best. A bit surprisingly the AVX2 parser
on 9950X hit ~20GB/s! That is, it was better than the AVX-512 based parser by
~10%, which is pretty significant for Sep. Hence, it would seem the mask
register issue was still an issue.</p>

<h2 id="parser-codeassembly-comparison-and-new-avx-512-to-256-parser">Parser Code/Assembly Comparison and New AVX-512-to-256 Parser</h2>

<p>Let’s examine the code and assembly (via
<a href="https://github.com/EgorBo/Disasmo">Disasmo</a>) for the AVX-512-based parser
(0.9.0), a tweaked version (0.10.0), compare it to the AVX2-based parser, and
finally review a new AVX-512-to-256-based parser that circumvents the mask
register issue and is even faster than the AVX2-based parser, achieving ~21 GB/s
as shown above.</p>

<h3 id="parse-methods">Parse Methods</h3>

<p>All parsers in Sep follow the same basic layout as shown below and have a single
generic <code>Parse</code> method to support both parsing for when handling quotes
(<code>ParseColInfos</code>) and when not (<code>ParseColEnds</code>). The former requires keeping
track of more state, and is slightly slower.</p>

<p>In Sep the <code>Parse</code> method is marked with <code>AggressiveInlining</code> to ensure it is
inlined, which means one can in principle go to <code>ParseColEnds</code> in Visual Studio
with Disasmo installed and hit <code>ALT + SHIFT + D</code>. Unfortunately, for some reason
this does not work currently unless you change the parser from a <code>class</code> to
<code>struct</code>. So readers are aware if they want to follow along. See GitHub issue
<a href="https://github.com/EgorBo/Disasmo/issues/68">Empty disassembly for method with inlined generic method (used to
work)</a> for more.</p>

<p>To recap, parsing in Sep is done on a span of <code>char</code>s (from an array) e.g. 16K
and outputs a set of column end indices and row column counts for that span.
This ensures parsing is done on a significant yet small enough chunk of data to
fit in the CPU cache, and facilitates efficient multi-threading after too.</p>

<p>Parsing of the span is basically then just a loop where one or two SIMD
registers (e.g. <code>Vector256</code>) are loaded (as unsigned 16-bit integers e.g.
<code>ushort</code>) and converted to <code>byte</code> SIMD register and then compared to the special
characters (e.g. <code>\n</code>, <code>\r</code>, <code>"</code>, <code>;</code>) using SIMD compare instructions. The
compare results are then converted to bit masks and each set bit in that mask is
sequentially parsed after.</p>

<p>The interesting part here is the SIMD code and how it’s JIT’ed to machine code
on .NET and how efficient that is. Below this specific code and assembly is
shown for the parsers mentioned before.</p>

<h3 id="sepparseravx512packcmpormovemasktzcntcs-090"><code>SepParserAvx512PackCmpOrMoveMaskTzcnt.cs</code> (0.9.0)</h3>

<p>A breakdown of the below code snippet:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Data Loading and Packing</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Two 16-bit integer vectors (<code>v0</code> and <code>v1</code>) are read from memory using
unaligned reads.</li>
      <li>These vectors are packed into a single byte vector using
<code>PackUnsignedSaturate</code>, ensuring values fit within the byte range.</li>
      <li>For AVX-512 this means loading two 512-bit SIMD registers each with
32 <code>char</code>s and then packing it to single 512-bit SIMD register with 64
bytes. This means 64 <code>char</code>s are handled in each loop.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Reordering Packed Data</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>The packed data is interleaved, so a permutation operation
(<code>PermuteVar8x64</code>) is applied to reorder the bytes into the correct
sequence.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Character Comparisons</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>The byte vector is compared against specific characters (e.g. <code>\n</code>, <code>\r</code>,
<code>"</code>, <code>;</code>) using SIMD equality operations. These comparisons identify
special characters relevant to CSV parsing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Combine Comparison Results</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>The results of the comparisons are combined using logical operations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Bitmask Generation and Check</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>A <code>MoveMask</code> operation extracts a bitmask from the SIMD register, allowing
for a quick check to skip further processing if no special characters are
found.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>All parsers follow the same basic approach, so this description will be omitted
going forward. Note how <code>ISA</code> and <code>Vec</code> are aliases used to make the different
parsers more similar which makes it easier to compare and maintain the different
parsers.</p>

<p>Assembly is shown below for a 64-bit CPU with AVX-512 support e.g. the 9950X.
What is most interesting here is that each compare <code>Vec.Equals</code> ends up being
two instructions <code>vpcmpeqb</code> (<code>c</code>o<code>mp</code>are <code>eq</code>ual <code>b</code>ytes) and <code>vpmovm2b</code>
(<code>mov</code>e <code>m</code>ask to <code>b</code>yte). That is, there is a lot of going from the mask
register, e.g. <code>k1</code>, to a normal 512-bit register, e.g. <code>zmm5</code>, and back again.</p>

<p>Note that the C# code does not deal with vector mask registers directly. This is
not supported in .NET and hence it is the JIT that is responsible for code
generation around this. Unfortunately, here it does not do a good job and the
AVX-512 is not as fast as it could be.</p>

<p>To address the above code generation issues, in Sep 0.10.0 I changed the AVX-512
based parser by moving the <code>MoveMask</code> calls earlier to avoid the whole mask
register back and forth as shown below. For other parsers, <code>MoveMask</code> is only
called when necessary to reduce instructions in the “happy”/skip path.</p>

<p>This improves the assembly for the parser quite a bit as can be seen below.
Basically, less instructions. We are still going to mask register to normal
register but at least only once.</p>

<p>The assembly below is, however, clearly more straightforward as there are no mask

<h3 id="sepparseravx512to256cmpormovemasktzcntcs-0100"><code>SepParserAvx512To256CmpOrMoveMaskTzcnt.cs</code> (0.10.0)</h3>

<p>Given that even the tweaked AVX-512 (0.10.0) based parser had issues with mask
registers, I kept thinking that perhaps there was a more straightforward way to
do this, and then after some searching and unfruitful discussions with LLMs I
figured out that one could just use AVX-512 instructions for loading the <code>char</code>s
and then convert the 16-bit to 8-bit bytes saturated as a 256-bit register,
avoiding the 512-bit mask registers, by using
<code>ConvertToVector256ByteWithSaturation</code> (<code>vpmovuswb</code>) as shown below. This “only”
parses 32 <code>char</code>s at a time, but it is much simpler and avoids the mask register
issue.</p>

<p>The assembly then is much simpler and direct (closer to AVX2) and not only
avoids the mask register issues but also has more straightforward saturated
conversion since no permutation is needed as the packed data is already in order
just in the <code>ymm4</code> register (that is the 256-bit part of <code>zmm4</code>).</p>

<p>And this is what brings Sep parsing up to a staggering 21 GB/s on the 9950X! 🚀</p>

<h3 id="all-parsers-benchmarks">All Parsers Benchmarks</h3>

<p>Finally, given all the parsers available in Sep I have added a benchmark, that
uses the aforementioned environment variable, to run all parsers and compare
their performance on the low level row parsing to better gauge their individual
performance on the same CPU. Here the AMD 9950X.</p>

<p>The new AVX-512-to-256 parser is the fastest parser of all hitting ~21.5 GB/s,
but the Vector256/AVX2 based parsers are not far behind (about 5%).
<code>SepParserVector256NrwCmpExtMsbTzcnt</code> is the cross-platform <code>Vector256</code> based
parser and it is notably now on par with the AVX2, but note how the other
cross-platform <code>Vector128</code> and <code>Vector512</code> based parsers are not (still fast but
5-10% slower), and even worse that the <code>Vector512</code> one is slower than the
<code>Vector128</code>.</p>

<p><code>SepParserIndexOfAny</code> is far behind, and should make it clear that any ideas
that this could be used to compete with Sep are not realistic. 😉 <code>Vector64</code> is
not accelerated on the 9950X and therefore very slow. It’s just there for
completeness.</p>

<h3 id="top-level-5950x-vs-9950x-benchmarks">Top Level 5950X vs 9950X Benchmarks</h3>

<p>Finally, the table below shows the top level benchmarks for the 5950X and 9950X
CPUs for the package assets and floats data.</p>

<p>Note how on the 9950X the one million package assets rows are parsed in just 72
ms for <code>Sep_MT</code> (multi-threaded Sep) compared to 119 ms on the 5950X. Or 8 GB/s
on 9950X vs 4.9 GB/s on 5950X. <strong>~8 GB/s!</strong> 🚀</p>

<p>Similarly, for floats Sep can parse 8 GB/s of floating point CSV data
multi-threaded. <strong>~8 GB/s</strong>! 🌪</p>

<p>That’s, about 1.5x-1.6x improvement, similarly to the low level benchmarks,
going from 5950X to 9950X. That’s significant generational improvements to CPU
performance. Kudos to AMD and TSMC.</p>

    <p>What I most love in cryptpad it's about privacy policies and cryptography. Have a service of this category for free, it's just amazing. The teams and real time working kicks out any disappointing if compare the product with Google Docs. I really would trust CryptPad for any service or doc that you must do online and would not worry at all with information leaks.</p>

Another thing I love is that we can work with a high level of privacy here. That's hugely important in tool selection in associations I work with.
For collaborative writing CryptPad is my tool of choice, for the overview to small projects I immediately start a Kanban board. CryptDrive is super as we can store all files here.</p>

    <p>Given the abusive commercial data mining activities of other cloud based productivity tool providers, the suite of tools offered by CryptPad and their dedication to data privacy and implementation of data encryption is both laudable and the future.

They actually respond to issues promptly. The free tier is generous and allows shoe-string independent developers like myself to get my fledgling business started. I will have no hesitation in switching to a paid tier when cashflow permits.</p>

    <p>Digitalcourage, the NGO I am volunteering for, had used Etherpad for many years to write texts collaboratively. When I set up a CryptPad server, everyone switched to it within a few weeks. As a pro-privacy organization, using a zero-knowledge service is a no-brainer. As an IT admin, I am glad that I cannot read the documents stored on my CryptPad server. As a user, it feels good that I can control who gets to read my documents. There is no reason to use Google Docs or Microsoft 365 any more!</p>

Very reassuring for new users who get confused/intimidated by techy UIs with dozens of buttons. Will definitely upgrade when independent journalism funding improves. For now, tho, this pad is a great way for new teams to safely connect e.g. as here in the vast Pacific, across many timezones. </p>

Very similar to the Microsoft Office &amp; LibreOffice software suites and would definitely say it's a smooth transition from those offerings to the CryptPad software suite.

    <p>I love that with CryptPad there is finally a privacy-friendly and open-source, still fully-featured alternative to well-known Google services. I love the ease of use and the simple yet genius security concept behind sharing document links which ensure that only end-users can read the content. And I love the spirit behind the product and their creators. It's really great to see that there are companies like XWiki SAS that believe both in privacy and free and open-source software products.</p>

    <p>CryptPad has great sharing options, and includes online concurrent editing. That makes it my default suggestion anytime someone wants to share documents: it satisfies the shared editing like in Google Docs, it includes spreadsheets, and it has folders that I can share with a group. I now have a single online service for collaboration... and I know I can export my own data any time if my projects grow in size (for me to host and directly manage, eg. P2P).</p>

    <p>The sandboxing layer of encryption is fantastic and the free account without restriction of features is a brilliant way to not turn people off. I recommend it's usage to anyone looking for something in this field. We are now running out of space and as a somewhat techy person I am self-hosting Cryptpad on our group's server, but there are a lot of people I'm sure who can't do that and I hope you are receiving some subscription finances from those that can afford it.</p>

    <p>In our modern world we share share data in our professional and private life to conveniently engage with other people every day. But this convenience comes at a cost. Your data reveals a lot about you and your businesses, your thoughts, your partners, your loved ones, and it can easily be used to harm you. This is not exclusively, but very important to investigative journalists, human rights defenders, and members of oppressed and marginalized groups. That is why these data must be protected. </p>

And even with the premium account, it requires just an email (which is still more privacy focused than Google).  It is about doing what you need to do without mining more data, or trying to dig deeper to lock you into one ecosystem.  Also the loading screen gives a fun kind of "hacker person" vibe while also giving an idea what it is doing.</p>

    <p>Open source is a huge amount of the appeal.  On top of being pretty much the only online collaborative document editor I can trust, the fact that anybody can deploy it and audit it and increases that trust.  Allowing free use while also providing extra support via subscription also seems like a good model for longevity of the project.  I really hope to see it continue to flourish, and perhaps become a subscriber myself soon!</p>

3. It has a free option and a paid with extra features so a sustainable model.
