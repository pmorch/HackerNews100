                                        <p>LONDON (AP) — European Union privacy watchdogs fined TikTok 530 million euros ($600 million) on Friday after a <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-europe-data-privacy-ireland-a01b6717a95ce2d36021bda80994f151">four-year investigation</a></span> found that the video sharing app’s data transfers to China breached strict data privacy rules in the EU. </p><p>Ireland’s Data Protection Commission also sanctioned TikTok for not being transparent with users about where their personal data was being sent and it ordered the company to comply with the rules within six months. </p><p>The Irish national watchdog serves as TikTok’s lead data privacy regulator in the 27-nation EU because the company’s European headquarters is based in Dublin. </p><p>“TikTok failed to verify, guarantee and demonstrate that the personal data of (European) users, remotely accessed by staff in China, was afforded a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the EU,” Deputy Commissioner Graham Doyle said in a statement. </p>
    
<p>TikTok said it disagreed with the decision and plans to appeal. </p><p>The company said in a blog post that the decision focuses on a “select period” ending in May 2023, before it embarked on a data localization project called Project Clover that involved building <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-data-privacy-china-europe-4d0dd2f7eb39bfdcbb5e7a85cc26e8da">three data centers</a></span> in Europe. </p>



<p>“The facts are that Project Clover has some of the most stringent data protections anywhere in the industry, including unprecedented independent oversight by NCC Group, a leading European cybersecurity firm,” said Christine Grahn, TikTok’s European head of public policy and government relations. “The decision fails to fully consider these considerable data security measures.”</p>
    
    
    
<p>TikTok, whose parent company ByteDance is based in China, has been under scrutiny in Europe over how it handles personal information of its users amid concerns from Western officials that it poses a security risk over user data sent to China. In 2023, the Irish watchdog also fined the company hundreds of millions of euros in a separate <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-data-privacy-europe-regulation-fine-8ebacba7646ef872fb8e85a1bcb93876">child privacy investigation</a></span>. </p>
    
<p>The Irish watchdog said its investigation found that TikTok failed to address “potential access by Chinese authorities” to European users’ personal data under Chinese laws on anti-terrorism, counter-espionage, cybersecurity and national intelligence that were identified as “materially diverging” from EU standards.</p><p>Grahn said TikTok has “has never received a request for European user data from the Chinese authorities, and has never provided European user data to them.” </p><p>Under the EU rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, European user data can only be transferred outside of the bloc if there are safeguards in place to ensure the same level of protection. </p><p>Grahn said TikTok strongly disagreed with the Irish regulator’s argument that it didn’t carry out “necessary assessments” for data transfers, saying it sought advice from law firms and experts. She said TikTok was being “singled out” even though it uses the “same legal mechanisms” that thousands of other companies in Europe does and its approach is “in line” with EU rules. </p><p>The investigation, which opened in September 2021, also found that TikTok’s privacy policy at the time did not name third countries, including China, where user data was transferred. The watchdog said the policy, which has since been updated, failed to explain that data processing involved “remote access to personal data stored in Singapore and the United States by personnel based in China.”</p>
    
<p>TikTok faces further scrutiny from the Irish regulator, which said that the company had provided inaccurate information to throughout the inquiry by saying that it didn’t store European user data on Chinese servers. It wasn’t until April that it informed the regulator that it discovered in February that some data had in fact been stored on Chinese servers. </p><p>Doyle said that the watchdog is taking the recent developments “very seriously” and “considering what further regulatory action may be warranted.” </p>

<section id="abstract">

Third-party (<abbr title="also known as">AKA</abbr> cross-site) cookies are harmful to the web, and must be removed from the web platform. This finding explains why they must be removed, and examines the challenges in removing them. We highlight some use cases that depend on third-party cookies and offer some examples of designed-for-purpose technologies that can replace them. Specification authors are expected to ensure they do not undermine the benefits of removing third-party cookies when proposing new web platform technologies.

</section>

<section id="sotd">
This document is an agreed finding and reflects the consensus of the <abbr title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</abbr>.
</section>

## Introduction

We consider privacy a core design principle and differentiator for the web platform (see: [Ethical Web Principles](https://www.w3.org/TR/ethical-web-principles/#privacy), [Unsanctioned Web Tracking](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/unsanctioned-tracking/), [Private Browsing Modes](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/private-browsing-modes/), [Privacy Principles](https://www.w3.org/TR/privacy-principles/), [Security &amp; Privacy Questionnaire](https://www.w3.org/TR/security-privacy-questionnaire/)).

Many browsers have restricted third-party cookies (see: [Webkit](https://webkit.org/blog/10218/full-third-party-cookie-blocking-and-more/), [Mozilla](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/firefox-rolls-out-total-cookie-protection-by-default-to-all-users-worldwide/)). Unfortunately, [not all browsers have followed suit](https://privacysandbox.com/intl/en_us/news/privacy-sandbox-update/). The TAG calls for all browsers to drop support for third-party cookies, as this provides an opportunity to further improve the privacy preserving features of the web platform.

Removing third-party cookies from the web platform is not without complications. There are use cases for third-party cookies that need to be preserved, and pitfalls we need to be careful to avoid while doing so. This document sets out some aspects that specification editors and implementors should be aware of in order to make sure we ultimately [leave the web better than we found it](https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/#leave-the-web-better) after third-party cookies are removed.

## Why remove third party cookies?

Cookies were [originally designed](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2109.html) for recognizing repeat visitors to a website, but they were soon repurposed for use cases like: login and single sign-on; tracking state (like putting shopping choices into a cart); tracking to better target advertising; detecting fraud; measurement and attribution of ad clicks. Third party cookies (cookies set by someone other than the website being used) have introduced additional vectors for cookies to be used as a data collection mechanism across web sites. This increase in data collection and sharing about people using the web - often in a way that is opaque or incomprehensible to a web user - results in decreased individual and collective privacy.

[Third-party cookies](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-11#name-third-party-cookies) in particular are a key technology supporting tracking networks, which have been [identified as a major threat to privacy](https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis.html#name-privacy-considerations). These tracking networks entail concentrating data in the hands of - and thus giving greater power to - intermediaries with a presence across many sites, away from the individual sites a person is actually visiting. This centralizing effect has repercussions on innovation and accountability, beyond what is in scope for discussion here.

We maintain that [security and privacy are essential](https://w3ctag.github.io/ethical-web-principles/#privacy) on the web; a reduction in privacy also has implications for [freedom of expression](https://w3ctag.github.io/ethical-web-principles/#expression), [supporting healthy communities](https://w3ctag.github.io/ethical-web-principles/#community) and the [enhancement of individual control and power](https://w3ctag.github.io/ethical-web-principles/#control).

## Use cases previously met by third-party cookies

Some features of the web that people have come to expect, and which greatly improve user experience, currently depend on third-party cookies. Continuing to support these use cases is important. It is better to approach this with replacement technologies that are designed-for-purpose and built to respect user privacy. Any proposal that acts as a general-purpose replacement for third-party cookies would need to be accompanied by evidence that it does not recreate the same issues.

Some of the use cases that are important enough to justify the creation of purpose-specific solutions include federated identity, authorizing access to cross-site resources, and fraud mitigation. There is also active investigation of cross-site information in advertising, for both measurement and targeting purposes.

In all cases, it is important to continually review how such proposals might interact with other emerging or proposed APIs. Be aware that a set of new technologies which carry minimal risk individually, could be used in combination for tracking or profiling of web users.

## Leaving the web better than we found it

We support removing third-party cookies from the web platform, and we embrace the opportunity to improve the privacy features of the web. When we review new technologies to replace third-party cookies, we need to ensure that the replacements do not recreate the same pitfalls to privacy.

The TAG considers each new technology proposal *both* individually, *and* as they fit together with the web platform as a whole. The web must be cross-platform, so multi-implementer (multi-browser) support and developer support for privacy-related specifications is essential if they are going to achieve the goal of increasing privacy on the web. When we consider whether something makes the web platform better, we should be explicit about what the baseline for comparison is. Is a proposal better for privacy when compared to usage of third-party cookies? Or when compared with a web free from third-party cookies altogether? What about when some user agents restrict third-party cookies, but others do not?

Many varied proposals are being incubated in W3C Community Groups (e.g., [PATCG](https://patcg.github.io/), [Privacy CG](https://github.com/privacycg/), [WICG](https://wicg.io/)) as well as outside (e.g., [Privacy Sandbox](https://www.privacysandbox.com/)), and in these incubation stages multi-stakeholder support, consensus, and possible timelines for standardization are uncertain, and far from guaranteed.

We want to emphasize that as any replacement proposals progress, implementations should have a strong commitment toward, and reasonable time frame for, removing third-party cookies.

We are also wary of new mechanisms being introduced that could be abused together with cookies, fingerprinting surface or other tools, for greater privacy invasion.
Given this context, we see an urgency to have a strict timeline for the removal of third-party cookies.

All proposers of new web platform technologies are expected to be able to explain and justify the benefits and trade-offs of their proposal. It is particularly important that proposals which aim to fill gaps left by the removal of third-party cookies provide clear and concrete evidence that individual and collective privacy is still preserved; especially proposals which involve profiling, cross-context recognition, or otherwise aggregating or sharing of web user data between parties. We encourage that proposals claiming to improve privacy on the web platform undergo independent review and analysis; the burden of proof is on the proposers, not reviewers, to justify additions and changes to the web platform. The benefits to web platform users of the removal of third-party cookies must not be undermined by user agents or site authors in other ways.

We are strongly in favor of innovations to build sustainable business models on the web platform, but an in-depth discussion of the various possibilities are outside of the scope of this document. From an architectural standpoint, web standards should avoid encoding particular business models that are available to authors, publishers, and web content creators.

In conclusion, when accommodating changes caused by the removal of third-party cookies, we should avoid introducing new technologies that, when deployed either individually or in combination, effectively preserve the status quo of harmful tracking and surveillance on the web.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
												<p>An employee at Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company <strong>xAI</strong>&nbsp;leaked a private key on <strong>GitHub</strong> that for the past two months could have allowed anyone to query private xAI large language models (LLMs) which appear to have been custom made for working with internal data from Musk’s companies, including <strong>SpaceX</strong>, <strong>Tesla</strong> and <strong>Twitter/X, </strong>KrebsOnSecurity has learned.</p>
<div id="attachment_71170"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71170" decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/x-ai.png" alt="" width="748" height="497"></p><p id="caption-attachment-71170">Image: Shutterstock, @sdx15.</p></div>
<p><strong>Philippe Caturegli</strong>, “chief hacking officer” at the security consultancy <strong>Seralys</strong>, was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/caturegli_yo-xai-your-devs-are-leaking-api-keys-on-activity-7321566948020953088-6KXj?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAAliaMB3BQO-WOS-eUh-XU4HAd5h8pTzkI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first to publicize the leak</a> of credentials for an x.ai application programming interface (API) exposed in the GitHub code repository of a technical staff member at xAI.</p>
<p>Caturegli’s post on LinkedIn caught the attention of researchers at <strong>GitGuardian</strong>, a company that specializes in detecting and remediating exposed secrets in public and proprietary environments. GitGuardian’s systems constantly scan GitHub and other code repositories for exposed API keys, and fire off automated alerts to affected users.</p>
<p>GitGuardian’s <strong>Eric Fourrier</strong> told KrebsOnSecurity the exposed API key had access to several unreleased models of <strong>Grok</strong>, the AI chatbot developed by xAI. In total, GitGuardian found the key had access to at least 60 fine-tuned and private LLMs.</p>
<p>“The credentials can be used to access the X.ai API with the identity of the user,” GitGuardian wrote in an email explaining their findings to xAI. “The associated account not only has access to public Grok models (grok-2-1212, etc) but also to what appears to be unreleased (grok-2.5V), development (research-grok-2p5v-1018), and private models (tweet-rejector, grok-spacex-2024-11-04).”</p>
<p>Fourrier found GitGuardian had alerted the xAI employee about the exposed API key nearly two months ago — on March 2. But as of April 30, when GitGuardian directly alerted xAI’s security team to the exposure, the key was still valid and usable. xAI told GitGuardian to report the matter through its bug bounty program at <strong>HackerOne</strong>, but just a few hours later the repository containing the API key was removed from GitHub.</p>
<p>“It looks like some of these internal LLMs were fine-tuned on SpaceX data, and some were fine-tuned with Tesla data,” Fourrier said. “I definitely don’t think a Grok model that’s fine-tuned on SpaceX data is intended to be exposed publicly.”</p>
<p>xAI did not respond to a request for comment. Nor did the 28-year-old xAI technical staff member whose key was exposed.<span id="more-71165"></span></p>
<p><strong>Carole Winqwist</strong>, chief marketing officer at GitGuardian, said giving potentially hostile users free access to private LLMs is a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>“If you’re an attacker and you have direct access to the model and the back end interface for things like Grok, it’s definitely something you can use for further attacking,” she said. “An attacker could it use for prompt injection, to tweak the (LLM) model to serve their purposes, or try to implant code into the supply chain.”</p>
<p>The inadvertent exposure of internal LLMs for xAI comes as Musk’s so-called <strong>Department of Government Efficiency</strong> (DOGE) has been feeding sensitive government records into artificial intelligence tools. In February, <strong>The Washington Post</strong> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/06/elon-musk-doge-ai-department-education/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> DOGE officials were feeding data from across the Education Department into AI tools to probe the agency’s programs and spending.</p>
<p>The Post said DOGE plans to replicate this process across many departments and agencies, accessing the back-end software at different parts of the government and then using AI technology to extract and sift through information about spending on employees and programs.</p>
<p>“Feeding sensitive data into AI software puts it into the possession of a system’s operator, increasing the chances it will be leaked or swept up in cyberattacks,” Post reporters wrote.</p>
<p>Wired reported in March that DOGE has <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gsai-chatbot-1500-federal-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deployed a proprietary chatbot called GSAi</a> to 1,500 federal workers at the <strong>General Services Administration</strong>, part of an effort to automate tasks previously done by humans as DOGE continues its purge of the federal workforce.</p>
<p>A <strong>Reuters</strong> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/musks-doge-using-ai-snoop-us-federal-workers-sources-say-2025-04-08/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> last month said Trump administration officials told some U.S. government employees that DOGE is using AI to surveil at least one federal agency’s communications for hostility to President Trump and his agenda. Reuters wrote that the DOGE team has heavily deployed Musk’s Grok AI chatbot as part of their work slashing the federal government, although Reuters said it could not establish exactly how Grok was being used.</p>
<p>Caturegli said while there is no indication that federal government or user data could be accessed through the exposed x.ai API key, these private models are likely trained on proprietary data and may unintentionally expose details related to internal development efforts at xAI, Twitter, or SpaceX.</p>
<p>“The fact that this key was publicly exposed for two months and granted access to internal models is concerning,” Caturegli said. “This kind of long-lived credential exposure highlights weak key management and insufficient internal monitoring, raising questions about safeguards around developer access and broader operational security.”</p>

				<p>One part of my work for the ScummVM project is helping to keep the server infrastructure up and running, including our primary server, which hosts our website, wiki, forums, and some internal applications.</p>
<p>About three weeks ago, I started receiving monitoring notifications indicating an increased load on the MariaDB server. This in itself is nothing too unusual. It usually means nothing but a sudden influx of new visitors, and in most cases, it is just a link being shared somewhere or a single IP trying to annoy us.</p>
<p>The notifications popped up and disappeared as quickly as they appeared. I started to look into the log files of our web server, and I didn’t notice anything too unusual, maybe a bit more background noise. This went on for a couple of days without seriously impacting our server or accessibility–it was a tad slower than usual.</p>
<p>And then the website went down.</p>
<p>We use a stack consisting of Apache2, PHP-FPM, and MariaDB to host the web applications. The server logs revealed that everything was saturated. Apache2 refused to accept new connections, the PHP-FPM pools were completely filled, and MariaDB also had no connections left.</p>
<p>Now, it was time to find out what was going on. Hoping that it was just one single IP trying to annoy us, I opened the access log of the day and was greeted by this:</p>

</code></pre><p>For privacy reasons, I replaced the real IPs with 127.0.0.1, but trust me, there were many IPs–around 35.000, to be precise–from residential networks all over the world. At this scale, it makes no sense to even consider blocking individual IPs, subnets, or entire networks. Due to the open nature of the project, geo-blocking isn’t an option either.</p>
<p>The main problem is time. The URLs accessed in the attack are the most expensive ones the wiki offers since they heavily depend on the database and are highly dynamic, requiring some processing time in PHP. This is the worst-case scenario since it throws the server into a death spiral.</p>
<p>First, the database starts to lag or even refuse new connections. This, combined with the steadily increasing server load, leads to slower PHP execution. Eventually, all resources in the PHP-FPM pools are used up, and since Apache2 doesn’t get a reply from PHP-FPM in time, it waits until it runs out of free connections. At this point, the website dies. Restarting the stack immediately solves the problem for a couple of minutes at best until the server starves again.</p>
<p>To bring the website back up, I cranked up the configuration of our stack to insane values, risking that the server would eventually run out of memory.</p>
<p>I needed a proper solution, something that takes the load away from the web application stack.</p>
<h2 id="hi-anubis">Hi, Anubis!</h2>
<p><a href="https://anubis.techaro.lol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anubis</a>
 is a program that checks incoming connections, processes them, and only forwards “good” connections to the web application. To do so, Anubis sits between the server or proxy responsible for accepting HTTP/HTTPS and the server that provides the application.</p>
<p>Designed to protect websites from AI scraper bots, Anubis primarily focuses on parameters like the user agent sent with the request and looks for oddities in the connection. “Known good” and harmless clients are always accepted, and “Known bad” clients are always denied. In case the defaults are not working for your application, Anubis allows extensive configuration with customizable <a href="https://anubis.techaro.lol/docs/admin/policies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bot policy definitions</a>
.</p>
<p>And then, there’s the in-between, the part where the real magic happens. Many bots disguise themselves as standard browsers to circumvent filtering based on the user agent. So, if something claims to be a browser, it should behave like one, right? To verify this, Anubis presents a <a href="https://anubis.techaro.lol/docs/design/why-proof-of-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proof-of-work challenge</a>
 that the browser needs to solve. If the challenge passes, it forwards the incoming request to the web application protected by Anubis; otherwise, the request is denied.</p>
<p><em>Solving</em> the challenge–which is valid for one week once passed–takes a couple of seconds on the client side, occupying CPU time. <em>Checking</em> if the browser solved the very fast on the server side, taking up virtually no resources.</p>

<p>As a regular user, all you’ll notice is a loading screen when accessing the website. As an attacker with stupid bots, you’ll never get through. As an attacker with clever bots, you’ll end up exhausting your own resources. As an AI company trying to scrape the website, you’ll quickly notice that CPU time can be expensive if used on a large scale.</p>
<p>Long story short, deploying Anubis immediately solved our issues. In fact, you can see the exact time in our monitoring.</p>

</figure>



<p>I didn’t get a single notification afterward. The server load has never been lower. The attack itself is still ongoing at the time of writing this article. To me, Anubis is not only a blocker for AI scrapers. Anubis is a DDoS protection.</p>

<p>The future of <a href="https://deno.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Deno Land Inc.</a> is not looking bright. Their commercial product <a href="https://deno.com/deploy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Deno Deploy</a> claims to be “edge” hosting with “massive global scale”.</p><blockquote><p>JavaScript applications on Deno Deploy run server-side logic geographically close to users, offering low latency and great performance.</p></blockquote><p>Except that’s <em>a bit of a stretch</em> if we’re being honest.</p><p>Deno provide a <a href="https://docs.deno.com/deploy/manual/regions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">list of regions</a> in their documentation (take a peek if you want spoilers). Between ’23–2024 I gave Deno Deploy a fair shot but my <a href="https://dbushell.com/notes/2024-09-03T05:44Z/">personal experience</a> was negative. I left <a href="https://github.com/denoland/deploy_feedback/issues/505" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">feedback amongst others’</a> and moved on.</p><p>Well, I did keep an eye on one thing…</p><h2 id="serverless-anyone">Serverless, anyone?</h2><p>Back in <a href="https://github.com/denoland/docs/commit/6d7d022ffa14595a23450bb7370743cd821b1958" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">January 2024</a> a few people noted that Deno Deploy had dropped from 35 regions to <strong>just twelve (12)</strong> worldwide.</p><blockquote><p>For example, Seoul moved to Tokyo, response times went from 8ms to 42ms!</p><p><cite><a href="https://x.com/Elefunc/status/1750442433144647933" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@Elefunc on <del>Twitter</del></a></cite></p></blockquote><p>I would have been happy seeing 42ms to begin with. Anyway, the original 35 wasn’t impressive but twelve is frankly pitiful if I’m being brutally honest, which I am (because it gets worse). I’ve never quite understand what “serverless” means but I think Deno are taking it too literally.</p><p>To provide an unfair comparison, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/network/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cloudflare</a> boast “335 cities in 125+ countries”. I don’t know what a respectable number is for Deno Deploy. Only that it’s between 12 and 335 but I suspect we’ll never find out.</p><p><a href="https://bunny.net/network/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bunny</a> advertise 119 Point of Presences (PoPs) in 77 countries.

Is that their own infrastructure, or Deno’s <a href="https://deno.com/enterprise" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">enterprise</a> offering? <a href="https://deno.com/blog/netlify-subhosting" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Netlify uses Deno</a> for edge functions but their 70+ PoPs is restricted to <a href="https://www.netlify.com/platform/core/high-performance-edge/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“High-Performance Edge”</a> (with a “custom” price tag). Now I’m curious, if (big if) Enterprise Deno is doing well, why scale back for us mortals?</p><p>By <a href="https://github.com/denoland/docs/commit/26786eb3fd07d908d5bf650f0166b2d104158d31" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">December 2024</a> Deno Deploy dropped from twelve to <strong>seven (7)</strong> regions.

This leaves only Singapore to serve East Asia, and presumably Oceania.

I feel like there should be a name for this <a href="https://dbushell.com/2025/03/01/never-have-never-will/">type of commit</a>.

Our team was small (~23
employees), and we knew that we needed many more people to execute on our
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikn7ovpjdIg">audacious vision</a>.  While we had
had success hiring in our personal networks, those networks now felt tapped;
we needed to get further afield.  As is our wont, we got together as a team
and brainstormed: how could we get a bigger and broader applicant pool?  One
of our engineers, Sean, shared some personal experience: that
<a href="https://oxide.computer/principles">Oxide’s principles and values</a> were very
personally important to him — but that when he explained them to people
unfamiliar with the company, they were (understandably?) dismissed as
corporate claptrap.  Sean had found, however, that there was one surefire way
to cut through the skepticism:  to explain our approach to compensation.
Maybe, Sean wondered, we should talk about it publicly?</p><p>"I could certainly write a blog entry explaining it," I offered.  At this
suggestion, the team practically lunged with enthusiasm: the reaction was so
uniformly positive that I have to assume that everyone was sick of explaining
this most idiosyncratic aspect of Oxide to friends and family.  So what was
the big deal about our compensation?  Well, as a I wrote in the resulting
piece,
<a href="https://oxide.computer/blog/compensation-as-a-reflection-of-values">Compensation
as a Reflection of Values</a>, our compensation is not merely transparent, but
uniform.  The piece — unsurprisingly, given the evergreen hot topic that is
compensation — got a ton of attention.  While some of that attention was
negative (despite the piece trying to frontrun every HN hater!), much of it was
positive — and everyone seemed to be at least intrigued.</p><p>And in terms of its initial purpose, the piece succeeded beyond our wildest
imagination: it brought a surge of new folks interested in the company.  Best
of all, the people new to Oxide were interested for all of the right reasons:
not the compensation <em>per se</em>, but for the values that the compensation
represents.  The deeper they dug, the more they found to like — and many who
learned about Oxide for the first time through that blog entry we now count as
long-time, cherished colleagues.</p><p>That blog entry was a long time ago now, and today we have ~75 employees
(and a <a href="https://oxide.computer/blog/the-cloud-computer">shipping product</a>!);
how is our compensation model working out for us?</p></div></div><div><h2 data-sectnum=""><a href="#_how_its_going">How it’s going<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" role="img"><g fill="currentColor"><path d="m6.586 12.243 1.59-1.591a.75.75 0 0 1 1.061 0l.354.353a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06L8 13.658A4 4 0 0 1 2.343 8l1.591-1.591a.75.75 0 0 1 1.06 0l.354.354a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-1.59 1.591a2 2 0 1 0 2.828 2.829M12.066 9.591a.75.75 0 0 1-1.06 0l-.354-.354a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l1.59-1.591a2 2 0 1 0-2.828-2.829l-1.59 1.591a.75.75 0 0 1-1.061 0l-.354-.353a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06L8 2.342A4 4 0 0 1 13.657 8z"></path><path d="M9.945 5.702a.75.75 0 0 0-1.061 0L5.702 8.884a.75.75 0 0 0 0 1.06l.353.354a.75.75 0 0 0 1.061 0l3.182-3.182a.75.75 0 0 0 0-1.06z"></path></g></svg></a></h2><div><p>Before we get into our deeper findings, two updates that are so important that
we have updated the blog entry itself.  First, the dollar figure itself
continues to increase over time (as of this writing in 2025, $207,264);
things definitely haven’t gotten (and aren’t
getting!) any cheaper.  And second, we <em>did</em> introduce variable compensation for
some sales roles.  Yes, those roles can make more than the rest of us — but
they can also make less, too.  And, importantly:  if/when those folks are
making more than the rest of us, it’s because they’re selling a lot — a
result that can be celebrated by everyone!</p><p>Those critical updates out of the way, how is it working?  There have been a
lot of surprises along the way, mostly (all?) of the positive variety.  A
couple of things that we have learned:</p><p><strong>People take their own performance really seriously.</strong>  When some outsiders
hear about our compensation model, they insist that it can’t possibly work
because "everyone will slack off." I have come to find this concern to be more
revealing of the person making the objection than of our model, as our
experience has been in fact the opposite: in my one-on-one conversations with
team members, a frequent subject of conversation is people who are concerned
that they aren’t doing enough (or that they aren’t doing the right thing, or
that their work is progressing slower than they would like).  I find my job is
often to help quiet this inner critic while at the same time stoking what I
feel is a healthy urge:  when one holds one’s colleagues in high regard, there
is an especially strong desire to help contribute — to prove oneself worthy
of a superlative team.  Our model allows people to focus on their own
contribution (whatever it might be).</p><p><strong>People take hiring <em>really</em> seriously.</strong>  When evaluating a peer (rather
than a subordinate), one naturally has high expectations — and because (in
the sense of our wages, anyway) everyone at Oxide is a peer, it shouldn’t be
surprising that folks have very high expectations for potential future
colleagues.  And because the
<a href="https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/3">Oxide hiring process</a> is writing
intensive, it allows for candidates to be thoroughly reviewed by Oxide
employees — who are tough graders!  It is, bluntly, really hard to get
a job at Oxide.</p><p><strong>It allows us to internalize the importance of different roles.</strong>  One of the
more incredible (and disturbingly frequent) objections I have heard is: "But
is that what you’ll pay support folks?" I continue to find this question
offensive, but I no longer find it surprising: the specific dismissal of
support roles reveals a widespread and corrosive devaluation of those closest
to customers. My rejoinder is simple: think of the best support engineers
you’ve worked with; what were they worth? Anyone who has shipped complex
systems knows these extraordinary people — calm under fire, deeply technical,
brilliantly resourceful, profoundly empathetic — are invaluable to the
business. So what if you built a team entirely of folks like that? The
response has usually been: well, sure, if you’re going to only hire <em>those</em>
folks. Yeah, we are — and we have!</p><p><strong>It allows for fearless versatility.</strong> A bit of a corollary to the
above, but subtly different: even though we (certainly!) hire and select for
certain roles, our uniform compensation means we can in fact think primarily
in terms of <em>people</em> unconfined by those roles.  That is, we can be very fluid
about what we’re working on, without fear of how it will affect a perceived
career trajectory.  As a concrete example: we had a large customer that wanted
to put in place a program for some of the additional work they wanted to see
in the product.  The complexity of their needs required dedicated program
management resources that we couldn’t spare, and in another more static
company we would have perhaps looked to hire.  But in our case, two folks came
together — CJ from operations, and Izzy from support — and did something
together that was in some regards new to both of them (and was neither of
their putative full-time jobs!)  The result was indisputably successful:  the
customer loved the results, and two terrific people got a chance to work
closely together without worrying about who was dotted-lined to whom.</p><p><strong>It has allowed us to organizationally scale.</strong> Many organizations describe
themselves as flat, and a reasonable rebuttal to this are the "shadow
hierarchies" created by the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tyranny_of_Structurelessness">tyranny of
structurelessness</a>.  And indeed, if one were to read (say)
<a href="https://cdn.fastly.steamstatic.com/apps/valve/Valve_NewEmployeeHandbook.pdf">Valve’s
(in)famous handbook</a>, the autonomy seems great — but the stack ranking
decidedly less so, especially because the handbook is conspicuously silent on
the subject of compensation.  (Unsurprisingly,
<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/ex-valve-employee-describes-ruthless-industry-politics/">compensation
was weaponized at Valve</a>, which descended into
<a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/07/wireduk-valve-jeri-ellsworth/">toxic
cliquishness</a>.) While we believe that autonomy <em>is</em> important to do one’s best
work, we also have a clear structure at Oxide in that Steve Tuck (Oxide
co-founder and CEO) is
in charge.  He has to be:  he is held accountable to our investors — and he
must have the latitude to make decisions.  Under Steve, it is true that
we <em>don’t</em> have layers of middle management.  Might we need some in the
future?  Perhaps, but what fraction of middle management in a company is
dedicated to — at some level — determining who gets what in terms of
compensation?  What happens when you eliminate that burden completely?</p><p><strong>It frees us to both lead and follow.</strong> We expect that
every Oxide employee has the capacity to lead others — and we tap this
capacity frequently.  Of course, a company in which everyone is trying to
direct all traffic all the time would be a madhouse, so we also very much rely
on following one another too!  Just as our compensation model allows us to
internalize the values of different roles, it allows us to appreciate the
value of <strong>both</strong> leading and following, and empowers us each with the judgement
to know when to do which.  This isn’t always easy or free of ambiguity, but
this particular dimension of our versatility has been essential — and
our compensation model serves to encourage it.</p><p><strong>It causes us to hire carefully and deliberately.</strong> Of course, one should
<em>always</em> hire carefully and deliberately, but this often isn’t the case — and
many a startup has been ruined by reckless expansion of headcount.  One of the
roots of this can be found in a dirty open secret of Silicon Valley middle
management: its ranks are taught to grade their career by the number of
reports in their organization.  Just as if you were to compensate software
engineers based on the number of lines of code they wrote, this results in
perverse incentives and predictable disasters — and any Silicon Valley vet
will have plenty of horror stories of middle management jockeying for reqs or
reorgs when they should have been focusing on product and customers.  When
you can eliminate middle management, you eliminate this incentive.  We grow
the team not because of someone’s animal urges to have the largest possible
organization, but rather because we are at a point where adding people will
allow us to better serve our market and customers.</p><p><strong>It liberates feedback from compensation.</strong> Feedback is, of course, very
important:  we all want to know when and where we’re doing the right thing!
And of course, we want to know too where there is opportunity for improvement.
However, Silicon Valley has historically tied feedback so tightly to
compensation that it has ceased to even pretend to be constructive:  if it
needs to be said, performance review processes aren’t, in fact, about
improving the performance of the team, but rather quantifying and
stack-ranking that performance for purposes of compensation.  When
compensation is moved aside, there is a kind of liberation for feedback
itself:  because feedback is now entirely earnest, it can be expressed and
received thoughtfully.</p><p><strong>It allows people to focus on doing the right thing.</strong>  In a world of
traditional, compensation-tied performance review, the organizational priority
is around those things that affect compensation — even at the expense of
activity that clearly benefits the company.  This leads to all sorts of wild
phenomena, and most technology workers will be able to tell stories of doing
things that we’re clearly right for the company, but having to hide it from
management that thought only narrowly in terms of their own stated KPIs and
MBOs.  By contrast, over and over (and over!) again, we have found that people
do the right thing at Oxide — even if (especially if?) no one is looking.
The beneficiary of that right thing?  More often than not, it’s our customers,
who have uniformly praised the team for going above and beyond.</p><p><strong>It allows us to focus on the work that matters.</strong>  Relatedly, when
compensation is non-uniform, the process to figure out (and maintain) that
non-uniformity is laborious.  All of that work — of line workers assembling
packets explaining themselves, of managers arming themselves with those
packets to fight in the arena of organizational combat, and then of those same
packets ultimately being regurgitated back onto something called a review — is <em>work</em>. Assuming such a process is executed perfectly (something which I
suppose is possible in the abstract, even though I personally have never seen
it), this is work that does not in fact advance the mission of the company.
Not having variable compensation gives us all of that time and energy back to
do the <em>actual</em> work — the stuff that matters.</p><p><strong>It has stoked an extraordinary sense of teamwork.</strong> For me personally — and
as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAFD2bq1_tU&amp;t=2854s">I relayed on an episode
of <em>Software Misadventures</em></a> — the highlights of my career have been being a
part of an extraordinary team.  The currency of a team is mutual trust, and
while uniform compensation certainly isn’t the only way to achieve that trust,
boy does it ever help!  As Steve and I have told one another more times that
we can count:  we are so lucky to work on this team, with its extraordinary
depth and breadth.</p><p>While our findings have been very positive, I would still reiterate what we
said four years ago:  we don’t know what the future holds, and it’s easier to
make an unwavering commitment to the transparency rather than the uniformity.
That said, the uniformity has had so many positive ramifications that the model
feels more important than ever.  We are beyond the point of this being a
curiosity; it’s been essential for building a mission-focused team taking on
a problem larger than ourselves.  So it’s not a fit for everyone — but if
you are seeking an extraordinary team solving hard problems in service to
customers, <a href="https://oxide.computer/careers">consider Oxide</a>!</p></div></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><span><span>Dangers come but dangers also go and when they do, the brain has an “all-clear” signal that teaches it to extinguish its fear. A new study in mice by MIT neuroscientists shows that the signal is the release of dopamine along a specific interregional brain circuit. The research therefore pinpoints a potentially critical mechanism of mental health, restoring calm when it works, but prolonging anxiety or even post-traumatic stress disorder when it doesn’t.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>“Dopamine is essential to initiate fear extinction,” said Michele Pignatelli di Spinazzola, co-author of the new study from the lab of senior author <a href="https://picower.mit.edu/susumu-tonegawa">Susumu Tonegawa</a>, Picower Professor of biology and neuroscience at the RIKEN-MIT Laboratory for Neural Circuit Genetics in The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and an HHMI Investigator.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>In 2020 <a href="https://picower.mit.edu/news/these-neurons-extinguishing-fear-its-own-reward">Tonegawa’s lab showed</a> that learning to be afraid, and then learning when that’s no longer necessary, result from a competition between populations of cells in the brain’s amygdala region. When a mouse learns that a place is “dangerous” (because it gets a little foot shock there), the fear memory is encoded by neurons in the anterior of the basolateral amygdala (aBLA) that express the gene Rspo2. When the mouse then learns that a place is no longer associated with danger (because they wait there and the zap doesn’t recur), neurons in the posterior basolateral amygdala (pBLA) that express the gene Ppp1r1b encode a new fear extinction memory that overcomes the original dread. Notably those same neurons encode feelings of reward, helping to explain why it feels so good when we realize that an expected danger has dwindled.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>In the new study, the lab, led by former members Xiangyu Zhang and Katelyn Flick, sought to determine what prompts these amygdala neurons to encode these memories. The rigorous set of experiments the team reports in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> show that it’s dopamine sent to the different amygdala populations from distinct groups of neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA).</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>“Our study uncovers a precise mechanism by which dopamine helps the brain unlearn fear,” said Zhang, who also led the 2020 study and is now Senior Associate at Orbimed, a healthcare investment firm. “We found that dopamine activates specific amygdala neurons tied to reward, which in turn drive fear extinction. We now see that unlearning fear isn’t just about suppressing it—it’s a positive learning process powered by the brain’s reward machinery. This opens up new avenues for understanding and potentially treating fear-related disorders like PTSD.”</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>Forgetting fear</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The VTA was the lab’s prime suspect to be the source of the signal because the region is well known for encoding surprising experiences and instructing the brain, with dopamine, to learn from them. The first set of experiments in the paper used multiple methods for tracing neural circuits to see whether and how cells in the VTA and the amygdala connect. They found a clear pattern: Rspo2 neurons were targeted by dopaminergic neurons in the anterior and left and right sides of the VTA. Ppp1r1b neurons received dopaminergic input from neurons in the center and posterior sections of the VTA. The density of connections was greater on the Ppp1r1b neurons than for the Rspo2 ones.</span></span></span></p>

<figure role="group">


<figcaption>An edited version of a figure from the research shows the ventral tegmental area, highlighting dopamine-associated neurons in green and one that connects to the posterior amygdala (magnified in inset) in red.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p><span><span><span>The circuit tracing showed that dopamine is available to amygdala neurons that encode fear and its extinction, but do those neurons care about dopamine? The team showed that indeed they express “D1” receptors for the neuromodulator. Commensurate with the degree of dopamine connectivity, Ppp1r1b cells had more receptors than Rspo2 neurons.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Dopamine does a lot of things, so the next question was whether its activity in the amygdala actually correlated with fear encoding and extinction. Using a method to track and visualize it in the brain, the team watched dopamine in the amygdala as mice underwent a three-day experiment. On day one they went to an enclosure where they experienced three little zaps on the feet. On day two they went back to the enclosure for 45 minutes where they didn’t experience any new shocks –at first the mice froze in fear but then relaxed after about 15 minutes. On day 3 they returned again to test whether they had indeed extinguished the fear they showed at the beginning of day 2.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The dopamine activity tracking revealed that during the shocks on day 1, Rspo2 neurons had the larger response to dopamine, but in the early moments of day 2 when the anticipated shocks didn’t come and the mice eased up on freezing in fear, the Ppp1r1b neurons showed the stronger dopamine activity. More strikingly, the mice that learned to extinguish their fear most strongly also showed the greatest dopamine signal at those neurons.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>Causal connections</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The final sets of experiments sought to show that dopamine is not just available and associated with fear encoding and extinction, but also actually causes them. In one set, they turned to optogenetics, a technology that enables scientists to activate or quiet neurons with different colors of light. Sure enough, when they quieted VTA dopaminergic inputs in the pBLA, doing so impaired fear extinction. When they activated those inputs, it accelerated fear extinction. The researchers were surprised that when they activated VTA dopaminergic inputs into the aBLA they could reinstate fear even without any new foot shocks, impairing fear extinction.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The other way they confirmed a causal role for dopamine in fear encoding and extinction was to manipulate the amygdala neurons’ dopamine receptors. In Ppp1r1b neurons, overexpressing dopamine receptors impaired fear recall and promoted extinction, whereas knocking the receptors down impaired fear extinction. Meanwhile in the Rspo2 cells, knocking down receptors reduced the freezing behavior.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>“We showed that fear extinction requires VTA dopaminergic activity in the pBLA Ppp1r1b neurons by using optogenetic inhibition of VTA terminals and cell-type-specific knockdown of D1 receptors in these neurons,” the authors wrote.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The scientists are careful in the study to note that while they’ve identified the “teaching signal” for fear extinction learning, the broader phenomenon of fear extinction occurs brainwide, rather than in just this single circuit.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>But the circuit seems to be a key node to consider as drug developers and psychiatrists work to combat anxiety and PTSD, Pignatelli di Spinazzola said.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>“Fear learning and fear extinction provide a strong framework to study generalized anxiety and PTSD,” he said. “Our study investigates the underlying mechanisms suggesting multiple targets for a translational approach such as pBLA and use of dopaminergic modulation.”</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Marianna Rizzo is also a co-author of the study. Support for the research came from the RIKEN Center for Brain Science, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Freedom Together Foundation and The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory.</span></span></span></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>An Arizona woman who created a "laptop farm" in her home to help fake IT workers pose as US-based employees has pleaded guilty in a scheme that generated over $17 million for herself... and North Korea.</p>
<p>Christina Marie Chapman pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, and conspiracy to launder monetary instruments in a US District Court on Tuesday.</p>
<p>She is scheduled to be sentenced on June 16, and under the terms of her plea deal, all parties will recommend the court put her behind bars for between 94 and 111 months. Chapman was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/17/three_arrested_for_helping_north_korea/">arrested</a> in May.</p>

    

<p>According to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/usao-dc/media/1352191/dl">court documents</a>, Chapman ran a laptop farm out of her home from October 2020 to October 2023. During this time she hosted computers for overseas IT workers — who were posing as American citizens and residents — to ensure the devices had local IP addresses, making them appear to be in the US.</p>

        


        

<p>Chapman also helped the foreign fraudsters steal the identities of more than 70 US nationals, then use those identities to apply for remote IT jobs, according to the Feds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those who successfully obtained employment as part of the scam then received payroll checks at Chapman's home with direct deposits sent to her US bank accounts before ultimately being laundered and funneled to North Korea, and then potentially contributing to the DPRK's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/08/us_lazarus_group_crypto_seizure/">weapons programs</a>, the court document says.</p>

        

<p>It's unclear how much of the ill-gotten gains Chapman pocketed, but according to the Justice Department, Chapman's overseas IT workers received <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/arizona-woman-pleads-guilty-fraud-scheme-illegally-generated-17-million-revenue-north">more than $17.1 million</a> for their work. Much of the income was falsely reported to the IRS and Social Security Administration in the names of real US individuals whose identities had been stolen.</p>

</ul>
<p>Some of the overseas workers were hired at Fortune 500 companies, including a top-five television network, a premier Silicon Valley technology company, an aerospace and defense manufacturer, an American car manufacturer, a luxury retail chain, and a US-hallmark media and entertainment company.</p>
<p>The Norks specifically targeted some of these companies, likely for their sensitive IP and other valuable data in addition to providing a paycheck, and even "maintained postings for companies at which they wanted to insert IT workers," according to the DOJ.</p>
<p>In total, more than 300 US companies were scammed, and more than 70 people had false tax liabilities created in their name. Additionally, phony documents were submitted to the Department of Homeland Security on more than 100 occasions.</p>
<p>These types of scams have netted Pyongyang at least <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/13/doj_dpkr_fake_tech_worker_indictment/">$88 million</a> over six years. Earlier this week, <em>The Register</em> interviewed someone who was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/11/it_worker_scam/">twice targeted</a>. In both cases, the fraudsters used AI-based tools during video interviews with — wait for it — a security startup using AI to find vulnerabilities. ®</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/integrations">https://www.anthropic.com/news/integrations</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43859536">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Today we're announcing Integrations, a new way to connect your apps and tools to Claude. We're also expanding Claude's <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/research">Research</a> capabilities with an advanced mode that searches the web, your Google Workspace, and now your Integrations too. Claude can research for up to 45 minutes before delivering a comprehensive report, complete with citations. In addition to these updates, we're making web search available globally for all Claude users on paid plans.</p><h2 id="integrations">Integrations</h2><p>Last November, we launched the <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol">Model Context Protocol</a> (MCP)—an open standard connecting AI apps to tools and data. Until now, support for MCP was limited to Claude Desktop through local servers. Today, we're introducing Integrations, allowing Claude to work seamlessly with remote MCP servers across the web and desktop apps. Developers can build and host servers that enhance Claude’s capabilities, while users can discover and connect any number of these to Claude.</p><p>When you connect your tools to Claude, it gains deep context about your work—understanding project histories, task statuses, and organizational knowledge—and can take actions across every surface. Claude becomes a more informed collaborator, helping you execute complex projects in one place with expert assistance at every step.</p><p>To start, you can choose from Integrations for 10 popular services, including <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/platform/remote-mcp-server">Atlassian’s Jira and Confluence</a>, <a href="https://zapier.com/mcp">Zapier</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare/tree/main">Cloudflare</a>, <a href="https://www.intercom.com/blog/introducing-model-context-protocol-fin">Intercom</a>, <a href="https://developers.asana.com/docs/using-asanas-model-control-protocol-mcp-server">Asana</a>, <a href="https://developer.squareup.com/docs/mcp">Square</a>, <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-mcp/">Sentry</a>, <a href="https://www.paypal.ai/">PayPal</a>, <a href="https://linear.app/changelog/2025-05-01-mcp">Linear</a>, and <a href="https://api.dashboard.plaid.com/mcp/sse">Plaid</a>—with more to follow from companies like Stripe and GitLab. Developers can also create their own Integrations in as little as 30 minutes using our documentation or solutions like <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/remote-model-context-protocol-servers-mcp/">Cloudflare</a> that provide built-in OAuth authentication, transport handling, and integrated deployment.</p><p>Each integration drastically expands what Claude can do. Zapier, for example, connects thousands of apps through pre-built workflows, automating processes across your software stack. With the <a href="https://zapier.com/mcp">Zapier Integration</a>, Claude can access these apps and your custom workflows through conversation—even automatically pulling sales data from HubSpot and preparing meeting briefs based on your calendar.</p><p>With access to Atlassian’s Jira and Confluence, Claude can collaborate with you on building new products, managing tasks more effectively, and scaling your work by summarizing and creating multiple Confluence pages and Jira work items at once.</p><p>Connect Intercom to respond faster to user feedback. Intercom's AI agent Fin, now an MCP client, can take actions like filing bugs in Linear when users report issues. Chat with Claude to identify patterns and debug using Intercom's conversation history and user attributes—managing the entire workflow from user feedback to bug resolution in one conversation.</p><h2 id="advanced-research">Advanced Research</h2><p>We're introducing several new updates to build on our recently-released <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/research">Research</a> capability. Claude can now conduct deeper investigations across hundreds of internal and external sources, delivering more comprehensive reports in anywhere from five to 45 minutes.</p><p>With its new ability to do more complex research, available when you toggle on the Research button, Claude breaks down your request into smaller parts, investigating each deeply before compiling a comprehensive report. While most reports complete in five to 15 minutes, Claude may take up to 45 minutes for more complex investigations—work that would typically take hours of manual research.</p><p>We've also expanded Claude's data access. We launched Research with support for web search and Google Workspace, but now with Integrations, Claude can also search any application you connect. </p><p>When Claude incorporates information from sources, it provides clear citations that link directly to the original material. This transparency ensures you can confidently use Claude's research findings, knowing exactly where each insight originated.</p><h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2><p>Integrations and advanced Research are now available in beta on the Max, Team, and Enterprise plans, and will soon be available on Pro. Web search is now globally available to all <a href="http://claude.ai/">Claude.ai</a> paid plans. For more information on getting started with Integrations, MCP servers, and security and privacy practices when connecting data sources to Claude, visit our <a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/11175166-about-integrations-using-remote-mcp">Help Center</a>.  </p></div></article></div>]]></description>

<p>Welcome, weary traveller from the orange site! Let me tell you the tale of <span>roons</span> — a kit for building mechanical computers.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="binary adder (roons)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4GCcf2u-t7s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>I got inspired a couple of years ago when I binged a bunch of mechanical logic gate YouTube videos. There are some unbelievably clever implementations — Steve Mould’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXaizglscw" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXaizglscw">water computer</a> was a particular inspiration.</p>



<p>Still, these mechanical logic gates usually end up too big to make any practical devices. I figured, how hard can it be to miniaturise them into a usable kit?</p>



<div><fieldset data-hintbox-type="foreshadowing"><legend>foreshadowing</legend><p>Very! It turned out the answer was <em>very hard</em>.</p></fieldset></div>



<h2>loom automaton</h2>



<blockquote>
<p>The Analytical Engine weaves algebraic patterns just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves.</p>
<cite>Ada Lovelace</cite></blockquote>



<p>After noodling around with far too many prototypes, I settled on what I call a <strong>loom automaton</strong>. We place tiles (“<span>roons</span>”) on a loom of alternating bars that move up and down. The contours on these tiles guide marbles <span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="false" alt="marble"></span> and holes <span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-hole.png" data-is-seq="false" alt="hole"></span> in discretised steps, representing bitstreams.</p>

<p>Isn’t it <em>incredibly neat</em> that a literal physical loom turns out to be a great substrate for Lovelace’s metaphorical loom?</p>



<p>Anyway — you can think of this loom as a cellular automaton, where each cell is:</p>







<p>If you know of prior work on this kind of system, please <a href="https://whomtech.com/whomtech/contact/" data-type="page" data-id="156">get in touch</a>! I don’t claim the loom automaton is original; I just haven’t seen it elsewhere.</p>



<h2>why loom good</h2>



<p>Initially, I was making ad-hoc devices for each computer component — a gadget for number comparison, which worked <em>like this</em>; and a gadget for addition, which worked <em>like that</em>; etc.</p>



<p>The loom was a turning point. Instead of a loose collection of dissimilar gadgets that plug in together, <em>everything</em> is implemented on the loom. (Except peripherals, which we’ll get to later.) This gives us a <strong>common interface </strong>for stitching together whatever devices we need — memory, instruction sets, whatever. It makes it trivial to deliver power in synchronised discrete steps to every component.</p>



<p>I tried several variations on the loom: moving the marbles using alternating pins; continuously guiding the marbles using slides rippling in a wave; replacing gravity with magnetic potentials; etc. You can read more about these failed attempts in the hardware/prototypes deep dive.</p>

<h2>Turing completeness</h2>



<p>You can skip this section if it’s obvious that discretised marble movements are Turing complete, but then you’d miss out on the beautiful interactive simulator:</p>







<p>I learned JavaScript for this.</p>



<p>When the <a href="https://whomtech.com/docs/list-of-roons/xor">xor <img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/piece/xor.png" alt="xor"></a> <span>roon</span> above receives its inputs, a single <span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="false" alt="marble"></span> (<span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-hole.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="hole"></span> or <span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-hole.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="hole"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"></span>) can fall into the central channel, while <span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"></span> will block each other. So an <a href="https://whomtech.com/docs/list-of-roons/xor">xor <img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/piece/xor.png" alt="xor"></a> implements XOR.</p>



<p>Other <span>roons</span> implement other logic gates. The <a href="https://whomtech.com/docs/list-of-roons/switch-back">canute <img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/piece/switch-back.png" alt="canute"></a> performs a check then kicks an <span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="false" alt="marble"></span> back one step, which lets us implement carry-like functions on a marble bitstream. There are also <span>roons</span> like the <a href="https://whomtech.com/docs/list-of-roons/trap">trap <img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/piece/trap.png" alt="trap"></a> that can permanently store a piece of state.</p>



<p>Though actually, you don’t need any stateful <span>roons</span> to store state — you can just cycle a stream of <span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-hole.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="hole"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-hole.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="hole"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-hole.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="hole"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-hole.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="hole"></span> round in a loop, bam, you’ve got a register:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="480" height="216" src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/static-register.gif" alt="7-bit static register"><figcaption>7-bit static register</figcaption></figure>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="480" height="216" src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/dynamic-register.gif" alt="7-bit read/write register"><figcaption>7-bit read/write register</figcaption></figure>



<p>We read from this register using a <a href="https://whomtech.com/docs/list-of-roons/switch">switch <img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/piece/switch.png" alt="switch"></a> to divert the path of an infinite stream of <span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"></span>. Meanwhile, the register is constantly reading in from one of two data sources: itself, or an input stream, depending on a 3rd signal channel. While this channel is <span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-hole.png" data-is-seq="false" alt="hole"></span>, the data loops; when it’s <span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="false" alt="marble"></span>, it gets overwritten by the external input, letting us perform a write.</p>



<p>But I’m getting off track. Trivially, XOR gates are Turing complete; my job is done, that’s a computer, we can all go home. Thank you.</p>



<h2>convenience</h2>



<p>“But wait! Being Turing complete isn’t enough to not suck!”</p>



<p>That’s a good point. To actually make a <em>good</em> mechanical computer kit, we need a few other things:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Compactness</strong> — build interesting devices in a small area, with very few pieces — no warehouse-sized processors!</li>



<li><strong>Promptness</strong> — reasonable processing rate; don’t have to wait for <code>BB 10</code> steps before a computation finishes</li>



<li><strong>Fast editing</strong> — minimal friction to changing a pattern and running it. “Hot reloading” so a pattern can be edited while running.</li>



<li><strong>Saving and loading</strong> — can save your work to compact storage, then bring it back later</li>



<li><strong>Minimal</strong> — build many complex systems from a small number of core parts</li>
</ul>



<p>Basically I wanted a kit that’s actually practical and fun for building circuits.</p>



<h2>did you make one?</h2>



<p>… yes!</p>

<p>Here’s a binary adder made of a <a href="https://whomtech.com/docs/list-of-roons/long-turn">long turn <img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/piece/long-turn.png" alt="long turn"></a>, <a href="https://whomtech.com/docs/list-of-roons/switch-back">canute <img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/piece/switch-back.png" alt="canute"></a>, and <a href="https://whomtech.com/docs/list-of-roons/distributor">distributor <img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/piece/distributor.png" alt="distributor"></a> — which together are not much bigger than a postage stamp. (Wave your hands and amortise away the space occupied by the disk drive itself, I/O plumbing etc etc)</p>



<p>Because space is at such a premium, instead of staggering multiple XORs and ANDs, we just bundle it all into a single unit — it’s small but slow.</p>



<p>We can also do memory, latches, processors, counters, timers, counters etc. Follow the <a href="https://whomtech.com/tutorials/" data-type="page" data-id="178">tutorial</a> sequence to learn more.</p>



<h2>modularity</h2>



<p>I wanted it to be easy to store and run lots of different patterns. Each disk drive is reasonably pocket-sized, but there’s still a lot of space dedicated to the internal gear mechanism.</p>



<p>So here’s the removable disk system:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="480" height="216" src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/disk-load.gif" alt="loading a disk onto a drive"></figure>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="480" height="216" src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/save.gif" alt="removing a disk from a drive"></figure>



<p>This is pretty simple, but it took a long time to get right! Challenges included:</p>



<ul>
<li>Figuring out exactly how much of the mechanism I could shunt down into the disk drive, and how much I had to retain in the disk</li>



<li>Optimising magnet strengths and positions — need the save/load to work smoothly, while preventing the base from popping back up in operation</li>
</ul>



<p>We can also move individual bars between disks, or rearrange the order within a disk. This makes it easy to adjust a pattern if we started it in the wrong place.</p>



<h2>extendability</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="480" height="216" src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/snap-drives.gif" alt="connecting two drives together"></figure>



<p>If we need a bigger workspace, we just put drives next to each other. This works along both X and Y axes, so you can build 2D grids.</p>



<div><fieldset data-hintbox-type="foreshadowing"><legend>foreshadowing</legend><p>I’m fully aware there’s a whole other dimension available here — working on it!</p></fieldset></div>



<h3>binding</h3>



<p>Each face of the drive has a pair of north-south magnets at its ends. This lets it pair up with a 180-degree-rotated copy of itself.</p>



<p>The centre of each face also has a small raised nub next to a corresponding pocket. This locks the drive into a precise position.</p>



<h3>power</h3>



<p>We also need to transfer power through the system. Originally I used horizontal axles with hidden magnetic couplers, which looked very cool but had too many design issues.</p>



<p>Instead, each drive has a 2 x 2 gear grid, where each gear has an integrated barrel cam to move the bars up and down. When two drives are placed next to each other, the gears bind together.</p>



<p>Because <code>N</code> is even in our <code>N x N</code> gear grid, the drives all spin the same way. This matters because certain peripherals expect a particular direction of rotation.</p>



<h3>phase</h3>



<p>We want all the bars to move in phase. Connecting the drives up correctly is fiddly — it’s easy to accidentally offset the connection by a tooth or two.</p>



<p>To prevent this, the gears have a layer of <strong>phase baffles</strong> (I don’t know the technical term). These physically block the gears from connecting until they’re perfectly synced up.</p>

<p>Combining all these principles together gives us a lot of freedom in how we set up our workspace:</p>

<p>How practical are these big grids, though? More details in the hardware deep dive.</p>



<h2>storage</h2>



<p>I wanted to make <span>roons</span> easy to store. I already had the stud system for binding tiles to bars, so I just extended that. The bases of the drives accept studs, so you can stack them up.</p>



<p>I also looked for convenient places to store the smaller pieces. For example, the encabulator has a hollow core for marbles, <span>roons</span> can be stored upside-down in the travel lid.</p>

<h2>peripherals?</h2>



<p>What an odd question, but — yes! Yes, <span>roons</span> has peripherals. These use the same 2×2 gear interface as the disk drives, so they plug into the grid and sync up.</p>



<p>There are two boring feature-complete peripherals:</p>



<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://whomtech.com/docs/tech-rundown/encabulator/" data-type="page" data-id="3037">encabulator</a> lets the user supply rotation to the system, powering each device.</li>



<li>The <strong>bucket</strong> is a bucket. <span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="false" alt="marble"></span> can fall into it. This one was particularly challenging and took billions of research hours.</li>
</ul>



<p>The WIP peripherals are where things get spicy:</p>



<ul>
<li>The <strong>7-segment display</strong> (WIP) intakes 4-bit numbers on a cycle, converting them into the corresponding base ten digit (plus 6 special characters)</li>
</ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="771" src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_20250422_122728642_AE-1024x771.jpg" alt="mockup of a 7-segment display peripheral" srcset="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_20250422_122728642_AE-1024x771.jpg 1024w, https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_20250422_122728642_AE-300x226.jpg 300w, https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_20250422_122728642_AE-768x578.jpg 768w, https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_20250422_122728642_AE-1536x1157.jpg 1536w, https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_20250422_122728642_AE.jpg 2040w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>mockup 7-segment display for illustration — prototype coming soon</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li>The <strong>numpad</strong> (WIP) converts keypresses of the digits 0-9 into 4-bit marble bitstreams.</li>



<li>The <strong>alphanumeric display</strong> (WIP) is a 6-bit extension of the 7-segment display, capable of displaying all letters of the alphabet, digits, and your favourite punctuation marks.</li>



<li>The <strong>hard drive</strong> (WIP) is space efficient marble data storage that can be used as input/output for other patterns.</li>



<li>The <strong>turbo encabulator</strong> (NES, Not Even Started) is a motorised encabulator for powering larger grids.</li>
</ul>



<p>Expect some big updates soon — these peripherals are what makes <span>roons</span> look like actual magic. For example, plugging a display into an adder:</p>







<p>Or chaining multiple displays together to get scrolling text (the bitstream passes through):</p>







<p>But I am just one person, and physically implementing these designs takes me a <em>long</em> time. So no mechanical text displays for you — yet.</p>



<h2>materials and manufacturing</h2>



<p>Most components are prototyped in 3D-printed PLA. Plans are to switch to injection-moulded ABS for mass production, though I’ve got a couple of more complex plans up my sleeve depending on demand.</p>



<p>I print these using three Bambu Labs A1 Minis. These are <em>really really good</em>, by the way.</p>



<p>Many of these pieces would be better prototyped in something like resin, but FDM turned out to be good enough; it’s what I was familiar with and had access to.</p>



<h3>magnets</h3>



<p>Each <span>roon</span> needs to cling to the bars of the loom. Consequently, I have manually superglued approximately 6,000 tiny neodymium magnets, and no longer have fingerprints.</p>



<h3>bars</h3>



<p>The bars of the disk need to be magnetic (or at least magnetically receptive). But inserting individual magnets would be too expensive and tedious.</p>



<p>Therefore, I manually trim down Copper-Coated Mild Steel (CCMS) brazing rods with a pair of bolt cutters, then embed them in the bars. You wouldn’t believe how many failed approaches it took to find this solution — could be an entire post in itself.</p>



<h2>website</h2>



<p>I took a calculated risk in setting up the whomtech website, and used two unproven technologies:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>WordPress</strong> is a little-known website builder. We hope that the endorsement of an industry titan like whomtech can give this underused piece of tech some exposure.</li>



<li><strong>JavaScript</strong> is a fresh, new approach to minimising your serotonin. It combines the elegance of Java with the type safety of punching yourself in the throat.</li>
</ul>



<p>You can read more JS slander in the software deep dive.</p>



<h2>disappointments</h2>



<p>So is <span>roons</span> an unmitigated success?</p>



<p>No! Don’t worry, there are many mitigations:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Peripherals behind schedule</strong> –The really cool peripheral prototypes are nowhere near production ready. The challenge is to integrate them with the marble bitstream concept, while minimising the number of parts and maximising reliability. I’d hoped to have this done by now — it’s absolutely possible, but I am slow.</li>



<li><strong>Piece reliability</strong> — Newer <span>roons</span> like the <a href="https://whomtech.com/docs/list-of-roons/crossing">crossing <img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/piece/crossing.png" alt="crossing"></a> haven’t hit the level of reliability I want. “Mostly working” isn’t good enough — we need 99.9%+ reliability to build anything interesting. This isn’t a threat to the underlying Turing completeness, but it does reduce the kit’s convenience.</li>



<li><strong>Piece interoperability</strong> — This is the real curse. Getting each <span>roon</span> to interoperate reliability with every other <span>roon</span> is exponentially (quadratically?) difficult. I’m happy with the basic interactions, but there are esoteric cases where an interaction “should” work but doesn’t.</li>



<li><strong>Ease of use</strong> — <span>roons</span> can be small and fiddly. I’m used to them by now, but there’s still work to be done to make it easier for newcomers.</li>



<li><strong>Simulator</strong> — I design the tutorials using a janky simulator tool I built. I wanted to polish it up before general release, but here we are.</li>



<li><strong>Site and tutorials</strong> — There’s still tons of tutorial content to write, and parts of the site that need attention.</li>



<li><strong>Additional <span>roons</span></strong> — There are many, many specific <span>roons</span> that I haven’t had time to develop yet: e.g. enhanced lateral movement, more state, general conveniences, 3D movement, etc</li>
</ul>



<h2>more technical stuff</h2>



<p>A <em>ton</em> of research and experimentation went into this project over the last couple of years. Some of it’s pretty interesting! You can read the mind-numbing details here:</p>

<section id="newslist"><article data-news-id="151"></article></section><topcomment><article data-comment-id="151-" id="151-"><span><span><a href="https://antirez.com/user/antirez">antirez</a></span> 34 minutes ago. 15371 views.  </span><pre>Five months ago, I rejoined Redis and quickly started to talk with my colleagues about a possible switch to the AGPL license, only to discover that there was already an ongoing discussion, a very old one, too. Many people, within the company, had the feeling that the AGPL was a better pick than SSPL, and while eventually Redis switched to the SSPL license, the internal discussion continued.

I tried to give more strength to the ongoing pro-AGPL license side. My feeling was that the SSPL, in practical terms, failed to be accepted by the community. The OSI wouldn’t accept it, nor would the software community regard the SSPL as an open license. In little time, I saw the hypothesis getting more and more traction, at all levels within the company hierarchy.

I’ll be honest: I truly wanted the code I wrote for the new Vector Sets data type to be released under an open source license. Writing open source software is too rooted in me: I rarely wrote anything else in my career. I’m too old to start now. This may be childish, but I wrote Vector Sets with a huge amount of enthusiasm exactly because I knew Redis (and my new work) was going to be open source again.

I understand that the core of our work is to improve Redis, to continue building a good system, useful, simple, able to change with the requirements of the software stack. Yet, returning back to an open source license is the basis for such efforts to be coherent with the Redis project, to be accepted by the user base, and to contribute to a human collective effort that is larger than any single company. So, honestly, while I can’t take credit for the license switch, I hope I contributed a little bit to it, because today I’m happy. I’m happy that Redis is open source software again, under the terms of the AGPLv3 license.

Now, time to go back to the terminal, to show Redis users some respect by writing the best code I’m able to write, and make Vector Sets more useful and practical: I have a few more ideas for improvements, and I hope that more will be stimulated by your feedback (it is already happening). Good hacking!

P.S. Redis 8, the first version of Redis with the new license, is also GA today, with a many new features and speed improvements of the core: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://redis.io/blog/redis-8-ga/">https://redis.io/blog/redis-8-ga/</a>

<h3>February 14 2024</h3>

<p>I've always attributed slow Xcode launches to Xcode simply sucking, but I've noticed that the FileMerge app frequently launches slowly too. When this happens, the app can take a dozen bounces in the Dock before finally opening. FileMerge resides in the folder <code>Xcode.app/Contents/Applications/</code> within the Xcode bundle and can be opened from the Xcode main menu under the Open Developer Tool submenu. I actually keep FileMerge in my Dock for quick access, because I use FileMerge a lot for diffing files and folders. I finally got fed up with slow launches and decided to investigate by taking a spindump from Activity Monitor. Spindumps are a nice way to see what exactly is consuming resources on your Mac, because they show the "CPU Time" used by each process on your system and each thread in the process.</p>
<p>From the spindump I discovered that the slow launches are caused by the <code>syspolicyd</code> process, specifically <code>DispatchQueue "com.apple.security.syspolicy.yara"</code>. The backtrace showed <code>syspolicyd</code> calling the <code>yr_rules_scan_file</code> function. According to <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/YARA">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>YARA is the name of a tool primarily used in malware research and detection. It provides a rule-based approach to create descriptions of malware families based on regular expression, textual or binary patterns.</blockquote>
<p>Thus, macOS is periodically scanning FileMerge for malware on launch, which causes very slow app launches. I don't know what the exact period is between scans, but rebooting the Mac seems to reset the cache, which made it convenient for me to test the malware scans while writing this blog post (but otherwise makes it extremely inconvenient for me). I've noticed the same <code>syspolicyd</code> malware scanning and consequent slow launches with some other apps such as Xcode itself, Google Chrome, and Wireshark. You can even see <code>syspolicyd</code> spinning up % CPU in Activity Monitor when the malware scan happens. (In order to catch this, make sure to increase Update Frequency to 1 sec.)</p>
<p>Xcode, Chrome, and Wireshark are very large apps, so it makes sense that a malware scan of them would be slow. However, FileMerge is much smaller, only 2 MB. Why does that take so long? My theory is that <code>syspolicyd</code> also scans the launched app's linked libraries. The command <code>otool -L</code> in Terminal will show them:</p>
<blockquote><code>otool -L /Applications/<wbr>Xcode.app/<wbr>Contents/<wbr>Applications/<wbr>FileMerge.app/<wbr>Contents/<wbr>MacOS/<wbr>FileMerge</code></blockquote>
<p>I doubt that the built-in system libraries are scanned for malware, because they reside on a separate cryptographically-signed read-only disk volume. But FileMerge also links to non-system libraries:</p>
<pre><code>	@rpath/IDEFoundation.framework/Versions/A/IDEFoundation (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 22551.0.0)
	@rpath/DVTKit.framework/Versions/A/DVTKit (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
	@rpath/DVTFoundation.framework/Versions/A/DVTFoundation (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
	@rpath/DeltaFoundation.framework/Versions/A/DeltaFoundation (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
	@rpath/DeltaKit.framework/Versions/A/DeltaKit (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
	@rpath/DVTUserInterfaceKit.framework/Versions/A/DVTUserInterfaceKit (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
	@rpath/libXCTestSwiftSupport.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 22516.0.0, weak)</code></pre>
<p>These libraries are located within the Xcode bundle in the <code>Xcode.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks/</code> folder.</p>
<p>In my testing, I also saw somewhat slow launching from another app bundled with Xcode, Accessibility Inspector. This app is larger than FileMerge, yet it launches much more quickly. I suspect the reason is that it links to fewer Xcode frameworks:</p>
<pre><code>	@rpath/AccessibilitySupport.framework/Versions/B/AccessibilitySupport (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)
	@rpath/DVTFoundation.framework/Versions/A/DVTFoundation (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
	@rpath/DVTKit.framework/Versions/A/DVTKit (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
	@rpath/AccessibilityAudit.framework/Versions/B/AccessibilityAudit (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
	@rpath/AccessibilityAuditDeviceManager.framework/Versions/A/AccessibilityAuditDeviceManager (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
</code></pre>
<p>In case you're wondering, Apple hasn't exempted Mac App Store apps from malware scanning, not even its own apps. I downloaded Xcode from the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/download/">Apple Developer website</a> rather than from the Mac App Store, but I can see the <code>syspolicyd</code> malware scan when launching large Mac App Store apps such as Pages and Numbers. Again, though, I think that the built-in read-only system apps are exempt.</p>
<p>Here's a mystery: I see frequent slow launches and malware scans with Google Chrome but never with <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/beta/">Google Chrome Beta</a>, despite the fact that the Google Chrome beta app is about the same size as the Google Chrome app. I don't yet have an explanation for the difference in behavior.</p>
<p>By the way, the existence or nonexistence of extended attributes such as <code>com.apple.quarantine</code> makes no difference. Removing all the extended attributes from an app bundle doesn't stop the malware scans.</p>
<p>You may remember our friend <code>syspolicyd</code> as the process that <a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/catalina-executables.html">phones home to Apple when running unsigned executables</a>. It was also the culprit in making <a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/xcrun.html">Xcode tools slow after reboot</a>. I guess I should have already known the cause of the slow app launches, but I must have forgotten and/or failed to put two and two together. In any case, <code>syspolicyd</code> sucks, and I really wish there were a way to completely disable the malware scanning and allow my apps to always launch quickly. I'm very careful about what I install, and I've never had malware in over twenty years of full-time Mac usage, so I think it's safe to say that for me, <code>syspolicyd</code> is security theater, and I'd rather not have to sit through its "play", full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. To be fair, I don't have an issue with malware scanning in the <em>background</em>; I just don't want malware scanning to hold up my apps launching in the foreground. Instead of interrupting me and scanning an app during the seconds when I'm launching it—what <em>should</em> be a fraction of a second—how about scanning the app during the innumerable seconds when I'm <em>not</em> launching it?</p>
<p>Perhaps <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/disabling_and_enabling_system_integrity_protection">disabling System Integrity Protection</a> disables the malware scan too? I haven't checked this, but it's not really viable for me as a Mac software developer, because I need to test the same runtime environment as my users, otherwise I could write code that works for me but not for my users. I believe that disabling SIP also disables some Apple services on your Mac that are "protected" by DRM (in order to make reverse engineering more difficult).</p>

<h3>Addendum</h3>
<p>I've now confirmed that disabling SIP does indeed eliminate the <code>syspolicyd</code> malware scan. Xcode launches so fast, it's beautiful. I feel like I'm in heaven! I don't think I can go back to the previous hell. I'll live with the consequences, whatever they may be.</p>

			<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/02/10/vegetative-electron-microscopy-fingerprint-paper-mill/">scientists discovered a peculiar term</a> appearing in published papers: "vegetative electron microscopy".</p><p>This phrase, which sounds technical but is actually nonsense, has become a "digital fossil" – an error preserved and reinforced in  <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/artificial-intelligence" data-linkid="73092" data-postid="159069" rel="nofollow" target="_self">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) systems that is nearly impossible to remove from our knowledge repositories.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->

<!-- END single/mrec --><h2>The scale problem</h2><p>Finding errors of this sort is not easy. Fixing them may be almost impossible.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>One reason is scale. The CommonCrawl dataset, for example, is millions of gigabytes in size. For most researchers outside large tech companies, the computing resources required to work at this scale are inaccessible.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>Another reason is a lack of transparency in commercial AI models. OpenAI and many other developers refuse to provide precise details about the training data for their models.

<!-- END single/mrec --><p>When errors are found, there is no easy fix. Simple keyword filtering could deal with specific terms such as vegetative electron microscopy. However, it would also eliminate legitimate references (such as this article).</p><!-- START single/mrec -->

<!-- END single/mrec --><h2>Implications for science and publishing</h2><p>This "digital fossil" also raises important questions about knowledge integrity as AI-assisted research and writing become more common.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>Publishers have responded inconsistently when notified of papers including vegetative electron microscopy. Some have retracted affected papers, while others defended them. Elsevier notably <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/02/10/vegetative-electron-microscopy-fingerprint-paper-mill/">attempted to justify the term's validity</a> before <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/12/2841">eventually issuing a correction</a>.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>We do not yet know if other such quirks plague large language models, but it is highly likely. Either way, the use of AI systems has already created problems for the peer-review process.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->

Additionally, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1930043324001298">phrases</a> such as "I am an AI language model" have been found in other retracted papers.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>Some automatic screening tools such as <a href="https://theconversation.com/problematic-paper-screener-trawling-for-fraud-in-the-scientific-literature-246317">Problematic Paper Screener</a> now flag vegetative electron microscopy as a warning sign of possible AI-generated content. However, such approaches can only address known errors, not undiscovered ones.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><h2>Living with digital fossils</h2><p>The rise of AI creates opportunities for errors to become permanently embedded in our knowledge systems, through processes no single actor controls. This presents challenges for tech companies, researchers, and publishers alike.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>Tech companies must be more transparent about training data and methods. Researchers must find new ways to evaluate information in the face of AI-generated convincing nonsense. Scientific publishers must improve their  <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/science-peer-review" data-linkid="73086" data-postid="159069" rel="nofollow" target="_self">peer review</a> processes to spot both human and AI-generated errors.</p><p>Digital fossils reveal not just the technical challenge of monitoring massive datasets, but the fundamental challenge of maintaining reliable knowledge in systems where errors can become self-perpetuating.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

        <div about="/about-nih/who-we-are/nih-director/statements/accelerating-access-research-results-new-implementation-date-2024-nih-public-access-policy" typeof="sioc:Item foaf:Document" role="main">

  
  <p><span property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2025-04-30T11:15:00-04:00">April 30, 2025</span></p><div><p>I am excited to announce that one of my first actions as NIH Director is pushing the accelerator on policies to make NIH research findings freely and quickly available to the public. The 2024 Public Access Policy, originally slated to go into effect on December 31, 2025, <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-25-101.html">will now be effective as of July 1, 2025</a>.</p>

<p>To be clear, maximum transparency regarding the research we support is our default position. Since the release of NIH’s 2008 Public Access Policy, more than 1.5 million articles reporting on NIH-supported research have been made freely available to the public through PubMed Central.&nbsp;While the 2008 Policy allowed for an up to 12-month delay before such articles were required to be made publicly available, in 2024, NIH revised the Public Access Policy to remove the embargo period so that researchers, students, and members of the public have rapid access to these findings.</p>

<p>NIH is the crown jewel of the American biomedical research system.&nbsp; However, a recent <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2024/11/14/public-trust-in-scientists-and-views-on-their-role-in-policymaking/">Pew Research Center study</a> shows that only about 25% of Americans have a “great deal of confidence” that scientists are working for the public good.&nbsp; Earlier implementation of the Public Access Policy will help increase public confidence in the research we fund while also ensuring that the investments made by taxpayers produce replicable, reproducible, and generalizable results that benefit all Americans.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Providing speedy public access to NIH-funded results is just one of the ways we are working to earn back the trust of the American people. Trust in science is an essential element in Making America Healthy Again.&nbsp; As such, NIH and its research partners will continue to promote maximum transparency in all that we do.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

We're a small team automating the painful admin work that clogs up the U.S. healthcare system — things like prior authorizations, discharge planning, and insurance claims. Our goal is simple: give time back to clinicians so they can focus on patient care, not paperwork.</p><p>We've found early product-market fit and are growing the team thoughtfully. We're hiring senior engineers across the stack: backend, frontend, and AI/LLM. We're NYC-based and hybrid (most of us come in ~3 days/week). We're not counting badge swipes — we just want teammates who want to be in the room with us often enough to build trust, have fun, and work on hard problems together!</p><p>What we're building:
* A general-purpose automation platform for healthcare ops, powered by LLMs
* A system that reads unstructured documents, fills out payer forms, and explains rejections
* Tools to automate patient discharge planning in hospitals
* A foundation for making AI in healthcare safe, observable, and human-in-the-loop</p><p>What we're looking for:
* AI Engineer — experience productionizing LLM apps (agents, RAG, embeddings); solid Python; knows how to build ML systems that ship
* Backend Engineer — strong Python/FastAPI; infra-savvy (K8s, Terraform, Docker); thoughtful about API design and scalability
* Frontend Engineer — React/TypeScript expert who's opinionated about UX and happy to dip into backend when needed</p><p>More importantly, we're looking for engineers who like open-ended, ambiguous challenges, and want to work with a tight-knit, high-trust team to solve real-world problems.</p><p>I'm a Principal Engineer here — if anything here resonates, drop me a line at john@ascertain.com or apply at our job board using <a href="https://lnkd.in/e5ZnGuqH">https://lnkd.in/e5ZnGuqH</a>!</p></div></td></tr>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Every day, our dedicated security and IT teams successfully repel a wide range of attacks from various bad actors. From our years of experience, we know how vast the attack vectors of any major company are. And as we’re disclosing today, they can include unexpected areas, such as the company’s recruitment process.</p>



<p>Our teams recently identified a North Korean hacker’s attempts to infiltrate our ranks by applying for a job at Kraken.</p>



<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2vXHlnjKbBI?si=7jufdYZuCbe96Sm2" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>



<p><em>Watch CBS News’ full coverage of how Kraken identified — and then strategically interacted with — a North Korean hacker who tried to get a job at Kraken</em></p>



<p>What started as a routine hiring process for an engineering role&nbsp;quickly turned into an intelligence gathering operation, as our teams carefully advanced the candidate through our hiring process to learn more about their tactics at every stage of the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is an established challenge for the crypto community, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/north-korea-stole-over-659m-in-crypto-heists-during-2024-deploys-fake-job-seekers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">estimates</a> indicating that North Korean hackers stole over $650 million from crypto firms in 2024 alone. We’re disclosing these events today as part of our ongoing transparency efforts and to help companies, both in crypto and beyond, to strengthen their defenses.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-candidate-s-red-flags-nbsp"><strong>The candidate’s red flags&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>From the outset, something felt off about this candidate. During their initial call with our recruiter, they joined under a different name from the one on their resume, and quickly changed it. Even more suspicious, the candidate occasionally switched between voices, indicating that they were being coached through the interview in real time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before this interview, industry partners had tipped us off that North Korean hackers were actively applying for jobs at crypto companies. We received a list of email addresses linked to the hacker group, and one of them matched the email the candidate used to apply to Kraken.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With this intelligence in hand, our Red Team launched an investigation using Open-Source Intelligence gathering (OSINT) methods. One method involved analyzing breach data, which hackers often use to identify users with weak or reused passwords. In this instance, we discovered that one of the emails associated with the malicious candidate was part of a larger network of fake identities and aliases.</p>



<p>This meant that our team had uncovered a hacking operation where one individual had established multiple identities to apply for roles in the crypto space and beyond. Several of the names had previously been hired by multiple companies, as our team identified work-related email addresses linked to them. One identity in this network was also a known foreign agent on the sanctions list.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-as-our-team-dug-deeper-into-the-candidate-s-history-and-credentials-technical-inconsistencies-emerged-nbsp">As our team dug deeper into the candidate’s history and credentials, technical inconsistencies emerged&nbsp;</h2>



<ul>
<li>The candidate used remote colocated Mac desktops but interacted with other components through a VPN, a setup commonly deployed to hide location and network activity.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Their resume was linked to a GitHub profile containing an email address exposed in a past data breach.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The candidate’s primary form of ID appeared to be altered, likely using details stolen in an identity theft case two years prior.</li>
</ul>



<p>By this point, the evidence was clear, and our team was confident this wasn’t just a suspicious job applicant, but a state-sponsored infiltration attempt.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-turning-the-tables-how-our-team-responded"><strong>Turning the tables – how our team responded</strong></h2>



<p>Instead of tipping off the applicant, our security and recruitment teams strategically advanced them through our rigorous recruitment process – not to hire, but to study their approach. This meant putting them through multiple rounds of technical infosec tests and verification tasks, designed to extract key details about their identity and tactics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The final round interview? A casual chemistry interview with Kraken’s Chief Security Officer (CSO) Nick Percoco and several other team members. What the candidate didn’t realize was that this was a trap – a subtle but deliberate test of their identity.</p>



<p>Between standard interview questions, our team slipped in two-factor authentication prompts, such as asking the candidate to verify their location, hold up a government-issued ID, and even recommend some local restaurants in the city they claimed to be in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At this point, the candidate unraveled. Flustered and caught off guard, they struggled with the basic verification tests, and couldn’t convincingly answer real-time questions about their city of residence or country of citizenship. By the end of the interview, the truth was clear: this was not a legitimate applicant, but an imposter attempting to infiltrate our systems.</p>



<p><strong>Commenting on the events, CSO Nick Percoco, said:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>“Don’t trust, verify. This core crypto principle is more relevant than ever in the digital age. State-sponsored attacks aren’t just a crypto, or U.S. corporate, issue – they’re a global threat. Any individual or business handling value is a target, and resilience starts with operationally preparing to withstand these types of attacks.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-key-takeaways"><strong>Key takeaways</strong></h2>



<ul>
<li>Not all attackers break in, some try to walk through the front door. As cyber threats evolve, so must our security strategies. A holistic, proactive approach is critical to protect an organization.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Generative AI is making deception easier, but isn’t foolproof. Attackers can trick parts of the hiring process, like a technical assessment, but genuine candidates will usually pass real-time, unprompted verification tests. Try to avoid patterns in the types of verification questions that hiring managers use.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>A culture of productive paranoia is key. Security isn’t just an IT responsibility. In the modern era, it’s an organizational mindset. By actively engaging this individual, we identified areas to strengthen our defenses against future infiltration attempts.</li>
</ul>



<p>The next time a suspicious job application comes through remember: Sometimes, the biggest threats come disguised as opportunities.</p>

<p>With the rise of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., brain worms have gotten a bad rap.</p>
<p>A year ago, the long-time anti-vaccine advocate and current US health secretary famously told The New York Times that a parasitic worm "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/us/rfk-jr-brain-health-memory-loss.html">got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died</a>." The startling revelation is now frequently referenced whenever Kennedy says something outlandish, false, or offensive—which is often. For those who have followed his anti-vaccine advocacy, it's frightfully clear that, worm-infested or not, Kennedy's brain is marinated in wild conspiracy theories and dangerous misinformation.</p>
<p>While it's certainly possible that worm remnants could impair brain function, it remains unknown if the worm is to blame for Kennedy's cognitive oddities. For one thing, he was also diagnosed with mercury poisoning, which can cause brain damage, too. As prominent infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said last June <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-585-dr-anthony-fauci/id1043593599?i=1000660407241">in a conversation</a> with political analyst David Axelrod: "I don't know what's going on in [Kennedy's] head, but it's not good."</p>
<p>The trouble is that now that Kennedy is the country's top health official, his warped ideas are contributing to the rise of a dystopian reality. Federal health agencies are spiraling into chaos, and critical public health services for Americans have been brutally slashed, dismantled, or knee-capped—from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/cdc-rocked-by-top-level-departures-loss-of-11-4b-in-covid-funding/">infectious disease responses</a>, the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-hhs-layoffs-cdc-lead-poisoning/">lead poisoning team</a>, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/01/g-s1-57716/hhs-layoffs-seniors-disabled-liheap-acl">Meals on Wheels</a> to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/19/cdc-cuts-maternal-mortality-fertility/">maternal health programs</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/14/cdc-closing-office-smoking-health-called-gift-to-big-tobacco-by-former-osh-director/">anti-smoking initiatives</a>, just to name a few. The health of the nation is at stake; the struggle to understand what goes on in Kennedy's head is vital.</p>
<p>While we may never have definitive answers on his cognitive situation, one thing is plain: Kennedy's thoughts and actions make a lot more sense when you realize he doesn't believe in a foundational scientific principle: germ theory.</p>

<h2>Dueling theories</h2>
<p>Germ theory is, of course, the 19th-century proven idea that microscopic germs—pathogenic viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi—cause disease. It supplanted the leading explanation of disease at the time, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1121911/">the miasma theory</a>, which suggests that diseases are caused by <em>miasma</em>, that is, noxious mists and vapors, or simply bad air arising from decaying matter, such as corpses, sewage, or rotting vegetables. While the miasma theory was abandoned, it is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/miasma-theory">credited with spurring improvements in sanitation and hygiene</a>—which, of course, improve health because they halt the spread of germs, the cause of diseases.</p>
<p>Germ theory also knocks back a lesser-known idea called the terrain theory, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/08/deep-dive-into-stupid-meet-the-growing-group-that-rejects-germ-theory/">we've covered before</a>. This is a somewhat ill-defined theory that generally suggests diseases stem from imbalances in the internal "terrain" of the body, such as malnutrition or the presence of toxic substances. The theory is linked to ideas by French scientist Antoine Béchamp and French physiologist Claude Bernard.</p>
<p>Béchamp, considered a bitter crank and rival to famed French microbiologist Louis Pasteur, is perhaps best known for wrongly suggesting the basic unit of organisms is not the cell, but nonexistent microanatomical elements he called "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Th%C3%A9orie-Microzyma-Syst%C3%A8me-Microbien-French/dp/1148133852">microzyma</a>." While the idea was <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8343086/#:~:text=Antoine%20Bechamp%2C%20a%20vocal%20rival,of%20highly%20personalized%2C%20precision%20medicine.">largely ignored by the scientific community</a>, Béchamp suggested that disruptions to microzyma are a predisposition to disease, as is the state of the body's "terrain." French physiologist Claude Bernard, meanwhile, came up with an idea of balance or stability of the body's internal environment (<em>milieu intérieur</em>), which was a precursor to the concept of homeostasis. Ideas from the two figures came together to create an ideology that has been enthusiastically adopted by modern-day germ theory denialists, including Kennedy.</p>
<p>It's important to note here that our understanding of Kennedy's disbelief in germ theory isn't based on speculation or deduction; it's based on Kennedy's own words. He wrote an entire section on it in his 2021 book vilifying Fauci, titled <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_Anthony_Fauci">The Real Anthony Fauci</a>.</em> The section is titled "Miasma vs. Germ Theory," in the chapter "The White Man's Burden."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>But, we did reach out to Health and Human Services to ask how Kennedy's disbelief in germ theory influences his policy decisions. HHS did not respond.</p>
<h2>Kennedy’s beliefs</h2>
<p>In the chapter, Kennedy promotes the "miasma theory" but gets the definition completely wrong. Instead of actual miasma theory, he describes something more like terrain theory. He writes: "'Miasma theory' emphasizes preventing disease by fortifying the immune system through nutrition and by reducing exposures to environmental toxins and stresses."</p>
<p>Kennedy contrasts his erroneous take on miasma theory with germ theory, which he derides as a tool of the pharmaceutical industry and pushy scientists to justify selling modern medicines. The abandonment of miasma theory, Kennedy bemoans, realigned health and medical institutions to "the pharmaceutical paradigm that emphasized targeting particular germs with specific drugs rather than fortifying the immune system through healthy living, clean water, and good nutrition."</p>
<p>According to Kennedy, germ theory gained popularity, not because of the undisputed evidence supporting it, but by "mimicking the traditional explanation for disease—demon possession—giving it a leg up over miasma."</p>
<p>To this day, Kennedy writes, a "$1 trillion pharmaceutical industry pushing patented pills, powders, pricks, potions, and poisons, and the powerful professions of virology and vaccinology led by 'Little Napoleon' himself, Anthony Fauci, fortify the century-old predominance of germ theory."</p>
<p>In all, the chapter provides a clear explanation of why Kennedy relentlessly attacks evidence-based medicines; vilifies the pharmaceutical industry; <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/11/15/rfk-jr-views-conspiracies-false-claims/">suggests HIV doesn't cause AIDS and antidepressants are behind mass shootings</a>; believes that vaccines are harmful, not protective; claims <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/01/top-10-moments-of-rfk-jr-s-reality-bending-confirmation-hearings/">5G wireless networks cause cancer</a>; suggests chemicals in water are changing children's gender identities; and is quick to promote supplements to prevent and treat diseases, such as recently recommending vitamin A for measles and falsely claiming children who die from the viral infection are malnourished.</p>

    <div>
          
          

<h2>A religious conviction</h2>
<p>For some experts, the chapter was like a light bulb going on. "I thought 'it now all makes sense'... I mean, it all adds up," Paul Offit, pediatrician and infectious disease expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told Ars Technica. It's still astonishing, though, he added. "It's so unbelievable, because you can't imagine that someone who's the head of Health and Human Services doesn't believe that specific viruses or bacteria cause specific diseases, and that the prevention or treatment of them is lifesaving."</p>
<p>Offit has a dark history with Kennedy. Around 20 years ago, Kennedy called Offit out of the blue to talk with him about vaccine safety. Offit knows a lot about it—he's not only an expert on vaccines, he's the <a href="https://historyofvaccines.org/diseases/rotavirus">co-inventor of one</a>. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14760258/">The vaccine he co-developed</a>, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/rotateq">RotaTeq</a>, protects against rotaviruses, which cause deadly diarrheal disease in young children and killed an <a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/routine-vaccines-extraordinary-impact-rotavirus">estimated 500,000 people worldwide each year</a> before vaccines were available. RotaTeq has been proven safe and effective and is credited with <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2696431">saving tens of thousands of lives</a> around the world each year.</p>
<p>Kennedy and Offit spent about an hour talking, mostly about thimerosal, an ethylmercury-containing preservative that was once used in childhood vaccines but was mostly abandoned by 2001 as a precautionary measure. RotaTeq doesn't and never did contain thimerosal—because it's a live, attenuated viral vaccine, it doesn't contain any preservatives. But Kennedy has frequently used thimerosal as a vaccine bogeyman over the years, claiming it causes harms (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/thimerosal.html">there is no evidence for this</a>).</p>
<p>After their conversation, Kennedy published a story in Rolling Stone and Salon.com titled "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadly_Immunity">Deadly Immunity</a>," which erroneously argued that thimerosal-containing vaccines cause autism. The article was riddled with falsehoods and misleading statements. It described Offit as "<a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/robert-f-kennedy-jr-vaccine-misinformation-20240530.html">in the pocket</a>" of the pharmaceutical industry and claimed RotaTeq was "laced" with thimerosal. Rolling Stone and Salon amended some of the article's problems, but eventually Salon retracted it and Rolling Stone deleted it.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Looking back, Offit said he was <a href="https://pauloffit.substack.com/p/my-conversation-with-robert-f-kennedy">sandbagged</a>. "He's a liar. He lied about who he was; he lied about what he was doing. He was just wanting to set me up," Offit said.</p>
<p>Although that was the only time they had ever spoken, Kennedy has continued to disparage and malign Offit over the years. In his book dedicated to denigrating Fauci, Kennedy spends plenty of time spitting insults at Offit, calling him a "font of wild industry ballyhoo, prevarication, and outright fraud." He also makes the wildly false claim that RotaTeq "almost certainly kills and injures more children in the United States than the rotavirus disease."</p>
<h2>Inconvincible</h2>
<p>Understanding that Kennedy is a germ theory denialist and terrain theory embracer makes these attacks easier to understand—though no less abhorrent or dangerous.</p>
<p>"He holds these beliefs like a religious conviction," Offit said. "There is no shaking him from that," regardless of how much evidence there is to prove him wrong. "If you're trying to talk him out of something that he holds with a religious conviction—that's never going to happen. And so any time anybody disagrees with him, he goes, 'Well, of course, they're just in the pocket of industry; that's why they say that.'"</p>
<p>There are some aspects of terrain theory that do have a basis in reality. Certainly, underlying medical conditions—which could be considered a disturbed bodily "terrain"—can make people more vulnerable to disease. And, with recent advances in understanding the microbiome, it has become clear that imbalances in the microbial communities in our gastrointestinal tracts can also predispose people to infections.</p>
<p>But, on the whole, the evidence against terrain theory is obvious and all around us. Terrain theorists consider disease a symptom of an unhealthy internal state, suggesting that anyone who gets sick is unhealthy and that all disease-causing germs are purely opportunistic. This is nonsense: Plenty of people fall ill while being otherwise healthy. And many germs are dedicated pathogens, with evolved, specialized virulence strategies such as toxins, and advanced defense mechanisms such as antibacterial resistance. They are not opportunists.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>(There are some terrain theory devotees who <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/germtheory.vs.terraintheory/posts/9795477983862455/">do not believe in the existence of microbes at all</a>—but Kennedy seems to accept that bacteria and viruses are real.)</p>

<h2>Terrain theory applied</h2>
<p>Terrain theory's clash with reality has become painfully apparent amid Kennedy's handling—or more accurately, mishandling—of the current measles situation in the US.</p>
<p>Most health experts would consider the current measles situation in the US akin to a five-alarm fire. An outbreak that began at the end of January in West Texas is now the largest and deadliest the country has seen in a quarter-century. Three people have died, including two unvaccinated young children who were otherwise healthy. The outbreak has spread to at least three other states, which also have undervaccinated communities where the virus can thrive. There's no sign of the outbreak slowing, and the nation's overall case count is on track to be the highest since the mid-1990s, before measles was declared eliminated in 2000. Modeling indicates the country will lose its elimination status and that measles will once again become endemic in the US.</p>
<p>Given the situation, one might expect a vigorous federal response—one dominated by strong and clear promotion of the highly effective, safe measles vaccine. But of course, that's not the case.</p>
<p>"When those first two little girls died of measles in West Texas, he said immediately—RFK Jr.—that they were malnourished. It was the doctors that stood up and said 'No, they had no risk factors. They were perfectly well-nourished,'" Offit points out.</p>
<p>Kennedy has also heavily pushed the use of vitamin A, a fat-soluble vitamin that accumulates in the body and can become toxic with large or prolonged doses. It does not prevent measles and is mainly used as supportive care for measles in low-income countries where vitamin A deficiency is common. Nevertheless, vaccine-hesitant communities in Texas have embraced it, leading to reports from doctors that they have had to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/04/04/texas-vitamin-a-toxicity-measles-patients/82871895007/">treat children for vitamin A toxicity</a>.</p>

    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<h2>Poisons</h2>
<p>Despite the raging outbreak, Kennedy spent part of last week drumming up fanfare for a rickety plan to rid American foods of artificial food dyes, which are accused of making sugary processed foods more appealing to kids, in addition to posing their own health risks. It's part of his larger effort to improve Americans' nutrition, a tenet of terrain theory. Though Kennedy has organized zero news briefings on the measles outbreak, he appeared at a jubilant press conference on removing the dyes.</p>
<p>The conference was complete with remarks from people who seem to share similar beliefs as Kennedy, including famed pseudoscience-peddler Vani Hari, aka "Food Babe," and alternative-medicine guru and fad diet promoter Mark Hyman. Wellness mogul and special government employee Cally Meads also took to the podium to give a fury-filled speech in which he claimed that 90 percent of FDA's spending is because we are "poisoning our children," echoing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/11/15/rfk-jr-views-conspiracies-false-claims/">a claim Kennedy has also made</a>.</p>
<p>Kennedy, for his part, declared that "sugar is poison," though he acknowledged that the FDA can't ban it. While the conference was intended to celebrate the removal of artificial food dyes, he also acknowledged that there is no ban, nor forthcoming regulations, or even an agreement with food companies to remove the dyes. Kennedy instead said he simply had "an understanding" with food companies. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary explained the plan by saying: "I believe in love, and let’s start in a friendly way and see if we can do this without any statutory or regulatory changes." Bloomberg reported the next day that food industry lobbyists said <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-23/food-industry-says-there-s-no-agreement-with-hhs-to-cut-dyes">there is no agreement to remove the dyes</a>.</p>
<p>However feeble the move, a focus on banning colorful cereal during a grave infectious disease outbreak makes a lot of sense if you know that Kennedy is a germ theory denialist.</p>
<p>But then again, there's also the brain worm.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago today, Jack Bogle started a different kind of investment firm—one owned by its investors, ensuring a focus on making money for them, not from them.<sup>1</sup></p>

                    <div>
                        <p><b>John C. Bogle:</b> What made Vanguard different from everybody else in this industry was the structure that I picked in the first place, way back in 1974. We are owned by the shareholders. Our mission is to serve them and not some outside management company owner.</p>
<p>And I don't think it's self-serving to say that we are a company that is of the shareholder, by the shareholder, and for the shareholder, with a crew that understands that and implements it really quite beautifully.</p>
<p>People are the key to everything we do and everything we ever have done. I've often talked about human beings being the hallmark of this operation—people that care about our values, people that care about our integrity, each with their own hopes and fears and financial goals.</p>

                    </div>

                </p></div>

<div>
                    	<p>Vanguard was founded on the ideal that all investors deserve a fair shake—that investing ought to be lower-cost and more accessible. Bogle’s idealism was audacious at the time. In 1975, investing was reserved for the very wealthy and was stubbornly expensive, and the U.S. stock market was down by half over the prior couple years.</p>
<p>The "Vanguard experiment" did not take off right away, but as generations of crew persistently took action to bring us closer to our founding ideals, more people were attracted to what we had to offer. Today, more than 50 million investors have entrusted Vanguard with their financial hopes—a responsibility we embrace with great care.</p>
<p>I am writing first to thank you for your trust in Vanguard. It is a trust that demands our constant effort, especially given the market fluctuations this year. So, I also want to highlight actions we are taking to serve your needs today and for the long term. Finally, I offer our unwavering commitment that Vanguard will always be your firm, one that takes a stand for your needs and where our focus is on your long-term investment success.&nbsp;</p>

        <div>
                    	<p>One of Bogle’s contrarian insights was that in investing, you get what you <i>don’t</i> pay for. The less you pay for your funds, the more you keep. A benefit of being a Vanguard investor-owner is that as we realize greater economies of scale, we pass those savings on to you through lower fees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is why <b>Vanguard has reduced expense ratios more than two thousand times.</b> Our relentless focus on fees is also why this February we announced the largest expense ratio cuts in our history—we expect our U.S. investors to save more than $350 million this year alone.<sup>2</sup> The Vanguard Effect has also spurred price competition across the industry, as our low-cost offerings draw attention to the importance of fees to long-term results.</p>

                    <p>Bogle’s insight was contrarian because lower cost portfolios tend to outperform higher cost ones—in index and active.<sup>4</sup> Skilled, low-fee active managers can be more prudent and disciplined than higher-fee managers who can feel compelled to take on greater risk to offset their higher fees. This is the main reason why Vanguard’s index and active funds have outperformed over the past decade.</p>

            </div>
        

        <div>
                    	<p>If the market turmoil of the past few months has highlighted one thing, it is the importance of diversification—especially between stocks and bonds. Bonds can be sound diversifiers and, as <a href="https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/vemo/vemo-return-forecasts.html" target="_self">Vanguard’s long-term outlook</a> indicates, they can be good sources of return and income—which is especially important if you are retired.</p>
<p>The bond market is significantly larger than the stock market and much more complex and inefficient, providing greater opportunities for active management to outperform. But competitors’ fees for active fixed income have remained persistently high. You deserve a better deal.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>At Vanguard we have been managing fixed income portfolios for forty years. Our combination of high skill and low fees (a quarter of the industry average) has resulted in <b>92% of our active fixed income funds outperforming</b> their peer group averages over the last 10 years.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>You also deserve a better deal on cash savings. Vanguard’s money market funds already provide strong performance at low fees but, you probably also hold traditional savings accounts—whether for the convenience of paying bills or FDIC insurance. But the typical savings account yields less than half a percent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Knowing we could do far better than that, we launched our Cash Plus offer. At present, it pays 3.65%, nearly 9x what you could earn with the average savings account, and it includes features like the ability to pay bills and FDIC insurance.<sup>8</sup> In two years, a Cash Plus account with a $10,000 balance could have earned nearly $1,000 more with our bank sweep program than with a traditional bank savings account.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>Beyond extending The Vanguard Effect to fixed income and cash, we are expanding our long-standing alliances with third-party managers to provide better access to institutional-quality private assets and guaranteed income solutions — as we believe they can play a role in certain long-term portfolios. We are at work developing solutions for your needs and will have more to announce on that front later this year.</p>

<p>10 The <i>J.D. Power 2025 U.S. Investor Satisfaction Study</i> surveyed approximately 4,000 self-directed investors.

The survey was fielded between January and December 2024 and measured satisfaction in seven key dimensions on a 1,000-point scale: product and service offerings meet investors’ needs; ease in doing business with the firm; digital channels; people; value for fees paid; and level of trust with the firm. <i>For J.D.

<p>11 Vanguard received the first overall ranking in Morningstar's 2025 "Robo-Advisor Report" among 15 other robo-advisors selected by Morningstar. Morningstar evaluated each provider across the following weighted criteria as of December 2024, to determine their rankings: total price (30%); the process used to select investments, construct portfolios, and match portfolios with investors (30%); the parent organization behind the digital platform (20%); and breadth of services (20%). Additional details about Morningstar's methodology are available on its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/specials/your-guide-to-getting-started-with-robo-investing" target="_blank"><b>website</b></a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/specials/your-guide-to-getting-started-with-robo-investing" target="_blank"><b>https://www.morningstar.com/specials/your-guide-to-getting-started-with-robo-investing</b></a>). Current fees may vary for Vanguard advisory services and the other robo-advisors considered. Although Vanguard compensates Morningstar for marketing services, Morningstar's opinions and evaluations are independent and unrelated to the selection of Vanguard for this ranking. Following the independent announcement of this ranking, Vanguard purchased a license from Morningstar for the right to include this rating in Vanguard marketing.

<p>12 According to Cerulli research, the industry average asset-based advisory fee ranges from 1.25% for a client with $100,000 in investable assets to 0.67% for a client with $10 million. Advisory fees exclude products’ embedded management fees and are self-reported by advisors. Source: Cerulli Associates. The Cerulli Edge: The Americas Asset and Wealth Management Edition: The Fees Issue, March 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vanguard Personal Advisor Select and Vanguard Personal Advisor Wealth Management charge fees based on a tiered fee schedule (maximum 0.30%) calculated as an average advisory fee on all advised assets. Vanguard Digital Advisor charges Vanguard Brokerage Accounts an annual gross advisory fee of 0.20% for its all-index investment options and 0.25% for an active/index mix. Vanguard Personal Advisor charges Vanguard Brokerage Accounts an annual gross advisory fee of 0.35% for its all-index investment options and 0.40% for an active/index mix. Vanguard Digital Advisor and Vanguard Personal Advisor reduce those fees by the amount of revenue that Vanguard (or a Vanguard affiliate) retains from your portfolio in order to calculate your net&nbsp;advisory fee. Note that this fee doesn't include investment expense ratios charged by a fund, such as fees paid to the funds' third-party managers which are not credited. While we generally recommend using low-cost Vanguard funds to build your portfolio, actively managed funds will have higher expense ratios than index funds. Please review each service's advisory brochure for more fee information. You should consult your plan fee disclosure notice for the applicable annual gross advisory fees that apply to your 401(k) account.</p>

<p>All investing is subject to risk, including possible loss of principal. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.</p>
<p>Bond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time, and that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer's ability to make payments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vanguard is reducing expense ratios for certain share classes of some funds. There is no guarantee that any individual investor will save money due to the reductions in fund expense ratios. Not all fund share classes will have a reduced expense ratio and therefore not all investors will experience the estimated savings. Investors that purchase the relevant funds after the expense ratios have been reduced will not experience savings. Savings means future money not spent on expense ratios and does not entail a rebate or deposit of any sort. Savings figures are estimates and should not be relied upon. Savings is based on data as of November 30, 2024; if other data is used, savings may differ. Estimated savings accrue to existing investors holding relevant share classes for 2024 and 2025. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance is not indicative of future results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Vanguard Cash Plus Account is a brokerage account offered by Vanguard Brokerage Services, a division of Vanguard Marketing Corporation, member FINRA and SIPC. Under the Sweep Program, Eligible Balances swept to Program Banks are not securities: they are not covered by SIPC, but are eligible for FDIC insurance, subject to applicable limits. Money market funds held in the account are not guaranteed or insured by the FDIC, but are securities eligible for SIPC coverage.

<p>Savings accounts may have characteristics that differentiate them from bank sweep programs offered by Vanguard Cash Plus. For example, they may offer overdraft protection, ATM access (immediate access to your money), and other convenience features. Each company's products differ, so it's important to ask questions to understand account features.</p>
