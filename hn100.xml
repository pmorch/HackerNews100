<b>Shit life syndrome</b> (<b>SLS</b>) is a phrase used by physicians in the United Kingdom and the United States for the effect that a variety of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty" title="Poverty">poverty</a> or abuse-induced disorders can have on patients.
</p><p>Sarah O'Connor's 2018 article for the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times" title="Financial Times">Financial Times</a></i> "Left behind: can anyone save the towns the economy forgot?" on shit life syndrome in the English coastal town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpool" title="Blackpool">Blackpool</a> won the 2018 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orwell_Prize" title="Orwell Prize">Orwell Prize for Exposing Britain's Social Evils</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Orwell_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-Orwell-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FT17_2-0"><a href="#cite_note-FT17-2">[2]</a></sup> O'Connor wrote that
</p>
<blockquote><p>Blackpool exports healthy skilled people and imports the unskilled, the unemployed and the unwell. As people overlooked by the modern economy wash up in a place that has also been left behind, the result is a quietly unfolding health crisis. More than a tenth of the town's working-age inhabitants live on state benefits paid to those deemed too sick to work. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant" title="Antidepressant">Antidepressant</a> prescription rates are among the highest in the country. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy" title="Life expectancy">Life expectancy</a>, already the lowest in England, has recently started to fall. Doctors in places such as this have a private diagnosis for what ails some of their patients: "Shit Life Syndrome"&nbsp;... People with SLS really do have mental or physical health problems, doctors say. But they believe the causes are a tangled mix of economic, social and emotional problems that they — with 10- to 15-minute slots per patient — feel powerless to fix. The relationship between economics and health is blurry, complex and politically fraught. But it is too important to ignore.</p><p>— <cite>Sarah O'Connor, "Left behind: can anyone save the towns the economy forgot?", <i>Financial Times</i> (2017)<sup id="cite_ref-FT17_2-1"><a href="#cite_note-FT17-2">[2]</a></sup></cite></p></blockquote>
<p>In a column for <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Irish_Times" title="The Irish Times">The Irish Times</a></i>, writer John McManus questioned whether Ireland had developed shit life syndrome in the wake of a recent fall in life expectancy.<sup id="cite_ref-IrishTimes_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-IrishTimes-3">[3]</a></sup>
</p><p>A 2018 article in <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quietus" title="The Quietus">The Quietus</a></i> on the films of the British director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Leigh" title="Mike Leigh">Mike Leigh</a> identified shit life syndrome in Leigh's 2002 film <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_or_Nothing_(film)" title="All or Nothing (film)">All or Nothing</a></i>. Kinney wrote that "The film asks questions about poverty – what does poverty do to people? How do you react when the chips are down?&nbsp;... The rise of populism in this country has been analysed through the lens of the 'left behind' – in a less crude way, this is exactly what <i>All or Nothing</i> was observing sixteen years ago."<sup id="cite_ref-Quietus_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-Quietus-4">[4]</a></sup>
</p><p>Rosemary Rizq, in an essay in the 2016 collection <i>The Future of Psychological Therapy</i>, questioned the origin of the term <i>shit life syndrome</i>, writing that "The phrase seemed to denote a level of long-standing poverty, family breakdown, lack of stability, unemployment and potential risk factors common to many of the predominately young, working class patients referred to the [psychotherapeutic] service" for shit is "something that we continually reject, get rid of or hide. At the same time it is something we cannot completely repudiate, it is part of us, something we need" and that the individuals with SLS have problems so "terrible, so untouchable" that they "quite literally cannot be thought about, cannot be handled by the service", yet a therapeutic organisation is "obliged to do so".<sup id="cite_ref-Lees2016_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-Lees2016-5">[5]</a></sup>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">




<article>
  
  
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.datasette.cloud/">Datasette Cloud</a> is the new SaaS hosting platform for the <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> open source project. It enables teams to create a private collaboration space, upload and share data securely with each other, and then selectively publish that data to the world.</strong></p>
  <div>
    <p>Datasette was <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2018/Aug/19/instantly-publish-datasette/">born out of data journalism</a>, and the initial intended audience for Datasette Cloud is newsrooms: we want to help journalists share data with each other and with the public without needing to configure and run Datasette on their own hosting provider.</p>
<p>We expect that tools which help journalists find stories in data will be of value to all kinds of other companies and organizations as well though, so everyone else is invited to try out the product too!</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Teams can create a private <strong>space</strong> to collaborate on data, hosted in a region close to them. Spaces each run in their own secure container (powered by <a href="https://fly.io/">Fly.io</a>) and get their own <code>space-name.datasette.cloud</code> subdomain.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of the screen where you create a space, picking a location in the world to host it" src="https://datasette-cloud-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/2023/welcome/pick-region.jpg" width="500"></p>
<p>The space administrator can then invite further members to join their space.</p>
<p>Team members can import data into their space in multiple different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upload CSV files to create tables</li>
<li>Load CSV files from a URL</li>
<li>Import data from government open data portals that are powered by <a href="https://dev.socrata.com/">Socrata</a></li>
<li>Create new databases by uploading a SQLite database file</li>
<li>Import data using the <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/1.0a3/json_api.html#the-json-write-api">Datasette Write JSON API</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Once imported, data can be edited inline through the Datasette Cloud web interface. See <a href="https://www.datasette.cloud/blog/2023/introducing-datasette-write-ui/">Introducing datasette-write-ui: a Datasette plugin for editing, inserting, and deleting rows</a>.</p>
<p>Data in Datasette Cloud can then be accessed using all of the tools provided by Datasette:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Datasette web interface, with filtering, faceting and the ability to run SQL queries and bookmark the results. See <a href="https://datasette.io/tutorials/explore">Exploring a database with Datasette</a> for a tutorial and live demos, and <a href="https://datasette.io/tutorials/learn-sql">Learn SQL with Datasette</a> for information on using SQL to query your data.</li>
<li>A powerful JSON API, protected by finely-grained API tokens, for accessing tables and executing SQL queries.</li>
<li>A GraphQL API to all of your tabular data, powered by the <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-graphql">datasette-graphql</a> plugin.</li>
</ul>
<p>All data in Datasette Cloud is stored securely in Fly volumes, and also backed up to S3 using <a href="https://litestream.io/">Litestream</a>.</p>
<h2>What's coming next?</h2>
<p>We're working on a number of features that will be coming to Datasette Cloud soon:</p>
<ul>
<li>AI-assisted queries. We've been researching ways Large Language Models (the technology behind OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Claude and Google's Bard) can be responsibly applied to help journalists find stories in data. Read more at <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">llm.datasette.io</a>.</li>
<li>The ability to publish selected tables and queries to the outside world.</li>
<li>Data annotations: your team will be able to add comments to columns and rows in your data, making it easier to collaborate on data analysis and find stories in your data.</li>
<li>Pricing! We want you to be able to pay for the product, so you can feel confident in its sustainable future and we can get paid to keep working on it.</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
      <article>
        
        

        
        <div>
          <p>In 2021, I developed a tool to stream the content of my reMarkable.
(and I also blogged about it <a href="https://blog.owulveryck.info/2021/03/30/streaming-the-remarkable-2.html">here</a>).
Given that I was predominantly working from home, this tool was very useful, allowing me to sketch elements during conference calls.</p>
<p>One of the primary benefits of this tool was its ability to stream content directly into a web browser tab.
This feature was particularly useful because it meant I could exclusively share this tab during video calls, ensuring focus on the content I intended to present.</p>
<p>At its core, the tool consisted of two main components:</p>
<ol>
<li>A server running on the device, responsible for capturing the raw image and transmitting it to the laptop.</li>
<li>A service on the laptop, which fetched the raw image from the server and processed it into a format suitable for browser viewing (I produced an MJPEG stream for this).</li>
</ol>
<p>Being the product manager of my own tools offered a unique perspective.
One piece of feedback I provided from my experience as a user was the slightly cumbersome nature of the tool’s on-the-fly activation.
The challenge arose from the necessity of a local service. During video calls, this meant some preparatory steps to initiate the local service, adding an additional layer of complexity to the process.</p>
<p>Recognizing this pain point, my goal became clear: eliminate the need for the local service.
This article delves into the revamped implementation of the streaming tool, which now boasts a more user-friendly design and improved performances.</p>
<h2 id="make-it-work-the-evolution-from-old-to-new">Make it work: The Evolution from Old to New</h2>
<p>The code running on the device must have a low footprint.
One way to ensure it remains lightweight is by eliminating any heavy computation on the device.
The sole function of the code running on the server is to grab the raw picture from the memory and expose it over the network.
This led to a three-tier design: server/client/renderer.</p>
<p><em>Ubiquitous language:</em></p>
<p>In this article:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The server</strong> refers to the code running on the reMarkable (the device). Its main purpose is to expose the raw image of the current display on the reMarkable.</li>
<li><strong>The client</strong> is responsible for fetching the raw image from the server and performing additional processes to convert it into a usable format.</li>
<li><strong>The renderer</strong> accepts the output from the client and displays it on a PC screen.</li>
</ul>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>To minimize CPU usage, the server extracts the picture only when the client is connected.
This functionality was achieved through gRPC communication.</p>
<p>The server can thus operate as a daemon on the reMarkable, awaiting an RPC call from the client.
To initiate streaming, I simply needed to activate the client.
The client retrieves the image in a loop, and each image is encoded in JPEG before being added to an MJPEG stream.
This stream is then made available as an HTTP service by the client.</p>
<p>The renderer is any software capable of reading the MJPEG stream via HTTP, such as VLC or a web browser.</p>
<p>One challenge with this setup is that it necessitates a specific network topology and configuration.
The client must not only be aware of the reMarkable’s address but also possess the necessary privileges to establish a server.
Additionally, the renderer must be familiar with the client’s IP address.</p>
<p>While this wasn’t an issue in my personal setup, complications arose post-pandemic when I returned to in-person presentations.
I realized the need for a more straightforward solution.
My ultimate aim became the ability to simply input the reMarkable’s address into any browser and instantly access the stream.</p>
<h3 id="new-architecture">New Architecture</h3>
<p>To achieve the objective, the solution involves eliminating the client and instead establishing an HTTP server within the server component.
The client should be implemented in a format that’s interpretable by a browser, such as Javascript or WASM.</p>
<p>My initial approach was to compile the client into WASM.
This seemed promising as it would let me leverage my expertise in Go development.
However, I encountered several limitations that would have necessitated substantial modifications.</p>
<p>Consequently, I opted to develop a second version of the tool, with the client written in Javascript.</p>
<p><em>Side note:</em> At this juncture, I confronted another challenge.
While I possess a broad understanding of Javascript’s functionality and browser rendering processes (what we might term “architectural skills”),
I felt less confident in my hands-on JS development abilities.
I turned to my digital assistant, ChatGPT, for guidance.
With my direction on the desired solution, it provided the necessary code fragments and explanations to bring my vision to life.
I was the developer, he was the coder.</p>
<h3 id="validation-of-the-canvas-renderer">Validation of the “canvas” renderer</h3>
<p>Initially, it was imperative to move away from the MJPEG stream, especially since my operations were now closely aligned with the renderer,
and Javascript possesses the required primitives for image manipulation.</p>
<p>In the browser, the conventional method for handling images is via the <code>canvas</code> element.
My preliminary task was to validate that I could retrieve a raw image from the server and showcase it within a <code>canvas</code>.</p>
<p>I achieved this by accessing the backbone of the canvas that represents the pixel map data in RGBA format and adjusting the pixels based on their values in the raw image from the reMarkable:</p>

<h3 id="basic-drop-in-replacement">Basic Drop-In Replacement</h3>
<p>With the renderer in place, my next step was to implement a lightweight JS client as a substitute.
While gRPC offers robust functionality, it’s not typically considered the gold standard in web development.</p>
<p>Thus, for communication and encapsulation, I gravitated towards the WebSocket protocol.
It was straightforward enough to be incorporated server-side, serving as a seamless drop-in replacement for the RPC server.</p>
<p>Messages delivered via this protocol carry the raw image.
The client remains on standby for these messages, and with each incoming message, the canvas content is updated, effectively emulating a streaming process.</p>
<p>One notable advantage of this approach is the enhanced control over server-side load.
Extracting the raw image demands both memory and CPU resources on the device.
By regulating the message emission frequency, I can efficiently manage device load.</p>
<h2 id="make-it-right-changing-the-streaming-architecture">Make it Right: Changing the Streaming Architecture</h2>
<p>The Websockets-based solution was operational, but it introduced challenges, particularly on iOS.
Furthermore, the Websocket implementation server-side introduced a certain overhead, which I lacked control over.
As a result, I pursued a different strategy to eliminate the use of websockets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One might wonder: Why even need an encapsulation method? Can’t I just directly send the data stream?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, <em>simplicity is complex</em>.</p>
<p>Raising this question of simplicity made me switch to a bare-bones approach: transmitting raw images over the network without any additional encapsulation.</p>
<p>This was feasible because I was privy to the image size, which remains constant due to the resolution of the reMarkable.</p>
<p>I crafted a Go endpoint that continuously wrote images to the wire (specifically to the <code>http.ResponseWriter</code>), using a basic <code>Write</code> method.</p>

<p>With a robust architecture in place, it’s time to fine-tune the tool’s efficiency. One significant challenge arises from the size of the raw picture—approximately 2.5Mb (with a resolution of 1872x1404 for the reMarkable 2). This volume of data needs to be transferred with each frame.</p>
<h3 id="packing-the-values">Packing the Values</h3>
<p>The reMarkable showcases “16” distinct colors. Since the release of FW 3.3, this color palette can be represented as an array of uint4 instead of uint8, as discussed in <a href="https://github.com/owulveryck/goMarkableStream/issues/36">issue 36</a>. Adopting this representation can yield a 50% reduction in data volume.</p>
<p>However, both Go and JavaScript lack native support for the uint4 type.</p>
<p>A viable workaround involves storing data for two pixels within a single byte (uint8). This approach necessitates the creation of two dedicated functions—one for packing in Go and another for unpacking in JavaScript.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="rle-compression-for-enhanced-efficiency">RLE Compression for Enhanced Efficiency</h3>
<p>Having achieved a reduction of 1.2Mb per frame through our packing technique, the next step is to further minimize data transfer.
To accomplish this, we can turn to more sophisticated compression algorithms without straining the reMarkable’s CPU or complicating our implementation.</p>
<p>Upon consulting with peers, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding">Run Length Encoding (RLE)</a> algorithm emerged as a recommended option due to its simplicity and effectiveness.
Without delving into a detailed explanation, the principle behind RLE is relatively straightforward: it involves tallying the consecutive occurrences of the same pixel value and subsequently transmitting this count alongside the pixel value itself.</p>
<p>For instance, let’s consider a sample sequence:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="text"><span><span>1</span><span>0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Using RLE, this sequence transforms to:</p>
<p>Implementing RLE is quite direct.
However, a challenge arises when considering the potential count values, which can soar up to 1872*1404.
Representing such large numbers would necessitate a datatype like uint64.
This poses a risk: in certain scenarios, the “compressed” sequence could end up surpassing the uncompressed picture in size.</p>
<p>To avert this, I opted to cap the count length at 15.
This choice paves the way to represent both the count and the pixel value within a single byte, striking a balance between simplicity and efficiency.</p>
<p>An added advantage of our RLE implementation in Go, which mimics an <code>io.Writer</code>, is its reusability.
If a situation calls for it, I can apply the RLE compression twice, though current circumstances haven’t demanded such a measure.</p>
<p>So far, the transfer is about 200Kb in average.</p>
<h3 id="sending-pictures-only-upon-modification">Sending Pictures Only Upon Modification</h3>
<p>The final optimization is to transmit new frames solely when there’s a change.
Determining whether a picture has been altered would typically require computing a checksum, which can be CPU-intensive.</p>
<p>However, the reMarkable device operates on a Linux system.
Thus, any screen interaction, whether by pen or touch, gets routed through <code>/dev/input/event*</code>.
I’ve introduced a goroutine that monitors these events and dispatches the pictures as necessary.</p>
<p>As a result, in the absence of any events, the CPU usage drops to zero, even if a client remains connected.
During writing operations, the CPU usage hovers around 10% — a level I consider efficient.</p>
<h2 id="end-notes">End Notes</h2>
<p>This application is based on a hack.
The core challenge is about effectively decoupling the interface, which fetches the image, from the client/renderer.</p>
<p>In the prior implementation, there was a complete decoupling facilitated by the protobuf definition between the client and the server.
Historically, when reMarkable introduced its 3.3 firmware, it disrupted the tool, as highlighted by <a href="https://github.com/owulveryck/goMarkableStream/issues/36">issue 36</a> on GitHub.
However, the necessary adjustments fixing this issue impacted only the client component.</p>
<p>It seems firmware version 3.6 might also usher in a breaking change, as indicated by <a href="https://github.com/owulveryck/goMarkableStream/issues/58">issue 58</a>.
I anticipate that addressing this will entail broader modifications.
On the bright side, the self-contained nature of the application (with the client integrated into the server) should streamline updates on the device.</p>
<p>The realm of IT is riddled with trade-offs; there’s no universal solution.
This dynamism and adaptability are what infuse excitement into the domain.</p>
<p>The application and its source code are accessible on <a href="https://github.com/owulveryck/goMarkableStream">github.com/owulveryck/goMarkableStream</a>.</p>

    <p>Theresa MacPhail is a medical anthropologist, former journalist and associate professor of science and technology studies. She is the author of “<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/636231/allergic-by-theresa-macphail/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Allergic: Our Irritated Bodies In a Changing World</a>” (Random House, 2023), from which this piece has been adapted.</p>
</div>

<p>Elizabeth, an engineer in her late-30s, has three children, all with some form of allergy. Her eldest daughter, Viola, 12, had eczema as a baby; has environmental allergies to pollen; and allergies to corn, tree nuts and peanuts.</p>



<p>Her youngest son, Brian, 3, also had eczema as a baby and subsequently developed allergies to peanuts and barley, though Elizabeth fears there could be more. Her middle daughter, five-year-old Amelia, had a dairy allergy as an infant, but is now just lactose intolerant. She’s the easiest of the three, at least in terms of allergy.</p>



<p>By the time I hear her story, Elizabeth is already a veteran at dealing with her children’s irritated immune systems. She began a support group for parents of children with corn allergies and is heavily involved in trying to educate other parents about food allergies.</p>



<p>The parents share their theories about why their children have allergies. Her own is that Viola and Brian both went to the emergency room with high fevers as babies and were given precautionary antibiotics. She blames the antibiotics for altering her children’s gut microbiome and herself for agreeing to the treatment in the first place.</p>



<p>Part of Elizabeth’s rationale is that no one else in her family has allergies. In fact, it’s so rare that her parents initially didn’t believe the diagnoses. They argued that “back in their day,” everyone ate everything and was fine; food allergy was made-up nonsense. But when both Viola and Brian landed in the ER repeatedly for food-related anaphylaxis, her parents realized these allergies were indeed “real.”</p>



<p>Elizabeth’s family’s routines have been upended. “My life revolves around cooking for them,” she explains. “We don’t eat out. We don’t trust people preparing their food.” Instead, Elizabeth gets up daily at 6:30 a.m. to cook a breakfast that avoids allergens for all three kids. Then she cooks and packs their lunches, preparing everything from scratch because most packaged foods contain at least one ingredient that one of her children will react to.</p>



<p>On a recent vacation with four other families, Brian ended up in the ER with anaphylaxis due to cross-contamination. Elizabeth says she will never share a house again if she’s not the “cleaning boss,” which basically means being not only continuously vigilant about the foods prepared in the kitchen but also thoroughly cleaning and wiping down anything that an allergy-inducing food touches. It’s a labor of love and worry in equal measure.</p>



<p>Brian’s allergies are the most severe. Though only a toddler, he knows some foods are dangerous. “I’ll ask him, ‘Do you know why you can’t have that?’” Elizabeth said. “And he’ll say, ‘Yes, Brian allergic. Makes me <em>owie</em>. Mommy give me shot and we go to hospital.’ He remembers the EpiPen. He remembers it because those things hurt. It’s an inch and a half needle jabbed into you.”</p>



<p>Brian runs away whenever he sees Elizabeth pack an EpiPen, a potentially life-saving device for allergy sufferers, into one of their bags. She says it makes her feel like she’s the biggest monster in the world. Not only because of her son’s reaction, but also because she ultimately feels responsible for his allergy.</p>



<p>Although allergy researchers may disagree on definitions, symptoms and methodology, all agree on one thing: Allergies have grown <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/05/30/1178433166/theresa-macphail-allergic-allergies" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">worse</a> over the last few decades, and the staggering numbers of allergy sufferers worldwide is likely to continue growing. An estimated 235 million people worldwide have asthma, and anywhere from 240 to 550 million people globally may suffer from food allergies. Drug allergy may affect up to 10% of the world’s population.</p>



<p>There’s a consensus, looking at the last century’s data, that U.S. hay fever rates increased in the mid-20th century. Data suggests that the incidence of asthma increased beginning in the 1960s, peaking sometime in the 1990s. Since then, asthma rates have remained fairly constant. Respiratory allergic diseases and atopic sensitization (or skin allergy) have likely increased over the last few decades. But the most dramatic and visible increase has been the rise in global incidence rates for food allergies, which began in earnest in the 1990s and has grown steadily ever since.</p>



<p>There are, unsurprisingly, multiple theories about the cause. The hygiene hypothesis is one front-runner, positing that people who are “too clean” develop allergies. Many others think it’s our diet, that changes in the way we grow and prepare food have altered our gut microbiome, fueling allergies. Still others argue that manmade chemicals and plastics we encounter daily are making our immune systems more irritable.</p>

<p>What everyone agrees on is that the environment’s influence on our genes, or epigenetics, has played a large role in the rise of allergies, as does the makeup of our nose, gut and skin microbiomes. In the end, it appears, we are at least partially doing this to ourselves. Modern living is likely at the root of the recent rise in allergies.</p>



<h2 id="h-our-changing-microbiomes"><strong>Our Changing Microbiomes</strong></h2>



<p>If you want to better understand how our modern lifestyles might be behind some of our biggest problems with allergy, you will end up talking to a diminutive, deeply intelligent, empathetic woman named Cathryn Nagler, who is one of the best immunologists in the world. Her decades of research primarily focuses on the role our gut microbiome plays in the development of children’s food allergy. She remembers when food allergy rates first began climbing in the late 1980s.</p>



<p>“I saw it myself,” Nagler said, loading graphs onto her computer in her University of Chicago office on a sunny spring afternoon. “I have kids that are 23 and 27, so I followed this in real-time because cupcakes were excluded from the classrooms as my kids went through school. Right around the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, when food allergy rates were starting to increase, the American Academy of Pediatrics said to withhold peanuts and allergenic foods from pregnant mothers, from nursing mothers and from children with risk of allergy until they’re four years old. That was exactly the wrong advice, and that fueled the fire and caused even more increase. Now all of the push is for <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26456447/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">early introduction</a>.”</p>



<p>Nagler is referencing the now-famous Learning Early about Peanut Allergy (LEAP) study, conducted by researchers in the United Kingdom and the United States, led by Dr. Gideon Lack at King’s College in London and <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1414850" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">published</a> in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2015. The study found that decades of erroneous advice to parents to avoid giving children younger than three years old anything containing peanuts had likely led to a massive increase in the incidence and severity of peanut allergy.</p>



<p>Infants enrolled in the study (four to 11 months old) were randomly assigned to two groups: parents in one group would continue to avoid peanuts; parents in the other would introduce peanuts to their children right away. Infants in both groups were given skin-prick tests for peanut sensitivities. Among those who tested negative, the prevalence of peanut allergy at 60 months of age was 13.7% in the peanut avoidance group and merely 1.9% in the peanut consumption group. Among those who had tested positive for sensitivity to peanuts, the prevalence of peanut allergy was 35.3% in the avoidance group and 10.6% in the consumption group.</p>



<p>A recent study in Melbourne, Australia, <a href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(20)31772-3/fulltext" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">found</a> that changes to dietary advice on peanuts in 2016, following the success of the initial LEAP study, had led to a 16% decrease in peanut allergy among infants. It’s perfectly clear that introducing peanuts to infants has a protective effect.</p>



<p>Nagler understands why parents might be hesitant, however, to introduce allergens into the diet early. After all, why would anyone trust the same people who gave them incorrect advice just a few years prior? Plus, she doesn’t think there’s definitive evidence that early introduction is good.</p>



<p>“You can be sensitized even before the first introduction of solid food,” Nagler explains. “Kids get allergic responses within the first month of life. That means they could have been sensitized by breast milk or by the skin. If you give early introduction to a kid like that, that kid is going to have an allergic response. So early introduction is risky, but now we know withholding is not good either.”</p>



<p>So how does the body learn to tolerate some foods and begin to react negatively to others? Nagler is convinced that food allergy as a phenomenon is part of a generational change.</p>



<p>“People will tell you that there is no history in their family of this,” she explains. “From parents with no family history of allergy to kids that have life-threatening responses to a crumb. You can be allergic to any food. Your allergy can develop at any point in your life. It used to appear between the ages of two and five. Now we’re getting a lot more adult-onset food allergy. It used to be that milk, eggs, wheat allergy were outgrown. Now they’re lasting into adulthood.”</p>



<p>In other words, food allergies signal a larger problem.</p>



<p>Nagler stops on a slide showing what is likely contributing to our immune system’s malaise: diet, C-sections, changes in food production, breastfeeding.</p>

  </div>




<p>“The idea is that modern industrialized lifestyle factors have triggered shifts in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4498960/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">commensal bacteria</a>,” Nagler says, referencing the so-called friendly bacteria that exist within and alongside us. “<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2022.733992/full" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Inflammatory bowel disease</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6905201/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">allergies</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41574-022-00794-0" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">obesity</a>, <a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/gut-brain-connection-autism" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">autism</a> — all non-communicable chronic diseases. They’ve all been linked to the microbiome.”</p>



<p>And there it is: Nagler’s answer to the all-important question of why allergies are rising. Changes to the makeup of our gut microbiome — or all the bacteria, fungi and viruses that help<strong> </strong>process our food into useable fuel for our cells — are driving immune function changes.</p>



<p>Recent studies have highlighted the connection between our diet, use of antibiotics and our gut bacteria in the development of allergies. A 2019 study led by Nagler <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30643289/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">showed</a> that the gut of healthy infants harbored a specific class of allergy-protective bacteria not found in infants with cow’s milk allergy. This was followed by a study at Brigham and Women’s Hospital that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0461-z" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">found</a> that five or six specific strains of gut bacteria in infants seem to be protective of developing food allergies. A lead researcher on that study, Dr. Lynn Bry, surmised that our lifestyles are, for better or for worse, capable of “resetting the immune system.”</p>



<p>Another study found that higher levels of cheese in our diet may accidentally worsen allergy symptoms because bacteria in some cheeses produce histamine — the naturally-occurring compound that helps trigger an effective immune response. University of California, San Francisco researchers led a study that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6830510/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">discovered</a> a link between three species of gut bacteria and the production of a fatty molecule called 12,13-diHOME. That molecule lowers the number of T-reg cells in our gut, cells crucial for keeping inflammation at bay. The researchers found that babies with higher levels of these three bacteria had an elevated risk for developing allergy and asthma.</p>



<p>Ultimately, most of us living in the 21st century have changed our microbiome makeup. Our diets are the real culprit, according to Nagler.<strong> </strong>When we go from eating foods with lots of fiber to highly processed foods loaded with sugar and fat, we end up starving beneficial bacteria in our gut.</p>



<p>“We’ve co-evolved with our microbes,” Nagler says. But “they can’t live without their food.”</p>



<p>There’s also the use of antibiotics that kill off not only the bacteria that cause strep throat and sinus infections, but our gut bacteria. And we eat meat from animals that have been given low-dose antibiotics to make them <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/do-antibiotics-make-us-fat" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">fat</a>. We’re experimenting on ourselves and our microbiomes, Nagler says, to deleterious effect.</p>



<p>Nagler has <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27096316/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">developed</a> the “barrier regulation” hypothesis, which theorizes that our gut and skin microbiomes regulate what is and isn’t allowed into the body. Commensal bacteria on the skin and in the gut are integral to maintaining barrier function. Nagler explains that a single layer of epithelial cells is all that stands between us and our environment, making sure that what enters our bodies is either inhaled or ingested.</p>



<p>Indeed, in 2018 researchers <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30249647/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">discovered</a> a link between a gene coding for an antiviral protein in the gut, changes in the gut microbiota, and greater intestinal permeability and severe allergic skin reactions in mice. Gut microbiomes are an intricately balanced mix of different species of bacteria, viruses and fungi. Mice lacking the gene for the antiviral protein had a changed microbiome — or the amounts and types of different bacteria and viruses.</p>



<p>This suggests that our immune systems have developed ways of coping with microbes in our gut and maintaining balance. When the composition of the microbiota changes, the immune components’ responses shift, making us more miserable in the process. This is evidence of how our genes and the environment (changes to the gut microbiota) interact to produce allergy; it also proves Nagler’s larger point that altered gut microbiota can have a direct effect on allergy.</p>



<p>Avery August, an immunologist at Cornell University, describes human immune cells as curators of the human body — constantly sensing everything we encounter and making millions of micro-decisions about what should become a part of the human body or coexist with us and what should not.</p>



<p>The barrier regulation theory dovetails nicely with the conception of our entire immune system — microbiome included — as curators of what can and cannot be part of us. Without the regulation that those barrier cells provide, entire proteins can pass through our skin or gut into the bloodstream, where they encounter our immune cells.</p>

<p>The allergic person’s immune system is wholly functional; it is doing what it was meant to do. For Nagler, the problem is that it’s performing a job different from the one it was initially trained to do. From this perspective, allergic disease is a barrier problem, not necessarily an immune system problem.</p>



<p>All creatures, even invertebrates, have an associated microbiota, Nagler explains, which performs vital physiological functions. Without microbiota, there would be no life at all. The human gut encounters antigens from a hundred trillion — or 100,000,000,000,000 — commensal microbes and more than 30 kilograms — or 66 pounds — of food proteins per year. Cells making up the gut barrier must discern between what is harmful — pathogens like harmful outside bacteria or viruses — and what are harmless antigens.</p>



<p>To Nagler, Elizabeth’s theory blaming antibiotics for her children’s food allergies isn’t so far-fetched. Changes in the gut microbiome in infants and children can lead to a greater risk of developing allergic responses as children age. And our children’s earliest environments are likely the most crucial.</p>



<p>The microbiome has been shown to be incredibly stable by age three. Alterations before this age seem to be critical to whether allergies ultimately develop. A study led by France’s Pasteur Institute <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761319300810?via%3Dihub" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">found</a> evidence in mouse models for the role of gut microbiota in the development of a healthy immune system in as young as three to six months of age, around when most human babies are first introduced to solid foods.</p>



<p>Bacteria in the gut increased 10- to 100-fold after solid foods were introduced. This stage of rapid microbiome growth and development, called “pathogenic imprinting,” seems to determine one’s susceptibility to inflammatory disorders like allergy and autoimmune disorders in adulthood. Antibiotics could theoretically disrupt this developmental stage, producing a greater risk of allergic diseases.</p>



<p>So far, scientific evidence appears to back this up. Research by Rutgers University and the Mayo Clinic <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33208243/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">found</a> that children under age two who are given antibiotics are at greater risk for asthma, respiratory allergies, eczema, celiac disease, obesity and ADHD. The study looked at 14,572 children born in Olmsted County, Minnesota, between 2003 and 2011. If antibiotics were given in their first six months, the risk increased dramatically.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers found that 70% of the children in the study had been prescribed at least one antibiotic in the first 48 months of their lives (typically for respiratory or ear infections). Another study <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7796951/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">found</a> that antibiotics can allow for the growth of non-pathogenic fungus in the human gut, which may make respiratory allergies more severe. Finally, related studies<strong> </strong>of <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aad0917" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Finnish</a> and <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aad7121" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">New York</a> babies <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2016/06/15/antibiotics-c-sections-may-change-childs-health-for-the-long-term/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">found</a> that C-sections and antibiotics correlated with altered gut microbiomes and a greater risk of allergies in childhood.</p>



<p>These findings don’t surprise Nagler. Vaginal births give infants what are known as “founder bacteria,” she tells me. As the baby moves through the vaginal canal, it is exposed to its mother’s friendly bacteria. Breastfeeding introduces more helpful bacteria into the infant’s gut.</p>



<p>“If you skip over both of those processes, which many people have done, you’ve disordered the microbiome,” Nagler explains. “The first 100 -1,000 days of life are absolutely critical for the development of the immune system.”</p>



<p>Research has shown that babies born by C-section not only haven’t been exposed to the correct, harmless vaginal founder bacteria, but they have also been exposed to potentially harmful hospital bacteria. One recent review <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10146705/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">found</a> that lactobacillus containing probiotics — the same bacilli found in breast milk — lowered SCORAD (Scoring Atopic Dermatitis) scores for children under age three who had moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, or more severe eczema.</p>



<p>Breastfeeding for the first three months of life has also been <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32128903/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">linked</a> with a lower risk of respiratory allergies and asthma. In a study of 1,177 mother/child pairs, breastfed babies had a 23% lower relative risk of allergies by age six and a 34% lower relative risk of asthma if there was no family history of asthma.</p>



<p>But for children whose mothers supplemented breast milk with formula, the protective effect seemed to have mostly disappeared. (Important aside: If you’re a mother and you’re panicking a bit right now, please don’t. There are many valid reasons to have C-sections and to choose formula over breastmilk. A lot of this is complicated and there’s a lot that we still don’t know about these interactions.)</p>

<p>Nagler reminds me that the cattle industry has been giving cows low doses of antibiotics for years to make them fatter and more commercially viable. We also eat <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/05/25/1178163270/ultra-processed-foods-health-risk-weight-gain" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">highly processed food </a>that’s low in fiber, with added sugars and fats. That means that the food we’re introducing into our guts is different from what our ancestors ate for millennia. That, of course, affects the types of bacteria that can flourish inside us.</p>



<p>Even simply changing bedsheets can change our microbiomes. Researchers in Denmark and the U.K. looked at samples from 577 six-month-old infants’ beds and compared them to respiratory samples taken from 542 of those infants<strong> </strong>at age three months old). Researchers <a href="https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-020-00895-w" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">found</a> 930 different types of bacteria and 103 genera of fungi.</p>



<p>A correlation was found between bacteria in bed dust and those found in the associated children; while the two populations of bacteria were not exactly synonymous, they did seem to directly affect each other. An increase or decrease in respiratory bacteria mirrored an increase or decrease in the bacteria in the infants’ beds. The <a href="https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-020-00895-w" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">research</a> suggests that less frequent changing of bed linens may benefit the health of all our nasal and airway microbiomes.</p>



<p>Many of the researchers I spoke to longed to return to a simple, less technologically driven way of life mostly centered on the foods we consume and how we produce them. One top allergist dreamt of performing the ultimate control study to prove that our modern lifestyle and habits negatively affect our immune systems.</p>



<p>“Imagine,” he said, “if we could get a group of people to revert back to a much older way of life. Eat foods grown without pesticides. Eat whole foods and a wide variety. Don’t use dishwashers or detergents. Do you know what would happen? No more allergies. I just wish I could prove it.”</p>



<h2 id="h-the-canaries-in-our-coal-mines"><strong>The Canaries In Our Coal Mines</strong></h2>



<p>The most compelling evidence that our 21st-century lifestyles and manmade environmental changes have spurred our allergies is this: Our companion species of thousands of years — dogs, cats, birds and horses — all get allergies regularly. Other species — those that do not live in our homes or alongside us — do not.
          </p>
        



<p>Our pets’ symptoms are very similar to ours: sneezing, snoring, asthma, vomiting and over-grooming in cats; skin eruptions, persistent scratching and grooming in dogs; coughing and wheezing in horses. And they likely have allergies for the same reasons we do. After all, their immune systems are exposed to the same panoply of natural and chemical substances. The top allergen in dogs? Dust mites. The top allergen in horses? Their human-packaged feed. Cats are often allergic to grass, trees, and weed pollen. Cats and dogs can also be allergic to human dander, since we shed skin, too. Sound familiar?</p>



<p>Many owners spend lots of time and money trying to eradicate allergy symptoms in their pets. The most common methods are the same as for humans: pets either take antihistamines and steroids or undergo immunotherapy shots. The problem is that we don’t know just how big the problem is because we don’t have good data on pet allergies or their incidence. We don’t know if rates are increasing, or if vets and pet owners are just getting better at recognizing the signs.</p>



<p>To better understand how and why allergies affect our pets, I traveled to Cornell University’s College of Veterinary Medicine to speak with Elia Tait<strong> </strong>Wojno, who started her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgHXqiQLgmo" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">career</a> doing work on parasitic worms and immune responses.</p>



<p>She explains that the immune response to parasitic worms is like the immune response during allergic responses in both humans and in dogs. (Of course, in the case of worms, those responses are protective and, in the case of allergies, the responses are the ones causing the miserable symptoms.) By studying the immune response to helminths (a type of parasitic worm) in dogs, we can learn a lot about the basic immune functions involved in allergy.</p>



<p>Working with dogs allows us to observe how allergies function in something other than mouse models. For decades, mice have been the dominant research organism in the field of immunology. But mice aren’t humans, and mouse models aren’t always the best predictors of what will happen in a human body. That is why<strong> </strong>there’s growing interest among allergy researchers to move beyond mouse models. Since some larger animals have natural allergic diseases, like cats and dogs, they might be good models for learning about basic immunology across species as well as doing drug testing for allergic conditions.</p>

  </div>




<p>Unlike mice, which are confined to the lab, usually inbred and live in very controlled environments, the dogs that Tait<strong> </strong>Wojno works with are born the old-fashioned way. She works with breeders to enroll dogs into her studies and the dogs are treated like pets because they are. These aren’t lab animals; they live at home with their owners. This is an important detail, since that allows researchers to ponder which components of our shared, lived environments, habits and medical practices might be affecting our companion species as well as us.</p>



<p>Allergies in our pets offer potential clues to solving the mystery of allergies. If we can understand early immune response in animals, then we might be able to better understand it in humans. And that’s one of the things we really don’t understand in any mammals — the immune system’s initial reaction to something it encounters and the subsequent set of events that follow. Ultimately, my visit to Cornell convinced me of one thing: Our pets are the literal canaries in our figurative allergy coal mines. The fact that our intimate companions have allergies is a sign that something humans are doing is irritating the immune systems of us all.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-dirt-on-cleanliness"><strong>The Dirt On Cleanliness</strong></h2>



<p>You’re likely already familiar with the most espoused theory of allergy causation, the idea that being “too clean,” or overly hygienic, is not good for childhood development of a properly functioning immune system. Maybe you’ve heard that it’s good to let children play in the dirt, get a little messy and slobber on each other. So goes the basic idea behind the hygiene hypothesis, first posited to try to explain the explosion of asthma, eczema and food allergies in the last half of the 20th century.</p>



<p>In 1989, epidemiologist David Strachan <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1838109/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">published</a> a short article in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), entitled “Hay fever, hygiene, and household size.” Using data from a national sample of over 17,000 British children born during the same week in March 1958, he looked at three things: How many of the study participants self-reported symptoms of hay fever at age 23; How many of their parents had reported hay fever in them at age 11; and when participants were seven, whether the parents remembered if their child had eczema in their first year of life.</p>



<p>Strachan found that younger siblings<strong> </strong>seemed most protected from developing hay fever or eczema, despite differences in socioeconomic class. Strachan posited that the lowered allergy rates might be explained, “if allergic diseases were prevented by infection in early childhood, transmitted by unhygienic contact with older siblings, or acquired prenatally from a mother infected by contact with her older children.”</p>



<p>Smaller family sizes, improvements in housing, and higher cleanliness standards might have combined to reduce the opportunity for children’s exposure to a wide variety of microbes. In other words, Strachan’s findings suggested that mild childhood infections might be beneficial to a developing immune system.</p>



<p>At first this idea was rejected. Many immunologists still believed that bad infections could trigger allergy, especially asthma. But Strachan’s ideas were eventually adopted and popularized after researchers discovered that IgE-mediated (or antibody-driven allergic) immune responses were driving many allergic conditions. It seemed plausible that a lack of early exposure to certain germs was the underlying problem, leaving the immune system “untrained” and hyper-responsive in later life.</p>



<p>Early work on the microbiome and friendly commensal bacteria, Nagler <a href="https://bpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/voices.uchicago.edu/dist/e/1480/files/2019/07/Iweala-and-Nagler-Annual-Reviews-Immunology-2019-published-version.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">co-wrote</a> in a 2019 review, “led to a reformulation of the hygiene hypothesis as the ‘old friends’ or the ‘biodiversity’ hypotheses of allergy, which proposed that changes in the environment, diet and lifestyle associated with Westernized, industrialized countries have altered the diversity of the gut and skin microbiomes.”<sup>8</sup></p>



<p>The “old friends” <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24481186/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">hypothesis</a> posits that humans are more at risk of chronic inflammatory diseases, like allergies or autoimmune disorders, because we no longer regularly encounter some of the microorganisms that we evolved alongside for millennia. These “old friends,” the theory goes, helped regulate our immune function. Their risk to human health was minimal, and a healthy immune system could easily keep them in check. This trained the developing human immune system, making it more robust and adaptive to its normal environment.</p>



<p>In the absence of these old friends, our immune system lacks the early training it needs to better self-regulate and overreacts to otherwise harmless stimuli, like pollen or dust mites.</p>



<p>Nagler explained to me how the hygiene hypothesis and the idea of microbes as old friends combine to produce an almost idyllic conception of farm life and the “farmhouse effect.” Farmhouses, with their tilled soil, muddy barns and stables, and fertile fields, come with a lot of bacteria, viruses and parasites.</p>

      “The most compelling evidence that our 21st-century lifestyles and manmade environmental changes have spurred our allergies is this: Our companion species of thousands of years — dogs, cats, birds and horses — all get allergies regularly.

<p>But if you alter the environment, you alter the microbiota. If you have better sanitation, move away from farms and have fewer children, then you cut off your supply of a richly diverse microbiota. You become, in essence, less intimate with microbes in your day-to-day life. And intimacy with friendly germs, especially in the first few years of life, does seem to be protective of a wide variety of immune disorders — but not all of them.</p>



<p>Recent studies have suggested that there is a measurable “farmhouse effect,” but researchers are uncertain about <em>which exposures </em>are protective and what mechanisms they might be triggering to produce that protective effect. What seems certain is that exposure to livestock from early childhood dramatically lowers the risk of developing allergic conditions later in life.</p>



<p>In particular, exposure to stable dust seems to prevent most allergic responses. Something in “farm dust” is effective — bacteria, viruses, fungi or even more allergens themselves — but it’s not entirely clear which components of the dust are protective, and which aren’t. Another <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11597666/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">study</a> of rural areas in Austria, Germany and Switzerland showed that a farming environment was more protective against hay fever, atopic sensitization and asthma.</p>



<p>If infants spent a lot of time in stables and drank cow’s milk in the first year of their lives, then their rates of allergic diseases dramatically lowered <em>even if </em>their IgE results showed sensitization. In other words, they might have an underlying sensitivity to some allergens, but that sensitivity did not become full-blown allergic responses.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/03/170308083717.htm" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">different study</a> that looked at the immune function of lab-raised mice versus those in a farm’s barn, the “farmhouse effect” was strongly supported. The results of studies in mice are, in fact, one of the key supports for this theory. August explained to me that pathogen-free mice bred for laboratory studies have dramatically different immune systems <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5512602/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">compared</a> to their “unclean” peers; the lab mice have immune systems that resemble a human newborn’s immune system. When you place those “clean” mice in a “dirty” environment — like the mice study did to simulate farm life — their immune systems change to look more like that of an adult human.</p>



<p>This tracks with research in humans that suggests that germ-ridden environments can also protect against allergies. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28381231/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Children</a> and adults who live with dogs have lower rates of asthma and obesity, in part due to more indirect exposure to bacteria that dogs carry and track into the home. A 2017 NIH-sponsored <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28939248/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">study</a> showed that exposing children in the first three years of life to high indoor levels of pet and pest allergens, like cockroach, mouse and cat allergens, lowers their risk of developing asthma by age seven. But whether exposure is protective, depends on the bacteria.</p>



<p>Enter the fascinating case of <em>Helicobacter pylori</em>, or <em>H. pylori</em>, a common gut microbe that’s the culprit behind gastrointestinal ulcers, chronic gastritis and even some forms of cancer.</p>



<p>Although scientists <a href="https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(05)01320-6" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">discovered</a> the species <em>H. pylori </em>in 1982, there is speculation that our colonization by the bacteria took place circa 60,000 years ago and that it depended on repeated contact in small, close-knit groups, i.e. the way humans typically lived until fairly recently. There are many different strains of <em>H. pylori</em>, and their prevalence in humans was estimated to hover around 80% until after World War II, when the introduction of antibiotics like penicillin to treat common infections led <em>H. pylori </em>to begin to disappear from the human gut. Today, it is estimated that around 50% of humans are infected with <em>H. pylori</em>, with <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28456631/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">rates hovering</a> as high as 88% in one African nation and as low as 19% in a European one.</p>



<p>This is in line with the hygiene hypothesis, since transmission of microbes is far easier in large, crowded households with many siblings. <em>H. pylori </em>is usually acquired in early childhood, after the first year, and is transmitted via the ingestion of feces, saliva or vomit (and if you just physically recoiled, I apologize). In the absence of antibiotics, <em>H. pylori</em>, once acquired, can persist in the gut for decades, often for the entire life of its human host. Most people living with <em>H. pylori </em>have no symptoms or ill effects.</p>



<p>The stomachs of people with and without <em>H. pylori </em>are <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrgastro.2014.13#:~:text=TREG%20cells%20have%20an,likely%20to%20develop%20peptic%20ulceration." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">immunologically different</a> and there is speculation that people with <em>H. pylori </em>have a larger gut population of regulatory T cells (Tregs). That’s important because Tregs are crucial for tamping down inflammatory immune responses. Although infection with <em>H. pylori </em>is associated with having more immune cells in the gut, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3888205/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">some researchers</a> have proposed that it may be a normal, rather than a pathological, response to the bacteria.</p>

<p>In other words, <em>H. pylori </em>may be beneficial in some situations. In fact, people who lack the bacteria are much more likely to suffer from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or acid reflux, and there is evidence that <em>H. pylori </em>plays a protective role against childhood-onset asthma.</p>



<p>All this gives credence to the basic premise of the hygiene hypothesis: We need regular exposure to friendly bacteria to train our immune systems. But also, simply living with more diverse microbial populations likely does not automatically produce improved immune system functionality. Dr. Thomas Platts-Mills, director of the University of Virginia School of Medicine’s Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, believes the hygiene hypothesis cannot possibly explain the rise of allergies, at least not by itself. His <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4617537/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">argument</a> relies upon our more recent history of “cleanliness.”</p>



<p>Throughout the 20th century, hygiene standards were adopted more widely. Improved sewage systems and potable drinking water meant human exposure to microbes through ingestion was far less frequent. Regular infection by helminths, or intestinal parasites, had decreased due to food and water quality controls and the increased use of shoes.</p>



<p>During this time people moved from rural farms into urban centers, so the general population also saw lower exposure levels to farm animals and decreased diversity of the bacterial populations they encountered. Family size also decreased, perhaps exposing children to fewer germs. Platts-Mills notes, however, that all these changes were completed by the 1920s, which leaves the dramatic rise of asthma and allergic rhinitis, from the 1940s into the 1950s, unexplained.</p>



<p>Platts-Mills argues that the best explanation for the rise of hay fever and asthma is more likely “an increase in sensitization to indoor allergens and the loss of a lung-specific protective effect of regular deep inspiration.” In other words, outdoor play and recreation were likely more protective against allergies than spending hours playing Minecraft or Fortnite.</p>



<p>If the hygiene hypothesis or farmhouse effect were correct, one would also expect to see a marked decrease in allergy rates in rural, farming communities. Yet Dr. Jill Poole, the University of Nebraska Medical Center division chief of allergy and immunology, found that around 30% of Midwestern farmers suffer from allergic disease directly linked to their agricultural lifestyle. Dust from grain elevators and animal barns, pesticide exposures and grain rot from flooding causes so-called Farmer’s Lung. So while some farm exposures seem beneficial, others are clearly not.</p>



<p>And if family size, rural life and socioeconomic status are linked in the original hypothesis theory, then one might expect that countries with larger family size, more rural populations and lower socioeconomic status would have fewer allergic diseases. Yet their allergies are also steadily increasing.</p>



<p>A 2019 <a href="https://www.independent.co.ug/half-of-ugandans-suffer-from-allergy-study/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">study</a> found that half of Ugandans living in the capital of Kampala have some form of allergy. It found that allergies are on the rise in rural areas, although more urban dwellers have access to hospitals where they can report symptoms of asthma, nasal congestion or skin rash. Many Ugandans self-treat with over-the-counter antihistamines, steroids, and antibiotics. Dr. Bruce Kirenga, a Ugandan allergy expert, said he thinks environmental pressures like air pollution are to blame.</p>



<p>These findings suggest that the farmhouse effect or hygiene hypothesis might not be the smoking gun we’re searching for. The theory makes intuitive sense, but we don’t have enough scientific evidence to definitively say that rural life, with its “dirty” or microbially rich environments, can fully protect us from allergic disease.</p>



<p>And yet, the basic idea that <em>something </em>about our interactions with the microbial world around us has shifted because of our lifestyles and daily habits is compelling. The hygiene hypothesis, then, is likely <em>partially </em>correct. There is growing evidence that some of our habits (particularly in relation to our diets and food production) might be behind the recent rise of allergies — especially food allergy.</p>



<h2 id="h-barrier-warfare"><strong>Barrier Warfare</strong></h2>



<p>In a 1950s pamphlet on allergy, Dr. Samuel Feinberg, a leading allergist and the first president of the now-named American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, wrote: “Man’s progress creates problems.” Feinberg pointed the finger at human ingenuity as a significant cause of the developed world’s increasing allergies. All our tinctures and dyes, our synthetic fabrics and new plastics, our lotions and eyeliner and lipsticks and shampoos were beginning to wreak havoc on our immune systems.</p>



<p>Dr. Donald Leung, an immunologist who is head of allergy and immunology at Denver’s National Jewish Health is also one of the world’s leading researchers on atopic dermatitis. Leung told me that we overuse soap, detergents and products containing alcohol.</p>

<p>We routinely use harsh antimicrobial products to clean our hands and homes, instead of soap and water; a fact exacerbated by the Covid pandemic. All of this can negatively affect our skin barrier, making it more likely we’ll develop an allergic condition.</p>



<p>Furthermore, exposure to food proteins through a weakened skin barrier along with early ingestion of higher doses of food proteins can lead to full-blown <a href="https://naglerlab.uchicago.edu/files/2019/07/Iweala-and-Nagler-Annual-Reviews-Immunology-2019-published-version.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">food allergy</a>. In layman’s terms, that means if you make a peanut butter sandwich and don’t wash your hands and then you pick up your baby, you may be depositing trace amounts of peanut protein onto their skin. If their skin is “leaky,” or more permeable than normal skin due to a possible genetic mutation or a disruption (or irritation) of the skin’s normal microbiome, then that protein could seep into the baby’s skin and when the baby eats peanuts, it can trigger a peanut allergy.</p>



<p>“All the things we’re putting on our skin, or the things we’re putting on our babies’ butts, are probably not good for our barriers,” Robert Schleimer, former chief of allergy and immunology at Northwestern’s Feinberg School of Medicine, told me.</p>



<p>Schleimer said his first job in the 1960s was collecting used cotton diapers for the Tidee Didee Diaper Service for $1.70 an hour. He would bring them back to the laundry facility to be cleaned and repackaged for delivery. As he reflected on the barrier hypothesis, he noted that cotton is a natural fabric. Now we use plastic diapers with antimicrobial properties and apply creams to babies’ skin to prevent rashes from those materials. And that’s just <em>one </em>of the changes that might be exposing our children to more irritants.</p>



<p>“You have these very tough detergents made of rough chemicals that break things down,” said Dr. Kari Nadeau, director of Stanford University’s Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy &amp; Asthma Research. “And initially that was seen as positive. Then they started to see that, wait a minute, all these people working in the plants that are making those detergents have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-detergent-exposure/detergent-exposure-hard-on-workers-lungs-studies-idUSTRE5AQ47S20091127" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">breathing</a> issues.”</p>



<p>In our discussion, Nadeau is adamant about the downsides of modern living, especially when it comes to daily chemical exposure. She points to the recent rise in severe eczema. In the 1940s and 1950s, the image of a “squeaky clean” home was heavily promoted by the same companies making these new detergents (like Dow Chemicals).</p>



<p>“It turns out that the way my grandmother lived on the farm was probably the right way to do things: not using a lot of detergents, not bathing every day, making sure you were exposed to a little bit of dirt, being exposed to the outdoors,” Nadeau said.</p>



<p>In one recent study, Canadian university researchers found that infants less than four months old living in a home where household cleaning products were used more frequently were more likely to develop wheezing and asthma by age three. Researchers noted that most of the infants spent between 80-90% of their time indoors — heavily increasing their exposure to these products.</p>



<p>Study co-author Dr. Anne Ellis noted that children take more frequent breaths than adults and, unlike adults, breathe mostly through their mouths —&nbsp;bypassing the nose’s natural filtration system and allowing anything in the air to more easily penetrate the lungs. The researchers hypothesized that fumes from cleaning products inflamed their respiratory tracts, activating the babies’ innate immune systems. The frequent use of household products such as air fresheners, deodorizers, antimicrobial hand sanitizers, oven cleaners and dusting sprays seemed particularly harmful.</p>



<p>Exposure to problematic chemicals in gestation can be equally harmful to developing immune systems. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28392331/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">One study</a> found that higher concentrations of plasticizers, or solvents used to make materials more flexible, equated to a greater risk of developing allergies. Researchers measured levels of Benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), a common plasticizer used to make Polyvinyl chloride (PVC or vinyl), in the urine of pregnant women and new mothers. They found that exposure to these phthalates during pregnancy and breastfeeding caused epigenetic changes to specific repressors for <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2022.945063/full" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Th2 immune cells</a> responsible for generating inflammation.</p>



<h2 id="h-our-dark-sedentary-lives"><strong>Our Dark Sedentary Lives</strong></h2>



<p>Changes to our work and leisure habits may also be contributing to the rise in allergies. We live much of our lives in the shade, Dr. Pamela Guerrerio at the NIH told me. The lack of the sun’s UVB rays on our skin, means our cells produce less vitamin D. It’s unclear how protective vitamin D is against allergies, but the ongoing debate over the evidence shows how little we know about the ill effects of our move indoors.</p>

<p>Dr. Scott Sicherer, director of Mount Sinai’s Elliot and Roslyn Jaffe Food Allergy Institute in New York, told me that both autoimmune and allergy diseases tend to occur at higher rates when a person lives farther from the equator. That fact made immunologists <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6047889/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">consider</a> whether vitamin D was involved in immune disorders, since people are exposed to less sunlight at higher latitudes.</p>



<p>But Sicherer also noted, “there might be fewer people engaged in farming lifestyles at those latitudes. There might be different exposures to different things in different regions of the globe. It’s so complex that we just don’t know.”</p>



<p>Guerrerio agreed, remarking that people around the globe have different diets, which, along with less sunlight, might compound immune system impacts. Guerrerio said it’s likely several factors cause allergies — including our indoor-prone lifestyles — and that several interventions will be necessary to reverse the effects on our immune systems.</p>



<p>As for Elizabeth and her children, Elizabeth’s misplaced sense of guilt is intimately tied to her desire to provide them with the best care. But her decision to allow her very ill babies to receive antibiotics was almost certainly the correct one, given the likelihood of more dangerous outcomes without treatment. Still, her sense of regret lingers — and she is most certainly not alone.</p>



<p>We are regularly bombarded with advice about how to keep ourselves and our children healthy and happy. You can try to “game the immune system,” but I don’t recommend it. As we learn more from experts about how our immune systems react and respond to our ever-changing environments, it’s best to come to terms with the fact that it’s highly unlikely that we can directly cause our own or someone else’s allergies. Reality is almost always more complicated than that.</p>

<p>The phrase arrived in my head so completely formed and concrete that I couldn’t believe it wasn’t already established in the lexicon, but at least preliminary searches suggest it is not. Of the people I have said the phrase to thus far — mostly a very small group of local women and one Parisian-based knitter — 95% immediately understood without further definition. This one registers loudly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Executive Function Theft (EFT) is the deliberate abdication of decision-making, tasks, and responsibilities that are perceived as administrative or repetitive, of lesser importance, or aren’t pleasant or shiny, to another person, with the result that the receiving person’s executive function becomes so exhausted that they are unable to participate in, contribute to, or enjoy higher level efforts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I say deliberate, it’s easy to picture a caricature villain chuckling to themselves of “oh, I am going to STEAL that executive function from Isobel and keep that precious capacity for myself!” Such extreme villains are hopefully rare as individuals, though perhaps not when we consider my corporate example below. But it is still a deliberate even if not consciously malicious choice. The thief has chosen to prioritize their executive function over another person’s and, having found that this makes their lives easier, repeats this behavior unless it is disrupted. When later called upon to carry their portion of the group executive function needed, they may become resentful or default to stereotypes (often gendered/racial) such as “oh she’s pickier than me, does it better, is just a good planner, they aren’t being tracked for leadership” or the thief may actively call to how they are busy doing “bigger picture things” with the implication that they must be protected from little things. They may also engage in willful or weaponized incompetence in order to maintain their ability to continue EFT.</p>



<p><strong>Everyone Faces Corporate EFT</strong></p>



<p>At one point as I work on this essay, I’m sitting on hold with the company that manages my health flexible spending account (FSA). Healthcare in the United States and attempting to manage and pay for it is an exquisite example of EFT. For example, today’s process involved:</p>



<ul>
<li>Receiving a bill from a provider</li>



<li>Reviewing the bill for accuracy (this is a recurring appointment)</li>



<li>Going to the provider’s billing website and make a payment (make sure you go through the email link, otherwise, you have to loop around 6 times in search of where to pay and re-enter all the details)</li>



<li>Going to FSA website and starting the process for reimbursement, which has to be entered as three different claims (see recurring)</li>



<li>Finding out that I am back to getting paper checks despite giving them direct deposit information</li>



<li>Attempting to get help via chat –which results in an agent or chatbot who keeps not reading anything I submit “what claim number is this about?” (one I haven’t submitted yet) “just go to your settings and set up a direct deposit!” (already did that)</li>



<li>Calling and wait on hold for a customer service agent</li>



<li>Finding out that because the “initial default setting for my employer” is pay-by-check there is no way AT ALL to get them to change it to direct deposit unless I wait for the FSA company to approve the payment and cut the check and then call to have them reissue the payment as a direct deposit.</li>



<li><strong>Pending</strong>: Monitoring the mail to receive 3 checks</li>



<li><strong>Pending: </strong>Taking the checks over to my bank – no I haven’t moved to phone-based check deposit</li>



<li><strong>Pending: </strong>Contacting my HR department to find out why my employer has moved to check-only as our option for reimbursement.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Here are multiple examples of theft from me. I have to maintain and track all of the paperwork and information; I have to spend an indefinite quantity of time with each of these parts and pieces. Should anything end up not being reimbursable or cross date lines for annual healthcare years, oh no!! I have to get it all perfectly right or run into fees and demands for me to reimburse the FSA company.</p>



<p>The goal, in the name of the company bottom dollar, is to make it as inconvenient as possible for me to use an employer offered benefit. A truly mundane and recurrent example, unfortunately, as I try to navigate U.S. health insurance.</p>



<p>While corporate examples are wonderfully obvious and right to hand, Executive Function Theft also plays out on the individual level. This might be at the workplace or in the home and these are often more insidious thefts.</p>



<p><strong>Workplace EFT</strong></p>



<p>In the workplace, an example of EFT often plays out in the inequality of service labor, and I will specifically use academic service work here as it is my current workplace. Think of the people who end up with more than their share of administrative maintenance tasks — such as organizing get well cards, scheduling workshops, or taking notes. Consider the colleague who has a list of committee appointments a yard long and has just gotten a request to be on Another! Important! <em>(is it?)</em> Committee. These individuals may not be doing these tasks strictly because it is their job responsibility, but because they see a need to be filled or have been asked or tasked with taking on more service that they feel they cannot turn down. And notice how those tasks so often fall to the same group of people — especially when we get to any form of implementation or ongoing commitment rather than the “fun” ideation phase. One way to calculate these service loads would be to count the number of committees and task forces held by and expected of various individuals — who gets a pass and who gets penalized if they don’t say yes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Quite often there’s a gendered component as to who is tasked with these additional service responsibilities — the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/09/they-feel-guilty-why-women-should-say-no-to-office-housework">office housekeeping</a> as well as the care tasks of the workplace. In their book,<a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-no-club-putting-a-stop-to-women-s-dead-end-work-linda-babcock/17554489?ean=9781982152338"> The No Club</a> by Babcock, Pester, Vesterlund and Weingart summarize this gendered and imbalance service load thus:</p>



<p>“In our own and others’ work, we found substantive and overwhelming evidence that women more than men are tasked with non-promotable work. Less saddled with these tasks, men have the freedom to concentrate on work that helps them advance while women’s careers are stalled or stymied” — The No Club, Page 11.</p>



<p>I will admit to never having been able to read Cal Newport’s Deep Work all the way through — I got too irritated — but I would point to his dismissive naming of the idea of “shallow work”, which he defines as logistical and often repetitive tasks, such as writing short emails. Newport recommends entirely stopping or poorly performing that work; I read this as encouraging readers to commit EFT against others around them. Too often the dump off of what are critical responsibilities is not to a specifically tasked and appreciated administrator but instead onto the junior, female, minoritized, non-tenure track, or precarious employees. It’s the maintenance work of keeping the workplace going and we do not appreciate the maintainers. Similarly thinking about EFT in the workplace, I was reminded of the guy who got famous with the Four Hour Workweek book and how we were all just supposed to outsource things to nameless underpaid gig workers. Notably, when looking for a summary of that book, I found an article by Cal Newport praising it.</p>



<p>“You need to read me in on that and send me updates” — this was a demand I got from a work peer a few years ago. She was demanding that I repeatedly spend time updating her personally on a professional topic where I was involved in campus initiatives. The message was that she was too busy and too important compared to me and so I needed to attend these meetings, do the labor, and then take time I didn’t have to synthesize information for her, in her preferred format, and at her convenience. I wasn’t the only one who got this kind of demand from that colleague and no, none of us did it. And yes, this would have obviously been a notably different statement had it come from a supervisor.</p>



<p>Executive Function Theft can lead to an inequality of time to dream, to rest, or to plan and grow professionally. If you are facing EFT in the workplace, how are you supposed to do five year goals or strategic planning? When are you supposed to be getting that significant work in that will lead you to promotion or a career change?</p>



<p><strong>EFT in the Home</strong></p>



<p>When I described the healthcare interactions above, did that sound familiar? Is that because you are the primary caregiver in your relationship? For brevity on an already long post, when I am talking about relationships below, I’m mostly referring to cishet romantic relationships from my own U.S. based lens but I have certainly been privy to EFT in friendships and other interpersonal relationships.</p>



<p>When thinking about Executive Function Theft in the home or personal relationships, the outcome that cropped up was that of decision fatigue. Does one person in the relationship have to decide what is for dinner every single night, and also to arrange all of the logistics of acquiring the food, preparing it, cleaning up after dinner, deciding what can be saved for leftovers and what needs to go into a lunch box the next day? Is their decision-making ability wholly captured in those tasks while the other person is getting to relax or to plan a project? Or think of the stereotypical holidays. “All <em>that</em> just doesn’t Matter and *I* have to think about [SINGLE TASK]!” a husband said in the face of a list of holiday traditions that he absolutely expected his wife to ensure happened to his expectations. Oh…and then he was annoyed that she didn’t have an opinion about how something occurred which was related to his Big Exciting Task. How often is one partner unable to actually enjoy a holiday because they had to make sure all the arrangements were made and schedules were held to, gifts were acquired and wrapped, friends and family were invited, etc?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two different pieces of literature came to mind when I was considering EFT in the home. One was a quote from the excellent book Equal Partners by Kate Mangino:</p>



<p>“While his female partner continues to do housework for twenty, twenty-six, thirty-one more hours — he can devote this time to hobbies, relaxation, exercise, hanging out with friends, sleep, work and/or continued education. Essentially, he has the opportunity to do so much more with his life than she does.” — Kate Mangino, Equal Partners, Chapter 1</p>



<p>I felt this dovetailed nicely with a 2008 article from the University of Michigan:</p>



<p>“Having a husband creates an extra seven hours a week of housework for women, according to a University of Michigan study of a nationally representative sample of U.S. families.” (<a href="https://news.umich.edu/exactly-how-much-housework-does-a-husband-create/">Press Release for the study</a>)</p>



<p>If a woman is doing at least 7 more hours a week of housework –think of all of the decisions that are included in that, and all of the executive function needed for her to complete that housework. What is it that she must remember which needs to be cleaned or ordered or prepared and what is the outcome of her spending that much additional time on the minutiae of the relationship or family? The thieved partner is likely focused on maintaining home functionality, so they may not even get the space or time to figure out a new system which might serve everyone better or reduce the task requirements. Beyond that, it can overall rob her of time to make bigger plans for herself or for the partnership, relationship, family. It may lead to satisfice efforts and the potential of the thieved partner feeling like a failure in situations where they see what the thief has been able to do in the time and function they didn’t have to spend making all of the decisions about dinner.</p>



<p>There’s a trend in short videos (Reels, Tiktoks, Shorts — chose your name) where a guy starts with “if you had me for 24 hours, what would we do” and it’s stitched with a woman running down a significant list of tasks, mostly house chores and repairs that need some planning and execution (example version <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@monicasopenhouse/video/7237131875079425326">here</a>) . While a joke, it speaks to a desire for a “someone else” to hand things off to that these women often don’t appear to have.</p>



<p><strong>EFT &amp; The Mental Load &amp; Invisible &amp; Emotional Labor</strong></p>



<p>I don’t think you can have a conversation about Executive Function Theft without also talking about the mental load and invisible labor and emotional labor. All of these concepts are connected. EFT creates a greater mental load for another individual. EFT demands ever increasing amounts of invisible labor without giving equitable time for “promotable tasks” or rest. EFT expects that Someone Else who they have assigned to be of lesser importance will take on the emotional parts of work or care tasks. I identify EFT not to ignore those terms but to build upon them. I want to try and help describe the rage of a friend recently describing the complete failure of a colleague to complete any part of year-long project he had signed up to lead, and how after she had pulled the project out and completed it after he abandoned it, he still got assigned to a position of more authority. Or I write this to clarify the exhaustion of a friend in the midst of a pandemic-exacerbated divorce describing the soon to be ex-husband passively waiting for her to deal with all of the legal paperwork and to ensure childcare arrangements didn’t infringe on the fun things that he felt took priority. I write this to name my own disgust at a company going out of their way to make my day more inconvenient in the name of their profit.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>EFT at the Intersection</strong></p>



<p>I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge other health and societal factors surrounding these concepts which can exacerbate the impact of EFT. My insurance example was, for me, a frustrating and inconvenient hour while I was also answering emails and working on this draft. I do not have an executive function disorder which might have kept me from working on other tasks while on hold or created further barriers for me to work through all of those steps. Nor do I have a physical disability which might require me to expend additional executive function in order to accomplish the activities of daily living, while also requiring that I navigate these systems more often than a healthy person. And I have a job where this was something I could attend to in the middle of a weekday with minimal disruption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also I’ve written mostly here also about the binary gender impact. There is obviously much to reflect upon as to the further impact as EFT intersects with race and class. Returning to my academic service example, it’s a recognized issue that faculty from historically marginalized communities face exponentially more demands for committee participation “so we have representation on the hiring committee!” Chasing a shallow definition of inclusion, we regularly commit EFT from these colleagues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, our social hierarchies and messaging about whose executive function should be protected so they can do some vaguely defined “real work”&nbsp; warrant a more extensive conversation that I hope others will pursue.</p>



<p><strong>Reducing EFT</strong></p>



<p>Unfortunately I don’t have an exact solution for reducing EFT, as it requires either someone in a leadership or managerial role disrupting the pattern (e.g., a rotating schedule of meeting note takers and consequences when the thief screws up in an attempt to get out of it) or for someone to recognize their harmful behavior and work towards changing it. And we all are guilty of selfishness and EFT — though it is with different levels of awareness that naming this will make it useful to spot when we are offloading onto others or not valuing the executive function needed on tasks. The Babcock, et al,&nbsp; and Mangino books I’ve cited above have recommendations and ideas, though sadly, I will point out that in<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03677-6"> a follow up to the No Club</a>, the authors found that when they turned something down, another woman — usually one with less power — was asked. Systems were not disrupted.</p>



<p>But there are ways to engage. One tactic I’ve incorporated recently with a couple of my friends is “Do you want to be engaged with this or would you like me to just make a decision/do X?” There are times I can see their executive function fading or where it is just one decision too many for today. In those instances, I can offer to remove that decision/activity or to at least pare it down. This has to be done explicitly and with consent but their relief is palpable that I can see the struggle, identify the issue, and move forward with something acceptable that meets the need. It allows them to save a squeeze of Executive Function for other things. The caveat is that I am choosing these, not getting assigned it unrelentingly in our relationships, and they do the inverse when they have more function than I do.</p>



<p>In the interim, however, I hope this phrase and idea gives you the words you need and that we are all able to disrupt it, especially against the corporations wasting our precious time and decision-making skills.</p>

			<p>NVIDIA is absolutely dominating the AI conversation right and for good measure - their GPUs perform out-of-the-box and are a top choice for professionals and businesses that want to dabble in consumer AI. But just this week, both Intel and AMD optimized their software stacks to get massive speedups in generative AI which has seen AMD's RTX 7900 XTX get higher performance per dollar than an NVIDIA RTX 4080 in generative AI (specifically Stable Diffusion with A111/Xformers). Considering Stable Diffusion accounts for the vast majority of non-SaaS, localized generative AI right now - this is a major milestone and finally offers some competition to NVIDIA.</p>
<h2>AMD's 7900 XTX achieves higher iterations per second per dollar in Stable Diffusion (Automatic111 with DirectML) than NVIDIA RTX 4080 (xformers)</h2>
<blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> Tuning for GenAI, much like tuning for crypto mining performance, will have mileage vary significantly depending on the model/configuration being used. This article is about the most common A111 Xformers config (you can get a running tally of average performance by GPU here: https://vladmandic.github.io/sd-extension-system-info/pages/benchmark.html) but there *<strong>are*</strong> hyper tuned boutique optimizations where the NVIDIA RTX 4080 is faster still.</p></blockquote>
<p>Using Microsoft Olive and DirectML instead of the PyTorch pathway results in the AMD 7900 XTX going form a measly 1.87 iterations per second to 18.59 iterations per second! You can read the <strong><a href="https://community.amd.com/t5/gaming/how-to-running-optimized-automatic1111-stable-diffusion-webui-on/ba-p/625585">detailed guide by AMD over here</a></strong>. This level of performance in Automatic111 is pretty close to the <a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/stable-diffusion-performance-nvidia-geforce-vs-amd-radeon/">SHARK-based approach to Stable Diffusion</a> and definitively puts the company on the map with regards to generative AI. As it turns out, it also makes the 7900 XTX offer slightly higher GenAI performance per dollar (in Stable Diffusion /A111) than the comparative RTX 4080 - at least at current prices.</p>

Before we crunch the numbers, I do want to mention the caveat that unlike NVIDIA, the AMD pathway does require the user to be a bit more tech savvy (AMD pathway uses Microsoft Olive instead of PyTorch and most automatic installers will likely not install the dependencies required for this automatically) - so if convenience is a factor for you - NVIDIA is still the way to go. But professionals and small businesses can usually get around an initial setup hassle if the cost basis is good enough and it does seem to be the case here.</p>

<table id="tablepress-1825"><thead><tr><th>GPU</th><th>Market Price</th><th>Configuration</th><th>SD Perf (it/s)</th><th>Dollars Spent Per it/s</th>
</tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>NVIDIA RTX 4080 </td><td>$1099</td><td>A111 (PyTorch)</td><td>19.41*</td><td>$56.6</td>
</tr><tr><td>AMD Radeon 7900 XTX</td><td>$969</td><td>A111 (Microsoft Olive)</td><td>18.59</td><td>$52.1</td>

</tr><tr><td colspan="5">*= data taken from Puget Systems comparison published on Jul 31, 2023.</td>
</tr></tbody></table><!-- #tablepress-1825 from cache --><p>As we can see, the AMD silicon is finally starting to shine in GenAI to the point where it offers higher value compared to the 4080 in Stable Diffusion A111. The AMD 7900 XTX offers 18.59 iterations per second making users pay $52.1 per it/s while NVIDIA RTX 4080 gets 19.41 iterations per second making users pay $56.6 per it/s. If users opt for the less-common SHARK implementation, they can drive the value proposition all the way up to just $46.6 per it/s for the Radeon 7900 XTX. So its official - AMD is officially a contender for consumers interested in generative AI.</p>
<p>This also means that given just slightly more attention from AMD - they can be a formidable competitor to NVIDIA's AI ambitions. Most people aren't going to be running LLMs out of their basement but GenAI and SLMs/ULMs are going to be absolutely everywhere within the next 12 months and part of a lot of productivity workflows. How Intel and AMD position themselves in a market that NVIDIA has a massive head start on - will determine how they fare in a world that is going to be dominated by AI.</p>

It, and its <a href="https://github.com/clemapfel/mousetrap">stand-alone C++-component of the same name</a>, fully wrap <a href="https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/" rel="nofollow">GTK4</a> (which is written in C), <em>vastly</em> simplifying its interface to improve ease-of-use without sacrificing flexibility.</p>
<p dir="auto">It aims to give developers of all skill levels the tools to start creating complex GUI applications with little time and effort.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong>: Mousetrap is under active development. While backwards-compatibility for all future releases can already be guaranteed, stability, portability, and quality of the documentation may be affected. <br>
Consider participating in the development by <a href="https://github.com/clemapfel/mousetrap.jl">opening an issue</a> when you encounter an error or bug (which - as of now - will most likely happen).</p>

In the studies presented here, we employed simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected antiretroviral (ART)-treated Indian rhesus macaques to evaluate biodistribution, safety, and the ability of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing treatment (EBT-001) to target integrated SIV given in a single intravenous (IV) bolus infusion [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 4" title="Mancuso P, Chen C, Kaminski R, Gordon J, Liao S, Robinson JA, et al.

EBT-001 (encoding SIV targeting guide RNAs) is the simian homolog of EBT-101 (encoding HIV targeting guide RNAs) and is comprised of an adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) encapsulated all-in-one CRISPR construct simultaneously expressing the SaCas9 endonuclease and dual guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting the viral long terminal repeats (LTRs) and the Gag gene. EBT-101 is designed for the removal of large intervening integrated proviral SIV DNA sequences positioned between the intended CRISPR target sites, thereby generating 3 possible deletions: 5′LTR to Gag, Gag to 3′LTR, and 5′LTR to 3′LTR. The use of AAV9 delivery is supported by our initial studies in small and large animal models, in addition to a large body of evidence from previous gene therapy clinical trials where AAV9 has exhibited safety, efficacy and broad biodistribution properties [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" title="Mancuso P, Chen C, Kaminski R, Gordon J, Liao S, Robinson JA, et al.

Here, we present more comprehensive data on safety, including extensive off-target analyses, and biodistribution of multiple doses (10<sup>12</sup>, 10<sup>13</sup>, 10<sup>14</sup> GC/kg) of EBT-001 and extended study (3 and 6 months) in an Indian rhesus macaque SIV model. This preclinical safety, biodistribution, and efficacy study demonstrated that a single IV administration of EBT-001 for SIV editing was well-tolerated and can broadly reach and excise viral reservoirs in NHPs without any observed off-target effects. These results support that a single IV inoculation of EBT-101 for HIV gene editing can be utilized to reach viral reservoirs in infected tissues throughout the body for the safe and specific in vivo editing of latent HIV proviral DNA.</p></div><div id="Sec2-section" data-title="Materials and methods"><h2 id="Sec2">Materials and methods</h2><div id="Sec2-content"><h3 id="Sec3">Study design</h3><p>This study was approved by BIOQUAL’s IACUC, protocol number 18-036. Twelve male Indian rhesus macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were obtained from the Caribbean Primate Research Center in Puerto Rico. Two studies were performed. The first was an <i>n</i> = 10 with animals randomized by a statistician into four treatment groups with 3 untreated, 3 treated with 1.4 × 10<sup>12</sup> GC/kg EBT-001, and 4 treated with 1.4 × 10<sup>13</sup> GC/kg EBT-001 (2 necropsied at 3 months and 2 at 6 months post EBT-001). Randomization was done using a permuted block randomization method with the restriction that social partner paired animals were in the same group. The second study was with an <i>n</i> = 2 using 1 log higher EBT-001 dose of 1.4 × 10<sup>14</sup> GC/kg and no randomization was performed here. All animals were screened and were triple negative for Mamu-A*01, Mamu-B*08 and Mamu-B*17. All rhesus macaques were received at BIOQUAL’s Piccard Drive Facility, in Rockville, MD where all the in vivo studies described here were performed. The rhesus macaques were serology pre-screened for retroviruses (STLV and SIV), SA8 virus, SHF virus, and measles virus prior to the study. Animals were infected with SIVmac239 (a gift from Dr. Preston Marx, Tulane Primate Center). Animals were started on a daily ART regimen of tenofovir (TDF; #T018500; 15 mg/kg/animal), emtricitabine (FTC; #E525000; 50 mg/kg/animal), and dolutegravir (DTG; #D528800; 2.5 mg/kg/animal) (Toronto Research Chemicals) beginning on day 28 post infection and continued to necropsy. Animals were observed for morbidity, mortality, injury, and availability of food and water. Any animals in poor health were identified for further monitoring, clinical treatment, and possible euthanasia. Observations included, but were not limited to, evaluation of the skin, fur, eyes, ears, nose, oral cavity, thorax, abdomen, external genitalia, limbs and feet, respiratory and circulatory effects, autonomic effects such as salivation, nervous system effects including tremors, convulsions, reactivity to handling, neurological/behavioral effects, and unusual behavior. SIV viral load (limit of detection of 50 copies/mL) was measured in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) plasma over the course of infection (Supplementary material and methods). Whole blood was collected on multiple days during the study period and submitted to IDEXX BioAnalytics, Inc. for complete blood count (CBC) analysis and for blood chemistries. Animals were dosed with EBT-001 at 6 months post SIV infection with a slow IV infusion at a rate of 1 mL/min. The amount of EBT-001 vector to be dosed was added to total of 100 mL of 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for each animal based on current body weight and dose (Table&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#MOESM1">S2</a>).

The output for the exhaustive search, including mismatches and possible bulges, contains few nominated sites in the rhesus macaque genome and very few with less than 4 differences (Supplementary materials and methods). The list of output sites also has few with low penalty match scores, which generally indicate a more possible chance of locating sequence-verified off-target sites. Penalty match scores were calculated based on the increasing number, type, and locations of the mismatches and bulges between the gRNA and chromosomal sequence (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#Fig1">1</a>).

In study one, a total of 10 male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were divided into 3 groups: Group 1 had no EBT-001 treatment, Group 2 with 1.4 × 10<sup>12</sup> genome copies (GC)/kg of EBT-001, and Group 3 with 1.4 × 10<sup>13</sup> GC/kg of EBT-001 (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#Fig2">2A</a>). In study two, a higher dose (1.4 × 10<sup>14</sup> GC/kg) of EBT-001 was given to 2 animals in Group 4 (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#Fig2">2B</a><b>)</b>. Both studies examined NHPs infected with SIVmac239 (200 TCID<sub>50</sub>) via the i.v. route and treated with a triple ART regimen (tenofovir (TDF), emtricitabine (FTC), and DTG) via the s.q. route (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#Fig2">2C</a>). This regimen was selected for its similarity to how HIV-infected humans are treated to control HIV infection. ART began 28 days post-infection and all 12 animals remained on ART for the entire course of the study. Once viral levels were reduced to minimum levels in the blood, animals were maintained on only ART (Group 1) or treated with one of 3 doses of EBT-001 delivered by a single IV infusion (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#Fig3">3C</a>, Supplementary material and methods, Table&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#MOESM1">S2</a>). All monkeys received full doses of EBT-001. One monkey (CK49) in Group 3 experienced shortness of breath and hypoxia after administration of anesthesia that worsened after infusion of EBT-001. The infusion of EBT-001 was paused while the monkey was treated for acute pulmonary edema and recovered. The remaining dose of EBT-001 was delivered several days later without any complications. This was an adverse reaction due to the anesthetic agent, Dexdomitor because the re-challenge of EBT-001 was well-tolerated and the symptoms were consistent with adverse reactions to Dexdomitor. One animal in Group 2 developed a skin rash after EBT-001 infusion.

EBT-001 treatment was associated with increases in AAV9 neutralizing antibodies 3 or 6 months after treatment relative to pre-dose values. The pre-dose titers (serum reciprocal dilution values) were low (&lt;5 and 80), except CF63, which had a pre-dose titer of 320. The values at necropsy ranged from 80-5120 in EBT-001 treated animals and were highest in the monkeys sacrificed at 6 months post-EBT-001. Of note, CF63’s titer did not change after EBT-001 treatment even though it was the highest at baseline.</p><p>All monkeys survived until the scheduled euthanasia (3 or 6 months post EBT-001) when a full necropsy was performed on all animals (Supplementary material and methods). Overall, the gross necropsy observations were within normal range, except for a single animal (1T6, Group 1) from the ART-only treated group, who was dehydrated and had a thin body condition (2/5 body composition score). All findings were consistent with SIV infection (Table&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#MOESM1">S5</a>). No EBT-001-related gross or microscopic pathology findings were noted in a comprehensive histopathological evaluation of major organs performed by Charles River Laboratories, LLC. General microscopic findings attributed to chronic SIV infection were observed within all treatment groups and included minimal to mild lymphoid hyperplasia of the germinal centers and mantle zone of the mesenteric lymph node, lymphoid hyperplasia of the secondary lymphoid follicles in the white pulp of the spleen, and mononuclear cell infiltration of the heart, kidney, and lung. Additionally, there was lymphoid hyperplasia of the periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths of the spleen in animal BM79 (Group 4). There were no apparent differences in the frequency or severity of these findings in monkeys treated with ART only or in monkeys treated with ART in combination with EBT-001. In a separate neuropathological evaluation performed by Experimental Pathology Laboratories, Inc., findings in all SIV-infected rhesus macaques were few and consisted primarily of focal minimal findings of microgliosis and less commonly astrocytosis and/or sparse perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrates. Overall, the microscopic findings were consistent with chronic SIV infection and were observed with similar frequency in control SIV-infected animals examined at the same timepoints from another EBT-001 study. The findings were therefore not attributed to treatment with EBT-001.</p><h3 id="Sec13">Detection of vector DNA in tissues</h3><p>To assess the biodistribution of the vector in tissues at necropsy, a TaqMan-based qPCR assay was used to quantitate EBT-001 (vector) DNA (Charles River) (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#Fig3">3A, B</a>). All DNA biodistribution and vector shedding samples collected from the untreated animals (Group 1) were negative, demonstrating the contamination was well controlled from animal dosing, necropsy, DNA extraction, and qPCR analysis in this study. Tissues that are considered major HIV/SIV reservoirs, including spleen, lymph nodes, colon, bone marrow&nbsp;compartment, and blood were examined for vector biodistribution (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#Fig3">3A</a>). Levels of vector DNA in spleen ranged from 4.82–6.44 (log10 copies of EBT-001 DNA/ug of monkey DNA). For the mesenteric lymph nodes, the value ranged from 4.01–6.42 and for colon 2.52–4.24 (log10 copies of EBT-001 DNA/ug of monkey DNA). In bone marrow, vector DNA was undetectable in Group 2, 1.75–3.55 (log10 copies of EBT-001 DNA/ug of monkey DNA) in Group 3, and 2 logs higher in Group 4 with average 5.5 (log10 copies of EBT-001 DNA/ug of monkey DNA). In blood, where cells turnover rapidly, vector DNA was only found in the 2 animals from Group 3 that were necropsied at 3 months post-EBT-001 and was absent in animals in the same group that were necropsied at 6 months and in the higher dosed animal also sacrificed at 6 months (Group 4) (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#Fig3">3A</a>). However, when biodistribution was examined serially in blood starting at 2 weeks post-EBT-001, vector DNA was detected in Groups 2 and 3 and decreased over time (Figure&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#MOESM1">S5</a>). The highest concentration of EBT-001 DNA was detected in the liver samples from Groups 3 and 4 (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#Fig3">3B</a>). For the brain and other tissues, Group 2 was low or undetectable and distribution was increased in Group 3 but interestingly, levels in Group 4 were in the range of 4 (log10 copies of EBT-001 DNA/ug of monkey DNA). No evidence of vector shedding in stool or urine was observed (not shown). The qPCR results confirm that EBT-001 was distributed widely to blood and all major organs and tissues tested in animals dosed with the vector. Biodistribution of EBT-001 (DNA levels) was dose dependent, and the vector levels in each tissue and blood decreased over time, although persisting 6 months after injection in many tissues.</p><h3 id="Sec14">Editing of proviral DNA fragments from blood cells and various solid organs</h3><p>SIV excision activity was assayed across treatment groups and tissues. The 2 gRNAs in EBT-001 target 3 locations in SIV and therefore excise 3 large intervening integrated proviral SIV segments. The LTR gRNA cuts both the 5′ and 3′LTR. As this guide is co-delivered along with the Gag gRNA, there is the possible removal of the intervening integrated proviral SIV DNA sequence between the 5′LTR to Gag, Gag to the 3′LTR and between the 5′LTR and 3′LTR. Two assays were used to demonstrate 5′LTR to Gag (5G) and Gag to 3′LTR (G3) excision in tissues and blood (see Supplementary material and methods and Supplementary Table&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#MOESM1">3</a>). Evidence of excision was detected by the observation of nested PCR products of distinct DNA fragments of 268 or 171 bp resulting from the removal of intervening DNA sequences between 5′LTR to Gag (5G) or Gag to 3′LTR (G3), respectively (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#Fig4">4A, C</a>). The 5 G assay also amplified the full-length SIV at an amplicon size of 1282 bp. Due to extensive homology between the 5′ and 3′LTR sequences and the lack of standardized flanking sequences due to the random chromosomal integration of SIV proviral DNA, it was not possible to measure the third excision product which removes the entire 5′LTR to 3′LTR portion. Both PCR-based excision assays (5G and G3) were completed (in duplicate by 2 operators) for blood and small sections of tissues and organs, including: bone marrow, brain (brain stem, cerebellum, frontal, occipital, parietal, prefrontal, temporal cortices), colon, duodenum, heart (left ventricle, left atrium, right ventricle, right atrium), kidneys, liver, lungs, mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, and testes (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#Fig4">4</a>, Tables&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#MOESM1">S6</a>, and S<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#MOESM1">7</a>).

No excision, defined by no detection of either of the nested PCR products of 268 bp (5G) or 171 bp (G3), is represented by a gray box. If no full-length (top band of 1282 bp in the 5G only) or excised product could be amplified (in both 5G and G3), then this is represented by a white box. This analysis demonstrated SIV DNA cleavage in a broad range of tissues, 3 and 6 months after vector treatment. SIV viral excision, 5′LTR to Gag or Gag to 3′LTR, was observed in some tissue for all EBT-001 treated animals. There was individual animal variability observed, as well as differences in excision in tissues. Excision was detected at 3 months and in some tissues at 6 months. No virus was detected in some tissue samples at the highest dose of EBT-001 (Group 4) at 6 months post-EBT-001, which may indicate the elimination of viral DNA from those sections of tissues. The results of the excision activity analysis showed SIV DNA cleavage in a broad range of tissues 3 and 6 months after vector treatment, and in blood 2–10 weeks after vector treatment, including the presence of SIV excision in the blood of one animal (BM79) at necropsy (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#Fig4">4D</a>). Since the 5G EXA assay amplifies both the full-length virus (1282 bp) and the amplicon (268 bp) of the excision product after the removal of intervening DNA sequences between 5′LTR to Gag, we calculated the percent efficiency of the 5G excision (Tables&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#MOESM1">S8</a> and <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#MOESM1">S9</a>, Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#MOESM1">S6</a>, Supplementary material and methods). We understand the limitations of this PCR-based assay, as it is semi-quantitative, and it is possible that the smaller excision products may be amplified more efficiently than the intact virus. In addition, this assay reflects only one of 3 possible excision products that can occur through EBT-001 cutting. Despite the limitations of assay detection, the results show varying excision abilities with several animals reported to have detectable excision in tissue sections examined, even at the lower doses.</p><div data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-4" data-title="Proviral excision of SIV DNA in tissues and blood."><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig4" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 4: Proviral excision of SIV DNA in tissues and blood.</b></figcaption><div><div><a data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4/figures/4" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41434-023-00410-4/MediaObjects/41434_2023_410_Fig4_HTML.png?as=webp"><img aria-describedby="Fig4" src="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41434-023-00410-4/MediaObjects/41434_2023_410_Fig4_HTML.png" alt="figure 4" loading="lazy" width="685" height="595"></picture></a></div><p>Example of 5G and G3 PCR of necropsy tissues from monkey MA285 (<b>A</b>).

WGS was conducted on genomic DNA samples from lymph node biopsies collected from 2 NHPs, CK49 and CH97, before receiving EBT-001 and from the same animals after 3 months or 6 months of treatment with EBT-001, respectively. WGS was performed using 2 × 150 bp paired end sequencing and averaged ~30× coverage depth. To effectively align and process the sequencing reads, a pipeline was designed in the High-performance Integrated Virtual Environment (HIVE), a cloud-based environment optimized for storage and analysis of extra-large data, such as NGS (9; Supplementary text). When assessing for unintended off-target editing, we focused on the nominated sites with relatively higher homology to the guide sequences. The indel rates were calculated for genomic loci within 10 bp of hypothetical cut sites of each nominated locus. When we&nbsp;compared the treated with untreated samples from lymph node, the&nbsp;initial screen identified 5 sites to have significantly different numbers of SNPs (Table&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#Tab2">2</a>) using two-tailed chi-squared test with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control false discovery rate (FDR). We observed that all these SNPs occur at a distant location from the hypothetical cut site (7–10 bases away) with SNPs showing in both treated and untreated samples. Further examination of these sites has shown a lack of evidence to attribute these changes to gene editing due to alignments being too noisy, having long stretches of Ts around the potential site that may result in ambiguous alignment, or coverage being low (Supplementary text). Additionally, it was noted that the relative change of the SNPs frequency was not consistent between the two select animals across all 5 sites. Hence, we conclude that there is lack of evidence for off-target editing activity. We also screened for structural variants among these nominated sites, we detected no read supporting partial alignments within 40 bp windows surrounding the nominated cut sites. Additionally, we looked at potential AAV integration events by searching for chimeric reads with partial alignment. Compared to samples before treatment, the analysis found only 2 potential reads in CH97 post-treatment and 1 read in CK49 post-treatment. The 2 reads from CH97 post treatment were identical to each other, possibly PCR duplicates, and showed partial alignment to Chr7:128862755–128862834 with partial alignment to Cas9 coding region (EBT001: 2636–2565). The 1 read in CK49 post treatment also showed partial alignment to Cas9 coding region (EBT001: 2944–3037), and partially aligned to Chr12:28738543–28738586 (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#MOESM1">S8</a>). However, it was noted that among these three reads, none of their respective paired end read supported the partial alignment results. Taken together with the extremely little amount of supporting reads, we concluded that none of the 3 split-read jumps can be attributed as evidence for AAV integration in the lymph nodes after EBT-001 treatment.</p><div data-test="inline-table" data-container-section="table" id="table-2"><figure><figcaption><b id="Tab2" data-test="table-caption">Table 2 Sites identified with significantly different indels located within 10 bp of a nominated cut site in the WGS.</b></figcaption><p><a data-test="table-link" data-track="click" data-track-action="view table" data-track-label="button" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4/tables/2" aria-label="Full size table 2"><span>Full size table</span></a></p></figure></div></div></div><div id="Sec17-section" data-title="Discussion"><h2 id="Sec17">Discussion</h2><div id="Sec17-content"><p>Treatment of SIV-infected rhesus monkeys with AAV9 CRISPR-Cas9 and dual gRNAs targeting SIV LTR and Gag (EBT-001) exhibited broad tissue biodistribution and evidence of SIV proviral DNA editing in all major viral reservoirs. EBT-001 was well-tolerated at doses of 1.4 × 10<sup>12</sup> GC/kg, 1.4 × 10<sup>13</sup> GC/kg, and 1.4 × 10<sup>14</sup> GC/kg. There were no clinical signs of toxicity and no abnormal gross pathology or organ histopathology attributed to EBT-001. One animal experienced an infusion related reaction thought to be due to anesthesia as the symptoms started after administration of anesthesia and before infusion of EBT-001, and another animal developed a rash at the infusion site. Transient increases in liver enzymes and total serum bilirubin were observed with the highest dose. Elevations in liver function tests following treatment with EBT-001 may represent an acute hepatic inflammation resulting from the treatment. Importantly, the elevated liver function tests returned to baseline range values in both NHP within 1–8 weeks. The transient nature of the elevations, combined with an absence of histopathological evidence of liver injury 6 months following treatment, indicate that the effects on liver function were reversible.</p><p>One interesting observation was the absence of weight loss among our SIV-infected cohort who received EBT-001, in contrast to the observation of weight loss seen in NHPs in the ART-only group. Interestingly, among our NHPs that were receiving the highest dose (1.4 × 10<sup>14</sup> GC/kg) of EBT-001 and exhibiting no signs of weight loss, we also noticed improvements in their absolute lymphocyte counts within 6 months. Although we do not have data from untreated animals at 6 months, EBT-001 did not cause an elevation in IFN-gamma. Other cytokines, including IL-10, were examined but were either undetectable or no changes were seen. One animal in the highest dose group, BM79, had elevated IL-7 and IL-15 at 6 months, but without an SIV only control at this time point it is difficult to delineate if this is in response to AAV or SIV. In addition, the data suggests that EBT-001 may potentially benefit the immune system via lymphocyte recovery, T cell development, and NK cell maintenance.</p><p>One of the main concerns with the use of gene therapies in humans is their potential to induce immunological responses that may have adverse clinical effects [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" title="Ronzitti G, Gross DA, Mingozzi F.

SIV DNA excision was still evident, as observed in blood from individual animals at the earliest timepoint tested (2 weeks following EBT-001 administration) and up to 6 months following administration of the vector. In addition, neither monocytes nor IFN-gamma were increased in EBT-001-treated animals, which would have indicated an inflammatory response to EBT-001 or AAV9.</p><p>EBT-001 was well distributed to major organs and tissues that are identified as viral reservoirs of HIV, including the brain, an important reservoir for an HIV cure [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 20" title="Deleage C, Turkbey B, Estes JD.

Expression of EBT-001 DNA was detected in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Overall, animals receiving the 10<sup>12</sup> dose had lower log10 copies of EBT-001 DNA compared to the animals receiving the 10<sup>13</sup> or the 10<sup>14</sup> doses and had undetectable levels at the time of necropsy in some tissues, such as bone marrow&nbsp;compartment, brain, skeletal muscle, and testes. EBT-001 DNA levels in blood decreased over time as expected and EBT-001 DNA was only detected at the terminal bleed in animals treated with the 10<sup>13</sup> dose and necropsied at 3 months post-infection. For HIV cure studies, sustained EBT-001 expression is not needed and the dose of AAV needed in the clinical setting is not yet known.</p><p>The pharmacologic gene editing activity of EBT-001 was demonstrated by the detection of SIV DNA excision, the removal of intervening DNA sequences between 5′LTR to Gag and/or Gag to 3′LTR, in organs and tissues tested at 3 and 6 months after vector administration. The 5G assay detects the amplicon bridging the excised region between 5′LTR and Gag; while the G3 assay detects the amplicon bridging the excised region between Gag and 3′LTR. Of note, there are 3 possible excision products that can result when using gRNAs targeting LTR and Gag. Due to the homology between the 5′ and 3′ LTRs, only 2 of the 3 excision are currently measurable. Thus, we are possibly underestimating the excision as we cannot detect evidence of the full 5′ to 3′LTR excision. However, the success of any one of the 3 possible excisions will render the viral unable to replicate.</p><p>With any gene editing platform, possible off-target effects are a concern that should be monitored. We mitigated this concern in this study using bioinformatics searches of the rhesus macaque genome that revealed no genomic sites output with 1, 2, or 3 mismatches to the guide and protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM). One site was identified for the LTR guide that had 2 mismatches plus a bulge. Few sites were output with 4 or 5 differences between the guides and the rhesus macaque genome (Table&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#Tab1">1</a>). Assays for possible off-target events for EBT-101 in HIV-1 infected humanized mice revealed no detectible activity after treatment with the guides targeting HIV [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 6" title="Dash PK, Kaminski R, Bella R, Su H, Mathews S, Ahooyi TM, et al.

Similar studies were conducted testing the SIV homolog EBT-001 in a small study of a single dose cohort of SIV-infected NHP [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 4" title="Mancuso P, Chen C, Kaminski R, Gordon J, Liao S, Robinson JA, et al.

To assay for possible unintended edits in this study, assays searched for indels and the possibility of larger changes, including insertions, deletions, inversions, translocations, or other chromosomal rearrangements. Past studies mapping the effects of CRISPR editing using a range of different gRNAs predominantly found single nucleotide deletions or insertions, a lower frequency of different small indels and a much lower frequencies of larger deletions and insertions [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 22" title="Cradick TJ, Fine EJ, Antico CJ, Bao G.

When larger deletions occurred, smaller indels were found at a higher frequency. Our analysis, therefore, included searching both for indels and possible larger changes. A marked advantage of the combination studies is the opportunity to use multiple pipelines simultaneously to assay for possible off-target editing and for the data from one pipeline to improve the accuracy of the data in other pipelines. For example, if structural changes or AAV insertion were detected at sites of off-target editing, these hypothetical events would be supported by evidence from indel analysis that were observed to occur at the same chromosomal sites with a higher number of sequence-confirmed indels. The simultaneous use of pipelines for indels, structural variation and AAV insertions can therefore help to assay for any possible, low-frequency editing sites. Here, WGS was performed without detecting unintended editing events and with no conclusive evidence of AAV or SaCas9 insertions, structural variations, or disruption of a gene, due to EBT-001 CRISPR editing. These NHP studies observed the intended SIV excision activity across multiple tissues studied with no detectible unintended editing.</p><p>This study was designed as a preclinical study for the safety and tolerability of EBT-001 in a large animal model of HIV. To most accurately model EBT-101, SIV guides were not optimized for cutting efficiency, but were instead selected to target the same LTR and Gag regions. Other than the guide sequences, EBT-001 and EBT-101 are comprised of an identical all-in-one delivery vector. The limitations of our study are the small animal numbers per group, the limited time on ART prior to EBT-001, and the lack of an analytical treatment interruption. The study was not designed to test the effect on the intact viral reservoir as EBT-001 was given when the viral reservoir was not stable and there was still active viral replication. Additionally, as animals were maintained on ART, we did not test the ability of EBT-001 to extend time to viral rebound or eliminate viral reactivation after an analytical treatment interruption. Together, the biodistribution and safety data support the continued development of AAV9 delivered CRISPR-Cas9 dual gRNA for HIV eradicative cure strategies.</p></div></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary"><span>For years, cops</span> and other government authorities all over the world have been using phone hacking technology provided by Cellebrite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/27/cellebrite-may-have-found-a-way-to-unlock-iphones-running-ios-11/">to unlock phones</a> and obtain the data within. And the company has been keen on keeping the use of its technology “hush hush.”</p>
<p>As part of the deal with government agencies, Cellebrite asks users to keep its tech — and the fact that they used it — secret, TechCrunch has learned. This request concerns legal experts who argue that powerful technology like the one Cellebrite builds and sells, and how it gets used by law enforcement agencies, ought to be public and scrutinized.</p>
<p>In a leaked training video for law enforcement customers that was obtained by TechCrunch, a senior Cellebrite employee tells customers that “ultimately, you’ve extracted the data, it’s the data that solves the crime, how you got in, let’s try to keep that as hush hush as possible.”</p>
<p>“We don’t really want any techniques to leak in court through disclosure practices, or you know, ultimately in testimony, when you are sitting in the stand, producing all this evidence and discussing how you got into the phone,” the employee, who we are not naming, says in the video.</p>
<p>For legal experts, this kind of request is troubling because authorities need to be transparent in order for a judge to authorize searches, or to authorize the use of certain data and evidence in court. Secrecy, the experts argue, hurts the rights of defendants, and ultimately the rights of the public.</p>
<p>“The results these super-secretive products spit out are used in court to try to prove whether someone is guilty of a crime,” Riana Pfefferkorn, a research scholar at the Stanford University’s Internet Observatory, told TechCrunch. “The accused (whether through their lawyers or through an expert) must have the ability to fully understand how Cellebrite devices work, examine them, and determine whether they functioned properly or contained flaws that might have affected the results.”</p>
<p>“And anyone testifying about those products under oath must not hide important information that could help exonerate a criminal defendant solely to protect the business interests of some company,” said Pfefferkorn.</p>
<p>Hanni Fakhoury, a criminal defense attorney who has studied surveillance technology for years, told TechCrunch that “the reason why that stuff needs to be disclosed, is the defense needs to be able to figure out ‘was there a legal problem in how this evidence was obtained? Do I have the ability to challenge that?’”</p>
<p>The Cellebrite employee claims in the video that disclosing the use of its technology could help criminals and make the lives of law enforcement agencies harder.</p>
<p>“It’s super important to keep all these capabilities as protected as possible, because ultimately leakage can be harmful to the entire law enforcement community globally,” the Cellebrite employee says in the video. “We want to ensure that widespread knowledge of these capabilities does not spread. And if the bad guys find out how we’re getting into a device, or that we’re able to decrypt a particular encrypted messaging app, while they might move on to something much, much more difficult or impossible to overcome, we definitely don’t want that.”</p>
<p>Cellebrite spokesperson Victor Cooper said in an email to TechCrunch that the company “is committed to support ethical law enforcement. Our tools are designed for lawful use, with the utmost respect for the chain of custody and judicial process.”</p>
<p>“We do not advise our customers to act in contravention with any law, legal requirements or other forensics standards,” the spokesperson said. “While we continue protecting and expect users of our tools to respect our trade secrets and other proprietary and confidential information, we also permanently continue developing our training and other published materials for the purpose of identifying statements which could be improperly interpreted by listeners, and in this respect, we thank you for bringing this to our attention.”</p>
<p>When asked whether Cellebrite would change the content of its training, the spokesperson did not respond.</p>
<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation’s senior staff attorney Saira Hussain and senior staff technologist Cooper Quintin told TechCrunch in an email that “Cellebrite is helping create a world where authoritarian countries, criminal groups, and cyber-mercenaries also are able to exploit these vulnerable devices and commit crimes, silence opposition, and invade people’s privacy.”</p>
<p>Cellebrite is not the first company that asks its customers to keep its technology secret.</p>
<p>For years, government contractor Harris Corporation made law enforcement agencies who wanted to use its cellphone surveillance tool, known as stingrays, sign <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/03/harris-stingray-nda/">a non-disclosure agreement</a> that in some cases suggested dropping cases rather than disclosing what tools the authorities used. These requests <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/19/cellebrite-asks-cops-to-keep-its-phone-hacking-tech-hush-hush/nytimes.com/2015/03/16/business/a-police-gadget-tracks-phones-shhh-its-secret.html">go as far back as the mid 2010s</a>, but <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/fbi-cell-site-simulator-stingray-secrecy/">are still in force today</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s the full transcript of the training video:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m happy you can join us. And I’m happy to kick off this initial module covering the system overview and orientation for Cellebrite Premium. Thank you and enjoy.</p>
<p>Did you know that Cellebrite Advanced Services has 10 labs in nine different countries around the world? Well, in order to leverage all of that capacity, we are working together to deliver this training to you, so you will be hearing from colleagues from around the world. The following list are those that comprise this current module set, I hope you enjoy meeting them each.</p>
<p>Before we begin, it’s quite important to go over the confidentiality and operational security concerns that we must abide by by using Cellebrite Premium, not only ourselves in our own Cellebrite Advanced Services labs, but most particularly you in your own labs around the world.</p>
<p>Well, we must recognize that this capability is actually saving lives. And in situations when it’s too late, we’re helping to deliver closure for the victims’ families, and ultimately solve crimes and put people behind bars. So, it’s super important to keep all these capabilities as protected as possible, because ultimately leakage can be harmful to the entire law enforcement community globally.</p>
<p>In a bit more detail, these capabilities that are put into Cellebrite Premium, they are actually trade secrets of Cellebrite, and we want to continue to ensure the viability of them so that we can continue to invest heavily into research and development, so we can give these abilities to law enforcement globally. Your part is to ensure that these techniques are protected as best as you can, and to either consider them as “law enforcement sensitive” or classify them to a higher level of protection in your individual country or agency.</p>
<p>And the reason why is because we want to ensure that widespread knowledge of these capabilities does not spread. And, if the bad guys find out how we’re getting into a device, or that we’re able to decrypt a particular encrypted messaging app, while they might move on to something much, much more difficult or impossible to overcome.We definitely don’t want that.</p>
<p>We’re also aware that the phone manufacturers are continuously looking to strengthen the security of their products. And the challenge is already so difficult as it is, but we still continue to have really good breakthroughs. Please don’t make this any more difficult for us than it already is.</p>
<p>And ultimately, we don’t really want any techniques to leak in court through disclosure practices, or you know, ultimately in testimony, when you are sitting in the stand, producing all this evidence and discussing how you got into the phone. Ultimately, you’ve extracted the data, it’s the data that solves the crime. How you got in, let’s try to keep that as hush hush as possible.</p>
<p>And now moving on to operational security or “opsec.” It starts with the physical protection of the premium system and all of its components that you’ve received in the kit.</p>
<p>These little bits and pieces that make all this capability… magic. They’re highly sensitive assets, and we want to ensure that no tampering or any other curiosities are employed on these devices. And in some cases, there is the chance of tampering and disabling the component, and that’s something that you really don’t want to do, because it could knock out your agency from having the capability whilst you await a replacement.</p>
<p>Additionally, exposure of any of these premium capabilities could be quite harmful to the global law enforcement environment. So, be careful with information sharing, whether it’s in face to face conversations, over the phone, on online discussion groups, via email — other things like that — just try to keep it sensitive and don’t go into any details.</p>
<p>When it comes to written documentation, obviously, you don’t want to disclose too much in your court reports. But definitely put the bare minimum to ensure that a layperson can understand the basic concepts of what was done.</p>
<p>Certainly mention that you used Premium, you can mention the version, but do not go into detail of what you’ve done with the phone: either manipulating it or whatever shows up on the graphical user interface of premium itself.</p>
<p>And when it comes to technical operations and quality management within your organization, please be wary that any document that you put together as a standard operating procedure could be visible by an outside auditor for ISO 17025 or other people that could do a Freedom of Information Act request in your agency in whichever laws of your country.</p>
<p>So just be careful with all that. You need to protect this as best as possible. And the other additional factor that you may not be aware of is that failed exploitations on devices — if they’re able to connect to the network — they could phone home and inform the manufacturer that the device is under attack. And with enough knowledge and intelligence, it is possible that the phone manufacturers might find out what we’re doing to achieve this magic. So please do your best to follow all the instructions and make this the best possible procedures [sic] going forward.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The historic structure on Front Street is the last house standing in a neighborhood reduced to rubble. </p>



<p>Before fires ripped through Lahaina, the craftsman-inspired home at 271 Front St. didn’t stand out much in the neighborhood.&nbsp;The nearly 100-year-old structure had been lovingly restored in recent years, but it was one of many charming homes lining the waterfront of one of Hawaii’s most historically important towns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, the house is unmissable: A red-roofed structure in seemingly pristine condition, surrounded by piles of ash and rubble for blocks in every direction. </p>



<p>“It looks like it was photoshopped in,” homeowner Trip Millikin said of the house, which stands in such contrast to the surrounding ruins that images of the home have gone viral in recent days. </p>

(Kevin Fujii/Civil Beat/2023)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Millikin has spent much of the last week — in between anxious calls to check up on friends and neighbors — puzzling over why his house was somehow spared. </p>



<p>Maybe it was just luck. Maybe the wind shifted at just the right moment. Or maybe it was a series of serendipitous choices made during a recent home renovation that helped prevent flying pieces of burning wood and debris from doing little more than scorching small patches of his yard and bubbling the paint on one wall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Experts say it was likely a little bit of all the above, but that one element of the home’s recent renovation is actually the most affordable and important thing people can do to try and protect their homes. </p>



<h2>A Painstaking Renovation </h2>



<p>Millikin and his wife, Dora Millikin, fell in love with the Front Street house several years ago, although it was vacant and had fallen into a state of disrepair. </p>



<p>The home, known as the Pioneer Mill Co./Lahaina Ice Co. Bookkeeper’s House, is believed to have been moved to Front Street in 1925 from a nearby plantation. For decades, it was used to house management-level employees. </p>



<p>The Millikins, who started living in Lahaina more than a decade ago, used to bicycle by the house and talk about what it would take to fix the sagging roof, the rotting lanai, the peeling paint. </p>



<p>“The house was an absolute nightmare, but you could see the bones of it,” Millikin said. </p>

(Courtesy: Trip Millikin/2023)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Millikin and his wife bought the property in 2021, working with the county on a historic preservation plan before embarking on a nearly two-year renovation project. They did much of the work themselves, along with a local carpenter and the help of neighbors. </p>



<p>The effort was a source of neighborhood pride, Millikin said, with people walking by and frequently talking to the couple as they hand glazed the 500 window panes in the structure, painstakingly repaired the termite damage, dug out the mushrooms growing in the downstairs ohana unit. </p>



<p>The house is what’s known as a craftsman-inspired “plantation vernacular” dwelling, a style of homes constructed mostly by sugar and pineapple plantation companies in the early 20th century. </p>



<p>This home, overseen by a Native Hawaiian carpenter who headed most construction projects for the Pioneer Mill Co., was built from California redwood, Millikin said, which has some natural fire-resistant properties. But so was the historic house next door, which burned completely in the Aug. 8 fire. </p>

<p>During renovations, Millikin installed a commercial-grade steel roof, something that definitely would have provided better protection from flying embers than shingles. At first, Millikin thought this might have made the biggest difference in why his home was spared. </p>



<p>But Michael Wara, the director of the Climate and Energy Policy Program at the Stanford Wood Institute for the Environment, said it was likely the Millikins’ decision to dig out the existing landscaping directly surrounding the house and replace it with river stones that made the biggest difference. </p>



<p>“What folks in the wildfire business call the zone zero or the ember ignition zone, is kind of a key factor in whether homes do or do not burn down,” Wara said. </p>



<p>Having nothing combustible in the 5 feet directly around a house is enormously important.</p>



<p>Millikin said the decision to install river stones for about a meter around the house was not actually aimed at fire prevention. He wanted to prevent runoff from landscaping from creating water and termite damage. But it may have saved his home. </p>



<p>Regulations in California have typically focused on a 30-foot perimeter around homes known as “Zone A” in firefighting. But Wara said that research on the thousands of homes that have burned in California in recent years has shown that it’s really what’s installed in the immediate few feet of a home that makes the biggest difference. </p>



<p>In fires like the one in Lahaina, there are enormous amounts of flaming embers that are flying through the air. And if there’s something next to the house that is combustible — a wood fence, a bush, dry grass — that’s often what will ignite the structure, Wara said. </p>



<p>In the instance of the Front Street house, there was also a considerable amount of luck involved, he said. Because even the most well-prepared house can catch fire when the homes next to it are burning. </p>



<p>“Basically, the houses start catching each other on fire,” Wara said, which is why encouraging homeowners to remove landscaping and install rocks or granite walkways around homes is so important. “If enough of the homes have that kind of preparation then that chain reaction doesn’t get started.”</p>



<h2>A Struggle To Make Use Of Luck </h2>



<p>Millikin, who was on a trip to Massachusetts during the Lahaina fire, said the last he heard from his immediate neighbor on Aug. 8 was that the whole neighborhood was burning and his home was unlikely to make it. </p>



<p>He went to bed feeling physically ill out of fear for the fate of his friends, his neighborhood, and his home. </p>



<p>In the morning, a friend called and sent them a picture from a helicopter flyover of Lahaina. Every structure had been destroyed in the area. But there, in the midst of the destruction, was the seemingly untouched red roof of Millikin’s home. </p>



<p>Millikin said he and his wife were overcome with emotion. </p>



<p>“We started crying,” he said. “I felt guilty. We still feel guilty.”</p>

(Kevin Fujii/Civil Beat/2023)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Millikin said he has friends who have lost homes in California in recent years, and when he’s seen stories about other “miracle houses” left standing in the aftermath of destructive fires, he’s always thought: “Boy, I’m glad I don’t own that one. I wouldn’t want that. I would feel guilty.” </p>



<p>Now, Millikin said, “that’s our house.” </p>



<p>Millikin is hoping to channel his luck — and his feelings of guilt — into community action. He’s been told by neighbors that it’s best to stay put outside of Lahaina while he can so as not to take up much-needed resources for other survivors. </p>



<p>But when he and his wife are able to go back, he’s hoping to set up his home as some sort of a community hub for people trying to rebuild theirs. </p>



<p>“Let’s rebuild this together,” he said. “This house will become a base for all of us. Let’s use it.”</p>

<!-- --><p>she's taking her husband to the hospital to see his doctor, but there's a massive road project that has cut off access for months, no end in sight, so she's parked a few blocks away. almost every parking lot in town removed their pay stations years ago. she has a smartphone but no idea how to handle this situation.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>she never would have figured it out. her words, and I don't doubt her.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>the lot has three signs hung up with instructions on how to pay, because every single lot in town supports one to five different competing parking lot apps. there's one sign that says you can use Park Mobile, and gives a lot ID, and then on another wall there's a sign that says you can use PayByPhone, with a different lot ID, and then there's a huge sign with a QR code that encourages you to Scan Here To Park, as if it's the official primary method for doing so. It is not, it's just another app.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>I've scanned these before and gotten an "Instant App." I figure this is minimal friction for this person, so I suggest she do so. she pulls up a QR Scanner app - either because she's been bamboozled into believing that's the only way to get QR support, or because her particular Android phone actually does not have it built into the camera for God knows what reason; I didn't have time to figure out which.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>at first she struggles to figure out how to change cameras, but this turns out to be only because she's used to every camera app opening with the front facing selected by default; it has actually selected the rear camera, so I help her get it aimed right, and it goes bleep, and then... pops up an ad. i have to stop her before she hits open on whatever sludge is trying to put itself on her device<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>then we get a screen with 30 different elements on it describing different qualities of the QR code. the most prominent is a "Search The Web" button, which would have dumped the scanned URL into Google for some reason and produced irrelevant results; i have to direct her to tap the tiny blue link.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>that link opens Instant App. Google play prints a huge permissions message; I direct her to accept it. it installs a 16mb app; so what was the point of Instant here, exactly?<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>well, that's moot anyway, because as soon as it opens, it asks for permission, and then simply installs the normal version of the app, 24mb.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>we get into that. it asks for the street address of the lot. I have never seen this information printed on any parking lot in my life. it suggests several "nearby" options; they are actually half a mile away.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>unable to figure this conundrum out even for myself, i sigh and walk her through installing Park Mobile, which I know works. i help her find the lot ID. it asks for duration. she picks two hours. it asks for payment. she gets out her CC and types in the info.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>proceeding to checkout, it then... selects google pay. even though she just put in a CC. she hits proceed, and i go "is that the right card?" and she double takes and goes "...no." i maybe just saved this woman from losing $30 in overdrafts.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>I direct her to tap the payment options field. nothing. i sigh. "I'm sorry, it looks like you have to tap that tiny pencil icon in the CORNER of the field." yep. finally she's able to select her credit card. she hits proceed.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>it now pops up the duration selector again. what???? why????? it's back at the default of 1 hour, and she tries to pick two again, but it just won't do it. I happen to know this UI pretty well, so I know that if parking time was actually limited to 1 hour, it wouldn't show the option at all. This is just completely glitched out.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>with no other options, she just picks one hour, and successfully pays. we both breathe a sigh of relief, and I advise her that if she needs more time, she should be able to just tap a button in the app to extend her parking. I really hope it actually works like I described.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>throughout all this we had to grant Location permissions at least three times, and each time you have to decide between three options, none of which are "Yes." the one you want is "while the app is open" but there is no way to know this, and nobody alive has ever picked either of the other options. nobody would.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>i have struggled to write an ending to this post three times. words genuinely fail me.<!-- --></p></div></div>]]></description>

In 2022, rightsholders obtained permission in Austria to block several pirate site domains and a list of IP addresses that actually belonged to Cloudflare. ISPs had no choice but to comply with the court's instructions which took out countless Cloudflare customers in Austria. According to reviews conducted by local telecoms regulator TKK, the IP address blocking violated net neutrality regulations and will no longer be allowed.
</p>
</div><div>
<p><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/pageblocked.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/pageblocked.jpg" alt="Page Blocked" width="275" height="207" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/pageblocked.jpg 275w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/pageblocked-200x150.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20275%20207'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/pageblocked.jpg 275w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/pageblocked-200x150.jpg 200w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/pageblocked.jpg"></a>With momentum building in favor of pirate site blocking measures elsewhere in Europe, Austrian ISPs took their <a href="https://futurezone.at/netzpolitik/ogh-netzsperren-sind-zulaessig-user-sollen-dafuer-zahlen/139.308.830">opposition</a> all the way to the country’s Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Despite <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/austrian-telecoms-regulator-rejects-informal-pirate-site-blocks-190118/">concerns</a> over the implications for net neutrality, rightsholders’ interests prevailed. Like many of their foreign counterparts, Austrian ISPs soon found themselves compelled by court order to block torrent and streaming sites, those offering unlicensed musical works, plus scientific article and textbook repositories.</p>
<h2>Domain/DNS Blocking Received Surprise ‘Upgrade’</h2>
<p>For years Austrian ISPs had deployed DNS blocking in response to court orders but in the summer of 2022, everything changed. New pirate site blocking orders not only contained domain names to be blocked, but also a list of IP addresses. </p>
<p>When the ISPs discovered that the IP addresses belonged to Cloudflare, arms were thrown up in despair. With no opportunity to contest the court-ordered blockades, ISPs had no other choice than to block the IP addresses, rendering countless innocent sites using Cloudflare inaccessible.</p>
<p>While this disruption was controversial and avoidable, the long term effect should be more positive.</p>
<h2>IP Address Blocking Violated Net Neutrality</h2>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.rtr.at/TKP/was_wir_tun/telekommunikation/weitere-regulierungsthemen/netzneutralitaet/nn_procedures.de.html">series of reports</a> published this week, local telecoms regulator Telekom Control Commission (TKK) states that the IP address blocks implemented last August amounted to net neutrality violations under EU law.</p>
<p>“In a decision dated August 7, 2023, the Telekom Control Commission decided on the admissibility of blocking networks by [various local ISPs] based on a warning from the rights holder SATEL Film GmbH in accordance with <a href="https://wilmap.stanford.edu/country/austria">Section 81 (1a) UrhG</a>,” one of the reports begins.</p>
<p>“The provider mentioned had set up DNS access blocks on the one hand and an IP access block on the other in its network at the end of August 2022. With regard to the DNS access blocks, no current violation of Art 3 Para 3 VO (EU) 2015/2120 was found and the procedure was discontinued in this respect.</p>
<p>“With regard to the blocking of access to the IP address 190.115.18.20, the Telekom Control Commission found a violation of <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32015R2120">Article 3 Paragraph 3 of Regulation (EU) 2015/2120</a>, because the IP access block poses the risk of ‘overblocking’ any website content.”</p>
<center><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/net-neutrality-art3.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/net-neutrality-art3.png" alt="net-neutrality-art3" width="610" height="285" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/net-neutrality-art3.png 686w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/net-neutrality-art3-300x140.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20610%20285'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/net-neutrality-art3.png 686w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/net-neutrality-art3-300x140.png 300w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/net-neutrality-art3.png"></a></center>
<p>In a follow-up announcement, TKK said that, since DNS-based blocking is generally sufficient to protect rightsholders, that will be the only method available to them moving forward.</p>
<h2>Protecting Net Neutrality</h2>
<p>After declaring IP address-based blocking prohibited in Austria, TKK explained its reasoning to a background of net neutrality and freedom of expression on the Internet.</p>
<p>“Since countless websites can be accessed from a single IP address, the risk of blocking websites or Internet services of uninvolved third parties is particularly high in the event of a block,” a TKK spokesman said.</p>
<p>“In Austria, network blocks have so far mainly been implemented with so-called ‘DNS blocks’. With this type of block, only individual domains are blocked and blocking notices are displayed instead. It is important that this practice is maintained in order to maintain the legally required proportionality in the future.” </p>
<p><em>TKK’s commitment to transparency includes <a href="https://www.rtr.at/TKP/was_wir_tun/telekommunikation/weitere-regulierungsthemen/netzneutralitaet/nn_blockings.de.html">publishing all blocking decisions</a> and the domains they affect.</em></p>

<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">Evidently, when the Iraqi government began blocking Telegram, it started by <a href="https://twitter.com/DougMadory/status/1688660150087823360" rel="noopener" target="_blank">using BGP to hijack traffic</a> destined for IP addresses associated with the messaging service, redirecting them to the proverbial bitbucket. And, as has happened before on numerous occasions, these hijack BGP routes leaked out of the country.</p>
<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">However, despite this technical error, no Telegram disruption was reported outside of Iraq, in part, due to the fact that Telegram had created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Public_Key_Infrastructure#Route_Origin_Authorizations" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Route Origin Authorizations</a> (ROAs) for its routes allowing ASes outside of Iraq to automatically reject the hijacks. A ROA is a record in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Public_Key_Infrastructure" rel="noopener" target="_blank">RPKI</a> that specifies the AS origin that is authorized to originate the IP address range.</p>

<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">Perhaps the most famous BGP hijack ever was Pakistan’s <a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/02/pakistans-accid/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hijack of YouTube in 2008</a> (also see <a href="https://www.kentik.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-the-internets-biggest-bgp-incidents/">The Internet’s Biggest BGP Incidents</a>). In that case, the Pakistani government ordered a block of Youtube in the country. The Pakistani state telecom, PTCL created BGP routes to hijack traffic destined for Youtube and blackhole it. However, the hijacks leaked out of Pakistan, leading to a global disruption of Youtube. Over the years, there have been many such leaks of BGP hijacks meant to censor content, such as those in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210512142832mp_/https://blogs.oracle.com/internetintelligence/ukraine-bans-russian-social-media" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ukraine</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170327193134/http://dyn.com/blog/iran-leaks-censorship-via-bgp-hijacks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Iran</a>.</p>
<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">More recently, during the initial weeks of the <a href="https://www.kentik.com/blog/myanmar-goes-offline-during-military-coup/">Myanmar military coup in 2021</a>, the military junta in charge ordered social media to be blocked. To comply with the order, one Myanma ISP elected to use BGP in order to hijack local Twitter traffic and drop it. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.manrs.org/2021/02/did-someone-try-to-hijack-twitter-yes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their hijack route was inadvertently leaked out</a> of Myanmar, causing disruptions to Twitter around South Asia.</p>
<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">And finally, last year, during Russia’s crackdown on social media and independent journalism following their invasion of Ukraine, a <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/russian-network-hijacked-twitter-traffic-578000" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Russian ISP elected to use BGP to blackhole traffic</a> to Twitter by hijacking the <em>exact same prefix</em> (104.244.42.0/24) that was hijacked a year earlier in Myanmar.</p>
<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">However, there was a difference between the two hijacks of Twitter’s 104.244.42.0/24 by Myanmar in 2021 and then again by Russia in 2022. In the intervening year, Twitter deployed RPKI, creating ROAs in RPKI for nearly all of its routes. By doing so, it enabled ASes which reject RPKI-invalid routes to automatically reject the hijack routes, limiting the disruption to Twitter.</p>
<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">As Twitter’s CISO <a href="https://twitter.com/LeaKissner/status/1508503164374315011" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wrote at the time</a>, “a bunch of the point of having security is to keep your systems from breaking all of the time” and in this case, it kept a BGP hijack from breaking access to Twitter for users outside of Russia. The Russian hijack propagated <a href="https://twitter.com/DougMadory/status/1508466367112093709" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>slightly less</em></a> than the hijack from Myanmar, but it is hard to directly compare since the hijacks were announced from different places on the internet, and there are numerous factors which can influence BGP route propagation.</p>
<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">Anecdotally, I would say that after my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKwjq94Quhc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NANOG 86 presentation</a> on the internet impacts due to the war in Ukraine, one of Twitter’s network engineers shared that, from a traffic standpoint, they observed significantly less disruption due to the Russian hijack. They believed the difference was due to RPKI.</p>
<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">The recent episode in Iraq is similar to the aforementioned cases because it was a BGP incident that was intentional, but also accidental. The network accidentally leaked out a BGP hijack that they intentionally created.</p>

<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">Except for the networks in the semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan, all Iraqi internet service must go through <a href="https://bgp.tools/as/208293" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AS208293</a>, a government network which serves as the country’s international gateway. AS208293 normally doesn’t originate any routes; it only connects the country’s telecoms to international transit providers.</p>
<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">However, at 13:52 UTC on 5 August 2023, AS208293 started originating the following prefixes:</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td color="body" font-size="16,18" font-weight="light">151.106.160.0/19</td><td color="body" font-size="16,18" font-weight="light">95.161.64.0/20</td></tr><tr><td color="body" font-size="16,18" font-weight="light">95.161.0.0/17</td><td color="body" font-size="16,18" font-weight="light">91.108.8.0/22</td></tr><tr><td color="body" font-size="16,18" font-weight="light">91.108.0.0/18</td><td color="body" font-size="16,18" font-weight="light">91.108.4.0/22</td></tr><tr><td color="body" font-size="16,18" font-weight="light">149.154.160.0/20</td><td color="body" font-size="16,18" font-weight="light">149.154.164.0/22</td></tr><tr><td color="body" font-size="16,18" font-weight="light">91.108.56.0/22</td><td color="body" font-size="16,18" font-weight="light">149.154.160.0/22</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">All but the first are address ranges used by Telegram. 151.106.160.0/19 was last utilized by the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/subspace-com_we-regret-to-announce-that-effective-may-activity-6930952295824207873-2z25/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">now-defunct Subspace network</a>, so the reason for its inclusion is unclear.</p>
<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">Illustrated in Kentik’s BGP Route Viewer below, 149.154.160.0/20 was originated by AS208293 and attained global circulation for two reasons. The first was that there was no competing route in circulation — 149.154.160.0/20 is “less-specific” to existing Telegram routes. Secondly, there was no matching ROA in RPKI to give ASes who have deployed RPKI a reason to reject it.</p>

<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">Conversely, when we look at the propagation of the corresponding “more-specific” 149.154.160.0/22, we see that nearly the entire internet believed (correctly!) that AS62041 (Telegram) was the origin. While AS208293 shows up in red in the ball-and-stick diagram along the bottom, it can hardly be seen in the upper stacked plot, which depicts route propagation by origin.</p>

<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">The lack of propagation of a BGP route with AS208293 as the origin of 149.154.160.0/22 is due to the fact that there was already an existing route to compete with (originated by AS62041), but also because the route from Iraq was <a href="https://rpki-validator.ripe.net/ui/149.154.160.0%2F22/AS208293?include=related_alloc,related_less_specific" rel="noopener" target="_blank">RPKI-invalid</a>, dramatically <a href="https://www.kentik.com/blog/how-much-does-rpki-rov-reduce-the-propagation-of-invalid-routes/">limiting its reach</a>.</p>

<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">The challenge of measuring the positive impact of any security mechanism is that it often requires knowledge of the incidents that didn’t occur as a result of its use. RPKI is no different. While it likely didn’t have the potential to be another Pakistan/YouTube incident, BGP non-events like this are what RPKI success looks like.</p>
<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">Of course, this is little solace to the Iraqi users who must now employ a VPN to circumvent this IP-level blockage. Censoring Telegram will do little to protect the personal data of any Iraqis, but it does cut them off from a popular communication tool and source of news and information.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3cswpt1#:%7E:text=In%201953%20Iran's%20democratically%20elected,British%20and%20American%20intelligence%20services.">1953 coup d'etat</a> in Iran ushered in a period of exploitation and oppression that has continued – despite a subsequent revolution that led to huge changes – for 70 years. Each year on August 19, the anniversary of the coup, millions of Iranians ask themselves what would have happened if the US and UK had not conspired all those years ago to overthrow Iran’s democratically elected leader. </p>

<p>Iran, the Middle East and, arguably, the whole world may well have been profoundly different. Apart from rewriting the destiny of Iran and its neighbours, the coup paved the way for a series of imperialist interventions and the toppling of democratically elected governments across the global south. Perhaps Washington might have thought twice before plotting coups in <a href="https://www.zinnedproject.org/news/tdih/jacobo-arbenz-guzman-deposed/">Guatemala in 1954</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/jan/17/patrice-lumumba-50th-anniversary-assassination">Congo in 1961</a> or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/18/1973-coup-chile-democratic-socialism-still-matters-britain">Chile in 1973</a>, if they’d been unable to overthrow Iran’s prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh, so easily and profitably.</p>

<p>As the democratically elected leader of Iran from 1951 to 1953, Mosaddegh championed nationalisation of Iran’s oil industry. This had previously been in the hands of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Persian_Oil_Company">Anglo-Persian Oil Company</a> –  a British company, founded in 1909 after the discovery of a large oil field in Iran, which would later become BP. </p>

          </figure>

<p>In March 1951, Iran’s parliament <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/world/mideast/032551iran-oil-vote.html">voted to proceed with nationalisation</a>. This caused consternation in the west – most notably in Britain, where the prospect of nationalisation was seen as potentially hugely damaging to the economy. Furthermore, it would have undermined Britain’s influence in the Middle East. Plotting to depose Mosaddegh began in earnest.</p>

<p>In the event, the coup – named <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/06/20/64-years-later-cia-finally-releases-details-of-iranian-coup-iran-tehran-oil/">Operation Ajax</a> –  was a joint venture between the CIA and MI6. The shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had recently fled the country after an earlier plot to remove Mossadegh had failed, returned to Iran.</p>

<p>Within a short period, he had tightened his grip on the country’s security services and imposed a dictatorial regime which ruled through brutality and fear. Pahlavi banned all opposition political parties, and many of the activists who participated in the movement for nationalisation of oil were arrested or fled the country. </p>

<h2>Government by fear</h2>

<p>In 1957, the shah established an internal security service, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAVAK">Sazman-e Ettel'at va Amniyat-e Keshvar</a></em> (Savak), which essentially ran Iran at the shah’s bidding. From then until 1975, only two major political parties were allowed to operate, the People’s Party (<em>Ḥezb-e Mardom</em>) and the New Iran Party (<em>Ḥezb-e Iran-e Novin</em>), and all parliamentary candidates had to be approved by Savak.</p>

<p>Both parties in reality were wholly under the shah’s control. The parliament only existed to rubber-stamp his decisions, as did the prime minister – who the shah appointed. </p>

<p>In 1975, the shah took his domination of Iranian politics further, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/03/archives/shah-decrees-iran-a-oneparty-nation.html">establishing a single party</a>, the Party of Resurrection of the Iranian Nation (<em>Hezb-e Rastakhiz</em>), which all Iranians were obliged to join. By 1979, when Iran <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-iranian-revolution-a-timeline-of-events/">rose up in a popular revolution</a>, it was a virtual absolute monarchy, with the shah’s will enforced by the dreaded Savak secret police.</p>

<p>Within months of the revolution, though, Iran’s religious authorities took control under the leadership of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The Islamic Republic quickly <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/06/07/khomeini-is-reported-to-have-a-savak-of-his-own/dfc8e0a4-85b5-4a35-9723-c8a57caabae6/">established its own secret police, Savama</a> – <em>[Sazman-e Ettelaat Va Amniat Meli Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Intelligence</em>(Iran))_ – which used many of the same brutal methods as Savak.</p>

<h2>‘Woman, Life, Freedom’</h2>

<p>This week, Iranians will recall the 1953 coup as they prepare protests ahead of the anniversary of the “Woman, Life, Freedom” uprising. This movement began in September 2022 after the <a href="https://theconversation.com/iran-on-fire-once-again-women-are-on-the-vanguard-of-transformative-change-191297">death of Mahsa Amini</a> at the hands of the morality police – who <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-66218318">patrol the streets</a> tasked with enforcing the laws on Islamic dress code in public – for the “crime” of not wearing her hijab (headscarf) in the approved manner. </p>

<p>The resulting explosion of unrest has posed the most serious challenge to the Islamic Republic in its history. Although the state tried to <a href="https://theconversation.com/iran-is-using-every-effort-to-crush-protesters-intent-on-a-revolution-except-hearing-them-out-193684">crush the demonstrations</a> from the beginning, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jul/24/theres-no-other-option-but-to-fight-iranian-women-defiant-as-morality-police-return">protesters have defied</a> police brutality and the prospect of severe punishment, which included public executions and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/12/13/iran-death-sentences-against-protesters">hundreds of deaths of protesters</a> at the hands of the security forces.</p>

<p>At the same time as battling the oppression of their own state apparatus, ordinary Iranians are also suffering under the brutal US-imposed regime of sanctions. In the past five years, these sanctions – reimposed by Donald Trump after he unilaterally pulled the US out of the Iran Nuclear Deal, which had been signed by his predecessor Barack Obama in 2015 – have devastated the Iranian economy. Soaring inflation and devaluation of the national currency have caused <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c86fccb4-f56e-43b7-a596-29c036cb4ec1?accessToken=zwAGAzIWvP-IkdPIb8y09W5Dt9OllinANstOwQ.MEUCIB-C6PA2kZTxATwPKPY1n-zam6BzvbSibbybEmV1FFyZAiEAhZTNZOtTm3l-gtkRtQYHI-C5I9UpYRKxm-s5hZRRBjc&amp;sharetype=gift&amp;token=b91228d2-5530-4fe4-bbf3-071a531111a6">serious hardship</a> for ordinary Iranians.</p>

<p>As they <a href="https://theconversation.com/iran-unions-and-civil-rights-groups-demand-democracy-and-social-justice-201422">fight for a better future</a>, Iranians clearly grasp how, 70 years after the coup snuffed out their fledgling democracy, their internal struggles are still being influenced by foreign powers. </p>

<p>And they ask themselves if Mahsa Amini, and also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/08/mother-says-police-beat-daughter-to-death-in-iranian-protests">Nika Shahkarami</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/oct/07/another-teenage-girl-dead-at-hands-of-irans-security-forces-reports-claim">Sarina Esmailzadeh</a> – two other women beaten to death by members of the state apparatus for protesting – as well as hundreds of other young Iranians, would still be paying with their lives in Iran’s struggle for basic rights today if the 1953 coup had not happened.</p>

          Howdy! I’m Carlos and I like tech and planes (among other things like
          having massive servings of pasta). I’m currently studying for my
          commercial license in Europe. So far most of my flight training has
          happened on a Piper PA28 (the -180 variant)

        <p>
          It’s from the late 60s, often there are at least 1 or 2 things that
          don’t work properly and it shows - the thing is old! I imagine at some
          point I’ll jump into modern jets, and so I am happy to spend the first
          few hundred hours being as much of an ‘aviator’ as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a bit of background, these planes are single pilot operation, so
          the idea is that whoever is flying is doing the navigating, the
          radios, the checklist, the flying, the communicating and the looking
          out and in. It can get busy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The one thing on this plane that is just hard to adapt to is how
          cramped it is and hot it can get - I’m talking about 38C/100F in a
          vibrating machine for 3h. And I say that with the knowledge of all the
          other issues this plane has (magnetos may drop excessively, gyro
          basically useless, fuel pump is old…).
        </p>
        <p>
          We get these things called kneeboards, that provide a ‘comfy’ space
          for us to write down things like the weather reports, the tower
          instructions and how accurate our routing plan is as we follow it
          along.

          how comfortable is that! does it come with a cupholder?
        </figcaption>
        <p>
          Whilst this picture looks pretty spacious, my plane is more cramped
          than that, and I’m sitting at a weirder angle. In my kneeboard /
          floating around the plane I have: 
          </p><ul>
            <li><a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/3070/5823042998_7de069bf04_b.jpg">Checklist</a> (before taking off checklist, taxiing checklist, …)</li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sectional_aeronautical_chart">Map</a> (big unfolding 1:400 map) (like the ones in the cartoons that open and open and open)</li>
            <li>Piece of paper to jot on (weather, tower instructions, tic tac toe..)</li>
            <li>Nav log (more on this soon)</li>
          </ul>    
        
        <p>
            All of those documents have to be hot swapped for one another at different phases of the flight, and so there is actually a pretty big market for kneeboards and all the shapes and sizes they can come in. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The Nav log is the term we give for a paper with point-to-point instructions from one waypoint to another. It typically has a lot of information to help us navigate (and even more info that we really use but had to write down to work out other things). Here’s a sample, but don’t worry too much about reading it.

        </p>
        <p><img src="https://carloslagoa.com/blog/flipreps/flipreps_files/image3.png" alt="alt text"></p><figcaption>
          an example of a Navigation Log
        </figcaption>
        <p>
            Realistically, out of all those numbers, I’m only really looking at a few because things like the wind correction angle only really matter so that I can work out other information (except in some edge cases).
        </p>
        <p>
            Since I’ve grown happy with how I work out the items in the Nav log (an important skill when you are in training), now I occasionally use this tool (screenshot below) which automatically fills most of those fields for me. For the most part it is repetitive work, like “how do my heading and wind interact with each other, hmm let me see.. <basic math="" here="">”. 
        </basic></p>
        <p>
            I simply look at my 1:400 map and then pick out the waypoints in this browser tool. This allows me to prep other parts of my fight that I might be doing that lesson whilst still having a fleshed out Nav log!
        </p>
        <p><img src="https://carloslagoa.com/blog/flipreps/flipreps_files/image5.png" alt="alt text"></p><figcaption>

            I then get a PDF which I can then copy by hand into my Kneeboard nav log. Sweet!
        </p>
        <p>
            Like I said I also like computers and toyin’ around with them, and so the other day I bought a receipt printer. Why? Well… 
            </p><ul>
                <li>they seemed super cool for small projects</li>
                <li>don’t use ink</li>
                <li>can get them second hand easily</li>
                <li>plug and play into Linux (/dev/usb/lp0)</li>
                <li>look cute (mostly through the use of googly eyes</li>
              </ul>   
        
        <p>
            So then I thought… hey… what about the windshield pillar or a-pillar (if you speak cars) in the plane?
        </p>
        <p><img src="https://carloslagoa.com/blog/flipreps/flipreps_files/image4.png" alt="alt text"></p><figcaption>
          it's strange to find unsued space in a cockpit
        </figcaption>
        <p>
            I mean, that thing is in the middle of the cockpit, serves no function (other than the obvious one of preventing a total structural collapse) and is strangely receipt sized.. surely.. I could use that to alleviate some of my issues with the cramped kneeboard. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Why don’t I make a <a href="https://github.com/kiloamp/fliprep">git project</a> that will let me have nicely formatted receipt prints of my nav log.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I thought the Navlog would be the easiest thing to do so that’s where I started. Oh how wrong I was.
        </p>
        <p>
            Knowing that I’ll be using SkyVector for the foreseeable future I wrote a quick (ish) script to grab their Nav log. Ideally I could export a Navlog in some format like the Garmin one, but not really - only a weirdly formatted PDF. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyways, fair enough -- I’ll just grab the whole PDF text with Ctrl+A and then ask the user to paste it into my script.
        </p>

            <p>
                I actually got a somewhat pretty looking Python dictionary / JSON of every leg of the journey. 
            </p>
            <pre>{
    "from": null,
    "to": null,
    "wind_direction": null,
    "wind_speed": null,
    "temp": null,
    "temp_deviation": null,
    "TAS": null,
    "Track": null,
    "WCA": null,
    "TH": null,
    "Var": null,
    "Magnetic Heading": null,
    "Ground Speed": null,
    "Distance": null,
    "ETA": null,
    "CumulativeETA": null
}</pre>
            <p>
                Then that JSON was exported into a PHP file (thanks <a href="https://github.com/mike42/escpos-php/">Mike42’s escpos-php/ library</a>!) which is what I’m using for formatting text in the receipt printer (mostly just font size and text-wrapping) and boom!

                version 1 -- still with a few things to add!
            </figcaption>
            <p>
                I have to say it works surprisingly well. I use that to quickly understand where I am whilst I play with the map and communicate on our area’s busy air to air frequency. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I don’t consider this to be dangerous since I also carry with me the full Nav log, so at any doubt I have all the other details, but hey, it never hurts to have extra easily-accessible information in unused space! 
            </p>
            <p>
                The script also works for simpler things, like printing the lesson plan if you want to. Hopefully in version 2 I can make this feature a bit more extensive, and maybe have some nicer formatting, maybe a QR reference to the lesson plan, etc..etc… 
            </p>
            <p><img src="https://carloslagoa.com/blog/flipreps/flipreps_files/image6.png" alt="alt text"></p><figcaption>
                the lesson plan is normally on an internal web app, I’d rather sellotape it to the plane!

      <h3 dir="auto">Motivation and Context</h3>
<p dir="auto">This feature allows disks to be added one at a time to a RAID-Z group, expanding its capacity incrementally. This feature is especially useful for small pools (typically with only one RAID-Z group), where there isn't sufficient hardware to add capacity by adding a whole new RAID-Z group (typically doubling the number of disks).</p>
<p dir="auto">For additional context as well as a design overview, see Matt Ahrens' talk at the <a href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/DevSummit/202106" rel="nofollow">2021 FreeBSD Developer Summit</a> (<a href="https://youtu.be/3SUKJye54aI?t=6166" rel="nofollow">video</a>) (<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FeQgEwChrtNQBHfWSNsPK3Y53O5BnPh3Cz5nRa5GAQY/edit#slide=id.p" rel="nofollow">slides</a>), and a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/raidz-expansion-code-lands-in-openzfs-master/" rel="nofollow">news article from Ars Technica</a>.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Description</h3>
<h4 dir="auto">Initiating expansion</h4>
<p dir="auto">A new device (disk) can be attached to an existing RAIDZ vdev, by running <code>zpool attach POOL raidzP-N NEW_DEVICE</code>, e.g. <code>zpool attach tank raidz2-0 sda</code>. The new device will become part of the RAIDZ group. A <em>raidz expansion</em> will<br>
be initiated, and the new device will contribute additional space to the RAIDZ group once the expansion completes.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>feature@raidz_expansion</code> on-disk feature flag must be <code>enabled</code> to initiate an expansion, and it remains <code>active</code> for the life of the pool. In other words, pools with expanded RAIDZ vdevs can not be imported by older releases of the ZFS software.</p>
<h4 dir="auto">During expansion</h4>
<p dir="auto">The expansion entails reading all allocated space from existing disks in the RAIDZ group, and rewriting it to the new disks in the RAIDZ group (including the newly added device).</p>
<p dir="auto">The expansion progress can be monitored with <code>zpool status</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Data redundancy is maintained during (and after) the expansion. If a disk fails while the expansion is in progress, the expansion pauses until the health of the RAIDZ vdev is restored (e.g. by replacing the failed disk and waiting<br>
for reconstruction to complete).</p>
<p dir="auto">The pool remains accessible during expansion. Following a reboot or export/import, the expansion resumes where it left off.</p>
<h4 dir="auto">After expansion</h4>
<p dir="auto">When the expansion completes, the additional space is available for use, and is reflected in the <code>available</code> zfs property (as seen in <code>zfs list</code>, <code>df</code>, etc).</p>
<p dir="auto">Expansion does not change the number of failures that can be tolerated without data loss (e.g. a RAIDZ2 is still a RAIDZ2 even after expansion).</p>
<p dir="auto">A RAIDZ vdev can be expanded multiple times.</p>
<p dir="auto">After the expansion completes, old blocks remain with their old data-to-parity ratio (e.g. 5-wide RAIDZ2, has 3 data to 2 parity), but distributed among the larger set of disks. New blocks will be written with the new data-to-parity<br>
ratio (e.g. a 5-wide RAIDZ2 which has been expanded once to 6-wide, has 4 data to 2 parity). However, the RAIDZ vdev's "assumed parity ratio" does not change, so slightly less space than is expected may be reported for newly-written blocks, according to <code>zfs list</code>, <code>df</code>, <code>ls -s</code>, and similar tools.</p>

     zpool-attach — attach new device to existing ZFS vdev

SYNOPSIS
     zpool attach [-fsw] [-o property=value] pool device new_device

DESCRIPTION
     Attaches new_device to the existing device.  The behavior differs depend‐
     ing on if the existing device is a RAIDZ device, or a mirror/plain
     device.

     If the existing device is a mirror or plain device ...

     If the existing device is a RAIDZ device (e.g. specified as &quot;raidz2-0&quot;),
     the new device will become part of that RAIDZ group.  A &quot;raidz expansion&quot;
     will be initiated, and the new device will contribute additional space to
     the RAIDZ group once the expansion completes.  The expansion entails
     reading all allocated space from existing disks in the RAIDZ group, and
     rewriting it to the new disks in the RAIDZ group (including the newly
     added device).  Its progress can be monitored with zpool status.

     Data redundancy is maintained during and after the expansion.  If a disk
     fails while the expansion is in progress, the expansion pauses until the
     health of the RAIDZ vdev is restored (e.g. by replacing the failed disk
     and waiting for reconstruction to complete).  Expansion does not change
     the number of failures that can be tolerated without data loss (e.g. a
     RAIDZ2 is still a RAIDZ2 even after expansion).  A RAIDZ vdev can be
     expanded multiple times.

     parity ratio (e.g. 5-wide RAIDZ2, has 3 data to 2 parity), but distrib‐
     uted among the larger set of disks.  New blocks will be written with the

This feature is believed to be complete. However, like all PR's, it is subject to change as part of the code review process. Since this PR includes on-disk changes, it shouldn't be used on production systems before it is integrated to the OpenZFS codebase. Tasks that still need to be done before integration:</p>
<ul>
<li> Additional code cleanup in <code>ztest</code> code</li>
<li> <code>zloop</code> changes to drive coverage of this feature</li>
<li> Address test failures in <code>ztest</code> runs</li>
<li> Document the high-level design in a "big theory statement" comment</li>
<li> Remove verbose logging</li>
<li> Detection of MBR partitions using reserved boot area (FreeBSD BTX boot loader)</li>
<li> Address any performance concerns</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I once joined a company as a consultant - in the previous 12 months, they'd spent their entire $1,500,000 marketing budget on Google/Facebook  ads. Using Hubspot we could track leads through the funnel and look at exactly how many customers this money had generated. The answer was 0. In total, the ads brought in two leads to the website who never even booked a demo for the product. For <strong><em>$1,500,000.</em></strong></p><p>We ultimately managed to turn the ship around (more on that later in the series) but the lesson stands: marketing can be expensive and drain your runway. This is why accelerators like YC prefer cold outreach / emailing prospects during the early days of your company - it's free.</p><p>But how do you know if your business is ready to invest in marketing? To answer this question, you'll need to understand if your company have some form of product market fit - PMF. There are many ways you can define PMF:</p><pre>In 2009, Sean Ellis, also known as the founder of Growth Hacking, wrote that he identify Product-Market fit with the help of a survey. He asks the users of a product however they would be disappointed if the product would no longer be available. If at least 40% of users say they would be very disappointed, it probably means that you have Product-Market Fit.<p>Further, he adds that “Admittedly this threshold is a bit arbitrary, but I defined it after comparing results across nearly 100 startups. Those that struggle for traction are always under 40%, while most that gain strong traction exceed 40%.”</p></pre><p>There are more abstract definitions which say that PMF has been achieved when your company is drowning in demand - without time or resources to scale. I don't like this definition as much because it's only the ultimate form of PMF from a VC perspective - I've seen plenty of companies with PMF who are not in the aforementioned situation. If a kid sells lemonade on a sunny day, they can still make bank even if the line to the stand isn't running around the block.</p><p>If you don't have any PMF, don't invest money in marketing - you might end up like the examples mentioned in the introduction. The goal of marketing is to find a predictable method where if you spend e.g. $1,000 marketing dollars and expect a statistical 3x return of $3,000 in profit which should scale with your marketing budget. Marketing research can help you find customers who would be a good fit for your product, but if so it needs to be conducted in a cheap fashion (more on this later). Instead, invest your budget in product development to reach PMF.<br></p><h3>If you have product market fit</h3><p>Congratulations! You've got over the hardest part of starting a startup and can start investing in marketing.</p><p>The basis of a good marketing strategy is aligning it with your business objective(s) - no more lofty "number of likes" metrics. Start at the top - here are some examples of marketing objectives to choose from:</p><ul><li><strong>Boost Customer Acquisition:</strong> Attract new customers to expand your customer base and drive revenue growth.</li><li><strong>Increase Market Share:</strong> Expand the percentage of the market your business serves, often achieved by outperforming competitors or acquiring new customers.</li><li><strong>Market penetration:</strong> If your startup is expanding to new markets, the marketing objective could be to increase market penetration in those regions.</li><li><strong>Improve Brand Awareness:</strong> Enhance the recognition and visibility of your brand among the target audience, leading to increased trust and customer loyalty.</li><li><strong>Enhance Customer Retention:</strong> Focus on strategies to retain existing customers, thereby reducing churn and fostering long-term relationships (marketing team can help with this too).</li><li><strong>Improve Employee Engagement (internal communication):</strong> Foster a positive work culture and invest in employee development to increase productivity and reduce turnover.<br></li></ul><p>This is usually agreed on a leadership level based on what can be accomplished with the soon to be approved marketing budget. For this exercise, let's imagine a SaaS business named ApiHub, targeting B2B customers looking for an API to power their e-commerce business:</p><p><strong>Company wide business objective for end of year (EOY):</strong></p><ul><li>Increase revenue by $8,000,000</li></ul><p><strong>Selected marketing objective:</strong></p><ul><li>Boost Customer Acquisition: Get 666,250 additional visitors to our website before EOY.</li></ul><p>How did we arrive at this number? As a rule of thumb, the pipeline in startup SaaS businesses usually comes from:</p><ul><li>Marketing: 40%</li><li>Cold-outreach/sales: 40%</li><li>Partnerships: 20%</li></ul><p>Hence,  $8,000,000 x 0.4 / $3,000 Annual Contract Value (ACV) = 1,066 customers before EOY.</p><p>This is where your website analytics comes in handy - e.g. last year, we know that we had 1,200,000 visitors on our SaaS website. Of them, 2,000 became paying customers - hence the conversion rate from visitor to customer is 2,000 / 1,200,000 =  0.16%. If we want to understand how many additional website visitors we need to generate 1,066 more customers, we calculate (1,066 / 16) x  10,000 = 666,250 additional visitors.</p><h3>How the heck do we get 666,250 new visitors?</h3><p>Now what? We need to dig deeper to get to specific marketing strategies and tasks to be able to execute on. Many companies use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectives_and_key_results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OKRs</a> to drill down sequential marketing objectives and specify key results that ladder back up to our overarching target. But I prefer a "effectiveness framework" used in many agencies instead.</p><pre>In 2005, the UK grocery chain Sainsbury's set up a big sales goal to recover profit over a period of declining sales. With a simple equation, agency BBDO calculated that the marketing portion of this sales goal would be achieved if they got each shopper to spend an extra £1.14 every time they shopped.<p>This led to the campaign 'Try Something New Today', encouraging each shopper to spend an extra £1.14 every time they shopped. Analysis had shown that customers were 'sleep-shopping' and in a rut with the things they buy and cook. By using TV, press, radio and in-store advertising, Sainsbury's gave its customers simple meal ideas, which encouraged them to try new things and spend more on their shopping. The success of this campaign has generated £550 million in sales over two years.</p></pre><p>This is a really great effectiveness case study where Sainsbury's managed to impact the bottom line using a clear marketing objective derived from their business objective. I recommend watching their short case study <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MopXVY7KswA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p>The idea of an effectiveness framework is to clearly map out what objectives you need to hit, what consumer behaviour change needs to happen and the role and tasks of comms you need to achieve.</p><p>For our API business, the beginning of an effectiveness map might look something like this:</p><p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/briefmix/1df3946c-4153-4c97-b2c4-71263cde026e_Screen+Shot+2023-08-18+at+10.23.35.png?auto=compress,format" alt="Briefmix Effectiveness Map"></p><p>You can view and download this template <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uFPNbZF8--Z4wH7Y3tyWaiir66umCMPaRvgv3uVJgwk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. We have also started to add KPIs next to the map which will be important to measure during the year to make sure our efforts are on track.</p><p>This is only the beginning to the map as we have yet to decide about the brand, marketing mix, tactics and channels. As we progress through the course, we will loop back to this map and fill it out further.</p><p>And there we have it! Before we can start filling out the rest of the framework with tactics, we need to have a good understanding of our brand and what we stand for. Let’s start by understanding why a third of Coca Cola's market value comes from its brand:</p><p><a href="https://briefmix.com/startup/create-new-brand">How do you define a brand? -&gt;</a></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Serde, a popular Rust (de)serialization&nbsp;project,&nbsp;has decided to ship its <em>serde_derive </em>macro as a&nbsp;precompiled binary.</p>
<p>The move has generated a fair amount of push back among developers who worry about&nbsp;its future&nbsp;legal and&nbsp;technical implications, along with a potential for supply chain attacks, should the maintainer&nbsp;account&nbsp;publishing these&nbsp;binaries be compromised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the Rust package&nbsp;registry, crates.io,&nbsp;<em>serde</em> has been downloaded <a href="https://crates.io/crates/serde" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">over 196 million times</a> over its lifetime, whereas the <em><a href="https://crates.io/crates/serde_derive" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">serde_derive</a></em>&nbsp;macro has scored&nbsp;more than 171 million downloads, attesting to the project's&nbsp;widespread circulation.</p>
<h2>Serde&nbsp;macro goes precompiled: there's no way to opt-out</h2>
<p>About three weeks ago, a Rust programmer using the Serde project in their application noticed something odd.</p>
<p>"I'm working on packaging serde for Fedora Linux, and I noticed that recent versions of <em>serde_derive</em> ship a precompiled binary now," <a href="https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/2538#issue-1825383332" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">wrote</a>&nbsp;Fabio Valentini, a Fedora Packaging Committee member.</p>
<p>"This is problematic for us, since we cannot, under no circumstances (with only very few exceptions, for firmware or the like), redistribute precompiled binaries."</p>
<p>Serde&nbsp;is a commonly used&nbsp;<em>ser</em>ialization&nbsp;and <em>de</em>serialization&nbsp;framework for Rust data structures that, <a href="https://serde.rs/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">according to its website</a>,&nbsp;is designed to conduct these operations "efficiently and generically."</p>
<p>"The Serde ecosystem consists of data structures that know how to serialize and deserialize themselves along with data formats that know how to serialize and deserialize other things," states the project's website. Whereas, "<a href="https://serde.rs/derive.html#using-derive" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">derive</a>" is one of its macros.</p>
<p>Valentini&nbsp;further&nbsp;inquired&nbsp;to the project maintainers, how were these new&nbsp;binaries "actually produced," and if it would be possible for him&nbsp;to recreate the binaries, as opposed to&nbsp;consuming precompiled versions.</p>
<p>David Tolnay, who is the primary Serde maintainer, <a href="https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/2538#issuecomment-1654783988" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">responded</a> with potential workarounds at the time. But, that's not to say that everyone is pleased.</p>
<p>Following an influx of comments from developers as to why the decision wasn't best suited for the project, Tolnay <a href="https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/2538#issuecomment-1682519944" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">acknowledged the feedback</a>, prior to closing&nbsp;the GitHub issue.</p>
<p>His justification for shipping precompiled binaries is reproduced in whole below.</p>
<div><p>"The precompiled implementation is the only supported way to use the macros that are published in <em>serde_derive</em>.</p><p>
If there is implementation work needed in some build tools to accommodate it, someone should feel free to do that work (as I have done for Buck and Bazel, which are tools I use and contribute significantly to) or publish your own fork of the source code under a different name.</p><p>
Separately, regarding the commentary above about security, the best path forward would be for one of the people who cares about this to invest in a Cargo or crates.io RFC around first-class precompiled macros so that there is an approach that would suit your preferences; <em>serde_derive</em> would adopt that when available."</p></div>
<p>BleepingComputer has approached Tolnay with additional questions prior to publishing.</p>
<h2>"First .NET's Moq and now this."</h2>
<p>Some Rust developers request that&nbsp;precompiled binaries be kept&nbsp;<em>optional&nbsp;</em>and separate from the original "serde_derive" crate, while others have likened the move&nbsp;to the <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/popular-open-source-project-moq-criticized-for-quietly-collecting-data/" target="_blank">controversial code change</a> to the Moq .NET project&nbsp;that sparked backlash.</p>
<p>"Please consider moving the precompiled serde_derive version to a different crate and default serde_derive to building from source so that users that want the benefit of precompiled binary can opt-in to use it," <a href="https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/2538#issuecomment-1661893000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">requested</a> one user.</p>
<p>"Or vice-versa.&nbsp;Or any other solution that allows building from source without having to patch serde_derive."</p>
<p>"Having a binary shipped as part of the crate, while I understand the build time speed benefits, is for security reasons not a viable solution for some library users."</p>
<p>Users&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/2538#issuecomment-1684708897" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">pointed out</a> how the change could impact entities that are&nbsp;"legally not allowed to redistribute pre-compiled binaries, by their own licenses," specifically mentioning government-regulated environments.</p>
<p>"...First .NET's Moq and now this," said Jordan Singh, an Australia-based developer, in a <a href="https://archive.is/Aqxco#issuecomment-1684657021-permalink" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">comment</a> that was later removed.</p>
<p>"If this is to force cargo devs to support a feature then this is terrible way around doing it. At-least give us reproducible binaries. I'm sick of devs of popular crates/libraries taking everyone hostage with absurd decisions."</p>
<p>Philadelphia-based Donald Stufft <a href="https://twitter.com/dstufft/status/1692705666593357909" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">cautioned against</a> the risks of getting into the business of "shipping binaries" on social media:</p>
<div>
<figure><img alt="Developer cautions against the move" height="221" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1164866/2023/Aug/rust-serde/tweet1.jpg" width="500"><figcaption><strong>Developer cautions against the "shipping binaries" business</strong></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Rust programmer Nathan West, who goes by <em>Lucretiel</em>, specifically <a href="https://twitter.com/Lucretiel/status/1692760873243160740" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">highlighted</a> the supply-chain risks posed by precompiled binaries, should the&nbsp;maintainer&nbsp;account get compromised:&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<figure><img alt="supply chain risk" height="245" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1164866/2023/Aug/rust-serde/tweet2.jpg" width="500"><figcaption><strong>Supply chain risks associated with shipping precompiled&nbsp;binaries</strong></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>"Is not this the exact way they'd go about it? Ship it silently as a semi-plausible change to how <em>serde</em> works, intransigently ignore all criticism of the decision," wrote West.</p>
<p>"This is *exactly* the reason that everyone has such a reflexive opposition to moves like this."</p>
<p>"Trust on the internet isn't perfect; we *don't* know that that's really [the maintainer]&nbsp;posting in GitHub. That's why we have layers and proxies of defense; sketchy sh*t is rejected because it's not worth the risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technologist&nbsp;Sanket Kanjalkar&nbsp;called the transition to ship&nbsp;binaries without a way of opting-out "<a href="https://twitter.com/sanket1729/status/1692698203572109355" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">a step backward</a>."</p>
<p>But, a security professional who goes by Lander, has <a href="https://twitter.com/landaire/status/1692688116925305176" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">a slightly different take</a>:</p>
<p>"This Rust drama about <em>serde_derive</em> shipping a precompiled binary is kind of funny," writes Lander.</p>
<p>"On one hand, I understand people's concern. On the other hand, who cares? nobody's reading proc macro <em>code/build.rs</em> code for every project they pull in anyways. An opt-out would be a good idea tho."</p>
<p>Whether you agree with the project's decision to serve its macros precompiled or not, it is a good practice&nbsp;to routinely inspect&nbsp;any source code and&nbsp;software binaries prior&nbsp;to incorporating these into your projects.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have posted this to four other Tesla related subreddits only to have them removed so hopefully this one sticks..</p>

<p>I have had a horrible experience with Tesla and their team in the past couple of days. My family purchased our new car a couple months ago and was enjoying it up until a few days ago when I tried to get the car into gear and it demanded that I input the password. Having not set up a password previously, I contacted Tesla about the issue. </p>

<p>While I was waiting to speak with a representative, I noticed that my car was no longer linked to my account on the app, nor could I log into my Tesla account. After waiting on hold for two hours, I was finally able to get through to a representative who informed me that I needed to contact Tesla Financial about this issue. I called the number provided immediately but they did not pick up as they were outside of working hours.</p>

<p>“Not a problem.” I thought. I’d call back again tomorrow and sort this out. I left my car in the parking lot at work overnight and had a family member pick me up and drop me off the next morning. While I’m working the next day, my boss informs me that there is a tow truck outside to tow my car. Confused, I went out to the parking lot and was told by the towing company that Tesla is repossessing my vehicle. </p>

<p>This is where my confusion grew. We had paid for the vehicle IN FULL at the time we picked it up from the dealership, but the towing company is just doing what tesla told them to do. so they took my car.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward, my father received a phone call from Tesla Financial and he asked them what was going on. They told him that Tesla had been trying to reach out to us multiple times through phone and email about a debt they have been attempting to collect on the car. </p>

<p>My father had been out of the country for the past couple months so any phone calls would not have reached him. He did not receive a single voicemail about this issue either. He looked through his emails and noticed that he did in fact receive only two emails on July 27 and July 28, stating that we had not yet paid for the car and that the full cost of the vehicle is still at large. These emails went ignored as he believed them to be a phishing attempt because we had already PAID IN FULL at the dealership. He also believed that Tesla could not have made such a huge mistake like this.</p>

<p>My father explained this over the phone but the representative did not budge. This Tesla representative was rude and unprofessional for the entire phone call—going so far as to yell at my father over the phone.</p>

<p>A different Tesla representative sent us an email that seemed to be a copy paste of what they had sent my father back in July and that this car is now being considered for repossession. I shot an email back explaining AGAIN that this car had been paid for in full already and that we have been very dissatisfied by how Tesla had been handling this situation.</p>

<p>Up until this point, we were under the impression that Tesla was repossessing our vehicle without any warning because the two emails they sent to us regarding this seemed to be a phishing scam. Again they left no voicemails about this either. </p>

<p>The Tesla representative then emailed back this statement:</p>

<p>“I am having the team fully post the funds of the cashier's check. I am redrafting the documents and title/lien to your name instead of [BANK]. I have attached documents. Once funds post I can then restore access to the vehicle and release title/lien to your name.”</p>

<p>Basically saying that they had the check this whole time but due to some internal oversight had not cashed it. And they came after us, accused us of not paying, and repossessed our vehicle. Not only that, they incorrectly had the title of our car under the bank’s name rather than our own.</p>

<p>The next day, we received another email stating that the car is now back under our name and it can be picked up from the tow yard. </p>

<p>No apology. No restitution. </p>

<p>My father emailed them back saying he was glad the issue was resolved but was disappointed that there was no restitution offered, not even an apology. </p>

<p>They then emailed back the equivalent of saying “well we did try to contact you about this.” </p>

<p>I shot back an email stating that we are frustrated because it seems like this was an internal accounting issue that we should not have been contacted about or been involved in, in the first place. </p>

<p>Now we find ourselves carless for four days and will have to go out of our way to pick up a car that was wrongly repossessed. </p>

<p>And still Tesla offers no apology, restitution, and no guarantee that they are taking steps to prevent anything like this from happening in the future.</p>

<p>EDIT: the car was paid for with a combination of card and CASHIER’S check. Cashiers check means the amount of money is withdrawn from the bank when it’s ISSUED not cashed. so no, we did not notice extra money sitting in our account because it had already been withdrawn.</p>

<p>UPDATE: we got the car back today and there is no damage to it. we have been talking about getting an attorney or at least taking this to small claims court but in the end the decision comes down to what my dad wants to do as he owns the car. </p>

<p>will probably not be updating again because i’m tired of thinking about this but we’ll see. i’m really upset with tesla and would return the car if i could.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Artwork created by artificial intelligence isn’t eligible for copyright protection because it lacks human authorship, a Washington, D.C., federal judge decided Friday.</p><p>Judge <bw-person data-terminal-id="15169224" data-id="00000161-7711-d8ae-adf9-ffb515750000" data-name="Beryl Alaine Howell">Beryl A. Howell</bw-person> of the US District Court for the District of Columbia agreed with the US Copyright Office’s decision to deny a copyright registration to computer scientist Stephen Thaler, who argued a two-dimensional artwork created by his AI program “Creativity Machine” should be eligible for protection. </p><p>The ruling is the first in the country to establish a boundary on the legal protections for AI-generated artwork, which has exploded in popularity with the rise of products like OpenAI Inc.'s ChatGPT and DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion.</p><p>Howell found that “courts have uniformly declined to recognize copyright in works created absent any human involvement,” citing cases where copyright protection was denied for celestial beings, a cultivated garden, and a monkey who took a selfie.</p><p>“Undoubtedly, we are approaching new frontiers in copyright as artists put AI in their toolbox to be used in the generation of new visual and other artistic works,” the judge wrote. </p><p>The rise of generative AI will “prompt challenging questions” about how much human input into an AI program is necessary to qualify for copyright protection, Howell said, as well as how to assess the originality of AI-generated art that comes from systems trained on existing copyrighted works. </p><p>But this case “is not nearly so complex” because Thaler admitted in his application that he played no role in creating the work, Howell said.</p><p>Thaler, the president and CEO of Imagination Engines, sued the office in June 2022 following its denial of his application to register the AI-generated art piece titled “A Recent Entrance to Paradise.”</p><p>His attorney, Ryan Abbott of Brown Neri Smith &amp; Khan LLP, said he plans to appeal the judgment. “We respectfully disagree with the court’s interpretation of the Copyright Act,” Abbott said.</p><p>The Copyright Office said in a statement that it believes the court reached the correct result and the office is reviewing the decision.</p><p>The office recently issued guidance on the copyrightability of works created with the assistance of AI, which attorneys said introduced <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/ai-copyright-guide-has-lawyers-asking-where-to-draw-the-line">additional murkiness</a> in the AI authorship debate.</p><p>The Copyright Office in February <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/ai-comic-art-dispute-leaves-copyright-protections-open-ended">granted</a> a limited copyright registration for an AI-assisted graphic novel, which attorneys said could crack the door open further to protect such works. </p><p>Thaler’s motion for summary judgment, which Howell denied in the Friday order, argued that permitting AI to be listed as an author on copyrighted works would incentivize more creation, which is in line with copyright law’s purpose of promoting useful art for the public.</p><p>“Denying copyright to AI-created works would thus go against the well-worn principle that '[c]opyright protection extends to all ‘original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium’ of expression,” Thaler argued in his <a href="https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/THALERvPERLMUTTERetalDocketNo122cv01564DDCJun022022CourtDocket/4?doc_id=X334L5RDNRF9EUPPB886AI13DKJ">motion</a>.</p><p>Register of Copyrights Shira Perlmutter, who leads the office, <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/ai-created-work-isnt-protectable-copyright-office-tells-judge">defended</a> the office’s decision to reject Thaler’s application on the grounds that it wasn’t created by a human. </p><p>“The Office’s conclusion that copyright law does not protect non-human creators was a sound and reasoned interpretation of the applicable law,” the agency wrote in its <a href="https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/THALERvPERLMUTTERetalDocketNo122cv01564DDCJun022022CourtDocket/4?doc_id=X334L5RDNRF9EUPPB886AI13DKJ">cross-motion</a> for summary judgment, which Howell granted Friday.</p><p>The Department of Justice represents the Copyright Office.</p><p>The case is <a href="https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/THALERvPERLMUTTERetalDocketNo122cv01564DDCJun022022CourtDocket/5?doc_id=X7E62VT5QQT84BRJVKSNVMDPLJV">Thaler v.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Eleven days ago, we sent these questions to Western Digital’s head of PR and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22291828/sandisk-extreme-pro-portable-my-passport-failure-continued">published them publicly</a> on <em>The Verge</em>: </p><div><ul><li>Why are these drives still on sale?</li><li>Will you offer free data recovery services to affected customers? When?</li><li>Are you proactively warning customers and retailers who have already purchased these drives that significant data loss is possible?</li><li>If not, why not?</li><li>What, exactly, is going wrong with these drives?&nbsp;</li><li>How did this happen?&nbsp;</li></ul></div><div><p>What’s the fuss? For months, the company has been laughably silent about how its pricey portable SanDisk Extreme SSDs <em>might lose all your data</em>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22291828/sandisk-extreme-pro-portable-my-passport-failure-continued">It happened to my colleague Vjeran Pavic <em>twice</em></a>. It happened <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/sandisk-extreme-ssds-are-still-wiping-data-after-firmware-fix-users-say/">to <em>Ars Technica</em></a>. It happened <a href="https://petapixel.com/2023/08/08/sandisk-portable-ssds-are-failing-so-frequently-we-can-no-longer-recommend-them/">to <em>PetaPixel</em></a>. </p></div><div><p>Months after our inquiries, Western Digital continues to sell these drives <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22291828/sandisk-extreme-pro-portable-my-passport-failure-continued#:~:text=broken%20state%20of%20the%20internet%20means%20Western%20Digital%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20have%20to%20work%20very%20hard%20to%20keep%20selling%20these%20drives">due to deep discounts, fake Amazon reviews, and issues with Google Search</a> that rank favorable results far higher than warnings about potential failures.  </p></div><p>We have now received a response from Western Digital head of PR Robin Schultz, but nothing about the company’s stance has changed. Schultz repeatedly refused to answer any of our questions. Her statement doesn’t even contain an acknowledgment of the issue and has no specific timeline for any real answers. </p><p>The only reason we’re printing Western Digital’s statement is so you can see it for yourself:</p><div><blockquote><p>In response to recent reports of concerns about specific Western Digital portable SSD products, we want to assure our valued customers that we are taking all measures necessary to address any product-related issues. We understand the significance of our products to our customers and we take these matters very seriously. We are conducting a comprehensive review to gain a thorough understanding of the issues.</p></blockquote></div><p>After getting the statement, we asked Schultz three times whether Western Digital would answer our questions. Each time, she deflected. She also wouldn’t provide any idea of when the company might share its conclusions — if ever.</p><p>There <em>is</em> one possible reason Western Digital is finally speaking up and yet saying nothing: the company just got sued. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/17/western_digital_sandisk_ssd_lawsuit/">As <em>The Register</em> reports</a>, California resident Nathan Krum has filed a prospective class action lawsuit, citing breach of contract, fraudulent and unfair business practices, and many other claims. Krum is suing over both the SanDisk Extreme drive itself and damages for any data lost. You can read the full complaint at the bottom of this story.</p><p>And that’s just lawsuit number one: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/sandisk-extreme-ssds-are-worthless-multiple-lawsuits-against-wd-say/">Ars Technica reports</a> there are two more. Three SanDisk SSD lawsuits in total, each seeking class-action status for the same failures. </p><div><p>Western Digital was already forced into <a href="https://www.wdrednasharddrivesettlement.com/">a class action settlement</a> over a previous questionable practice: in 2020, the company brazenly tried to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/05/western-digital-gets-sued-for-sneaking-smr-disks-into-its-nas-channel/">sneak SMR drives into its “WD Red” lineup</a> marketed for network-attached storage devices. The company <a href="https://www.bursor.com/result/western-digital-class-action-settlement/">paid $5.7 million</a> to settle those claims.</p></div><div><p>The company’s tricks didn’t end there: Western Digital’s NAS disks have started <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/13/23759368/western-digital-three-years-warning-synology-nas">triggering warnings even if there’s nothing wrong with a drive</a>, seemingly to scare people into buying new ones simply after three years have gone by.</p></div><p>I won’t be buying a Western Digital or SanDisk product anytime soon.</p><p><em><strong>Update, 12:25AM ET: Added that there are actually three lawsuits, not just one, against WD.</strong></em></p></div></div>]]></description>

							<p>Have you ever wandered into an old library or dusty bookshop and paused to breathe in that familiar vanilla-coffee-grassy scent wafting off the aged tomes? That nostalgic olfactory experience is thanks to a bouquet of chemical compounds.</p>
<p>Modern books smell different because of changes in manufacturing, while old books release distinctive <a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/what-are-volatile-organic-compounds-vocs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">volatile organic compounds</a> (VOCs) as they slowly decay. Scientists are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/13/scientists-preserving-books-smell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sniffing out these VOCs</a> to reveal secrets about a book’s age, condition, and history.</p>

<h3>The Chemistry of Paper</h3>
<p>Paper is made of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/cellulose-fiber" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cellulose fibers bound by lignin</a>, while inks and bindings add other organic compounds. Cellulose is a polymer made of long glucose chains, while lignin is a complex polymer found in plant cells.</p>
<p>Over time, light, heat, and moisture cause the paper and compounds to break down, releasing VOCs that vaporize into the air. The manufacturing process also affects the VOCs released as the book ages.</p>
<h3>Telltale Scents</h3>
<p>An almond scent comes from <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/240" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benzaldehyde</a> in the paper. <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Vanillin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vanillin</a>, the main compound in vanilla, is responsible for a sweet vanilla fragrance. <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ethylbenzene" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethylbenzene</a>, used in inks and paints, has a sweet plastic smell. <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/2-Ethylhexan-1-ol" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2-Ethyl hexanol</a>, found in solvents and scents, smells lightly floral.</p>
<p>New books use modern chemicals like hydrogen peroxide and alkyl ketene dimers, so they give off different VOCs. The VOCs can also indicate exposure to smoke, water damage, or other aging factors.</p>
<h3>Reading the Chemical Clues</h3>
<p>Scientists can analyze the VOCs from an old book to determine its age and condition. The mix of compounds can reveal if a book came from an early print shop versus a late 19th century press. They can also identify degradation and preservation needs.</p>
<p>Librarians and historians use VOC analysis to study collections and even match orphaned books with the libraries they came from based on chemical fingerprints. It provides clues to an old tome’s origins and secrets as it aged over decades or centuries.</p>
<h3>The Life Story in a Whiff</h3>
<p>So next time you get a whiff of an old book, take a moment to enjoy that aromatic time capsule. Its scent has a story to tell, echoing the people, places, and processes that brought an ancient text to you. With each sniff, we get a little closer to understanding our bibliophilic past.</p>

<p><strong>FAQs</strong></p>
<h2>Why do old books smell the way they do?</h2>
<p>Old books release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as they slowly decay over time. The specific VOCs depend on the paper, inks, and binding materials used, which give old books their distinctive scents.</p>
<h2>Do new and old books smell different?</h2>
<p>Yes, new books tend to smell more crisp and fresh, while old books have mustier, sweeter scents. This is because new book manufacturing uses different chemicals that produce different VOCs as they break down.</p>
<h2>What chemicals cause that nostalgic old book smell?</h2>
<p>Compounds like benzaldehyde, vanillin, ethylbenzene, and 2-ethyl hexanol are often responsible for old book scents. Benzaldehyde has an almond-like scent, vanillin smells like vanilla, ethylbenzene is sweet and plastic-y, and 2-ethyl hexanol is lightly floral.</p>
<h2>Can scientists learn about a book’s history from its smell?</h2>
<p>Yes, analyzing the volatile organic compounds released by a book can reveal details about its age, manufacturing origins, condition, and past exposure to elements like smoke or water. This helps determine preservation needs.</p>
<h2>How does paper decomposition create VOCs?</h2>
<p>Paper is made of cellulose and lignin. Over time, heat, light, and moisture cause these polymers to break down and release VOCs, which enter the air. The specific VOCs depend on the paper production process.</p>
<h2>Do libraries and museums use VOC analysis?</h2>
<p>Libraries and museums are beginning to use VOC analysis to identify preservation needs in collections. It can also help match orphaned books by chemical fingerprint to determine their original source library.</p>
