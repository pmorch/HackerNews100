            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.kodingkitty.com/blog/how-to-build-a-website/">https://www.kodingkitty.com/blog/how-to-build-a-website/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36591032">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
An innocent question <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/21-websites-for-free-illustrations-29a45232db" target="_blank">was posted</a> on IndieHackers the other day:
<span>"I'm asking what did you use to build your website"</span>.
    </p><p>
The question also had a second part.
So just to be fair, here it is in its entirety: <span>"I'm asking what did you use to build your website, I really love the design and feeling of kodingkitty."</span></p><p>
But this post is not about people loving our website.
Although we're obviously happy about that.
    </p><p>
Too lazy to read? <a href="#kittys-tool-chain">Check out Koding Kitty's simple toolchain</a>.
      </p><h2>The shocking truth</h2><p>
The question sparked an idea to write about the tech stack that KodingKitty team uses for its own web.
And we warn you beforehand: it's so simple that some of you might find it shocking.
    </p><p>
You have been warned.
    </p><h2>Hype is just a coincidence</h2><p>
Our tech stack has nothing to do with the current hype about lightweight or simplified web development.
Not everyone rides that wave, and that's fine.
    </p><p>
On the other hand, we believe that in many cases, "back to the roots" or "simplicity is the ultimate perfection" is a better solution for customers than convoluted web of overused frameworks and libraries.
    </p><p>
To put it another way, the solution we designed for our website and the current hype is just a coincidence.
Our stack is simple because we wanted something pragmatic with minimal friction for the developers.
    </p><p>
And even though we wanted Koding Kitty website to have a distinctive yet subtle design, it is important to mention that it could have been achieved in many other ways.
    </p><h2>Comparing options</h2><p>
Our website and the way it is built comes from our past experience.
    </p><p>
We had the chance to work with different web frameworks in the past.
We know this is a luxury not everyone has.
It has allowed us to compare different technologies and decide what works best for us.
    </p><p>
From the beginning we agreed to start with a static website.
After all, what does a kitty's web really need?
A front page, a showcase, a blog ... and probably not much more.
At least in the beginning.
    </p><h2>Our requirements</h2><p>
We set the following set of requirements:
    </p><ul><li>Fast website</li><li>Fast to develop</li><li>Inexpensive hosting</li><li>Minimal complexity</li></ul><p>
What are the options today to have a website with the above requirements?
    </p><h2>Wordpress (and similar CMS)</h2><p>
Nothing against WordPress, it's done a tremendous job for the internet but&nbsp;...<br>
...&nbsp;honestly, it's a bit overkill for our modest needs.
    </p><p>
We don't need to store our content in a database.
We don't need to deal with plugins.
We don't need a visual editor to write our content.
    </p><h2>No-Code</h2><p>
Yes, that's one area where there's a lot of the hype these days.
    </p><p>
But to be a web coder and use a no-code tool?
Seriously?
It sounds weird.
    </p><p>
We want to own our content.
We want to do whatever we want with our web.
We can code a website faster than we can build it in the no-code WYSIWYG editor.
    </p><p>
The last point is that such tool still requires initial (and then ongoing) learning.
    </p><h2>Frameworks</h2><p>
We have an experience with frameworks.
    </p><p>
But, did we want to do the whole setup?
Although it can be done quickly, we would end up with too many parts.
Like a database, configuration, libraries, admin, and so on.
Yes, it is a fully customizable solution, but we would end up with something that resembles WordPress.
    </p><p>
And that's not what we wanted.
    </p><h2>Jamstack (aka Site generators)</h2><p>
Static site generators look like a tempting option for our needs, don't they?
    </p><p>
Just pick a programming language, do some coding, press a button (or run a script) and voila&nbsp;...<br>
...&nbsp;your fast static site is generated.
    </p><p>
Unfortunately, Jamstack tools require an initial setup and an initial (and continuous) learning.
    </p><p>
We understand, that writing a blog in markdown is convenient, but taking all things into consideration we decided for simpler solution.
    </p><h2>KittyStack</h2><p>
Our solution is obvious, when you review our requirements (repeated below for your convenience):
    </p><ul><li>Fast website</li><li>Fast to develop</li><li>Inexpensive hosting</li><li>Minimal complexity</li></ul><p>
Let's discuss them one by one:
    </p><h2>Fast website</h2><p>
Is a static website fast?<br>
Yes, it is!
    </p><h2>Fast development</h2><p>
Now, you may be thinking: "If you're not writing your content in markdown, you're not using a fancy editor, then what are you using?"
    </p><p>
We write our content in HTML!
    </p><p>
Take a look at our website.
For the kind of posts we publish there, HTML is ideal.
We mix the text with HTML/CSS/JS widgets, so it makes sense to have a post written directly in HTML.
    </p><h2>Inexpensive hosting</h2><p>
Is hosting a static site inexpensive?
    </p><p>
It depends on the provider and all the bells and whistles you decide you need.
    </p><p>
We decided to go with the absolute minimum, because hosting static sites doesn't require a massive hardware setup.
    </p><p>
Mind you, Hetzner <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/webhosting" target="_blank">webhosting</a> starts at 2 EUR!
How crazy is that?
    </p><p>
And if you are worried that your site will not survive a massive spike in traffic - like when your post hits the front page of Hacker News - it probably will.
At least our site did.
    </p><h2>Minimal complexity</h2><p>
We insisted on minimal complexity, but some of our pages and posts have repeating patterns.
    </p><p>
While it is possible to use a copy+paste routine, it can quickly get out of control.
Using some form of loops would help a lot.
Also, the ability to include some blocks of code - like header, footer, and the alike - would be beneficial.
    </p><h2>Templating to the rescue</h2><p>
And so we come to the last piece of the puzzle.
    </p><p>
Meet <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/" target="_blank">Jinja</a> templates, which make our life much easier.
Jinja allows us to use loops, include files (navigation bar, footer, etc.) and much more.
    </p><p>
Plus, we didn't have to learn a new system as we were already using frameworks based on Jinja before.
    </p><h2 id="kittys-tool-chain">A simple toolchain</h2><p>
Now you might be wondering how we generate the final, static page.
    </p><p>
We use a short Python script with exactly 45 lines of code.
<span>Including comments and blank lines.</span></p><p>
In summary, this is the simple toolchain for building our web:
    </p><ul><li>Developer updates index.src.html</li><li>Watchdog.py detects the file change and ...</li><li>... renders Jinja template into index.html and ...</li><li>... calls <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/blog/standalone-cli" target="_blank">Tailwind CSS CLI</a> to generate styles.min.css.</li></ul><!-- Widget --><div><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="0.5" stroke="#ffffff" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path stroke="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M10 2l-.15 .005a2 2 0 0 0 -1.85 1.995v6.999l-2.586 .001a2 2 0 0 0 -1.414 3.414l6.586 6.586a2 2 0 0 0 2.828 0l6.586 -6.586a2 2 0 0 0 .434 -2.18l-.068 -.145a2 2 0 0 0 -1.78 -1.089l-2.586 -.001v-6.999a2 2 0 0 0 -2 -2h-4z" stroke-width="0" fill="currentColor"></path></svg><div><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="#ffffff" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path stroke="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M10.325 4.317c.426 -1.756 2.924 -1.756 3.35 0a1.724 1.724 0 0 0 2.573 1.066c1.543 -.94 3.31 .826 2.37 2.37a1.724 1.724 0 0 0 1.065 2.572c1.756 .426 1.756 2.924 0 3.35a1.724 1.724 0 0 0 -1.066 2.573c.94 1.543 -.826 3.31 -2.37 2.37a1.724 1.724 0 0 0 -2.572 1.065c-.426 1.756 -2.924 1.756 -3.35 0a1.724 1.724 0 0 0 -2.573 -1.066c-1.543 .94 -3.31 -.826 -2.37 -2.37a1.724 1.724 0 0 0 -1.065 -2.572c-1.756 -.426 -1.756 -2.924 0 -3.35a1.724 1.724 0 0 0 1.066 -2.573c-.94 -1.543 .826 -3.31 2.37 -2.37c1 .608 2.296 .07 2.572 -1.065z"></path><path d="M9 12a3 3 0 1 0 6 0a3 3 0 0 0 -6 0"></path></svg><p><span>watchdog.py</span><span>renders Jinja template</span><span>calls Tailwind CLI</span></p></div><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="0.5" stroke="#ffffff" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path stroke="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M10 2l-.15 .005a2 2 0 0 0 -1.85 1.995v6.999l-2.586 .001a2 2 0 0 0 -1.414 3.414l6.586 6.586a2 2 0 0 0 2.828 0l6.586 -6.586a2 2 0 0 0 .434 -2.18l-.068 -.145a2 2 0 0 0 -1.78 -1.089l-2.586 -.001v-6.999a2 2 0 0 0 -2 -2h-4z" stroke-width="0" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></div><p>
It's also important to mention following:
    </p><ul><li>During development, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server" target="_blank">Live Server</a> serves files and reloads them as they change.</li><li>When it's time to publish, the files are uploaded <span>manually</span> via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank">FTP</a>.</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>
Web development can be kept simple without sacrificing too much.
    </p><p>
In fact, it can be liberating to limit yourself to just a few options.
And based on what we've seen so far, many customers would benefit from having solutions that are faster, simpler and cheaper.
    </p><p>
But don't just take our word for it.
Take a look around the web and ask yourself: could the same result be achieved using a less complex tech stack?

<p>This is a problem many people who love doing creative stuff (writing, music, programming, painting, pottery, calligraphy, anything creative and original) will face:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>“This is good, why don’t you make money from it?”</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>As if the only value anything has is by how much dollars it makes.</p>



<p>You could create the most beautiful painting, the most moving music, the most engaging novel, but if you don’t have the big dolla’s in your bank account, you are a failure.</p>



<p>And all of it is complicated by the fact that, yes, like most creatives, I <em>do want</em> to make money from my writing. Maybe not millions, but a little would help. Especially when the day job is going shit, and you know the fantasy that online entrepreneurs sell:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Quit the day job! Start your own business! Don’t depend on one person for all your income! Blah blah blah! Now buy my book/course, so at least one of us can get rich.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>It doesn’t help with all these online “gurus” who claim you can make the big $$$ by selling anything (yes sir, ANYTHING!) online, if only you buy their expensive course.</p>



<p>One guru (and why name him, since they all do the same) says you can make money online (BIG MONEY!) even if you are selling things like crotchet kits or dog training. All you have to do is <em>(in thunderous manly voice)</em>:</p>



<p><strong>FOLLOW MY FORMULA!</strong></p>



<p>His formula was, in a nutshell: Create training courses and sell them to others, just as he was doing. And at least one of us made big money (<em>hint, it wasn’t me</em>).</p>



<p><strong>My story</strong></p>



<p>I loved writing fiction– novels, short stories, interactive fiction. At first, I would just self-publish them on Amazon, no care whether anyone bought them.</p>



<p>Then I joined a few writer groups, and they were all like “You need to market your work”.</p>



<p>And so I spent hours every week building my email list, running ads, asking for reviews (as you need them to sell books), blogs/podcasts.</p>



<p>I found the type of fiction that sells is in a few mainstream genres, and in series (so you write a dozen books, all with a hard-boiled detective, for example). That’s why every book nowadays is in a series because publishers (traditional and indie)have figured out this is the “formula” to success.</p>



<p>I like to experiment and play—one genre I love writing is comedy-horror. This is one of those super niche genres that have a few hardcore fans but isn’t mainstream. Think <em>Shaun of the Dead</em> in movies, or one of my favourite books <em>John Dies at the End.</em></p>



<p>Other books I wrote were supernatural detective series, a fantasy comedy (a teddy bear that solves crime). Now, there are books like these and sell (and where do you think I got ideas from?), but they are not mainstream.</p>



<p>If you want to make the big money, you at least have to try writing for the “market” or trying to write in a way that appeals to the mainstream, or at least a large number of people.</p>



<p>So that’s what I did. Why not? Everyone else was doing it. They were pasting screenshots of how much money they were making online in Facebook groups.</p>



<p>And while all the above I tried worked in the short term (and yes, it DOES work), soon I began to hate what I was doing and one day, I just couldn’t type anymore.</p>



<p>And one day, I couldn’t take it anymore. Couldn’t type one more word. Quit 2 years ago, after 7-8 years of writing.</p>



<p>Have tried to restart many times, but each time, I feel disgusted and quit.</p>



<p><strong>Trying to make money from your “passion” is hard</strong></p>



<p><em>Just follow your passion and you won’t have to work a day!</em></p>



<p>Sure, if your passion is online marketing or making WordPress sites for cash-rich, time-poor business owners.</p>



<p>When I was writing, I hit all the clichés about “passion”:</p>



<ul>
<li>I would be lost for hours in writing</li>



<li>I loved doing it</li>



<li>I did it for several years non-stop, including training to become better</li>
</ul>



<p>And yet, in spite of my passionate “passion”, I never made enough money to quit the day job. I followed my passion and all it gave my was wrist pain.</p>



<p>And it is a field where people make money— but like many other creative fields (music, sports, art), it’s a winner-take-all field. 5-10% of authors make 90% of the money. And that’s fine, I knew the statistics before I started.</p>



<p>But I was still hoping to make some money. To be honest, I do, but it’s never been more than a fancy night out each month.</p>



<p>I never cracked the Amazon algorithm; I never got 10,000 fans on Facebook; I never got a huge email list of people <em>Oh gosh! Just waiting to buy my book.</em></p>



<p>And in trying to hit these targets, I started hating what I was actually doing — writing.</p>



<p><strong>My advice is</strong>: If you love someone, do it for love, don’t always try to make money from it.</p>



<p>It all comes back to doing it for the love and accepting that perhaps this will always remain a hobby. Do it with a craftsman’s mindset, always improving for the sake of improving.</p>



<p>And don’t let anyone shame you if you don’t want to make money.</p>



<p><em>Note: I wrote this post 2–3 years ago, and it had been sitting on my hard drive since then.</em> <em>I have given up fiction writing, though my books are still online I don’t do anything to promote them, nor am I writing new ones. I wrote this post as a warning: If you love something, do it for the love and don’t let the Get-Rich-Types make you lose your focus.</em></p>

            <link>https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/pull/13392</link>
            <guid>36588240</guid>
            <pubDate>Tue, 04 Jul 2023 15:46:56 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/pull/13392">https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/pull/13392</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36588240">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
  <task-lists disabled="" sortable="">
    <div>
      


<h3 dir="auto">Motivation and Context</h3>
<p dir="auto">Block Cloning allows to clone a file (or a subset of its blocks) into another (or the same) file by just creating additional references to the data blocks without copying the data itself. Block Cloning can be described as a fast, manual deduplication.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Description</h3>
<p dir="auto">In many ways Block Cloning is similar to the existing deduplication, but there are some important differences:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Deduplication is automatic and Block Cloning is not - one has to use a dedicated system call(s) to clone the given file/blocks.</li>
<li>Deduplication keeps all data blocks in its table, even those referenced just ones. Block Cloning creates an entry in its tables only when there are at least two references to the given data block. If the block was never explicitly cloned or the second to last reference was dropped, there will be neither space nor performance overhead.</li>
<li>Deduplication needs data to work - one needs to pass real data to the write(2) syscall, so hash can be calculated. Block Cloning doesn't require data, just block pointers to the data, so it is extremely fast, as we pay neither the cost of reading the data, nor the cost of writing the data - we operate exclusively on metadata.</li>
<li>If the D (dedup) bit is not set in the block pointer, it means that the block is not in the dedup table (DDT) and we won't consult the DDT when we need to free the block. Block Cloning must be consulted on every free, because we cannot modify the source BP (eg. by setting something similar to the D bit), thus we have no hint if the block is in the Block Reference Table (BRT), so we need to look into the BRT. There is an optimization in place that allows to eliminate majority of BRT lookups that is described below in the "Minimizing free penalty" section.</li>
<li>The BRT entry is much smaller than the DDT entry - for BRT we only store 64bit offset and 64bit reference counter.</li>
<li>Dedup keys are cryptographic hashes, so two blocks that are close to each other on disk are most likely in totally different parts of the DDT.  The BRT entry keys are offsets into a single top-level VDEV, so data blocks from one file should have BRT entries close to each other.</li>
<li>Scrub will only do a single pass over a block that is referenced multiple times in the DDT. Unfortunately it is not currently (if at all) possible with Block Cloning and block referenced multiple times will be scrubbed multiple times.</li>
<li>Deduplication requires cryptographically strong hash as a checksum or additional data verification. Block Cloning works with any checksum algorithm or even with checksumming disabled.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">As mentioned above, the BRT entries are much smaller than the DDT entries.  To uniquely identify a block we just need its vdevid and offset. We also need to maintain a reference counter. The vdevid will often repeat, as there is a small number of top-level VDEVs and a large number of blocks stored in each VDEV. We take advantage of that to reduce the BRT entry size further by maintaining one BRT for each top-level VDEV, so we can then have only offset and counter as the BRT entry.</p>
<p dir="auto">Minimizing free penalty.</p>
<p dir="auto">Block Cloning allows to clone any existing block. When we free a block there is no hint in the block pointer whether the block was cloned or not, so on each free we have to check if there is a corresponding entry in the BRT or not. If there is, we need to decrease the reference counter. Doing BRT lookup on every free can potentially be expensive by requiring additional I/Os if the BRT doesn't fit into memory. This is the main problem with deduplication, so we've learn our lesson and try not to repeat the same mistake here. How do we do that? We divide each top-level VDEV into 64MB regions. For each region we maintain a reference counter that is a sum of all reference counters of the cloned blocks that have offsets within the region. This creates the regions array of 64bit numbers for each top-level VDEV. The regions array is always kept in memory and updated on disk in the same transaction group as the BRT updates to keep everything in-sync. We can keep the array in memory, because it is very small. With 64MB regions and 1TB VDEV the array requires only 128kB of memory (we may decide to decrease the region size in the future). Now, when we want to free a block, we first consult the array. If the counter for the whole region is zero, there is no need to look for the BRT entry, as there isn't one for sure. If the counter for the region is greater than zero, only then we will do a BRT lookup and if an entry is found we will decrease the reference counters in the entry and in the regions array.</p>
<p dir="auto">The regions array is small, but can potentially be larger for very large VDEVs or smaller regions. In this case we don't want to rewrite entire array on every change. We then divide the regions array into 128kB chunks and keep a bitmap of dirty chunks within a transaction group. When we sync the transaction group we can only update the parts of the regions array that were modified. Note: Keeping track of the dirty parts of the regions array is implemented, but updating only parts of the regions array on disk is not yet implemented - for now we will update entire regions array if there was any change.</p>
<p dir="auto">The implementation tries to be economic: if BRT is not used, or no longer used, there will be no entries in the MOS and no additional memory used (eg.  the regions array is only allocated if needed).</p>
<p dir="auto">Interaction between Deduplication and Block Cloning.</p>
<p dir="auto">If both functionalities are in use, we could end up with a block that is referenced multiple times in both DDT and BRT. When we free one of the references we couldn't tell where it belongs, so we would have to decide what table takes the precedence: do we first clear DDT references or BRT references? To avoid this dilemma BRT cooperates with DDT - if a given block is being cloned using BRT and the BP has the D (dedup) bit set, BRT will lookup DDT entry and increase the counter there. No BRT entry will be created for a block that resides on a dataset with deduplication turned on.  BRT may be more efficient for manual deduplication, but if the block is already in the DDT, then creating additional BRT entry would be less efficient. This clever idea was proposed by Allan Jude.</p>
<p dir="auto">Block Cloning across datasets.</p>
<p dir="auto">Block Cloning is not limited to cloning blocks within the same dataset.  It is possible (and very useful) to clone blocks between different datasets.<br>
One use case is recovering files from snapshots. By cloning the files into dataset we need no additional storage. Without Block Cloning we would need additional space for those files.<br>
Another interesting use case is moving the files between datasets (copying the file content to the new dataset and removing the source file).  In that case Block Cloning will only be used briefly, because the BRT entries will be removed when the source is removed.<br>
Note: currently it is not possible to clone blocks between encrypted datasets, even if those datasets use the same encryption key (this includes snapshots of encrypted datasets). Cloning blocks between datasets that use the same keys should be possible and should be implemented in the future.</p>
<p dir="auto">Block Cloning flow through ZFS layers.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note: Block Cloning can be used both for cloning file system blocks and ZVOL blocks. As of this writing no interface is implemented that allows for ZVOL blocks cloning.<br>
Depending on the operating system there might be different interfaces to clone blocks. On FreeBSD we have two syscalls:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=" ssize_t fclonefile(int srcfd, int dstfd);
 ssize_t fclonerange(int srcfd, off_t srcoffset, size_t length, int dstfd, off_t dstoffset);"><pre><code> ssize_t fclonefile(int srcfd, int dstfd);
 ssize_t fclonerange(int srcfd, off_t srcoffset, size_t length, int dstfd, off_t dstoffset);
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Even though fclonerange() takes byte offsets and length, they have to be block-aligned.<br>
Both syscalls call OS-independent zfs_clone_range() function. This function was implemented based on zfs_write(), but instead of writing the given data we first read block pointers using the new dmu_read_l0_bps() function from the source file. Once we have BPs from the source file we call the dmu_brt_addref() function on the destination file. This function allocates BPs for us. We iterate over all source BPs. If the given BP is a hole or an embedded block, we just copy BP. If it points to a real data we place this BP on a BRT pending list using the brt_pending_add() function.</p>
<p dir="auto">We use this pending list to keep track of all BPs that got new references within this transaction group.</p>
<p dir="auto">Some special cases to consider and how we address them:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The block we want to clone may have been created within the same transaction group as we are trying to clone. Such block has no BP allocated yet, so it is too early to clone it. In this case the dmu_read_l0_bps() function will return EAGAIN and in the zfs_clone_range() function we will wait for the transaction group to be synced to disks and retry.</li>
<li>The block we want to clone may have been modified within the same transaction group. We could potentially clone the previous version of the data, but that doesn't seem right. We handle it as the previous case.</li>
<li>A block may be cloned multiple times during one transaction group (that's why pending list is actually a tree and not an append-only list - this way we can figure out faster if this block is cloned for the first time in this txg or consecutive time).</li>
<li>A block may be cloned and freed within the same transaction group (see dbuf_undirty()).</li>
<li>A block may be cloned and within the same transaction group the clone can be cloned again (see dmu_read_l0_bps()).</li>
<li>A file might have been deleted, but the caller still has a file descriptor open to this file and clones it.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">When we free a block we have additional step in the ZIO pipeline where we call the zio_brt_free() function. We then call the brt_entry_decref() that loads the corresponding BRT entry (if one exists) and decreases reference counter. If this is not the last reference we will stop ZIO pipeline here. If this is the last reference or the block is not in the BRT, we continue the pipeline and free the block as usual.</p>
<p dir="auto">At the beginning of spa_sync() where there can be no more block cloning, but before issuing frees we call brt_pending_apply(). This function applies all the new clones to the BRT table - we load BRT entries and update reference counters. To sync new BRT entries to disk, we use brt_sync() function. This function will sync all dirty top-level-vdev BRTs, regions arrays, etc.</p>
<p dir="auto">Block Cloning and ZIL.</p>
<p dir="auto">Every clone operation is divided into chunks (similar to write) and each chunk is cloned in a separate transaction. To keep ZIL entries small, each chunk clones at most 254 blocks, which makes ZIL entry to be 32kB.  Replaying clone operation is different from the regular clone operation, as when we log clone operation we cannot use the source object - it may reside on a different dataset, so we log BPs we want to clone.<br>
The ZIL is replayed when we mount the given dataset, not when the pool is imported. Taking this into account it is possible that the pool is imported without mounting datasets and the source dataset is destroy before the destination dataset is mounted and its ZIL replayed.<br>
To address this situation we leverage zil_claim() mechanism where ZFS will parse all the ZILs on pool import. When we come across TX_CLONE_RANGE entries, we will bump reference counters for their BPs in the BRT and then on mount and ZIL replay we will just attach BPs to the file without bumping reference counters.<br>
Note it is still possible that after zil_claim() we never mount the destination, so we never replay its ZIL and we destroy it. This way we would end up with leaked references in BRT. We address that too as ZFS gives as a chance to clean this up on dataset destroy (see zil_free_clone_range()).</p>

<article data-postid="2347375719013220143">

<div id="post-body-2347375719013220143"><p>In September 2006, the mayor of São Paulo passed the so-called “Clean City Law" that outlawed the use of all outdoor advertisements, including on billboards, transit, and in front of stores. Within a year, 15,000 billboards were taken down and store signs had to be shrunk so as not to violate the new law. Outdoor video screens and ads on buses were stripped. Even pamphleteering in public spaces has been made illegal. Nearly $8 million in fines were issued to cleanse São Paulo of the blight on its landscape. Seven years on, the world's fourth-largest metropolis and South America’s most important city remains free of visual clutter and eye sore that plagues the majority of cities around the world.</p>  <p>When the law was passed, it triggered wild alarm among city businesses and advertisement groups. Critics worried that the advertising ban would entail a revenue loss of $133 million and 20,000 people would lose jobs. Others predicted that the city would look like a bland concrete jungle with the ads removed. </p>  <p><img title="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-2" alt="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-2" src="https://lh3.ggpht.com/-TYoPCASlqVo/UepisNtsvEI/AAAAAAAAqhk/elNkMuvwKDY/sao-paulo-billboard-ban-26.jpg?imgmax=800" width="790" height="526"></p>  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ndecam/6155859365/" rel="nofollow">Photo credit</a></p><p>"I think this city is going to become a sadder, duller place,” said Dalton Silvanom, the lone councilman to vote against the law, and who (unsurprisingly) is in the advertising business. “Advertising is both an art form and, when you're in your car or alone on foot, a form of entertainment that helps relieve solitude and boredom," Silvanom added.</p>  <p>Despite the forebodings, São Paulo’s economy didn’t run aground although the city did look alien and war-torn for a few months following the tear down. The breakneck speed at which the law was enacted caused the city to resemble a battlefield strewn with blank marquees, partially torn-down frames and hastily painted-over storefront facades.</p>  <p>In a survey conducted in 2011 among the city’s 11 million residents, 70 percent found the ban beneficial. Unexpectedly, the removal of logos and slogans exposed previously overlooked architecture, revealing a rich urban beauty that had been long hidden. “My old reference was a big Panasonic billboard,” said Vinicius Galvao, a reporter with Folha de São Paulo, Brazil’s largest newspaper, in an interview with NPR. “But now my reference is an art deco building that was covered [by the massive sign]. So you start getting new references in the city. The city’s now got new language, a new identity.”</p>  <p>Photographer <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tonydemarco" rel="nofollow">Tony de Marco</a> documented the transformation the city underwent in 2007 in a sequence of images published on Flickr. </p>  <p>Sao Paulo isn’t the only city to have banned outdoor advertisements. Bans on billboards exist in other parts of the world, such as Vermont, Alaska, Hawaii, and Maine in the US, as well as some 1,500 towns. In Europe, the Norwegian city of Bergen does the same and many others have imposed severe restrictions on billboards or declared no-billboard zones within the city.</p>  <p><img title="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-4" alt="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-4" src="https://lh3.ggpht.com/-ZM2pOpipWoU/Uepiu-a9viI/AAAAAAAAqhs/DXZ4oekG5K8/sao-paulo-billboard-ban-42.jpg?imgmax=800" width="790" height="592"></p>  <p><img title="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-5" alt="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-5" src="https://lh5.ggpht.com/-OX_nt4ucheU/UepiybZdBdI/AAAAAAAAqh0/EeLcZCyq6go/sao-paulo-billboard-ban-52.jpg?imgmax=800" width="790" height="592"></p>  <p><img title="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-6" alt="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-6" src="https://lh4.ggpht.com/-Qa4wXnNE_5w/Uepi1x86XZI/AAAAAAAAqh8/UaV1Tj-xkm8/sao-paulo-billboard-ban-62.jpg?imgmax=800" width="790" height="592"></p>  <p><img title="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-7" alt="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-7" src="https://lh4.ggpht.com/-FX6vTTY1s7g/Uepi30VO9JI/AAAAAAAAqiE/A9rEu2PB-sM/sao-paulo-billboard-ban-72.jpg?imgmax=800" width="790" height="592"></p>  <p><img title="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-8" alt="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-8" src="https://lh4.ggpht.com/-DJg66H-KPDs/UepjMO-lkSI/AAAAAAAAqiU/tWK9RNK3DQo/sao-paulo-billboard-ban-82.jpg?imgmax=800" width="790" height="592"></p>  <p><img title="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-9" alt="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-9" src="https://lh6.ggpht.com/-5VquaBRt4Vc/UepjQbTGZmI/AAAAAAAAqic/9ZulQL7gcMw/sao-paulo-billboard-ban-92.jpg?imgmax=800" width="790" height="592"></p>  <p><img title="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-10" alt="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-10" src="https://lh6.ggpht.com/-tzgz9EgoWMU/UepjTAWH4HI/AAAAAAAAqik/fXYFWJJp2po/sao-paulo-billboard-ban-102.jpg?imgmax=800" width="790" height="592"></p>  <p><img title="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-11" alt="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-11" src="https://lh5.ggpht.com/-6O3y2DllMlc/Uepj3lswdMI/AAAAAAAAqi0/Fr9XmPNQXMA/sao-paulo-billboard-ban-112.jpg?imgmax=800" width="790" height="592"></p>  <p><img title="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-12" alt="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-12" src="https://lh3.ggpht.com/-Pxw2cBLrBKA/Uepj8h96N1I/AAAAAAAAqi8/S9bWMXwQzg4/sao-paulo-billboard-ban-122.jpg?imgmax=800" width="790" height="592"></p>  <p><img title="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-13" alt="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-13" src="https://lh5.ggpht.com/-_2PgvPxP1Cs/UepkAZPhNzI/AAAAAAAAqjE/XEwdMvJ_q6o/sao-paulo-billboard-ban-132.jpg?imgmax=800" width="790" height="592"></p>  <p><img title="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-3" alt="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-3" src="https://lh3.ggpht.com/-8ylIbVYwavw/UepkDv9WeII/AAAAAAAAqjM/RC7mBOR6Np8/sao-paulo-billboard-ban-36.jpg?imgmax=800" width="790" height="592"></p>  <p>Sources: <a href="http://www.newdream.org/resources/sao-paolo-ad-ban">Newdream</a>, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2007-06-18/s-o-paulo-the-city-that-said-no-to-advertisingbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice">Businessweek</a>, <a href="https://www.adbusters.org/magazine/73/Sao_Paulo_A_City_Without_Ads.html">Adbusters</a>, <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/9963268">Economist</a></p>  </div>

Mozilla Firefox 115.0 official builds are now available for this notable update to this open-source web browser while also marking the new Extended Support Release (ESR) series.
</p><p>
Most prominent for Linux users of Firefox 115.0 is Intel graphics video decoding being enabled by default. Mozilla has finally blessed Intel graphics hardware with the open-source VA-API video decode stack to enable that hardware acceleration by default.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=intel-arc-nov&amp;image=intel_arc_0_med"></p>
<p>Also on the video acceleration front with Firefox 115 is now supporting Cisco's OpenH264 plug-in for platforms lacking H.264 video decoding otherwise.
</p><p>
Firefox 115 under Linux also now treats middle clicks on the new tab button as opening the xclipboard contents into the new tab. If the xclipboard contents is a URL it will open that URL otherwise it will seed the contents to the default search provider. Firefox 115 also allows undo and redo actions on password fields.
</p><p>
Firefox 115.0 also adds support for migrating payment methods saved in Chrome into Firefox, UI improvements for data importing from other browsers, and various other usability enhancements.
</p><p>
Grab Firefox 115 from <a href="https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/115.0/">Mozilla.org</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

</figure><p>Injecting ageing monkeys with a ‘longevity factor’ protein can improve their cognitive function, a study reveals.</p><p>The findings, published on 3 July in <i>Nature Aging</i><sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>, could lead to new treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p>It is the first time that restoring levels of klotho — a naturally occurring protein that declines in our bodies with age — has been shown to improve cognition in a primate. Previous research on mice had shown that injections of klotho can extend the animals’ lives and increases synaptic plasticity<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup> — the capacity to control communication between neurons, at junctions called synapses.</p><p>“Given the close genetic and physiological parallels between primates and humans, this could suggest potential applications for treating human cognitive disorders,” says Marc Busche, a neurologist at the UK Dementia Research Institute group at University College London.</p><p>The protein is named after the Greek goddess Clotho, one of the Fates, who spins the thread of life.</p><h2>Monkey memory tests</h2><p>The study involved testing the cognitive abilities of old rhesus macaques (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>), aged around 22 years on average, before and after a single injection of klotho. To do this, researchers used a behavioural experiment to test for spatial memory: the monkeys had to remember the location of an edible treat, placed in one of several wells by the investigator, after it was hidden from them.</p><p>Study co-author Dena Dubal, a physician-researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, compares the test to recalling where you left your car in a car park, or remembering a sequence of numbers a couple of minutes after hearing it. Such tasks become harder with age.</p><p>The monkeys performed significantly better in these tests after receiving klotho — before the injections they identified the correct wells around 45% of the time, compared with around 60% of the time after injection. The improvement was sustained for at least two weeks. Unlike in previous studies involving mice, relatively low doses of klotho were effective. This adds an element of complexity to the findings, which suggests a more nuanced mode of actions than was previously thought, Busche says.</p><h2>Unclear mechanism</h2><p>It is still unclear exactly how injecting klotho has this effect on cognition or why it lasts this long. Klotho itself cannot cross the barrier from blood to brain, and uncovering its mechanism is a matter of finding what intermediates are involved, explains Dubal. But this study “certainly gives us hope”, she says, “and there’s a very strong reason to jump into human clinical trials now”.</p><p>Gøril Rolfseng Grøntvedt, a neurologist at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, agrees that further work is needed to answer such questions. Grøntvedt and her team previously found that people with Alzheimer’s who have naturally higher klotho levels tend to experience less cognitive impairment than do those with lower levels<sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup>.</p><p>This raises the possibility that artificially increasing klotho might have beneficial effects. A better understanding of the protein’s mode of action will be “crucial” for realizing its clinical potential, Grøntvedt says.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Google has updated its privacy policy to state that it can use publicly available data to help train its AI models. The tech giant has changed the wording of its policy over the weekend and switched "AI models" for "language models." It also stated that it could use publicly available information to build not just features, but full products like "Google Translate, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/googles-bard-ai-is-getting-better-at-programming-160034882.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:1;pos:1;itc:0">Bard</a>, and Cloud AI capabilities." By updating its policy, it's letting people know and making it clear that anything they publicly post online could be used to train Bard, its future versions and any other generative AI product Google develops.</p>
<p>The tech giant has highlighted the changes to its privacy policy on its <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20221215-20230701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:2;pos:1;itc:0">archive</a>, but here's a copy of the pertinent part:</p>

<p>Critics have been raising concerns about companies' use of information posted online to train their large language models for generative AI use. Recently, a proposed class action lawsuit was <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/06/28/tech/openai-chatgpt-microsoft-data-sued/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:3;pos:1;itc:0">filed against OpenAI</a>, accusing it of scraping "massive amounts of personal data from the internet," including "stolen private information," to train its GPT models without prior consent. As <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-updates-privacy-policy-to-collect-public-data-for-ai-training/490715/#close" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:4;pos:1;itc:0"><em>Search Engine Journal</em></a> notes, we'll likely see plenty of similar lawsuits in the future as more companies develop their own generative AI products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Owners of websites that could be considered public squares in the digital age have also taken steps to either prevent or profit from the generative AI boom. Reddit has started charging for access to its API, leading third-party clients to <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apollo-and-other-popular-third-party-reddit-apps-have-shut-down-123149140.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:5;pos:1;itc:0">shut down</a> over the weekend. Meanwhile, Twitter <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-puts-strict-cap-on-how-many-tweets-users-can-read-each-day-182623928.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:6;pos:1;itc:0">put a restriction</a> on how many tweets a user sees per day to "address extreme levels of data scraping [and] system manipulation."</p></div></div>]]></description>

I’m an engineer and product manager, like many of you. In 2013, I landed my first job in Big Tech (at Google), and my career took off. Over the next 10 years, I moved into management and leadership roles, where I learned about how the sausage is made when it comes to interviews, offers, and talent assessments. Now, I’m a chief product officer, and&nbsp;I moonlight as a career coach to help people unlock outsized career opportunities.</p><p>My goal in sharing this Minimum Viable Interview Prep (MVIP) process is to arm you with the employer and interviewer perspective so that you can build confidence in your job search. I’m passionate about helping people with job searching because I know how much the right role can set you up for success in your career and financial life.</p><p>First rounds are designed to filter out candidates who are unlikely to be a contender for an offer.</p><p><span>Interviews are</span><em> very</em><span> expensive for employers (time, coordination, resources, opportunity cost). The singular goal of a first-round interview (from the employer’s perspective) is to determine if they want to invest in additional interviews with that candidate.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe24a39eb-70f0-4521-8536-7fc73f709c48_1408x1056.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe24a39eb-70f0-4521-8536-7fc73f709c48_1408x1056.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe24a39eb-70f0-4521-8536-7fc73f709c48_1408x1056.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe24a39eb-70f0-4521-8536-7fc73f709c48_1408x1056.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe24a39eb-70f0-4521-8536-7fc73f709c48_1408x1056.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe24a39eb-70f0-4521-8536-7fc73f709c48_1408x1056.png" width="1408" height="1056" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e24a39eb-70f0-4521-8536-7fc73f709c48_1408x1056.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1056,&quot;width&quot;:1408,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:183898,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe24a39eb-70f0-4521-8536-7fc73f709c48_1408x1056.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe24a39eb-70f0-4521-8536-7fc73f709c48_1408x1056.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe24a39eb-70f0-4521-8536-7fc73f709c48_1408x1056.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe24a39eb-70f0-4521-8536-7fc73f709c48_1408x1056.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>By the time you get to a first-round interview, you likely have already:</p><ul><li><p>Applied or been referred by an employee</p></li><li><p>Spoken to a recruiter or HR representative (phone screen)</p></li></ul><p>If you pass a first-round interview, the next step is often second rounds (another single interview), or even final-round interviews (three to six interviews back-to-back in one day or split over two days).</p><p><strong>Most first-round interviews in tech are:</strong></p><ul><li><p>30 minutes to 1 hour</p></li><li><p>on the phone or via video chat</p></li><li><p>with just one interviewer (not panel-style)</p></li><li><p>conducted by a hiring manager, peer, or another person familiar with the role</p></li></ul><p><strong>The standard time breakdown is typically:</strong></p><ul><li><p>10% intro</p></li><li><p>70% questions from the interviewer</p></li><li><p>20% questions from the candidate</p></li></ul><p><strong>For a 45-minute interview, this looks like:</strong></p><ul><li><p>3-5 minutes intros</p></li><li><p>35 minutes questions from the interviewer</p></li><li><p>5-7 minutes questions from the candidate</p></li></ul><p><strong>Most first-round interviews stick to behavioral questions</strong><span>, i.e. questions that ask you about your own experiences, like</span><em> “Tell me about a time when you had a conflict with a colleague.”</em></p><p><strong>Generally, the first-round interview scope isn’t comprehensive.</strong><span> Employers aren’t going to be able to fully assess your fit for the role/team/company in less than 60 minutes!&nbsp;</span></p><p><em>Note: It’s a bit of a hot take, but I advise people to run if a company gives you an offer at this stage. (Just imagine how undiscerning they will have been with your future peers as well!)&nbsp;</em></p><p>On-the-spot offers in tech are rare, but all of us who build products know that systems fail at the edge cases—few of you will get an offer in your first or second interview (and this is a good thing), but my advice is to walk away (or at least ask a lot of questions) if you get an offer on the spot.</p><p><strong>Common first-round interview question themes:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Your resume and online content (including expertise posts and thought leadership)</p></li><li><p>1-2 core competencies for the role (usually the P0s, not the P2s and P3s)</p></li><li><p><span>Culture fit (these can be direct questions, e.g. “</span><em>Describe your ideal team culture,” </em><span>or indirect assessments based on your behavior, mannerisms, or speech: what you say and how you say it)</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>Special cases</strong></p><p><em>Are you a software engineer or data scientist? </em><span>Your first-round interview will likely be a technical screen (coding or system design or experimental design). Note that the way you problem-solve and communicate are assessed, not just whether you arrive at a working solution!</span></p><p><em>Are you a PM?</em><span> Your first-round interview will likely focus more on product design, product sense/execution, and data analysis or estimation questions (PM core competencies).</span></p><p>It’s time to talk about tactics for interview preparation.&nbsp;</p><p>Now is a good time to introduce Minimum Viable Interview Prep (MVIP). Below is a quick summary of the approach, with links to dive deeper before your next interview.</p><p><strong>Know your digital footprint</strong></p><p>Anything and everything on the open web is fair game for an employer or interviewer to read and bring up in your interviews. This includes LinkedIn posts, Medium or Substack articles, GitHub, tweets, old blog posts, quotes in newspaper articles, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>A useful to-do list:</p><ol><li><p>Know what’s out there (about you or authored by you)</p></li><li><p>Assess whether it fits how you’d like to present yourself</p></li><li><p>Modify as needed to represent yourself as you’d prefer</p></li></ol><p>For example: If I were looking for a data science role, I’d want to spend a few hours organizing the Python code in my public machine learning GitHub repo. It was written under timeline duress (!) and needs some refactoring so I can put my best foot forward if someone skims the code.</p><p><strong>Know your (strategic and compelling) reasons for wanting this role</strong></p><p>When you go for an interview, you should assume the company is assessing at least two to four other people for the role. Like any competition, you want to get out front quickly and take the lead. One way to do this is to be clear and concise about why you want this job.</p><p>Generally, avoid reasons that revolve around work hygiene or professional conveniences, e.g. compensation, short commute, remote work. This advice may seem obvious, but yes, people bring these up often. Don’t be one of them.</p><p>Avoid reasons that sound like complaints about your current or past employer, e.g. “better company,” “smarter colleagues,” “kinder boss,” “escaping a toxic culture.”</p><p>Stick to reasons that:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p>convey what you bring to the role (the compelling ones for the employer)</p></li><li><p>explain how this role will accelerate your career (the strategic reasons)</p></li></ol><p><span>You don’t need 10 reasons. One single, decisive reason will do: </span><em>“I’ve spent eight years building large-scale, distributed systems for products used by about 100 million users. An exciting and progressive step for me would be to build similar technologies for the billion-user scale.”</em></p><p><strong>Know the role (map it)</strong></p><p>One of the oldest sales tricks in the book is a tactic called “mirroring.” It’s a psychological concept that involves physically and verbally doing what the other person is doing. People are comfortable with their own mannerisms. When you mirror them, you make them comfortable and subconsciously make them feel you are like them.</p><p><span>You can use mirroring in your interview process. How? Use </span><em>their</em><span> language when describing </span><em>your</em><span> experiences.</span></p><p><strong>How to do this (interview pre-work)</strong></p><ol><li><p>Paste the job description into a doc, then highlight keywords and concepts.</p></li><li><p><span>Put the keywords into a table (one row per keyword or concept). Then add a column to the right. </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16rMkstp5LsN99TEGALCBE4_bM7KqxpOW35swrIRzyD8/copy" rel="">Here’s a template to get you started</a><span>.</span></p></li><li><p>In the right column, write down parts of your experience that map to that concept.</p></li><li><p>Read this before your interview.</p></li><li><p>In the interview, when you talk about your experience (right column), use their language (left column) to explain what you did.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

Yet there’s more to it…</p><p>Behavioral interview questions were invented 50 years ago, in the 1970s. Studies quickly found that these questions were 55% more effective at predicting on-the-job performance than the prevailing interview questions at the time. They took the business world by storm and became the de facto interview technique. Today, they are used extensively in tech interviews (by my estimate, more than 60% of interview questions are behavioral). Amazon actually sends candidates a STAR primer before their interviews!</p><p><span>But it’s been half a century, and behavioral question formats </span><em>have</em><strong> </strong><span>evolved. Your approach to answering them needs to evolve too.</span></p><p>In tech, I see 3 main formats for behavioral questions:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Pure </strong><span>— “Tell me about a time when…”&nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Situational </strong><span>— “Put yourself in this situation; what would you do?”</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Theoretical </strong><span>— “What’s your general approach to doing X?”</span></p></li></ol><p><span>All of them ask what you </span><strong>have done</strong><span> or what you </span><strong>would do </strong><span>(in a situation) or what you </span><strong>generally do</strong><span>, to extrapolate and predict on-the-job performance. To interview effectively in tech today, you need to know how to answer each of these questions.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Below is a primer you can use to answer each type of behavioral interview question.</p><p><strong>Why they ask: </strong><span>Understanding how you’ve behaved in the past can be used to extrapolate how you might perform in this role</span></p><p><strong>What they ask: </strong><span>Share a specific career experience from the past</span></p><p><strong>How to respond:</strong><span> Start with</span><strong> </strong><span>STAR, then add two improvements.

Half of the battle is preparing well and showing up to answer </span><em>the interviewer’s</em><strong> </strong><span>questions; the other half is asking </span><em>them</em><strong> </strong><span>questions that get them thinking (and make you stand out).</span></p><p>We all want to work with exceptional colleagues who work hard, get things done, and push us to greater heights. Interviewers are exactly the same. You need to get them thinking (in a good way).</p><p>Formulate questions that are interesting and thoughtful, and you’ll end the interview on a high note and possibly put yourself in the lead.</p><p>3 steps to formulating great questions for interviewers:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Define the signals you need (to determine if you want the role). </strong><span>Bring questions whose answers are actually important to you. Anyone can grab a question from a listicle. Only you can ask questions that will answer your open questions about the role.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Do your research. </strong><span>On the industry, company, competitive landscape, team/product, and even the interviewers. Look for trends, competitive landscape changes, and news. You can find these on consulting firm dossiers, VC thought-leadership white papers, the company’s website, Yahoo Finance, and competitive landscape engines like G2 and Capterra.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Formulate questions</strong><span> that highlight that you’ve done your homework and that give you the signal you want.</span></p></li></ol><p>You can do this in an hour or two, and it’s well worth the investment. You can even reuse some of these “first-round” questions in later interviews to get diverse perspectives from the full panel.</p><p>An example of a high-signal question that one of my coaching clients formulated for an interview at Cruise, a self-driving car company: </p><blockquote><p><em>In your three years at Cruise, the privacy world has expanded, with the CCPA and other states discussing more regulations for consumer privacy—how has this impacted the nature of your work, and what do you see as the biggest challenge or area of focus as Cruise continues to expand to new geos?</em></p></blockquote><div><figure><a target="_blank"

      <div><p>Children will soon be prevented from bringing mobile phones into Dutch classrooms. Sources close to the Cabinet confirmed that schools will have until October 1 figure out how they can arrange the restriction on their own. If that fails, national rules may be introduced to restrict the use of telephones in schools.</p>

<p>Unnamed sources also confirmed the story to ANP, after it was first reported by AD and RTL Nieuws.</p>

<p>Smartphones may still be used if they are needed for class, or if there is a medical need. One example of the latter is if a student with diabetes needs to measure sugar levels.</p>

<p>Schools and teachers have been asking for rules to restrict the use of mobile phones in the classroom for some time. The debate about this issue gained momentum at the end of last year when CDA Member of Parliament René Peters advocated on behalf of a ban. The largest opposition party in the Tweede Kamer, PVV, has been outspoken in favor of a ban for an extended period, and has joined forces with the CDA, a coalition party.</p>

<p>Initially, the plea from the CDA and PVV was warmly received in the Tweede Kamer, the lower house of Parliament, with a degree of support from two other coalition parties. These include Prime Minister Mark Rutte's VVD, and the smallest party in the coalition, ChristenUnie. However, former Education Minister Dennis Wiersma and the two parties thought it was better for the schools themselves to set limits in this regard.</p>

<p>Gradually, the number of supporters seemed to increase. A large group of teachers appeared to support the proposal, teachers union AOb announced after commissioning a poll.</p>

<p>Due to persistent signals from teachers that they are unable to keep smartphones out of the classroom on their own, Wiersma left the door open at the beginning of this year to examine the policy. He promised discuss the issue with schools and said he would be open to a ban if there was a great need for it.</p></div>

  6/23/2000 - <b>Lack of Updates</b><br>
  Sorry about the lack of updates since early May.  May and June have been extremely busy for me, and I haven't been able to give the site the attention it needs and deserves.  I am doing some minor list updates, and have been redesigning the site to make it a little easier to navigate.  This isn't my best design work, I promise.  I made the site like this as function over form to start.  I am gathering contact people for the first petition email.  I have been talking with the people at Sendmail, Inc, and that have been interested in seeing what you folks have to say about their decision to only support Red Hat.  I saw something funny yesterday... Dell's online ordering system will let you buy "Linux 6.2"...  I was thinking this must be some new distribution or maybe they got the kernel version wrong, but then a light went off... Silly me, they meant Red Hat 6.2!  Doh!<p>
  5/2/2000 - <b>Minor Updates</b><br>
  I have added a few companies to the various lists, made some spelling corrections, and added the Petition Distribution Breakdown.  Thanks to everyone who has sent emails concerning corrections, suggestions, opinions, etc... Keep them coming.  I will be doing some major updates in the near future.</p><p>
  4/28/2000 - <b>Update #2</b><br>
  Thanks to Tim Riker for pointing out that RPM is not RedHat Package Manager but rather RPM Package Manager.  Seems a bit recursive if you ask me ;-) But on the official <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815063125/http://www.rpm.org/RPM-HOWTO/index.html#INTRO" target="_new">RPM FAQ</a> It does list it as such.  Seems like traffic is dying down a little.  I guess it's a good thing, in that we'll have less people trying to be distruptive.  I have about 5-10 vendors to update, and hope to do so this weekend.  Thanks for stopping by.</p><p>
  4/28/2000 - <b>Heavy Traffic and more</b><br> 
  As you can imagine with over 30,000 people visiting us in the last 12 hours, we have gotten a log of email.  If you have sent us mail, and you haven't gotten a reply, we will do our best to reply to all the emails sent.  From what we have read, there have been some very good suggestions, additions to our list, and outright anger to to what we're doing.  A lot of email has been sent about VA Linux, and our placing them on the Red Hat only list.  I know they support the development of Debian and run Debian on their web server, but when you buy something through their web site, currently you can only get Red Hat.  I have a call in to them to confirm that we're not just blind and not seeing other distributions.  Thank you for your zeal in response to our efforts.  On a more disappointing side, someone thought it would be cute to write a program to continually vote for their favourite distribution, which is why the poll went away.  Please check back often as we are updating the page through out the day.</p><p>
  4/27/2000 (5:00pm Update) - <b>We've been /.'ed</b><br>Well we have just been posted on Slashdot, and from the comments I am seeing, I only ask that you Read before you Roast, as it seems many don't understand the context of the domain name, and the name of our Effort.</p><p>
  4/27/2000 - <b>Linux.Com, Geeknews.org Report on RedHatIsNotLinux.org</b><br>Thanks to Linux.com and Geeknews.org for reporting on our efforts here.  I think it shows a true effort to show journalistic integrity on the part of Linux.com to list us, as VA is on our Red Hat Only List.  Kudos to them!</p><p>
  4/18/2000 - <b>redhatisnotlinux.org seeks volunteers</b><br>We are currently looking for volunteers to help compile our different lists.  If you are interested in helping us out, please let us know at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815063125/mailto:info@redhatisnotlinux.org">info@redhatisnotlinux.org</a>.</p><p>
  4/16/2000 - <b>redhatisnotlinux.org goes live</b><br>In an attempt to gain support for other distributions of GNU/Linux, redhatisnotlinux.org is established.  We're currently filling out our database of products that support Linux, both distribution specific and distribution non-specific.

  <u><b><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></b></u></p><blockquote>
  <b>If this is not an Anti-Red Hat Linux site, what is it?</b><br>
  This is an attempt to call attention to the fact that companies who are writing commercial applications for Linux are ignoring part of the professional GNU/Linux community, which does not use Red Hat Linux.<p>
  <b>What do you mean "Red Hat Is Not Linux"</b><br>
  The easiest way to explain this is to create some definitions or premises, and then come up with a result:</p><p>
  Linux, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815063125/http://everything.slashdot.org/everything.pl?sid=&amp;lastnode=&amp;node=linux">defined</a> by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815063125/http://cmdrtaco.net/">CmdrTaco</a> of Slashdot is: 
 "the GNU license operating system created by Linus Torvalds and the rest of the internet. Unix-like and free, it powers power systems maintained by power users."</p><p>  
  Linux as we define it is the kernel of the GNU/Linux OS and various Distributions.</p><p>
  A Distribution of the GNU/Linux OS, of which Red Hat is one (and the most popular in the media), is the packaging of the Linux kernel, utilities, and programs to make a usable operating system, which can be installed on any number of computers.</p><p>
  This is how we first of all derive that 1) Red Hat != GNU/Linux, and 2) Red Hat is a Distribution of GNU/Linux.</p><p>
  Because of the fragementation of commands, security methodologies, package management, and file layouts among distributions, we feel it is not in the best interest of GNU/Linux to consider one Distribution, and its way of doing things as "Linux."</p><p>
  <b>What do you hope to accomplish by this?</b><br>
  Better support by commercial vendors for GNU/Linux, not just Red Hat Linux and support for GNU/Linux hardware platforms other than Intel based chipsets (PPC, Alpha, etc).</p><p>
  <b>Why do you think that commercial vendors ignore GNU/Linux?</b><br>
  A majority of applications being written today are not distribution independent.  Not only are companies developing solely for Red Hat Linux, they are not aware that other distributions exist.</p><p>
  <b>I'm not convinced, but how do you expect your goals to be accomplished?</b><br>
  Our main goal is to point out incompatibilities between distributions, as well as to provide a petition facility for non-Red Hat users to voice their distress with the continued trend of software that only supports Red Hat.  By doing so, we hope that enough attention can be created for our cause that commercial vendors would consider support for Linux as a whole, not just Red Hat Linux, including all major distributions and binary platforms (x86, PPC, Alpha, etc).
  </p><p><b>What's With This GNU/Linux Stuff Anyway?</b><br>
  There is a political issue in the Linux community as to the relevance of GNU to Linux.  Our position is that without GNU and their tools such as GCC, Linux would not be a mainstream operating system.  We feel that indeed GNU has done more for Linux than Red Hat has, as I am sure Red Hat themselves would admit.  We refer to GNU/Linux in respect to the importance and impact GNU has on Linux.

  We are currently gathering information on different community efforts to standardize Linux Distribution structure.  We feel that companies can do various things to insure support for all major distributions of Linux including:<ul>
 <li>Outsourcing Technical Support to Organizations like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815063125/http://www.linuxcare.com/">LinuxCare</a></li>
 <li>Providing non-distribution specific binary releases (glibc-2.0, shadow passwords, glibc-2.1, shadow passwords, glibc-2.0 PAM, glibc-2.1 PAM) - C2Net does an excellent job of this with their distributions of Stronghold.
 </li><li>Provide RPM, DEB, and  Tarball distribution of Binary Applications.</li>
 <li>Create a Media Awareness kit to avoid sterotyping of different distributions as "LINUX."  We would be happy to spearhead this, but would love some help in creating it from professional writers and media people.</li>
 <li>VA Linux, or another company with the same ability, should setup a commercial server farm of different distributions, similar to VA's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815063125/http://www.valinux.com/about/news/releases/030700.html" target="_new">SourceForge<sup>TM</sup> CompileFarm</a>, for comercial entities to build binary distributions for ALL MAJOR Linux distributions.</li>

Most modern concrete is a mix of Portland cement and aggregates—materials such as sand or crushed stone that are not intended to chemically react over time. Roman concrete was made from volcanic ash, lime (calcium oxide), and seawater. <a href="https://als.lbl.gov/learning-from-roman-concrete/">Previous ALS studies</a> showed that the lime, upon exposure to seawater, reacted with the volcanic ash to produce aluminous tobermorite (Al-tobermorite), a layered mineral that forms fine fibers and plates.</p>
<p>To better understand the longer-term chemical processes in the concrete, researchers studied samples from ancient pier and breakwater sites using a variety of techniques, including electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. At ALS <a href="https://als.lbl.gov/beamlines/12-3-2/">Beamline 12.3.2</a>, they used x-ray microdiffraction to trace the complex sequences of crystal growth at the micron scale. The results indicate that Al-tobermorite and a related zeolite mineral called phillipsite continue to form over millennia as seawater percolates through the massive structures, reinforcing the cementing matrix in a kind of regenerative process that strengthens the concrete.</p>
<p>The researchers suggest that a reformulated recipe for Roman concrete could be tested for applications such as seawalls and other ocean-facing structures, and may be useful for safeguarding hazardous wastes, since Al-tobermorite has special cation-exchange properties. The work ultimately could lead to a wider adoption of concrete manufacturing techniques with less environmental impact than modern cement manufacturing processes, which require high-temperature kilns. These are a significant contributor to industrial carbon dioxide emissions, which add to the buildup of greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere.</p>

</p>
<p>I've spent too much of my professional life trying to build a better means of authentication.</p>
<p>For a while I was fixated on Magic Links, then I built a few prototypes of authentication using a combination of token passing and TOTP. And finally, I built a storage-less password manager (another story for another day). When proposals for systems like WebAuthn or Apple Passkeys were published I got excited. To see the world move away from the dated and insecure email/password combo would have really made my day.</p>
<p>But after a while I lost my fervour. There was a lack of implementation of these strong password-less authentication methods across web-services and apps. There was no transition. Also, my opinions around authentication changed...somewhat.</p>
<p>I had an article pop up on my feed recently titled "<a href="https://sec.okta.com/articles/2020/04/webauthn-great-and-it-sucks" target="_blank">WebAuthn is great and it sucks</a>" which describes the problem succinctly. While the tech is great, the problem is that nothing supports these new-fangled methods of authentication. I've run into a few other problems as well:</p>
<ol>
<li>Multi-devicing for authentication is a poor user experience. Even having to go click a link in your mailbox sucks.</li>
<li>People don't have their phone on them all the time (and some don't even have a smartphone).</li>
<li>New users don't understand these methods of authentication.</li>
<li>They're generally much more complicated to implement than a basic email/password combo.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>As a side note, I'm not a fan of single sign-on using Twitter/Google/Facebook due to the inability to migrate to a different service if need be. If Twitter locks you out of your account you're locked out of all your connected services as well. This is a broader topic, but I just wanted to touch on it before continuing.</em></p>
<p>Passwords are simple and affordable. We were using them prior to computers ("Open sesame!") and their understandability transferred easily. "But wait!" you say. "Aren't passwords insecure and easy to compromise?". Well yes...if managed poorly.</p>
<h4 id="let-s-explore-the-common-pitfalls-of-passwords">Let's explore the common pitfalls of passwords:</h4>
<ol>
<li>People can't remember passwords for their dozens of services.</li>
<li>Due to #1 people tend to re-use passwords, which makes one compromised service a more wide-spread problem.</li>
<li>People can have their passwords stolen (generally also due to #1 since they write them down or store them insecurely).</li>
<li>Services can have their user's passwords stolen if not stored as a hash (this is a solved problem though, services need to do better).</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that all of these problems are solved by fairly simple password hygiene.</p>
<p>I personally have one obnoxiously long and complicated password for my password manager, but then all of my other passwords are random lengthly strings which are impossible to guess.</p>
<p>I don't ever see them.</p>
<p>The passwords also aren't re-used, which solves #2 and my login flow is a super convenient fingerprint scan on both my phone and my laptop. And if I have to manually enter my password on a different device (which is very rare) I can easily pull up my password on my password manager and type it in.</p>
<p>Not only does a good password manager make people safer, it makes logins much easier since you don't have to remember "which password I used for this service", then follow the "forgot password" flow.</p>
<p>I guess the point I'm trying to make here is that the problem with passwords is password hygiene, not with the method itself.</p>
<p>When ebola was wreaking havoc in Central Africa the most effective intervention was to implement a culture of hand-washing. The UN send healthcare workers out to cities, towns and villages armed with plastic basins and soap, but most importantly, knowledge. It was an effective intervention and the culture of hand-washing persists to this day.</p>
<p>Password hygiene is imperative for our digital world. Fact is that even if we create the perfect new authentication method, passwords will persist on the vast majority of services. If it ain't broke...</p>
<p>Finally, when sharing passwords, it is important to do so securely. Slack is not a secure channel for these kinds of things. I've <a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/thinking-about-passwords/" target="_blank">written</a> about this before and built out a completely free <a href="https://horuspass.com/send/" target="_blank">service</a> to share passwords and API keys securely, but any good password manager should have similar functionality.</p>
<h4 id="recommendation-time">Recommendation time:</h4>
<p>If you're an Apple user, then the built in Apple password manager is probably the best solution for you. It's close to perfect since it allows biometric authentication, syncs between your devices, and is well integrated into their products.</p>
<p>Alternatively, there are also a bunch of great apps that have similar functionality. <a href="https://1password.com/" target="_blank">1Password</a> is a good choice. So is <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/" target="_blank">Dashlane</a>. There are others.</p>
<p>Good passwords combined with an authentication app for 2FA like <a href="https://authy.com/" target="_blank">Authy</a> or Google Authenticator are great security. You'll probably never have an issue. On this note, SMS 2FA is bad. Not only are SIM-swap scams prevalent and fairly easy to execute, but it is also a fragile system and breaks easily ("Didn't receive the SMS? Click here to retry.").</p>
<p>On top of that, SMS isn't universal. My bank only supports SMS 2FA so while I'm travelling I'm effectively cut off from certain functionality. I hate it and have tried to change it, but banks move slowly.</p>
<p>It's important for us to get this right. If you have parents (or grandparents) who aren't particularly tech-savvy, sit them down for an afternoon and teach them about password hygiene. Let's create a better authentication culture. It will keep everyone safer.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/03/jolly_roger_telephone_company/">https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/03/jolly_roger_telephone_company/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36583969">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Every week there seems to be another cynical implementation of AI that devalues the human experience so it is with a breath of fresh air that we report on a bedroom venture that uses GPT-4 technology to frustrate telemarketers.</p>
<p>"Fight back against annoying telemarketers and evil scammers!" the Jolly Roger Telephone Company rails on its <a target="_blank" href="https://jollyrogertelephone.com/">website</a>. "Our robots talk to telemarketers so humans don't have to!"</p>
<p>While no one can put a price on slamming the phone down on a call center worker, some among us might get a perverse joy out of listening to them squirm under the non sequiturs of AI. And it seems to be working for Jolly Roger, which has thousands of customers subscribed for $23.80 a year.</p>

    

<p>The company has a <a target="_blank" href="https://jollyrogertelephone.com/our-robots/">number of bots</a> at its disposal all with unique voices and quirks that makes them utterly infuriating to speak to from the original Jolly Roger, based on the voice of Californian founder Roger Anderson, to distracted mother Salty Sally, who keeps wanting to talk about a talent show she won, to feisty senior citizen Whitey Whitebeard and more. Samples of toe-curling conversations are all over Jolly Roger's website.</p>

        


        

<p>"Oh jeez, hang on, there's a bee on me, hang on," Jolly Roger tells one scammer. "There's a bee on my arm. OK, you know what? You keep talking, I'm not gonna talk, though. You keep talking, say that part again, and I'm just gonna stay quiet because of the bee."</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/01/microsoft_github_copilot/">Microsoft and GitHub are still trying to derail Copilot code copyright legal fight</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/28/microsoft_openai_sued_privacy/">Microsoft, OpenAI sued for $3B after allegedly trampling privacy with ChatGPT</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Sprinkle in gratuitous salvos of "Suuuure" and "Mhm" and "Sorry, I was having trouble concentrating because you're EXACTLY like somebody I went to high school with so, sorry, say that part again." Five minutes later you have a cold caller pulling their hair out and hanging up.</p>
<p>Here's Salty Sally in action:</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://youtu.be/dtO7jvS-pxA?t=39" data-media="x-videoplayer">Youtube Video</a>
</p>

        

<p>Customers provide the phone numbers they want to protect and the subscription activates immediately. Users login to the website where they can set up whichever bot or bots they want to employ. Then, when a telemarketer calls, the user is able to merge the call with a specified or random bot. The customer can then listen to the fruits of their labor in Jolly Roger's "Pirate Porthole."</p>
<p>YouTubers like Kitboga have made a name for themselves by infuriating and hacking computer-based scammers in real time while they try to swindle him over the telephone, but now regular folk can do similar without having to lift a finger.</p>
<p>At a time when AI grifters are trying to convince the gullible to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI3Bt-pIkfA&amp;lc=UgzWPfD9JScCLI0vA5R4AaABAg">flood the ebook market with ChatGPT-generated joke books</a>, it is heartening to see something related that is both funny and actually effective. ®</p>

            <h2>Companies must stop using Google Analytics </h2>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            The Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) has audited how four companies use Google Analytics for web statistics. IMY issues administrative fines against two of the companies. One of the companies has recently stopped using the statistics tool on its own initiative, while IMY orders the other three to also stop using it.
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>IMY has audited how four companies transfer personal data to the US via Google Analytics, which is a tool for measuring and analysing traffic on websites. The companies audited are CDON, Coop, Dagens Industri and Tele2. The audits concerns a version of Google Analytics from 14th of August 2020.</p>
<p>The audits are based on complaints from the organisation None of Your Business (NOYB) in the light of the Schrems II ruling by the European Court of Justice (CJEU). The complaints allege that the companies, in violation of the law, transfer personal data to the United States.</p>
<p>According to the data protection regulation, GDPR, personal data may be transferred to third countries, i.e. countries outside the EU/EEA, if the European Commission has decided that the country in question has an adequate level of protection for personal data that corresponds to that within the EU/EEA. However, the CJEU ruled through the Schrems II ruling that the United States could not be considered to have such an adequate level of protection at the time of the ruling.</p>
<p>In its audits, IMY considers that the data transferred to the US via Google's statistics tool is personal data because the data can be linked with other unique data that is transferred. The authority also concludes that the technical security measures that the companies have taken are not sufficient to ensure a level of protection that essentially corresponds to that guaranteed within the EU/EEA.</p>
<p>– By the fact that IMY has decided on these cases at the same time, it is made clear what requirements are placed on technical security measures and other measures when transferring personal data to a third country, in this case the United States, says legal advisor Sandra Arvidsson, who led the audits of the companies.</p>
<p>If there is no decision on an adequate level of protection by the European Commission, data may be transferred based on standard contractual clauses that the European Commission has decided on. However, according to the CJEU, such standard contractual clauses may need to be supplemented with additional safeguards if it is necessary for the protection that the clauses are intended to provide to be maintained in practice.</p>
<p>All four companies have based their decisions on the transfer of personal data via Google Analytics on standard contractual clauses. From IMY's audits, it appears that none of the companies' additional technical security measures are sufficient. IMY issues an administrative fine of 12 million SEK against Tele2 and 300,000 SEK against CDON, which has not taken the same extensive protective measures as Coop and Dagens Industri. Tele2 has recently stopped using the statistics tool on its own initiative. IMY orders the other three companies to stop using the tool.</p>
<p>– These decisions have implications not only for these four companies, but can also provide guidance for other organisations that use Google Analytics, says Sandra Arvidsson.</p>

Sorry for the delay, the reasons for which were expressed in previous 
<br>emails 
<br>(<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/libjpeg-turbo-announce/c/zXCK0qw1pIE/m/yMLo__OuAAAJ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-US&amp;q=https://groups.google.com/g/libjpeg-turbo-announce/c/zXCK0qw1pIE/m/yMLo__OuAAAJ&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1688565604347000&amp;usg=AOvVaw27CfQu_N8aKruqGkcsHDTs">https://groups.google.com/g/libjpeg-turbo-announce/c/zXCK0qw1pIE/m/yMLo__OuAAAJ</a>). 
<br>  SignPath is still having issues with their upstream CA, so the Windows 
<br>installers for libjpeg-turbo 3.0.0 are temporarily unsigned until those 
<br>issues can be resolved.  Ultimately, however, the delay produced a more 
<br>stable 3.0.0 release, since most of the bug reports against 3.0 beta 
<br>were filed after the beta cycle was supposed to have ended.
</p><p>
On that subject, I want to remind everyone that, while I do my best to 
<br>maintain this project with the highest possible quality standards and 
<br>using industry best practices, I cannot test for every possible usage 
<br>scenario.  The three-month beta testing phase is intended to allow the 
<br>community ample time to thoroughly test a new release series.  *Please* 
<br>use that time to test the new release series rather than waiting until 
<br>after the .0 release!
</p><p>
Why there may never be a libjpeg-turbo 3.1
<br>------------------------------------------
</p><p>
I will continue to fix bugs in libjpeg-turbo and issue bug-fix releases 
<br>in the 3.0.x release series, but there will not be a libjpeg-turbo 3.1 
<br>release series *unless* this project can secure more general funding. 
<br>As it stands, libjpeg-turbo only has general funding for about 8-10 
<br>hours of labor per month.  Finishing the 3.0 beta release required 
<br>borrowing against all expected general funding for 2023, and fixing all 
<br>of the 3.0 post-beta bugs required borrowing against all expected 
<br>general funding through September of 2024.  If things continue apace, 
<br>then libjpeg-turbo is effectively in "maintenance mode".  That means 
<br>that no new features (even minor ones) can be considered, and tech 
<br>support will be limited, for at least the next 15 months.
</p><p>
I maintain three open source projects for a living.  Those projects have 
<br>saved companies many millions of dollars in labor and IT costs, but I 
<br>take home less pay than that of a typical starting teacher.  (For those 
<br>outside of the U.S., a starting teacher's salary is a rhetorical 
<br>benchmark for very low pay.  We criminally underfund education here just 
<br>like we criminally underfund open source development.)  What I earn 
<br>through independent open source development is about 20-25% of what my 
<br>skills would be worth to a corporate employer, and I have turned down 
<br>numerous offers from such employers over the years in order to continue 
<br>working on these OSS projects full-time.  I don't expect to get rich 
<br>from open source development, but it is also unfair for organizations to 
<br>profit handsomely from my work while I am expected to do that work for free.
</p><p>
Because the majority of my income is from VirtualGL and TurboVNC, 
<br>uncompensated labor on libjpeg-turbo forces me to steal time away from 
<br>those more lucrative projects.  Thus, I simply can't eat labor cost on 
<br>libjpeg-turbo anymore.  (I ate hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth 
<br>of it from 2010-2018, but when the libjpeg-turbo 2.0 release caused me 
<br>to go into debt in 2018, I had to stop.)  However, major releases still 
<br>require a lot of general labor.  Because the project is so high-profile 
<br>(used by literally billions of people every day through major web 
<br>browsers, operating systems, and image viewers/editors) and is an 
<br>ISO/ITU-T reference implementation, it undergoes intense scrutiny. 
<br>Unfortunately, that scrutiny typically lags the development of new 
<br>features by enough time that specific funding is no longer available to 
<br>fix unanticipated bugs in the new features.  Thus, it has become 
<br>increasingly difficult to estimate the labor costs of new features 
<br>upfront.  In order to adequately cushion against unforeseen bugs, I 
<br>would have to grossly overestimate every new feature to the point that 
<br>no one would be willing to fund the feature.  Instead, I have had to 
<br>accept the risk of unforeseen bugs in order to keep libjpeg-turbo moving 
<br>forward, and that has forced me to perform many hours of general labor 
<br>on the run-up to every new release series.  The companies that have 
<br>partially (but unfortunately not fully) funded each new release series 
<br>have pressured me to put out the .0 releases in a timely manner, so that 
<br>has left me with no choice but to borrow against expected future 
<br>funding.  Specific to 3.0, I had to spend more than 70 uncompensated 
<br>hours fixing bugs discovered in the beta release.  Most of those hours 
<br>were spent fixing bugs in the lossless JPEG feature, but I also spent a 
<br>significant amount of time fixing bugs in the partial image 
<br>decompression and RGB565 features (both of which were integrated to 
<br>support Android and both of which have required me to eat the cost of 
<br>bug fixes or beg for money a handful of times since they were integrated.)
</p><p>
This project has only been kept alive because of the libjpeg-turbo 
<br>General Fund, which is funded by Cendio AB and Crimson Vista and your ad 
<br>hoc donations, as well as a few large ad hoc donations from Google. 
<br>However, the current General Fund is only enough to pay for general 
<br>project maintenance and support.  To keep libjpeg-turbo moving forward 
<br>in any meaningful way, including providing community support, 
<br>integrating or implementing minor features, supporting popular new 
<br>platforms, etc. requires more general funding.  To keep libjpeg-turbo 
<br>moving forward in a more proactive/progressive way, including expanding 
<br>the coverage of the JPEG spec (3.0 essentially expands our coverage of 
<br>the JPEG spec by a factor of five), expanding SIMD coverage to new 
<br>algorithms or instruction sets or CPU architectures, supporting less 
<br>popular new platforms, improving the APIs, hardening security, improving 
<br>fuzzer coverage, enhancing the build system, improving automation, etc. 
<br>requires even more general funding.  Essentially I have been expected to 
<br>keep libjpeg-turbo moving forward in a proactive/progressive way, but 
<br>the amount of general funding only allows for maintenance mode.  In the 
<br>best case, that puts me in the position of begging for funding on a 
<br>regular basis, which distracts from meaningful open source development. 
<br>In the worst case (where we are now), that puts me in the position of 
<br>stalling the project for potentially more than a year until funding can 
<br>catch up to the labor I've already contributed.  It just isn't working, 
<br>and I don't know how to fix it.  It's ironic that the most 
<br>popular/ubiquitous open source project I maintain (by at least four or 
<br>five orders of magnitude) is much more difficult to fund than the 
<br>others.  Maybe a JPEG codec isn't "sexy" enough?  Maybe people take it 
<br>for granted because the complexity of it is hidden behind higher-level 
<br>interfaces and applications?  Still, though, the organizations that 
<br>develop those higher-level interfaces and applications should not be 
<br>taking libjpeg-turbo for granted, particularly when most of the recent 
<br>issues I was expected to fix for free were security-related.
</p><p>
I have expressed in the past that the business model necessitated by 
<br>independent open source development may not be the best fit for a 
<br>critical infrastructure project such as libjpeg-turbo.  Thus, I am open 
<br>to acquisition by a larger organization, if that organization is both 
<br>O/S-agnostic and CPU-agnostic and has a vested interest in both the 
<br>survival and the openness of libjpeg-turbo.  However, I also don't 
<br>expect such an offer to ever materialize.  I have built significant 
<br>value in libjpeg-turbo-- including its reputation, its ubiquity, and its 
<br>user community-- over the past 13 years, but it is obviously not a cash 
<br>cow.  Still, though, unless I can secure enough general funding to move 
<br>the project forward in a meaningful way, the only other options are 
<br>acquisition (however unlikely) or putting the project into maintenance 
<br>mode for the foreseeable future.  The latter is where we are now.
</p><p>
How can you help?  If every individual developer who used libjpeg-turbo 
<br>on a regular basis donated just $5-10/month to the project through 
<br>GitHub Sponsors (<a href="https://github.com/sponsors/libjpeg-turbo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-US&amp;q=https://github.com/sponsors/libjpeg-turbo&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1688565604347000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3jbm3wa_QqbfwzSb_bOlOU">https://github.com/sponsors/libjpeg-turbo</a>), we'd have a 
<br>healthy amount of general funding.  But that requires everyone to take 
<br>responsibility for the health of this project, not to rely on the few 
<br>corporate benefactors that have kept libjpeg-turbo on life support for 
<br>the past five years.

<blockquote>
<p>The subtle biases of LLM training are difficult to detect but can manifest themselves in unexpected places. I call this the ‘Lone Banana Problem’ of AI.</p>
<cite>Daniel Hook, CEO, Digital Science</cite></blockquote>



<p>Think of all the tools that the information age has brought us…</p>



<p>Think of all the people whose diseases have become manageable or which have been cured. Think of all the economic benefits that have been generated through increased productivity. Think of all the routes that we have to express ourselves and share our creativity. Think of all the skills that were needed to power that revolution – the hardware engineering, and the software engineering – the development of whole new fields of knowledge and understanding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then think of all the wealth disparity that has been introduced into our world.&nbsp; Think of the social anxiety of always being online.&nbsp; Think of the undermining of our democratic institutions.</p>



<p>The effects of new technology are seldom either solely positive or solely negative and, as such, there is a responsibility that sits with those that develop technology to consider how it will be used.&nbsp; Underlying that responsibility sits a need to deeply understand technology.&nbsp; The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and its rapid adoption begs many questions about whether we understand the technology and whether we understand how it will impact us at a cultural, societal, or economic level.</p>



<p>It is clear that the experience that we have of programming and existing technologies will give way to different skills with this new technology.&nbsp; The command of a programmer mindset and skill with languages such as C++ and Python will give way to the need to understand a dynamic meta language that is drawn from the patterns of online human interaction.&nbsp; The new skill for the present technology is “speaking” language in the way that AI determines that language to be spoken from the inputs that it has consumed.</p>



<p>In that context, knowing that LLMs are not producing something new or creative, but rather that they are producing (or reproducing) the statistical average of the inputs that they have consumed in the context of the question they have been asked is important. Understanding that AIs do not understand us the way that we think they do is an important step in taking responsibility for developing on top of these technologies when creating new tools.</p>



<p>What follows attempts to illustrate this point.</p>



<h3>Going Bananas</h3>



<p>When I have written before on this topic I have noted that it is not these large biases that are concerning to me, rather it is the subtle biases that are difficult to detect that I think should be of more concern. I found recently what I regard to be an excellent illustration of the phrase that I have chosen to describe the output of AI. I call this the ‘Lone Banana Problem’.</p>



<p>Bananas are attractive fruits, they have a jolly colour, and they taste great. I have had a running joke for several years with a friend of mine that due to his love of bananas he should use them more significantly in the branding of his business. When I signed up to <a href="https://midjourney-app.com/">Midjourney</a> I saw the perfect opportunity to generate an idealised banana image for him to use. I started with a simple prompt: “A single banana casting a shadow on a grey background”. The result is shown in Figure 1.</p>

<figcaption><em>1: Four initial outputs generated by Midjourney in response to the prompt “A single banana casting a shadow on a grey background”.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Now, the more astute amongst you may notice an issue with the outputs that Midjourney has produced in Figure 1. While the bananas are beautiful and look extremely tasty in their artistic pose casting their shadow on the grey background, you may notice that I asked for a single solitary banana, on its own, but none of the variants that I received contained just one banana. Of course, I thought, the error must be mine, I clearly must not have been sufficiently precise in my prompt. So, I tried variants – from “a perfect ripe banana on a pure grey background casting a light shadow, hyperrealistic”, to the more specific “a single perfect ripe banana alone on a pure grey background casting a light shadow, hyperrealistic photographic”, and even to the emphatic (even pleading) “ONE perfect banana alone on a uniform light grey surface, shot from above, hyperrealistic photographic”.</p>



<h3>The Invisible Monkey Problem?</h3>



<p>I mentioned this challenge to a friend of mine who has much more of a programmer’s brain than I. He asked me if I tried to get Midjourney to render a monkey with a banana and then asking Midjourney to imagine that the monkey was invisible. (You see what I mean about a programmer’s brain?) He (my friend, not the monkey) was surmising that the data around monkeys holding bananas, or bananas in a different context might yield different results. The depressing result is included in Figure 2.</p>

<figcaption><em>Figure 2: One of the outputs of&nbsp; the experimental prompt: “An invisible monkey with a single banana”.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>You are quite right, that monkey (in Figure 2) should look sheepish! Firstly, he should be invisible and is conspicuous by well…his conspicuousness.&nbsp; Secondly, he is holding not <em>one</em> but <em>two</em> bananas!&nbsp; The results were the same with aliens holding bananas and other animals.&nbsp; Slightly bizarrely, several of the monkeys ended up wearing bananas or being banana-coloured.</p>



<p>Every image that I asked Midjourney to produce contained 2 (or more) bananas seemingly no matter how I asked.</p>



<p>I began to suspect that bananas, like quarks in the Standard Model of physics, might not naturally occur on their own as through some obscure binding principle they might only occur in pairs. I checked the kitchen. Experimental evidence suggested that bananas can definitely appear individually. Phew! But, the fact remained that I couldn’t get an individual banana as an output from the AI. So, what was going on?</p>



<h3>Bias Training</h3>



<p>One of the problems of generative AI is that understanding what is going on inside the machine’s brain is almost impossible. There are interesting approaches such as <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/been-kim-is-building-a-translator-for-artificial-intelligence-20190110/">TCAV</a> that attempt to give us more of an insight, but as with a human brain, we don’t fully understand the process that goes on inside a deep learning algorithm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Testing and understanding the outputs for a given input is critical when deciding how this type of technology can be applied in real-world applications. Anyone who has studied chaos theory or who has heard of the butterfly effect will know that naturally complex systems are often highly sensitive to initial conditions. The Large Language Models (LLMs) that we are building have highly complex inputs in the form of vast amounts of data that are used to train these intelligences. However, like the Mandelbrot set and other complex-looking fractals, the rules that are then applied to the data to do the training are deceptively simple.</p>



<p>The bias to two bananas in a picture is, I believe, an example of a subtle bias (OK, it’s not <em>that</em> subtle, but it is more subtle than many of the more concerning news-grabbing biases that we regularly read about). A naïve explanation may be that in the training dataset there have been many pictures of bananas added to Midjourney’s database that have been labelled “banana” but not labelled “two bananas”. It may also be that Midjourney has never seen an individual banana, so it doesn’t know that a single banana is possible.</p>



<p>The danger here is that due to the convincing nature of our interactions with AIs, we begin to believe that they understand the world in the way that we do.&nbsp; They don’t.&nbsp; AIs, at their current level of development, don’t perceive objects in the way that we do – they understand commonly occurring patterns.&nbsp; Their reality is fundamentally different to ours – it is not born in the physical world but in a logical world. Certainly, as successive generations of AI develop, it is easy for us to have interactions with them that suggest that they do understand. Some of the results of textual analysis that I’ve done with ChatGPT definitely give the impression of understanding. And yet, without a sense of the physical world, an AI has a problem with the concept of a single banana.</p>



<p>Of course, the point of this article is not to be vexed about the lack of individual bananas in the AI’s virtual world. It is to point out that even though this technology is developing rapidly and that the output is impressive, there are still gaps and, while they are not always immediately notable, they are not small. Ethical and responsible use of AI is easy to forget when faced with the speed of innovation and the constant press hype around AI. The lone banana problem is, in some sense, a less scary version of HAL the AI in Arthur C. Clarke’s 2001 where instead of killing the crew of the Odyssey, I have merely discovered a virtual universe in which bananas only appear in pairs.</p>



<p>While humans are amazing pattern matchers, that skill is augmented by common sense (in many but not all cases), context and an evolved and subtle understanding of the physical world around us. AIs don’t yet have those augmentations – they are pure pattern matching power. And hence, they are only as good as the data that we input into the training set and hence can be no more than the statistical average of those inputs. In the lone banana problem, the statistics suggested that bananas only appear in twos (or more) and so the AI could not imagine a single banana, because the data and parametric tuning that had gone on didn’t allow it to consider that approach, on average.</p>



<h3>Existential Questions</h3>



<p>But this line of thinking does beg certain uncomfortable questions such as, is human intelligence just the result of pattern matching in the context of an enriched relationship with a physical world? Is human morality simply the result of a pattern matching type feature with a sense of its own mortality? Or, is there something deeper going on? Is inspiration or intuition something that an AI will be able to master either through its learnt experiences or a richer relationship with the physical world? In a philosophical sense, what is creativity? And, does human creativity differ fundamentally from that of machine creativity?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Certainly human creativity has limits (and, perhaps paradoxically, appears to become more limited with age – precisely as we have been exposed to more experiences). Some of those limits are, for example, the amount of data that we can perceive and process. Others appear in the extent to which we can imagine beyond our everyday experiences. Machine creativity appears to have different limits – not ones of data processing, but rather limits on what can be perceived to be relevant or important, and similar to human experience, on imagining beyond experience. Despite the alluring implication of the command “\imagine” used to initiate a new prompt when getting Midjourney to create a set of images, to what extent is the AI able to imagine beyond the patterns that have been fed to it?</p>



<p>It also points to a deeper issue of the underlying nature of this technology. When programming became a more mainstream job in the 1980s and people started studying for computer science degrees, it was noted that programming required a certain way of thinking.&nbsp; It is the same for prompt engineering, but the type of thinking behind prompt engineering is not the same as for programming. Prompt engineering requires a deep understanding of language and not only that, a deep understanding of how a large language model understands language. In the same way that deep learning algorithms have a deep understanding of chess and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">Go</a> and consequently make surprising moves due to their perception of the game, the same will be true of large language models and their perception of the world. Their use of language and interpretation will be considerably more nuanced than ours, loaded with a myriad of cultural references that none of us can possibly have assimilated.</p>



<p>While I appreciate that AIs are a good deal more complex than my simple example shows, and indeed my example may even just be a facet of clumsy prompt engineering, it still demonstrates that you have to be incredibly careful about your assumptions when using AI. What it tells you may not be what you think it is telling you and it may not be for the reasons that you think either.</p>



<p>At Digital Science, we believe that we have a responsibility to ensure that the technologies that we release are well tested and well understood. The use cases where we deploy AI have to be appropriate for the level at which we know the AI can perform and any functionality needs to come with a “health warning” so that people know what they need to look for – when they can trust an AI and when they shouldn’t.</p>



<h3>Postlog</h3>



<p>After two weeks in despair of ever finding a lone banana, I tried a different style of prompt in Midjourney (either it has learnt some new tricks, or I might be getting better at “prompt thinking”). The prompt “A single banana on its own casting a shadow on a grey background” yielded Figure 3.</p>



<p>This shows two things: Firstly, that initial conditions, by which I mean the prompt given can be very sensitive – the difference between the phrases “A single banana casting a shadow on a grey background” and “A single banana on its own casting a shadow on a grey background” is not large, either in the semantics or the words used. However, the outcome is significantly different in its level of accuracy.&nbsp; Secondly, even with this improved prompt formulation coupled with whatever upgrades that may have been implemented by the Midjourney team in the prior two weeks, there is still one output that contains two bananas, and if you look closely, one attempted banana is trying to split itself in two!!</p>

<p dir="auto">Unintrusive algorithms for C arrays OR a C implementation of &lt;algorithm&gt; from C++</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Pitch</h2>
<p dir="auto">The C++ STL is one of the most complete and reusable algorithm libraries available.
This single header file brings 80% of that functionality to C99 in a non-intrusive way.
There are no new data structures. Just include the library and call functions on C arrays.</p>
<p dir="auto">Features:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Sets (intersection, union, subset, etc)</li>
<li>Heaps (priority queues)</li>
<li>Binary search (lower bound, upper bound, etc)</li>
<li>Sorts (insertion sort, quick sort, merge/stable sort, heap sort, partial sort, etc)</li>
<li>Partitioning (partition, unique, etc)</li>
<li>Predicates (all of, any of, none of, etc)</li>
<li>Uniform random sampling and shuffling</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2>
<p dir="auto">This library uses the preprocessor to implement generic functions.
Each time you include the library, you will need to define the array element type and a function prefix:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="#define ARRAY_ALG_TYPE int
#define ARRAY_ALG_PREFIX intv_
#include &quot;array_alg.h&quot;"><pre><code>#define ARRAY_ALG_TYPE int
#define ARRAY_ALG_PREFIX intv_
#include "array_alg.h"
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The above will only generate the declarations.
In at least one C file, you will also need to generate implementations.
To generate implementations, define <code>ARRAY_ALG_IMPLEMENTATION</code> in a C file and include the library:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="#define ARRAY_ALG_TYPE int
#define ARRAY_ALG_PREFIX intv_
#define ARRAY_ALG_IMPLEMENTATION
#include &quot;array_alg.h&quot;"><pre><code>#define ARRAY_ALG_TYPE int
#define ARRAY_ALG_PREFIX intv_
#define ARRAY_ALG_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "array_alg.h"
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Alternatively, add <code>#define ARRAY_ALG_STATIC</code> before the original declaration
to avoid the need for separate implementations.</p>
<p dir="auto">Repeat this process for each array type you want to use.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Examples</h2>
<p dir="auto">Remove duplicate entries:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="#define ARRAY_ALG_TYPE int
#define ARRAY_ALG_PREFIX intv_
#include &quot;array_alg.h&quot;

int compare_int(const int *a, const int *b, void *ctx) {
    return *a - *b;

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Design</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">1. Iterators and Arrays</h3>
<p dir="auto">The C++ STL is designed around the concept of iterators.
With iterators, one algorithm can be reused not just for multiple types, but also for many data structures.
This is an ingenious design.
However, in practice, this capability is rarely needed.
The vast majority of real world &lt;algorithm&gt; invocations are on contiguous arrays/vectors.</p>
<p dir="auto">For those cases where you do have a fancy data structure (graphs, trees, etc),
copy its contents to an array, perform the algorithm, and then copy the contents back.
This will often help it perform better anyway!</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">2. Bounds vs counted ranges</h3>
<p dir="auto">STL algorithms typically operate on half-open ranges bounded by iterators [first, last).
This convention is not used as often in C, but we think it offers some benefits.
Internally, the functions can maintain less state by simply incrementing pointers
rather than keeping track of pointers, indices, and counts.</p>
<p dir="auto">Operations also compose a little easier.
When a pointer is returned to an element of interest,
that same pointer can be used as an argument for another algorithm.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">3. What's left out</h3>
<p dir="auto">Because it's a bit verbose to define a C closure (function pointer and context), some STL algorithms are less useful in C.
If an algorithm can be written as a simple for loop with no additional state or control flow, this library doesn't implement it.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="transform -> for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) out[i] = f(in[i])
fill -> for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) out[i] = x;
iota -> for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) out[i] = i;
generate -> for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) out[i] = f();"><pre><code>transform -&gt; for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) out[i] = f(in[i])
fill -&gt; for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) out[i] = x;
iota -&gt; for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) out[i] = i;
generate -&gt; for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) out[i] = f();
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The algorithms which rely on ordered types always require a comparison function.
We do not include any variants that operate on the <code>==</code> operator, as operators cannot be overloaded in C.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">4. Generics vs <code>void*</code></h3>
<p dir="auto">Including a header multiple times with various <code>#define</code>s is a little cumbersome.
However, we think it's a superior way to achieve C generics compared to the <code>void*</code> style used by <code>qsort</code> and <code>bsearch</code>.
The preprocessor approach provides:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Better type safety and avoids verbose casting logic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Better peformance (as <code>void*</code> functions are difficult to optimize).</p>
<p dir="auto">Note: The C compiler can only create one non-inlined version of each function.
For example, it could not choose to use <code>int</code> instructions, even if it knew the type at compile time.
With the single header approach you get a new instance of each function optimized for each application.</p>
</li>
</ul>

SQLite requires no setup, no maintenance, and no scaling, and the result of that execution lies entirely in a single file that you could drop into your CI/CD for quick verification. What’s not to like?</p><p id="51db">But it’s not a common choice for production backends because of its lack of network accessibility for things like monitoring and backups. Most modern applications also need replicas for availability. And thanks to platforms such as Netlify, Vercel, and Cloudflare. applications are moving to the edge: they are now deployed <em>everywhere</em>, instead of <em>somewhere</em>.</p><p id="58a5">Historically, these situations have made SQLite an infeasible option. But no more!</p><h2 id="3947">SQLite gets network accessibility</h2><p id="f7e2">Aside from any technical consideration, the SQLite project is Open Source, but not Open Contribution, which prevents the creation of a community of people and organizations pushing the project in new directions.</p><p id="fc22">In October 2022, we <a href="https://medium.com/p/aedad19c9a1c" rel="noopener">announced a fork of SQLite</a> that is also Open Contribution and distributed under an Open Source License (MIT), indicating our intent to evolve the project into some new and spicy directions. We call it <a href="https://github.com/libsql" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">libSQL</a>.</p><p id="449b">The latest addition is called “server mode” (known as `<a href="https://github.com/libsql/sqld" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">sqld</a>`) that enables network access to libSQL, as well as replication to multiple instances.</p><figure></figure><p id="8923">With this first iteration, we support:</p><ul><li id="a864">The Postgres wire protocol</li><li id="84ed">The Postgres wire protocol over websocket</li><li id="ed68">HTTP</li></ul><h2 id="0376">sqld in action</h2><p id="9bee">To see how it works, we start the server and indicate we want to serve it over http and postgres. The <code>-d</code>switch specifies the database file.</p><pre><span id="2a46">$ sqld -d foo.db -p 127.0.0.1:5432 --http-listen-addr=127.0.0.1:8000</span></pre><p id="f6bb">Since sqld supports the Postgres wire protocol, standard Postgres tooling works, including the <code>psql</code>command shell. We’ll use it to create a table and insert a row.

So is a fork really needed?”</p><p id="f220">A full explanation of how SQLite writes and reads data is out of the scope of this article. There are many <a href="https://www.compileralchemy.com/books/sqlite-internals/#rollback-wal" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">other sources</a> that go into great detail about that.</p><p id="6096">Suffice to say, there are two entities that are relevant when interacting with SQLite’s storage: the VFS, and the WAL (Write-Ahead Log).</p><h2 id="a5a6">WAL Virtualization</h2><p id="9e6a">While SQLite does offer a virtualized interface for the VFS, it does not allow for the virtualization of the WAL methods. The main work in the core of libSQL was to <a href="https://github.com/libsql/libsql/pull/53" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">allow for WAL virtualization</a>.</p><p id="01b1">Once the WAL is virtualized, we can capture any new updates to the database as they happen. This gives us the flexibility of VFS, but with a log-structured API.</p><p id="c2f7">Log-structured APIs are easier to replicate, since it is a natural point for streaming changes. In WAL mode, a writer can work in parallel with readers, which provides better concurrency guarantees for mixed and read-intensive workloads, compared to the default rollback journal mode.</p><p id="b114">Moreover, SQLite has a very interesting feature that isn’t generally available yet — <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/cgi/src/doc/begin-concurrent/doc/begin_concurrent.md" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">BEGIN CONCURRENT</a> transactions, which use the power of optimistic concurrency control to allow multiple writers to work in parallel. This feature is built on top of WAL mode only.</p><h2 id="25c8">For us, it’s more than sqld</h2><p id="2809">This is as good a time as any to remember the primary reason for our fork: our goals with libSQL go beyond server mode. Many projects extend SQLite, making it hard to unify these efforts.</p><p id="9d69">As an example, before server-mode, we had already integrated <a href="https://blog.chiselstrike.com/webassembly-functions-for-your-sqlite-compatible-database-7e1ad95a2aa7" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">WASM user-defined functions</a>, allowing users to to write close-to-the-data functions and <a href="https://blog.chiselstrike.com/webassembly-triggers-in-libsql-b5eb62cc1c6" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">triggers</a> in WASM. libSQL also allows for <a href="https://github.com/libsql/libsql/pull/56" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">randomized row ids</a>, among other features, <a href="https://github.com/libsql/libsql/issues" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">with even more planned in the future</a>.</p><h2 id="9256">What next?</h2><p id="13ae">We would love to hear how you might like to use libSQL’s server mode in your next project.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Before I got into productivity and performance, I used to spend many hours online ingesting vast troves of digital content. My information diet ranged from inspirational TED talks to specialized podcasts, from blog posts found on Hacker News to ebooks shared on Twitter.</p>
<p>I’m deeply curious, and I gave in to new content as much as I could. What could be the harm?—I thought. I <em>loved</em> spending my time this way. It felt useful, it was fun, and it nurtured my self-image as a “smart guy” — all at the same time. Truly, a learning hack.</p>
<p>Turns out I wasn't hacking anything: The learning wasn’t real.</p>
<p>A few months ago, doubts began to creep into my mind about the effectiveness of my habits.</p>
<p>While I’d amped up my information consumption, I wasn’t retaining most of it. My memory was behaving like a leaky bucket. Sure, I was spending tens of hours listening to politics on the radio. But when I tried to use any of those points in a conversation, I found that I didn't actually know enough to make a coherent argument. <strong>I knew the surrounding context, but the moment I needed to get specific my argument would crumble</strong>. Same for many other topics: the more technical they were, the less retention I had.</p>
<p>Where did all that information go?</p>
<p>The problem lied in how I was seeing learning, and therefore how I was approaching it.</p>
<p>Learning is what turns information consumption into long-lasting knowledge. The two things are different: while information is ephemeral, true knowledge is foundational. If knowledge were a person, information would be its picture.</p>
<p>It’s easy to think of learning in <em>accretive, cumulative</em> terms: if I stack up enough information, it will eventually turn into knowledge. We tend to judge the world in material terms, and if data were tangible, an indefinitely growing memory might be reasonable to assume. The more information I consume, the more information I store, the information data I can later retrieve. The more business newsletters I’ll read, the more I’ll know business.</p>
<p>However, this line of thinking wasn’t really applicable to my case: I was undoubtedly consuming many business newsletters each week, but that wasn’t translating into long-term business knowledge.</p>
<p>I spent the last eight months trying to find an answer to this riddle. It took me deep into the topic of meta-learning: How do humans learn? And how can we learn better in the digital information age?</p>
<h2>Learning must be effortful</h2>
<p>Unfortunately for us, human memory does not resemble storage, and “passive accumulation” isn’t how learning happens.</p>
<p>The truth is that we retain information only when we put <em>serious effort</em> into the process of learning. The intrinsic effortfulness of learning is not just a byproduct of the core activity, like shortness of breath during running. On the contrary: it’s what <em>actually</em> <em>enables</em> it. The relationship is causal.</p>
<p><img src="https://giansegato.com/images/edutainment-not-learning/image_1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I didn’t find a learning hack to avoid effort because there’s no such thing as easy learning: <strong>learning <em>must</em> be effortful in order for it to happen</strong>.</p>
<p>What surprised me the most is that learning is far more grounded in the physical world than I was comfortable admitting.</p>
<p>The most literal meaning of effort is <em>physical</em> effort (think of weight lifting at the gym). The same holds true with information retention: it works best when the process of assimilating it is <em>physically effortful</em>. Our memory shines when our learning is physical, visceral, and obvious, like the aching in your hands after a morning spent hand-writing.</p>
<p>Since they’re passive, easy, and exclusively digital, after this realization all my podcasts, e-books, audiobooks, newsletters, blog posts, videos, live webinars were suddenly deprived of their “<em>learning status</em>”. Instead, they assumed their proper place in my schedule as pure <em>entertainment</em> activities.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that digital products make it uniquely easy to trick yourself into thinking that you’re learning when you are actually being entertained.</p>
<p>What I still didn’t know was why our mind works like this. Is this just the current state of digital learning and teaching, or there’s actually a margin for <em>easy</em> learning to be found somewhere?</p>
<h2>The neurology of learning</h2>
<p>I’m no expert in medicine, let alone neurology, but I did want to roughly understand what happens when we — as humans — create knowledge. Luckily I didn’t need profound medical expertise to get the gist of the matter.</p>
<p>Our brain is made of a web of interconnected neurons. The links between these neurons are called axons: long, slender projections of nerve fibers that transmit electrical impulses.</p>
<p>Around these axons, there’s an insulating membrane called myelin. It covers many neuronal axons and facilitates the propagation of electrical signals along neuronal circuits. The more myelin around an axon, the stronger and more connected the signal transmission will be.</p>
<p><img src="https://giansegato.com/images/edutainment-not-learning/image_2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Myelin is to neural transmissions as oxygen is to fire. It allows rapid information transfer over long distances, and it <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1261127">greatly increases</a> the speed of propagation of electric signals in our brain.</p>
<p>See it as water flowing through a pipe with dynamic, changing capacity. Pipes with greater capacity can move more water, more quickly than a small pipe or a slow drip. The more myelin supporting a neural connection, the easier it is to use that connection — and thus to use the skill or remember the topic associated with that connection</p>
<p>A key aspect of myelin is that it’s highly dynamic. It’s an integral component of our brain plasticity. So the question becomes: how is myelin generated, and why?</p>
<p>When we come across a new topic, new regions of the brain start activating. The more we use those new regions, the more myelin is synthesized, the easier that topic (or activity) gets.</p>
<p>We all know the old saying <em>practice makes perfect</em>. The more we use a certain region of our brain, the more our brain "prioritizes" and "hones" it. That is what leads to myelin: activity induces myelination, which leads to increased strength of connectivity and efficiency along those very neurons. It’s a self-reinforcing process.</p>
<p>In other words, it compounds.</p>
<p><img src="https://giansegato.com/images/edutainment-not-learning/image_3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>See now why it’s so hard to learn? To learn anything we must make active use of unexplored regions of our brain <em>before</em> they're ready. It's, quite literally, getting out of the comfort zone. The more we use them, the more they get better. <strong>Learning is <em>structurally</em> hard.</strong></p>
<p>The truly mesmerizing thing about myelination is that it is correlated with active use of <em><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.4351">motor neurons</a></em>. It looks like human cognition is fundamentally grounded in sensory-motor processes: we retain information better when we associate some <em>physical activity</em> to it. <strong>The general intuition is that movement provides additional cues we can use to retrieve knowledge.</strong></p>
<p>We can see this effect happening when we take notes. A larger corpus of research is suggesting that taking notes physically — that is, by hand-writing them — is <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01810">far more effective</a> than using a laptop. Keyboarding does not provide tactile feedback to the brain that the contact between pencil and paper does: this contact, this raw feedback, is the key to creating the neurocircuitry in the hand-brain complex, that <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01810">evidence shows</a> supports memory and retention.</p>
<p>All of this means <strong>we need to radically reassess digital learning</strong>. We haven’t evolved to store information by passively watching Masterclass videos: that’s just not how our minds work.</p>
<p>However, the other side of this coin is that we’re living in times of unprecedented information surplus. This is an opportunity that we should learn to seize.</p>
<h2>Creative learning in a digital world</h2>
<p>The best way to describe my information diet before discovering that effort is instrumental to learning would be <em>edutainment</em>.</p>
<p>Edutainment mixes education topics with entertainment methodologies. Even if edutainment optimizes for passive attention instead of effortful engagement (the opposite of learning), it’s not just “mere fun.” Deleting Twitter and unsubscribing from newsletters, as suggested by Deep Work advocates like <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">Cal Newport</a>, can actually end up <em>preventing</em> learning.</p>
<p>I see edutainment as <em>preparation for learning</em>: it’s a powerful explorative tool that can provide ideas and motivation to learn. And yet, it’s also not learning itself, in the same way as buying running shoes is not running.</p>
<p>Within this framework, “mindless” browsing online can be transformed into <em>scouting for learning opportunities</em>. It’s yet another searching problem where it’s key to balance the exploration of new opportunities with the commitment to the existing ones — a topic I wrote about at length in <a href="https://giansegato.com/essays/the-ebb-and-the-flow-of-product-development/">another essay</a>. It’s about balancing the time spent “scouting” for interesting topics online with the offline effort needed for long-term retention and integration.</p>
<p>Pragmatically, I solved this trade-off with a powerful tool: a learning inbox.</p>
<p>A learning inbox is a to-do list for stuff I’d like to actually learn. I picked up the idea from Andy Matuschak — legendary ed-tech expert —, who <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/A_reading_inbox_to_capture_possibly-useful_references">used a similar concept</a> as a tool for capturing possibly-useful references. The learning inbox is a system that forces me to be mindful about what content is <em>learning</em>, and what is at the end of the day just <em>entertainment</em>.</p>
<p>Everything interesting I find on my way is sent to my learning inbox and from there gets triaged, be it a paper, an online essay, a blog post, a YouTube video, or a podcast. When an item ends up in there, there are three things that can happen: I either decide to actively engage with it, to file for future interest, or just trash it. Active engagement is exactly what it sounds like: <strong>I need to take effortful action to consume the content in the list</strong>, otherwise I automatically bucket it as entertainment.</p>
<p>In other words, I need to do something with it. To <em>create</em> something. Write a blog post about it, use it in a new project, test it on the field, teach it at a meetup. That’s why I speak at <a href="https://giansegato.com/about/#talks">many conferences</a>: it’s a learning tool.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/">GTD fashion</a>, permanence in this list is temporary. It's a release valve, not a procrastination tool.</p>
<p>For example, I recently came across <a href="https://twitter.com/metasoarous/status/1324897236434649093?s=20">a tweet</a> during the last Election day mentioning <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tBVMAm0-00&amp;ab_channel=ClojureTV">a video</a> about computational democracy. I’m extremely interested in the intersection between politics and data, so I sent the link to my learning inbox (a task on Things 3) – and then promptly forgot about it.</p>
<p>A few days later, during one of my ritual learning sprints, I took out my notepad and watched the whole video while taking handwritten notes. I then reviewed and transcribed what I had jotted down to an <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes">evergreen digital note</a> in my personal knowledge base. The whole process took twice as long as watching the video, and it’s not even a done deal: I would still need some kind of experimentation, tinkering, iteration, application in different contexts, and generally something more hands-on than just note-taking to significantly solidify my knowledge on the topic. That’s what learning takes.</p>
<p>The process takes a lot of time and effort, which means it’s not something I can afford to do with every piece of content I find online. Most of the time I trash the links I find, upon further review. Sometimes they end up in my <a href="https://giansegato.com/learning/">learning wish list</a>.</p>
<p>The core idea is trying my best to not kid myself: when my engagement with a piece of content is active and effortful then it’s learning, when it’s passive it’s entertainment. <strong>When I create I <em>learn</em>. When I consume I just <em>relax</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Bottom line: we need to <em>engage</em> with what we encounter if we wish to absorb it long term. In a smartphone-driven society, real engagement, beyond the share or like or retweet, got fundamentally difficult – or, put another way, not engaging got fundamentally easier. Passive browsing is addictive: the whole information supply chain is optimized for time spent in-app, not for retention and proactivity.</p>
<p>Luckily, the other side of the coin is that finding new topics and new <em>reasons</em> to learn got dramatically easier, with such an abundance of content and stimuli.</p>
<p>We just need to be proactive with how we engage with all of the streams of content available to us. To go out and build, write, talk, teach, explain, create — effortful actions, that lead to meaningful growth.</p>
<p>That's for sure what I’m going to do.</p>

        <p>Nginx, a versatile web server pivotal to numerous internet infrastructures, has held a dominant market share since its inception in 2004, with widespread adoption across websites and Docker containers. This article delves into the intricacies of Nginx, focusing on the location and alias directives that are central to how Nginx handles specific URLs. We also explore potential vulnerabilities arising from misconfigurations and demonstrate how they can lead to security exploits, drawing on research presented at the BlackHat 2018 conference by Orange Tsai.</p><p>The guide further illustrates these points through a thorough examination of popular open-source repositories using GitHub Code Search to identify potential Nginx configuration vulnerabilities. Real-world case studies involving Bitwarden and Google's HPC Toolkit highlight the significant risk of data exposure if these vulnerabilities are not addressed. Additionally, we introduce NavGix, an automated tool designed to detect these vulnerabilities in a black-box manner, providing comprehensive insights into Nginx's complexities, vulnerabilities, and potential misconfigurations.</p><h2 id="brief-overview-of-nginx">Brief Overview of Nginx</h2><p>Nginx is a versatile web server that can also function as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy, and HTTP cache. The software was created and publicly released in 2004.</p><p>As per W3Tech's data, as of June 2022, Nginx holds the highest market share among web servers, with 33.6% of websites on the internet utilizing it. Additionally, according to Docker, Nginx is the most deployed technology in their containers. This significant popularity makes vulnerabilities related to Nginx all the more critical and intriguing.</p><h3 id="location-and-alias-directives">Location and Alias Directives</h3><p>The location directive is a block directive that can contain other directives and is used to define how Nginx should handle requests for specific URLs, they can be defined. </p><p>It is often used in conjunction with the alias directive to map URLs to specific file locations on the server. the directives can be defined in the <code>nginx.conf</code> file or in a separate configuration file.</p><p>The syntax for the location directive is as follows:</p><pre><code>location [modifier] /path/to/URL {
    # other directives
}</code></pre><p>The <code>modifier</code> is optional and can be one of the following:</p><ul><li><code>=</code>: Exact match</li><li><code>~</code>: Case-sensitive regular expression match</li><li><code>~*</code>: Case-insensitive regular expression match</li><li><code>^~</code>: Prefix match (stop searching if this matches)</li></ul><p>Here is an example of how to use the location directive in the <code>nginx.conf</code> file:</p><pre><code>location /assets/ { # defines a location block for requests matching /assets
    
    alias /opt/production/assets/; # maps the request to the assets folder
    
}
</code></pre><h2 id="identifying-misconfigurations">Identifying Misconfigurations</h2><p>At the BlackHat 2018 conference, Orange Tsai presented his research on breaking URL parsers. Among other impressive findings, he demonstrated a technique discovered in a 2016 CTF challenge from HCTF, created by @iaklis.</p><p>For the technique to be applicable, the following conditions must be met:</p><ul><li>The <code>location</code> directive <strong>should not</strong> have a trailing slash in its path;</li><li>An <code>alias</code>directive must be present within the location context, and it <strong>must</strong> end with a slash.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/2023/06/alias_vuln_example.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1039" height="180" srcset="https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/alias_vuln_example.png 600w, https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/alias_vuln_example.png 1000w, https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/2023/06/alias_vuln_example.png 1039w"></figure><h3 id="achieving-impact">Achieving Impact </h3><p>In the vulnerable example above, Nginx will match any URLs that start with <code>/img</code> and serve whatever follows that slash with the alias path <code>/var/images/</code> prepended. </p><p>This implies that both a request for <code>/img/profile.jpg</code> and a request for <code>/imgprofile.jpg</code> would return the same file. Because since the alias directive ends with a trailing slash, an additional slash is not necessary after the matched location.</p><figure><img src="https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/2023/06/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="660" height="622" srcset="https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-1.png 600w, https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/2023/06/image-1.png 660w"></figure><p>Taking into account that we can access the target folder through any request URL starting with <code>/img</code>, we can attempt to access the ever-present <code>..</code> directory, thereby reaching the parent directory of the target directory by issuing a request to <code>/img..</code> for the given example. </p><p>If we receive a redirection response from Nginx, we can assume that Nginx has located the directory and is attempting to redirect us to <code>/img../</code>, as it commonly does when accessing a directory.</p><figure><img src="https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/2023/06/image-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="445" height="283"><figcaption>And we do!</figcaption></figure><p>Consequently, this implies that any file or child directory within the parent directory of the target folder will be accessible to us, and Nginx will readily serve them. In our lab example, this means we could access all files in the <code>/var/</code> folder, given that the target folder in the configuration is <code>/var/images/</code>. This allows us to utilize simple payloads, such as a GET to, <code>/img../log/nginx/access.log</code> to download a log file located on <code>/var/log/nginx/access.log</code>.</p><figure><img src="https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/2023/06/image-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1139" height="351" srcset="https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-3.png 600w, https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/image-3.png 1000w, https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/2023/06/image-3.png 1139w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>We can even see our previous tests!</figcaption></figure><p>The severity of this vulnerability can fluctuate significantly depending on the project, extending from a negligible impact to a critical one. The degree of its repercussions is primarily determined by whether the exposed directory holds sensitive data that may facilitate additional attacks or result in the disclosure of private information.</p><h3 id="achieving-impact-without-a-slash-on-alias">Achieving Impact Without a Slash on Alias</h3><figure><img src="https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/2023/06/image-5.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1660" height="246" srcset="https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-5.png 600w, https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/image-5.png 1000w, https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/image-5.png 1600w, https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/2023/06/image-5.png 1660w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Same vulnerability, but without a trailing slash on alias.</figcaption></figure><p>A question that may arise is whether this vulnerability can still be exploited without the trailing slash on the alias directive. The answer is yes, but it would mean that using traversal sequences to escape the directory would no longer be possible. This is because everything after the matched location is appended to the alias, and appending a <code>..</code> sequence to a path without a trailing slash would only result in a non-existent folder name. e.g <code>/var/images../</code></p><p>However, we can still exploit this misbehavior to access other directories that have a name starting with the target directory name. As a result, we might not be able to access it <code>/var/images/../log/</code>, but we could still access a directory &nbsp;<code>/var/images_confidential</code> by making a GET request to <code><a href="http://localhost/img_confidential?ref=labs.hakaioffsec.com">/img_confidential</a></code>. </p><p>In this case, Nginx appends <code>_confidential</code> to the <code>/var/images</code> target path, effectively serving URLs from the combined path of <code>/var/images</code> and <code>_confidential</code> which results in <code>/var/images_confidential</code>.</p><figure><img src="https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/2023/06/image-4.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="565" height="275"></figure><h2 id="hunting-open-source-repositories">Hunting Open-Source Repositories</h2><p>As a starting point in our search for this vulnerability, we chose to explore popular GitHub repositories that displayed this issue. Identifying this specific vulnerability in environments with access to source code becomes significantly more feasible, primarily due to two main factors:</p><ol><li>Detection: Utilizing straightforward code analysis tools, such as regular expression searches, allows us to effectively pinpoint potentially vulnerable Nginx configuration files within these projects.</li><li>Exploitation: Having knowledge of the exact target directory that has been aliased empowers us to set up a local instance, examine the aliased directories using a local shell, and determine which files can be accessed through the vulnerability.</li></ol><h5 id="github-code-search"><strong>GitHub Code Search</strong></h5><p>GitHub Code Search is a feature available on GitHub, the web-based platform for version control and collaboration using Git. This feature enables users to search for code across all public repositories hosted on the platform, making it especially useful for developers seeking examples, libraries, or solutions to specific coding challenges.</p><p>Additionally, GitHub Code Search can be employed to search for snippets of vulnerable code within popular projects. This can be accomplished through a variety of methods, such as simple string matches, regular expressions, path filters, and more. For example, to search for the Nginx Alias Traversal vulnerability, the following regular expression can be used:</p><pre><code>/location \/[_.a-zA-Z0-9-\/]*[^\/][\s]\{[\s\n]*alias \/[_.a-zA-Z0-9-\/]*\/;/</code></pre><p>Upon examining the search results for this query, it becomes evident that a significant number of repositories contain this specific vulnerability.</p><figure><img src="https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/2023/06/image-6.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="255" srcset="https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-6.png 600w, https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/image-6.png 1000w, https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/image-6.png 1600w, https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/size/w2400/2023/06/image-6.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Due to the inherent limitations of regular expressions, they may not be ideally suited for matching code syntax. For instance, this particular regular expression will not match vulnerable configuration files containing comments between the directives. However, it serves as a starting point for our analysis.</p><h3 id="case-study-1-leaking-bitwardens-vault-logs-and-certificates">Case Study #1: Leaking Bitwarden's vault, logs, and certificates.</h3><p>Bitwarden is an open-source password manager that helps users securely store and manage their passwords, credentials, and other sensitive information. It offers features such as password generation, autofill, and synchronization across devices. Bitwarden supports various platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and web browsers through extensions. Users can access their data through a web vault, desktop apps, mobile apps, or browser extensions. </p><p>Bitwarden also offers <a href="https://github.com/bitwarden/server/?ref=labs.hakaioffsec.com">a self-hosted option</a> for those who want to maintain their own server, which is the one we are going to examine.</p><p>If we search for ways to create a self-hosted instance of the Bitwarden server, one of the presented ways is through the <a href="https://bitwarden.com/help/install-and-deploy-unified-beta/?ref=labs.hakaioffsec.com">Unified docker method</a>, which is a setup made for simplifying the deployment of the platform.</p><figure><img src="https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/2023/06/image-12.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1385" height="276" srcset="https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-12.png 600w, https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/image-12.png 1000w, https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/2023/06/image-12.png 1385w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>100K+ downloads!</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/2023/06/image-7.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1229" srcset="https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-7.png 600w, https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/image-7.png 1000w, https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/image-7.png 1600w, https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/size/w2400/2023/06/image-7.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Since our regular expression gave a match for Bitwarden's repository, we started dwelving into the code base searching for potentially vulnerable Nginx configurations, which is when we found the following inside the folder for the unified docker setup. </p><figure><img src="https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/2023/06/image-9.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1778" height="646" srcset="https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-9.png 600w, https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/image-9.png 1000w, https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/image-9.png 1600w, https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/2023/06/image-9.png 1778w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>If this config is used, then it means all files on /etc/bitwarden/attachments/ will be accessible on the URL /attachments, but looking back at the exploit details, this also means that any files present on /etc/bitwarden/ will be downloadable also.</p><p>But let's not get ahead of ourselves, we first must assess the impact of the exposure. To do that, we can either explore the code base or fire up a local instance and list the directory with a local shell. </p><p>Looking into the Dockerfile for that image, we find more info about that directory and what files it can contain:</p><figure><pre><code>[...]
ENV BW_DB_FILE="/etc/bitwarden/vault.db"

Bitwarden issued a US$6000 bounty, which is the highest bounty they issued on their HackerOne program.</p><h3 id="case-study-2-google-hpc-toolkitleaking-google-cloud-credentials">Case Study #2: Google HPC Toolkit - Leaking Google Cloud Credentials</h3><p>During our foray through GitHub, we chanced upon a software solution developed by Google, known as the Cloud HPC Toolkit. This was introduced in 2022, designed as a robust framework to facilitate the deployment of high-performance computing (HPC) environments on Google Cloud.</p><p>The HPC Toolkit boasts a Django-based web application front-end, granting users the ability to manage their HPC environments conveniently via a web interface.</p><p>Upon scrutinizing the configuration section identified by our regular expression, we discovered that a vulnerable path had indeed been defined. This path was aliased to <code>../hpc-toolkit/community/front-end/website/static/</code>, implying that issuing a request to <code>/static../</code> would provide us with access to the website folder.</p><figure><img src="https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/2023/06/image-16.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="535" height="371"></figure><p>Interestingly, we found that the SQLite database was also exposed within this folder and could be accessed through a specific URL:</p><pre><code>curl http://&lt;frontend URL&gt;/static../db.sqlite3 -O</code></pre><p>Moreover, the Django secret key was accessible at the following location:</p><pre><code>curl http://35.204.135.69/static../.secret_key</code></pre><p>Gaining access to this database is highly critical for the application, as the primary function of the HPC Toolkit appears to be the orchestration of large-scale Google Cloud resources. In the event of a compromise, an attacker could potentially gain control over a victim's GCP account credentials, which are stored in the SQLite database.</p><pre><code>sqlite&gt; select * from ghpcfe_credential;

They believed the impact on the application wasn't severe enough to warrant a larger reward. I toyed with the idea of debating the reward amount with them, but ultimately decided against it. After all, the recognition of our efforts was a reward in itself, and that was more than enough for us.</p><h2 id="navgix-detecting-the-vulnerability-in-a-black-box-manner">NavGix: Detecting the vulnerability in a black-box manner</h2><p>There are several methods to detect this vulnerability without necessitating access to the Nginx configuration file. Initially, potential location aliases can be identified by extracting links from the HTML source-code on the website's main page. Subsequently, directory traversal can be attempted using the techniques outlined in the earlier sections of this report.</p><p>In the absence of extractable links, it is feasible to perform a minor brute-force attack targeting common aliases. The ensuing list has demonstrated promising results during our testing phase:</p><pre><code>	var dictionary = []string{
		"static",
		"js",
		"images",
		"img",
		"css",
		"assets",
		"media",
		"lib",
	}</code></pre><p>An automated tool, <a href="https://github.com/hakaioffsec/navgix?ref=labs.hakaioffsec.com">NavGix</a>, has been created to aid in the enumeration and testing of aliased directories for traversal vulnerabilities. It is publicly available for download and use on its respective <a href="https://github.com/hakaioffsec/navgix?ref=labs.hakaioffsec.com">GitHub</a> page.</p><figure><img src="https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/2023/06/image-25.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="956" height="241" srcset="https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-25.png 600w, https://labs.hakaioffsec.com/content/images/2023/06/image-25.png 956w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Sample usage of navgix</figcaption></figure><p>Upon the identification of a directory susceptible to traversal by NavGix, it becomes possible to employ additional tools to fuzz for other accessible folders or files within the traversed directory. The primary objective here should be to locate files of interest that could potentially provide further impact, such as a configuration file containing secrets, log files, or source-code.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Wrapping up, while Nginx is a robust and incredibly versatile tool that fuels a significant portion of the internet, it's easily susceptible to certain inconsistencies. These potential pitfalls are often a result of misconfigurations, which can inadvertently transform this reliable powerhouse into a possible weak link. Nginx's approach to security leaves a significant onus on developers to avoid hazardous configurations, underscoring the importance of thorough understanding and cautious implementation.</p><p>Our journey through the world of open-source repositories and real-life case studies like Bitwarden and Google's HPC Toolkit underlines just how significant these vulnerabilities can be. It's a sobering reminder that even the most reliable systems can have their Achilles' heel.</p>
