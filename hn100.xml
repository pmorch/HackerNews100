Dozens of academics have raised concerns on social media about manuscripts and peer reviews submitted to the organizers of next year’s International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), an annual gathering of specialists in machine learning. Among other things, they flagged <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02853-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02853-8" data-track-category="body text link">hallucinated citations</a> and suspiciously long and vague feedback on their work.</p><p>Graham Neubig, an AI researcher at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was one of those who received peer reviews that seemed to have been<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03390-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03390-0" data-track-category="body text link"> produced using large language models (LLMs)</a>. The reports, he says, were “very verbose with lots of bullet points” and requested analyses that were not “the standard statistical analyses that reviewers ask for in typical AI or machine-learning papers.”</p><p>But Neubig needed help proving that the reports were AI-generated. So, he posted on X (formerly Twitter) and offered a reward for anyone who could scan all the conference submissions and their peer reviews for AI-generated text. The next day, he got a response from Max Spero, chief executive of Pangram Labs in New York City, which develops tools to detect AI-generated text. Pangram screened all 19,490 studies and 75,800 peer reviews submitted for ICLR 2026, which will take place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in April. Neubig and more than 11,000 other AI researchers will be attending.</p><p>Pangram’s analysis revealed that around 21% of the ICLR peer reviews were fully AI-generated, and more than half contained signs of AI use. The findings were <a href="https://www.pangram.com/blog/pangram-predicts-21-of-iclr-reviews-are-ai-generated" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.pangram.com/blog/pangram-predicts-21-of-iclr-reviews-are-ai-generated" data-track-category="body text link">posted online by Pangram Labs</a>. “People were suspicious, but they didn’t have any concrete proof,” says Spero. “Over the course of 12 hours, we wrote some code to parse out all of the text content from these paper submissions,” he adds. </p><p>The conference organizers say they will now use automated tools to assess whether submissions and peer reviews breached policies on using <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01839-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01839-w" data-track-category="body text link">AI in submissions and peer reviews</a>. This is the first time that the conference has faced this issue at scale, says Bharath Hariharan, a computer scientist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and senior programme chair for ICLR 2026. “After we go through all this process … that will give us a better notion of trust.” </p><h2>AI-written peer review</h2><p>The Pangram team used one of its own tools, which <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02936-6" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02936-6" data-track-category="body text link">predicts whether text is generated or edited by LLMs</a>. Pangram’s analysis flagged 15,899 peer reviews that were fully AI-generated. But it also identified many manuscripts that had been submitted to the conference with suspected cases of AI-generated text: 199 manuscripts (1%) were found to be fully AI-generated; 61% of submissions were mostly human-written; but 9% contained more than 50% AI-generated text. </p><p>Pangram described the model in a preprint<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>, which it submitted to ICLR 2026. Of the four peer reviews received for the manuscript, one was flagged as fully AI-generated and another as lightly AI-edited, the team’s analysis found.</p><article data-label="Related"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00894-7" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"><img alt="" src="https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03506-6/d41586-025-03506-6_50959900.jpg"><p>AI is transforming peer review — and many scientists are worried</p></a></article><p>For many researchers who received peer reviews for their submissions to ICLR, the Pangram analysis confirmed what they had suspected. Desmond Elliott, a computer scientist at the University of Copenhagen, says that one of three reviews he received seemed to have missed “the point of the paper”. His PhD student who led the work suspected that the review was generated by LLMs, because it mentioned numerical results from the manuscript that were incorrect and contained odd expressions. </p><p>When Pangram released its findings, Elliott adds, “the first thing I did was I typed in the title of our paper because I wanted to know whether my student’s gut instinct was correct”. The suspect peer review, which Pangram’s analysis flagged as fully AI-generated, gave the manuscript the lowest rating, leaving it “on the borderline between accept and reject”, says Elliott. “It's deeply frustrating”.</p><h2>Repercussions</h2></div></div>]]></description>

			<p>Iceland has classified the potential collapse of a major Atlantic current system as a national security threat, citing new scientific warnings that such a change could radically alter the country’s climate and economy. Officials say the risk represents an “existential” challenge that demands a coordinated, top-level response.</p>

<p>Iceland has taken the rare step of treating a climate-linked ocean threat as a matter of national survival, launching a coordinated government response to one of the most feared potential tipping points in the climate system.</p>



<p><br>Officials say the shift reflects mounting evidence that a key Atlantic current system could be heading toward dangerous instability.</p>



<h2>Security shift in Reykjavík</h2>



<p>According to <em><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/11/15/climate/iceland-warming-current-amoc-collapse-threat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNN</a></em>, Iceland’s National Security Council formally labelled the possible collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) a national security risk in September — the first time the country has applied such a designation to a climate impact.</p>



<p><br>The move followed a government briefing on new research that raised “grave concerns” about the system’s future stability.</p>



<p>Jóhann Páll Jóhannsson, Iceland’s minister for environment, energy and climate, said the risks extend far beyond weather. </p>

<p>“Our climate, economy and security are deeply tied to the stability of the ocean currents around us,” he told <em>CNN</em>.</p>



<p>He later described the threat as “an existential threat,” warning that a breakdown could disrupt transport, damage infrastructure and hit the country’s fishing industry.</p>



<h2>Why the AMOC matters</h2>



<p>The AMOC — often compared to a giant conveyor belt — carries warm water northward before it cools and sinks, helping regulate weather across the Atlantic basin. </p>



<p><em>CNN </em>reported that scientists increasingly worry that warming temperatures and disrupted salinity levels are slowing the system.</p>



<p>Some studies suggest a tipping point could be reached this century, though the exact timeline remains uncertain.</p>

<p>Stefan Rahmstorf, an oceanographer at Potsdam University, told <em>CNN </em>that a collapse “cannot be considered a low likelihood risk anymore.” </p>



<p>The consequences, he said, would be dramatic: surging sea levels along US and European coasts, major monsoon disruptions across Africa and Asia, and a deep freeze across parts of Europe.</p>



<p>For Iceland, he said, the country “would be close to the center of a serious regional cooling,” with sea ice potentially surrounding the island.</p>



<h2>Preparing for the worst</h2>



<p>The security designation means Iceland will now pursue a high-level, cross-government effort to analyse the threat and consider how to manage or reduce the consequences. Jóhannsson said the decision </p>



<p>“reflects the seriousness of the issue and ensures that the matter gets the attention it deserves.”</p>

<p>Rahmstorf praised Iceland’s stance, telling <em>CNN </em>that other nations should treat the risk with similar urgency.</p>



<p>Jóhannsson said the country is confronting a stark possibility: “What we do know is that the current climate might change so drastically that it could become impossible for us to adapt… this is not just a scientific concern — it’s a matter of national survival and security.” </p>

            <p>Let’s rip the Band-Aid off immediately: If your underlying business process is a mess, sprinkling "AI dust" on it won’t turn it into gold. It will just speed up the rate at which you generate garbage.</p><p>In the world of Business IT, we get seduced by the shiny new toy. Right now, that toy is Artificial Intelligence. Boardrooms are buzzing with buzzwords like LLMs, agentic workflows, and generative reasoning. Executives are frantically asking, <em>"What is our AI strategy?"</em></p><p>But here is the hard truth: </p><blockquote><strong>There is no such thing as an AI strategy. <br>There is only Business Process Optimization (BPO).</strong></blockquote><h3 id="the-magic-wand-fallacy">The "Magic Wand" Fallacy</h3><p>Too many enterprises treat AI like a magic wand. They believe that by implementing a sophisticated neural network, their structural inefficiencies will vanish. They think AI brings intelligence.</p><p>It doesn’t.</p><p>Like every major technological shift before it—from the steam engine to the spreadsheet—AI does not inherently make an organization smarter. <strong>AI, like any other tool, only makes faster.</strong></p><p>If you automate a stupid decision, you just make stupid decisions at light speed. If you apply an agentic AI workflow to a bureaucratic nightmare of an approval chain, you haven't fixed the bureaucracy; you’ve just built a robot that hates its job as much as your employees do.</p><h3 id="the-unstructured-data-trap">The Unstructured Data Trap</h3><p>There is, however, one superpower AI possesses that previous tools lacked: <strong>It is the first technology that is truly useful for handling unstructured data.</strong></p><p>For decades, traditional software demanded structure. Rows, columns, booleans, and fixed fields. If data didn't fit the box, the computer couldn't read it.</p><p>AI changes this. It can read messy emails, interpret vague Slack messages, parse PDFs, and analyze images. But this capability exposes a massive, hidden problem in most enterprises.</p><p><strong>Processes that rely on unstructured data are usually unstructured processes.</strong></p><p>Because computers couldn't handle the mess, humans handled it (before AI). And humans don't always follow a flow chart. These processes—like "handling a complex customer complaint" or "brainstorming a marketing campaign"—are often ad-hoc, intuitive, and completely undocumented. They live in the heads of your senior staff, not in your SOPs.</p><h3 id="you-can%E2%80%99t-automate-what-you-haven%E2%80%99t-designed">You Can’t Automate What You Haven’t Designed</h3><p>This brings us back to BPO. You cannot apply AI to these "hidden" processes until you drag them into the light.</p><p>If you want to use AI to process unstructured data, you must first bring structure to the workflow itself. You need to improve your process design to account for the ambiguity that AI handles.</p><p>Ask yourself:</p><ol><li><strong>What is the trigger?</strong> (Where does the unstructured mess come from?)</li><li><strong>What is the transformation?</strong> (What exactly is the human—or now the AI—supposed to extract or deduce from that mess?)</li><li><strong>What is the structured output?</strong> (How does this flow back into your rigid ERP or CRM systems?)</li></ol><h3 id="speed-vs-intelligence">Speed vs. Intelligence</h3><p>Let’s clarify the distinction between "smarter" and "faster."</p><p>Intelligence implies wisdom, context, and nuance. While AI models are simulating reasoning better every day, in a business context, they are fundamentally pattern-matching engines. They excel at acceleration.</p><ul><li><strong>The Old Way:</strong> An analyst reads 50 contracts (unstructured), highlights risks based on gut feeling (unstructured process), and summarizes them in 3 days.</li><li><strong>The AI Way:</strong> An AI scans 50 contracts and extracts specific risk clauses based on defined parameters in 3 minutes.</li></ul><p>The <em>process</em> (Review Contracts -&gt; Identify Risk -&gt; Summarize) hasn't changed, but it had to be rigorously defined for the AI to work. The <em>intelligence</em> (knowing what a "risk" actually means) still requires human governance. What has changed is the <strong>velocity</strong>.</p><h3 id="the-bottom-line">The Bottom Line</h3><p>Stop chasing the hype.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post"><article><p>2014-04-01</p><section><p>2 min read</p><img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7lCDvfhTzFcVMB5PveKJco/9283bc24e4a11eddef1aa631a61960e9/the-weird-and-wonderful-world-of-dns-loc-records.jpg" alt=""><div><p>A cornerstone of CloudFlare's infrastructure is our ability to serve DNS requests quickly and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/deep-inside-a-dns-amplification-ddos-attack">handle DNS attacks</a>. To do both those things we wrote our own authoritative DNS server called <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-story-of-a-little-dns-easter-egg">RRDNS</a> in Go. Because of it we've been able to fight off DNS attacks, and be consistenly one of the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-fastest-free-dns-among-fastest-dns">fastest</a> DNS providers on the web.</p><p>Implementing an authoritative DNS server is a large task. That's in part because DNS is a very old standard (<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt">RFC 1035</a> dates to 1987), in part because as DNS has developed it has grown into a more and more complex system, and in part because what's written in the RFCs and what happens in the real-world aren't always the same thing.</p><p>One little used type of DNS record is the LOC (or location). It allows you to specify a physical location. CloudFlare handles millions of DNS records; of those just 743 are LOCs. Nevertheless, it's possible to set up a LOC record in the CloudFlare DNS editor.</p>
            <figure>
            
            <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/SE3YNqdqCWTZjCq2X3204/6350156b41c21658e2c1cafe7780ae4b/480px-Trinity_Site_Obelisk_National_Historic_Landmark.jpg" alt="Trinity" width="480" height="480" loading="lazy">
            
            </figure><p>My site <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140329092052/http://geekatlas.com/">geekatlas.com</a> has a LOC record as an Easter Egg. Here's how it's configured in the CloudFlare DNS settings:</p>
            <figure>
            
            <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2Qe1yA3xIACsdf36XEi1oQ/1a078bd649abd88e5b382cab36f748b9/Screen_Shot_2014-03-27_at_11.34.24.png" alt="LOC Example" width="1894" height="96" loading="lazy">
            
            </figure><p>When you operate at CloudFlare scale the little-used nooks and crannies turn out to be important. And even though there are only 743 LOC records in our entire database, at least one customer contacted support to find out why their LOC record wasn't being served.</p><p>And that sent me into the RRDNS source code to find out why.</p><p>The answer was simple. Although RRDNS had code for receiving requests for LOC records, creating response packets containing LOC data, there was a missing link. The CloudFlare DNS server stores the LOC record as a string (such as the <code>33 40 31 N 106 28 29 W 10m</code> above) and no one had written the code to parse that and turn it into the internal format. Oops.</p><p>The textual LOC format and the binary, on-the-wire, format are described in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1876.txt">RFC 1876</a> and it's one of many RFCs that updated the original 1987 standard. RFC 1876 is from 1996.</p><p>The textual format is fairly simple. Here's what the RFC says:</p>
            <pre><code>The LOC record is expressed in a primary file in the following format:

owner TTL class LOC ( d1 [m1 [s1]] {"N"|"S"} d2 [m2 [s2]]
                           {"E"|"W"} alt["m"] [siz["m"] [hp["m"]
                           [vp["m"]]]] )

where:

   d1:     [0 .. 90]            (degrees latitude)
   d2:     [0 .. 180]           (degrees longitude)
   m1, m2: [0 .. 59]            (minutes latitude/longitude)
   s1, s2: [0 .. 59.999]        (seconds latitude/longitude)
   alt:    [-100000.00 .. 42849672.95] BY .01 (altitude in meters)
   siz, hp, vp: [0 .. 90000000.00] (size/precision in meters)

If omitted, minutes and seconds default to zero, size defaults to 1m,
horizontal precision defaults to 10000m, and vertical precision
defaults to 10m.  These defaults are chosen to represent typical
ZIP/postal code area sizes, since it is often easy to find
approximate geographical location by ZIP/postal code.</code></pre>
            <p>So, there are required latitude, longitude and altitude and three optional values for the size of the location and precision information. Pretty simple.</p><p>Then there's the on-the-wire format. Unlike a TXT record the LOC record data is parsed and turned into a fixed size binary format. Back to RFC 1876:</p>
            <pre><code>  MSB                                           LSB
   +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
  0|        VERSION        |         SIZE          |
   +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
  2|       HORIZ PRE       |       VERT PRE        |
   +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
  4|                   LATITUDE                    |
   +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
  6|                   LATITUDE                    |
   +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
  8|                   LONGITUDE                   |
   +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
 10|                   LONGITUDE                   |
   +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
 12|                   ALTITUDE                    |
   +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
 14|                   ALTITUDE                    |
   +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+</code></pre>
            <p>So, 32 bits of latitude, longitude and altitude and then three 8 bit values for the size and precision. The latitude and longitude values have a pretty simple encoding that treats the 32 bits as an unsigned integer:</p>
            <pre><code>The latitude of the center of the sphere described by the SIZE field, expressed as a 32-bit integer, most significant octet first (network standard byte order), in thousandths of a second of arc.  2^31 represents the equator; numbers above that are north latitude.</code></pre>
            <p>And the altitude can be below sea-level but still unsigned:</p>
            <pre><code>The altitude of the center of the sphere described by the SIZE field, expressed as a 32-bit integer, most significant octet first (network standard byte order), in centimeters, from a base of 100,000m below the [WGS 84] reference spheroid used by GPS.</code></pre>
            <p>But the 8 bit values use a very special encoding that allows a wide range of approximate values to be packed into 8 bits and also be human-readable when dumped out in hex!</p>
            <pre><code>The diameter of a sphere enclosing the described entity, in centimeters, expressed as a pair of four-bit unsigned integers, each ranging from zero to nine, with the most significant four bits representing the base and the second number representing the power of ten by which to multiply the base.  This allows sizes from 0e0 (&lt;1cm) to 9e9 (90,000km) to be expressed.  This representation was chosen such that the hexadecimal representation can be read by eye; 0x15 = 1e5.</code></pre>
            <p>For example, the value <code>0x12</code> means <code>1 * 10^2</code> or 100cm. <code>0x99</code> means <code>9 * 10^9</code> or 90,000,000m. The smallest value that can be represented is 1cm (it's <code>0x10</code>). So, in just 8 bits there's a range values from 1cm to larger than the diameter of Jupiter.</p><p>To fix this I wrote a parser for the LOC text record type (and associated tests). It can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/jgrahamc/9807839">here</a>.</p><p>We've now rolled out the fix and all the existing LOC records are being served by RRDNS. For example, my <code>geekatlas.com</code> LOC record can be queried like this:</p>
            <pre><code>$ dig geekatlas.com LOC
; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.8.3-P1 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; geekatlas.com LOC

<p>OpenAI is now internally testing 'ads' inside ChatGPT that could redefine the web economy.</p>


<p>Up until now, the ChatGPT experience has been completely&nbsp;free. While there are premium plans and models, you don't see GPT sell you products or show ads.</p>


<p>As <a href="https://x.com/btibor91/status/1994714152636690834" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">spotted </a>by Tibor on X,&nbsp;ChatGPT Android app 1.2025.329 beta includes new references to an "ads feature" with "bazaar content", "search ad" and "search ads carousel."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wiz.io/lp/ai-data-security-best-practices-cheat-sheet?utm_source=bleepingcomputer&amp;utm_medium=display&amp;utm_campaign=FY26Q3_INB_Form_AI-Data-Security-Best-Practices&amp;sfcid=701Py00000SmgsrIAB&amp;utm_term=FY26Q4-bleepingcomputer-970x250&amp;utm_content=AI-Data-Security-BP" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/c/w/wiz/AI-Data-Security-970x250.png" alt="Wiz"></a>
</p>


<p>It is likely that ads will be limited to the search experience only, but that might change soon.</p>


<p>My understanding is that GPT ads could be highly personalised as the AI knows everything about you unless you disable the feature,</p>


<p><em>This is a developing story...</em></p>

<p>EU is not a federation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This part is arguable, because it isn't a federation indeed, but it's not <em>not</em> one either. </p>

<p>The EU doesn't check any box of existing institutions; it's a <em>sui generis</em> entity that mixes intergovernmental, confederal &amp; federal attributes. It's pretty much unique, and cannot really be compared to anything else.</p>

<p>But you're technically correct.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>EU has actually quite little power. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This part is just downright bullshit, however.</p>

<p>The EU literally has more exclusive regulatory power than the US federal government in several key areas, notably market regulation, labour legislation, environment regulation, and a few others, which are all very much central to the attributes of sovereign states.</p>



<p>That being said, your answer is pretty much irrelevant to the question the OP asked, though. You're missing his point entirely, and it feels like you just wanted to take a jab at the EU.</p>

<p>We all know exercise is good for us. It lowers the risk of heart disease, cancer, and early death, and keeps the body and mind in shape. But when the air you breathe is polluted, a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-025-04496-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new study</a> suggests that exercise might not provide the same benefits it normally would.</p>



<p>An international team, including researchers from University College London (UCL) analyzed health data from over 1.5 million adults, collected over more than a decade in countries including the UK, Taiwan, China, Denmark, and the United States.</p>



<p>The researchers focused on levels of fine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulate_matter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">particulate matter</a>, specifically tiny particles known as <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12916-025-04496-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PM<sub>2.5</sub></a>. These fine particles are smaller than 2.5 micrometers; they can get stuck in the lungs and enter the bloodstream, where they can trigger inflammation and long-term damage.</p>

<p>Researchers found that adults who exercised at least two and a half hours a week—moderate to vigorous activity like jogging or other sports—typically had a 30% lower risk of dying during the study period than less active people. But in areas where the yearly average PM<sub>2.5</sub> exceeded 25 μg/m³, the protective effects of exercise dropped to just 12–15%.</p>



<p>The protective effects of <a href="https://scienceclock.com/why-audiences-doubt-the-most-attractive-fitness-influencers-according-to-new-research/">exercise</a> weaken even further in more polluted regions.

<p>“Our findings emphasise that exercise remains beneficial even in polluted <a href="https://scienceclock.com/category/environment/">environments</a>,” lead researcher Professor Po-Wen Ku <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1107581" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in a statement</a>. “But improving air quality can significantly enhance these health gains.”</p>

<p>Co-author Professor Andrew Steptoe <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1107581" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>, “Our study shows that toxic air can, to some extent, block the benefits of exercise, although not eliminate them. The findings are further evidence of the damage that fine particle pollution can do to <a href="https://scienceclock.com/category/health/">our health</a>.</p>




<p>“We believe clean air and physical activity are both important for healthy ageing, and so we encourage greater efforts to curb health-harming pollution levels.”</p>



<p>The study looked at the data from seven existing studies, including three previously unpublished datasets, combining both summary statistics and raw participant-level data. Researchers carefully accounted for a wide range of other factors, including income, education, smoking, and pre-existing chronic conditions. </p>

<p>However, the team points out that their data mostly comes from high-income countries, so the impact could be greater in low-income regions, where PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels often exceed 50 μg/m³. They also mention the lack of indoor air quality data and limited information on participants’ diets as part of the study’s caveats.</p>




<p>“We don’t want to discourage people from exercising outdoors,” <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1107581" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said </a>Co-author Professor Paola Zaninotto. “Checking air quality, choosing cleaner routes, or easing off intensity on polluted days can help you get the most health benefits from your exercise.”</p>



<p>The study reminds us of one of the world’s most serious problems: <a href="https://scienceclock.com/carbon-offsets-play-a-negligible-role-in-corporate-climate-action-and-emission-reductions/">air pollution</a>. Staying active is not enough to protect your health if the air around you is toxic. Cleaner air and regular exercise go hand in hand, and tackling pollution is not just about the environment—it’s about our bodies too.</p>



<p>The study was published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-025-04496-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>BMC Medicine</em></a>. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="msg_59712"><p>(And Mac OS 8!)</p><p>Hey, guys!</p><p>Surely y'all know and have enjoyed Mac OS 9.2.2 booting and beautifully-running on all four Mac mini G4 models for close to 8 years now. (Wow!)</p><p>Well, that was one massive revolution...</p><p>... But most of us did not think we would live to see the day New World ROM machines, even more so the likes of the Mac mini G4, to NATIVELY boot System 7:</p><p><img src="http://revontulet.org/2025/11/27/ea941d2fe9ea40eda5ef21b98235a199.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480"></p><p>(Gotta love it trying to display 1 GB RAM capacity.)</p><p>Before your eyeballs leave your eyesockets completely, I ought to warn that there's still much to be sorted out in this, especially sound, video and networking (the usual suspects). In other words, your mileage may vary, so keep expectations in check!</p><p><strong>========================================================<br>OK, so HOW in the WORLD is any of this possible?<br>========================================================</strong></p><p>It turned out "New World ROM" Macs had a cousin born out of the clone program (until the usual villain, Steve Jobs, came and killed it), which was an architecture called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Hardware_Reference_Platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CHRP</a>" (pronounced "chirp"). It was the successor to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC_Reference_Platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PReP</a>, but, unlike PReP, Mac OS was also going to be officially-bootable on it. Close to no CHRP machines ever saw the light of the day, thanks to Jobs' return. Nonetheless, Apple internally developed Mac OS 7.6 ~ 8.0 for CHRP systems before it got axed. It's just that they never released it, but the development was done regardless. On October 2025, it turned out someone preserved some of these Mac versions, which were then acquired and preserved and shared with the world. (<a href="http://www.macintoshgarden.org/apps/mac-os-chrp-releases-powerpc-common-hardware-reference-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Macintosh Garden link</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/apple-mac-os-for-CHRP-PowerPC-Common-Hardware-Reference-Platform-Systems-1997/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">archive.org link</a>.)</p><p>Although CHRP was left to die, the so-called "New World ROM" Macs inherited much of its architecture and design. As you probably know, these Macs rely on an extra system file called "Mac OS ROM", whereas "Old World ROM" Macs do not need it, and can use their own actual ROM to get Mac OS going. This meant any Mac OS version unaware of the concept of a Mac OS ROM file could not just simply boot in a New World ROM Mac normally. People were able to boot Mac OS versions as low as 8.1, but not any lower, and that too only for the very first few New World ROM Macs, but none of the later ones, which increasingly had a higher and higher minimum OS version.</p><p>But not anymore, as the following major events happened:</p><p>- The recent Mac OS 8.0 CHRP leaks provided an earlier ROM file that, it turns out, allows regular Mac OS 8.0 to boot, as well. Or, alternatively, the Mac OS ROM file that always worked with Mac OS 8.1 also worked on these Mac OS 8.0 CHRP releases. (Exact details are fuzzy in my memory by now, so someone else might want to correct me if I got something wrong.)</p><p>- The recent Mac OS 7.6 CHRP leak provided an additional System Enabler file, which could be exploited for loading Mac OS ROM files. I forget if that's how it worked out-of-the-box, or if a bit of hacking to the System Enabler was required for that, however what I do remember clearly is that, while the System Enabler was hardcoded so that artifically no OS earlier than 7.6 could use it, the OS version check could be patched out of it, so that System 7.5.x (and potentially earlier) can also use it.<br>In other words, <em>this file is the reason that earlier Mac OS versions can make use of the Mac OS ROM file</em>, thus bringing Mac OS 7.6.1 and earlier potentially to ALL New World ROM Macs!<br>(Trivia tidbit: Apparently this enabler was also present in certain archives of the Mac OS 8.0 betas from when it was still known as "Mac OS 7.7". Oops! This thing was right under our nose all this while!)</p><p>- Of course, as hinted at previously, a System Enabler _alone_ is NOT enough to boot System 7 and the like when even much newer systems that were already aware of the Mac OS ROM file could not boot. The newer the model of the New World ROM Mac, the less you could actually "go back". The reason is simple: Mac OS ROM files, over time through its various versions, would get new features added, BUT also would remove older ones which were required by older OS versions. The solution? Using <a href="https://github.com/elliotnunn/tbxi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ELN's great Mac OS ROM patching tools</a> (plus other tools of his own), "Rairii" AKA "Wack0", known for his amazing PPC Windows NT 3.51 / NT 4.0 project on <a href="https://github.com/Wack0/maciNTosh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PowerMacs</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/Wack0/entii-for-workcubes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo GC / Wii / Wii U</a>, analyzed many of these Mac OS ROM files, and fixed + patched + stitched together new Mac OS ROM files that attempt to keep ALL the old features that were removed AND all the new features that were added. In other words, the ultimate Mac OS ROM file that boots everything and runs everything (roughly-speaking). He also is the one who figured out and hacked the System Enabler to also accept OSes earlier than Mac OS 7.6.</p><p>Keep in mind, however, that this effort essentially allows Macs that are already able to boot SOME version of Mac OS to ALSO boot older versions. But if a given machine cannot boot ANY Mac OS version, such as the two DLSD PowerBook G4s (<a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/powerbook_g4/specs/powerbook_g4_1.67_15_hr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15"</a>, <a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/powerbook_g4/specs/powerbook_g4_1.67_17_hr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">17"</a>), these patches cannot do anything about that: Their incompatibilities need to be addressed first and separately.</p><p>One more interesting thing to note about the similarity between CHRP systems and New World ROM Macs: If you check ANY "Mac OS ROM" file to see its TYPE and CREATOR codes, you will see they are "tbxi" and, you guessed it, "<strong>chrp</strong>", respectively. I couldn't believe "chrp" was in ALL the Mac OS ROM files all these years!</p><p><strong>========================================================<br>Where can I get ahold of this EPIC stuff ? ? ? ? ?<br>========================================================</strong></p><p>Rairii's "super" ROMs are available on <a href="https://github.com/Wack0/universal-tbxi-patchset" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this GitHub repository</a>, under <a href="https://github.com/Wack0/universal-tbxi-patchset/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">releases</a>. You may also fetch the patched System Enabler for Mac OS 7.6.1 and earlier from there, and place it in the System Folder. Make sure to download the files from the latest release there.</p><p>Note that he applied his patches to 3 different versions of the (US) ROMs:</p><p>- 10.2.1 with CPU Software 5.9: The "latest and greatest" Mac OS ROM file of all Mac OS. For reference, this is also the ROM version that the <a href="http://www.macintoshgarden.org/apps/mac-os-9-roms-without-15-gb-limit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.628 GB max RAM Mac OS ROM we have was based on (thus going beyond the 1.5 GB limit)</a>, although do note that the RAM limit break patches are NOT included in this, at least not yet as of the time of writing.</p><p>- 2.5.1: A much earlier version of the ROM, but still new enough to support USB. See the GitHub page for details.</p><p>- 1.7.1: A very early ROM, which can be well-leveraged by very early New World ROM Macs. See the GitHub page for details.</p><p>Note you need ROM version 9.1 or higher to use ATA-6 AKA Ultra ATA/100 AKA Kauai drivers, which are essential on the likes of the Mac mini G4 and the MDD. Special notes for the Mac mini G4 are further down.</p><p><strong>========================================================<br>What is the COMPLETE list of Mac OS versions that now boot?<br>========================================================</strong></p><p>To be exact, this is the complete list of OSes I have attempted, all on the Mac mini G4 1.5GHz model, with the following results:</p><p>- System 6.0.8: <a href="http://revontulet.org/2025/11/27/eecf1c7de4ff43ca851785c566422bd4.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No boot</a>. You get a Happy Mac, followed by a blinking question mark in a floppy icon. (Note: Although this very attempt is UTTERLY insane for multiple technical reasons, it might be not AS seemingly-impossible as one may think, as the 68k emulator resides within the Mac OS ROM file.)</p><p>- System 7.0: <a href="http://revontulet.org/2025/11/27/b1fc8c2fe35d4cd4a5b3bf0047f9d7e2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No boot</a>. You get a Happy Mac, but then a warning window pops up saying System 7.0 cannot boot on this computer.</p><p>- System 7.1.2: <a href="http://revontulet.org/2025/11/27/17bf3873e4c1477899938addae65ab8f.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No boot</a>. You get a Happy Mac, but then a warning window pops up saying System 7.1 cannot boot on this computer.</p><p>- System 7.5: <a href="http://revontulet.org/2025/11/27/ea941d2fe9ea40eda5ef21b98235a199.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BOOTS AND IS STABLE</a>. It requires you to hold shift to turn Extensions (and Control Panels / INITs) off, though, or to get rid of the "Mouse" Control Panel (and possibly more). The system is surprisingly stable! I tested the British version of this one, as Apple's Mac OS Anthology discs did not include the US installers, for some very slacker-y reason.</p><p>- System 7.5.2: <a href="http://revontulet.org/2025/11/27/0ba4006b498a47e78e44b63f51fb0e61.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boots, but very broken, close to nothing works</a>. It could be because System 7.5.2 was always VERY machine-specific, and is apparently one of the most broken versions of Mac OS of ALL time, regardless. The machine-specific enablers, and other things, might be what is making it so unstable.</p><p>- System 7.5.3: <a href="http://revontulet.org/2025/11/27/f7727e4e760447f986ee90cf58e0052f.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BOOTS AND IS STABLE</a>. It requires you to hold shift to turn Extensions (and Control Panels / INITs) off, though, or to get rid of the "Mouse" Control Panel (and possibly more). The system is surprisingly stable!</p><p>- Mac OS 7.6: <a href="http://revontulet.org/2025/11/27/9bc2c9a93e9344aba07960841287a9ab.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BOOTS AND IS STABLE</a>. Holding shift is not required here. What else can I say? It "works".</p><p>- Mac OS 8.1: <a href="http://revontulet.org/2025/11/27/49fd379b1e014e24801968343b71d892.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BOOTS AND IS STABLE</a>. Holding shift is not required here, either. Behaves much the same as the others, except we now have HFS+ by default. Still, it did NOT like me having a 940 GB HFS+ partition, and prompted me to either eject it or format it. (To be fair, older OSes tried to do that, too, but Mac OS 8.1 was THE OS to _officially_ be able to handle HFS+ properly, so there are no excuses for it to fail here. Mac OS 9.2 ~ 9.2.2 all work perfectly with it.)</p><p>- Mac OS 8.5: No boot. Rather, it seems like it WOULD boot, but starting with Mac OS 8.5, Mac OS now always checks to see if the machine you are booting from is within a list of Apple-endorsed machine IDs for the given Mac OS version. In other words, Mac OS 8.5 does not know what the Mac mini G4 is, nor what a G4 Cube is (our Mac mini G4 ROM file makes the mini pretend to be the latter). It seems it should be possible to patch out the machine check. According to Rairii, this should be able to be patched out by disabling such a check on the "boot" resource in the Resource Fork of the System file, in ID 3 (also known as "boot3"). For Mac OS 8.6, it seems like this check happens at the end of boot3, wherever a check for machine ID 406 is located, in which after it's detected, the code checks to see if the exact Mac model is whitelisted or not.</p><p>- Mac OS 8.5.1: <a href="http://revontulet.org/2025/11/27/7502a600acc044069a280aa4b6bccc1c.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No boot</a>. All that applies to Mac OS 8.5 also applies to Mac OS 8.5.1.</p><p>- Mac OS 8.6: <a href="http://revontulet.org/2025/11/27/412760cddd8e4561aac7e16ca413cc04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No boot</a>. It crashes during the start screen, when the loading bar appears, but before the first extension gets to load. See the top-left corner of the picture for a glitchy visual artifact. Same happens if you try to boot with Extensions off.</p><p>- Mac OS 9.0.4: No boot. It crashes during the start screen, when the loading bar appears, but before the first extension gets to load. Same happens if you try to boot with Extensions off. Exact same symptoms as when trying to boot Mac OS 8.6 at least on this mini model, including the visual artifact on the top-left corner.</p><p>- Mac OS 9.1: <a href="http://revontulet.org/2025/11/27/7765c9186c3a43549015719de3a26387.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No boot</a>. It crashes during the start screen, when the loading bar appears, but before the first extension gets to load. Same happens if you try to boot with Extensions off. Exact same symptoms as when trying to boot Mac OS 8.6 and Mac OS 9.0.4 at least on this mini model, including the visual artifact on the top-left corner.</p><p>- Mac OS 9.2 ~ 9.2.2: BEST OS EVER, BOOTS AND RUNS BEAUTIFULLY. 'Nuff said.</p><p>Note that, although I describe many of these as "stable", I mean you can use much of it normally (sound/video/networking aside) without it crashing or misbehaving, at least not too hard, but that is not to say everything works, because that is just not the case. For example, when present, avoid opening the Apple System Profiler, unless you want a massive crash as it struggles trying to profile and gather all the information about your system. Some other apps or Control Panels might either not work, or work up to a certain point, after which they might freeze, requiring you to Force Quit the Finder to keep on going. And so on.</p><p>As you can see, I did not yet try System 7.5.5, Mac OS 7.6.1 and Mac OS 8.0. That's because they all are most likely working exactly as their neighbouring versions. But feel free to confirm.</p><p>Most non-mini systems should be able to boot Mac OS 8.6 ~ Mac OS 9.1 just fine. A "Mac OS 8.6 Enabler", so to speak, by LightBulbFun, can be renamed as e.g. "Sawteeth" and put inside the System Folder for some machines that cannot boot Mac OS 8.6 normally, so that they can, then, boot it. It is actually a Mac OS ROM file, but can function as a complementary, helper file to aid the actual Mac OS ROM file in this case. If you'd like, check <a href="https://68kmla.org/bb/index.php?threads/mac-os-8-6-for-some-unsupported-g3s-and-g4s.46765/page-3#post-575895" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> for more info. I have attached "Sawteeth.bin" to this post for convenience. LightBulbFun first shared it on <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mac-os-8-6-findings-and-ramblings.2021922/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this post</a>, specifically through this <a href="https://mega.nz/file/VUgFAKZR#xXTi_4BK2wJHU8QYCoqyNIjq2aZFPFnM7B4JlmY1lRk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MEGA link</a>.</p><p>Most non-mini systems should also be able to boot Mac OS 8.5 and 8.5.1, especially on G3s and earlier. Some G4 Macs might need to spoof the Mac model in Open Firmware (or some other Forth script added to ROM) to boot, though, or patch the check out like I mentioned for the mini earlier. The reason the mini doesn't have the spoofing as an option is that any spoofing in OF would be overwritten by its own specialized Mac OS ROM, which spoofs a G4 Cube, which is clearly not in the whitelist of supported machines for Mac OS 8.5 and 8.5.1.</p><p>Also note that the mini behaves as reported above with Mac OS 8.6 with or without this "8.6 enabler" file (and with or without the System Enabler for Mac OS 7.6.1 and earlier, both of which don't seem to get in the way of later, nor earlier, OSes).</p><p>Most importantly, I did <em>not</em> yet attempt to identify which are the latest versions of each Control Panel and Extension for each of these OSes. If I did, I'm sure it would help a lot, and perhaps address quite a number of these problems. The more people chime in on this effort, the better! Imagine if we had a proper "Mac mini G4 System 7.5.5" CD, then an "MDD Mac OS 8.5.1" CD, then an "iBook G3 Mac OS 7.6.1" CD, and so on. Everyone with a G3 or G4 Mac can help by trying things out!</p><p>Namely, something akin to MacTron's efforts highlighting the latest Extensions for Mac OS 9.2.2 and Mac OS 8.6 like this, but also for every other Mac OS version:</p><p><img src="http://revontulet.org/2020/01/14/extensions.jpg" alt=""></p><p><strong>========================================================<br>But how did you get the mini to boot? It requires its own special ROM!<br>========================================================</strong></p><p>Indeed it does! All credit goes to ELN and all of those who helped him on Mac OS 9 Lives!: you can simply use his tooling (which was also very useful for Rairii) to re-apply the Mac-mini-G4-specific ROM patches to Rairii's latest 10.2.1 ROM, and voila! It works as well as you would hope it to! </p><p>You can even use the resulting ROM for Mac OS 9.2.2, as well, even though you don't have to: Originally, the Mac mini G4 ROM as we see them in RossDarker's Mac mini G4 CDs version 8 and 9 (AKA v8 and v9), as well as in all the previous versions, were based on the US ROM v9.6.1. I could not find an explanation as to why ROM v10.2.1 wasn't used in the end, even when digging the old Mac mini G4 thread again that started it all. Perhaps because we already had a working ROM with v9.6.1 and did not want to risk breaking anything, or who knows. However, I have thoroughly tested Mac OS 9.2.2 with this new ROM combination (latest Rairii 10.2.1 + latest Mac mini G4 patches AKA v9 patches), and from what I could tell, everything behaves <em>exactly</em> the same as with the previous ROM we always used. Except now we have the ability to use the same ROM to also boot System 7.5 (I still can't believe this, even though it is true).</p><p>(For the record, while the 9.6.1 ROM was also modified to spoof the Mac mini G4 model identifier as a G4 Cube, we also tried to spoof it as a QuickSilver 2002 at one point, but someone reported sound issues with that, and so it was quickly changed back to a G4 Cube and such a change never made it into one of RossDarker's CDs. So just about everyone using Mac OS on the mini for all these years has had a ROM reporting to the OS as a G4 Cube, exclusively.)</p><p>To apply the Mac mini G4 patches, I used ELN's <a href="https://github.com/elliotnunn/tbxi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tbxi</a> and <a href="https://github.com/elliotnunn/tbxi-patches" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tbxi-patches</a> to apply his "macmini.py" script. You can follow the instructions as per the tbxi-patches page, which you should not let intimidate you even if you are not used to this kind of thing. It's quick and easy, and the scripts are also fully-commentated very nicely by ELN if you are curious about what it is doing and why.</p><p>In my case, first I tried using the latest Python 3.13.9 both from Windows 7 (bad idea due to resource fork loss) and macOS 10.14.6 Mojave, but neither worked: it seems like that version of Python was just too new. I then retried with <em>Python 3.8.10</em> instead (which I chose thinking it might be more period-appropriate for the script's age) on Mojave, which worked <em>flawlessly</em>. I didn't try it, but perhaps an older Python version might work on PowerPC OS X, as well.</p><p>I used the Python installer <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">from the official website</a>, and I also used an "official" Git installer from <a href="https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/git-osx-installer/git-2.33.0-intel-universal-mavericks.dmg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> (thus avoiding any package manager headache... man, how I hate non-Mac-OS systems, including OS X, and package managers in general...)</p><p>If somehow someone with plenty of Python knowledge and the willingness to put enough time into it wished to, both tbxi and tbxi-tools could, perhaps, be ported to <a href="http://www.macintoshgarden.org/apps/macpython-233" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MacPython 2.3.5</a>, so that we could do all this patching from Mac OS 9.2.2 directly and natively without leaving our main OS. That would also be awesome! (Of course, it helps that this is also available on more recent systems nonetheless, because then everyone gets to join in on the fun with all kinds of different backgrounds and setups.)</p><p>For convenience, I attached the final patched ROM to this post, so that anyone can go wild on their minis right away!</p><p><strong>========================================================<br>Why should I care when Mac OS 9.2.2 already boots, and runs better?<br>========================================================</strong></p><p>It is also my opinion Mac OS 9.2.2 is the greatest OS, and Mac OS, ever, but not everything that is possible in earlier Mac OS versions is possible in Mac OS 9.2.2. For example, some software requires Mac OS 9.0.4 or earlier to work. A lot of software is System-7-exclusive.</p><p>Some people also just prefer the likes of System 7 for its even-lighter memory footprint, lack of mandated Appearance Manager and the like. Mac OS 9.2.2 is already overkill-fast on the mini, and on most New World ROM Macs, but the likes of System 7.5 are just RIDICULOUSLY fast. Even more ridiculously. I still am trying to come into terms with how indescribably fast using it on the mini was. It got even faster when I thought there was no way to get "faster than instantaneous", as Mac OS 9.2.2 always felt instantaneous like no other system already!</p><p>People might also have some other kind of reason and/or special attachment to an earlier OS version. Or maybe people want to explore older OS APIs and behaviors, perhaps even make a new application they want to know how it will behave on bare-metal not just on Mac OS 9, but also System 7 etc..</p><p>The value is in opening up the doors that give us, the users, more options that help us all out. <img src="https://macos9lives.com/smforum/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt=":)" title="Smiley"></p><p><strong>========================================================<br>Final remarks<br>========================================================</strong></p><p>Above all, thank you to everyone that made this possible. But I wanted to emphasize and give special thanks to Rairii for engineering all these ROMs, Mac84 for archiving and sharing all the CHRP discs, ELN for engineering all the Mac mini G4 ROM compatibility scripts and creating all the ROM and other Mac OS tooling, and to the Mac community at large everywhere that assisted in all of this into becoming reality. There's honestly many, many people to thank we owe over this one way or another, both in small and big ways.</p><p>I can't wait to see what people will do with all these new Mac OS versions on their New World ROM systems over the course of time!</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/363119/every-mathematician-has-only-a-few-tricks">https://mathoverflow.net/questions/363119/every-mathematician-has-only-a-few-tricks</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46084535">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>From a physicist point of view I want to mention this trick and its generalization for operators:</p>
<pre><code>      "Two commuting matrices are simultaneously diagonalizable"
</code></pre>
<p>(for physicists all matrices are diagonalizable). Of course the idea is that if you know the eigenvectors of one matrix/operator then diagonalizing the other one is much easier. Here are some applications.</p>
<p>1)The system is translation invariant : Because the eigenvectors of the translation operator are <span>$e^{ik.x}$</span>, then one should use the Fourier transform.  It solves all the wave equations for light, acoustics, of free quantum electrons or the heat equation in homogeneous media.</p>
<p>2)The system has a discrete translation symmetry: The typical system is the atoms in a solid state that form a crystal. We have a discrete translation operator <span>$T_a\phi(x)=\phi(x+a)$</span> with <span>$a$</span> the size of the lattice and then we should try <span>$\phi_k(x+a)=e^{ik.a}\phi_k(x)$</span> as it is an eigenvector of <span>$T_a$</span>. This gives the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch%27s_theorem" rel="noreferrer">Bloch</a>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floquet_theory" rel="noreferrer">Floquet</a> theory where the spectrum is divided into band structure. It is one of the most famous model of condensed matter as it explains the different between conductors or insulators.</p>
<p>3)The system is rotational invariant: One should then use and diagonalize the rotation operator first. This will allow us to find the eigenvalue/eigenvectors of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_atom" rel="noreferrer">Hydrogen atom</a>. By the way we notice the eigenspace of the Hydrogen are stable by rotation and are therefore finite dimension representations of <span>$SO(3)$</span>. The irreducible representations of <span>$SO(3)$</span> have dimension 1,3,5,... and they appears, considering also the spin of the electron, as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_shell" rel="noreferrer">columns</a> of the periodic table of the elements (2,6,10,14,...).</p>
<p>4)<span>$SU(3)$</span> symmetry: Particle physics is extremely complicated. However physicists have discovered that there is an underlying <span>$SU(3)$</span> symmetry. Then considering the representations of <span>$SU(3)$</span> the zoology of particles seems much more organized (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clebsch%E2%80%93Gordan_coefficients_for_SU(3)#/media/File:Baryon-decuplet.svg" rel="noreferrer">A</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meson#/media/File:Meson_nonet_-_spin_0.svg" rel="noreferrer">B</a>).</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2025/11/28/tricusp-triangle/">https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2025/11/28/tricusp-triangle/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46084122">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<h2>Spherical geometry</h2>
<p>In spherical geometry, the interior angles of a triangle add up to more than π. And in fact you can determine the area of a spherical triangle by how much the angle sum exceeds π. On a sphere of radius 1, the area equals the <strong>triangle excess</strong></p>
<p>Area = <em>E</em> = interior angle sum − π.</p>
<p>Small triangles have interior angle sum near π. But you could, for example, have a triangle with three right angles: put a vertex on the north pole and two vertices on the equator 90° longitude apart.</p>
<h2>Hyperbolic geometry</h2>
<p>In hyperbolic geometry, the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always less than π. In a space with curvature −1, the area equals the <strong>triangle defect</strong>, the difference between π and the angle sum.</p>
<p>Area =&nbsp;<em>D</em> = π − interior angle sum.</p>
<p>Again small triangles have an interior angle sum near π. Both spherical and hyperbolic geometry are locally Euclidean.</p>
<p>The interior angle sum can be any value less than π, and so as the angle sum goes to 0, the triangle defect, and hence the area, goes to π. Since the minimum angle sum is 0, the maximum area of a triangle is π.</p>
<p>The figure below has interior angle sum 0 and area π in hyperbolic geometry.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.johndcook.com/tricusp.png" width="500" height="252"></p>
<p>Strictly speaking this is an improper triangle because the three hyperbolic lines (i.e. half circles) don’t intersect within the hyperbolic plane per se but at ideal points on the real axis. But you could come as close to this triangle as you like, staying within the hyperbolic plane.</p>
<p>Note that the radii of the (Euclidean) half circles doesn’t change the area. Any three semicircles that intersect on the real line as above make a triangle with the same area. Note also that the triangle has infinite perimeter but finite area.</p>

            <p>Django 6.0 introduces a built-in background tasks framework in <code>django.tasks</code>. But don't expect to phase out Celery, Huey or other preferred solutions just yet. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/releases/6.0/#background-tasks">release notes</a> are quite clear on this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Django handles task creation and queuing, but <strong>does not provide a worker mechanism to run tasks.</strong>
Execution must be managed by external infrastructure, such as a separate process or service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main purpose of the new <code>django.tasks</code> module is to <strong>provide a common API for task queues</strong> implementations. <a href="https://theorangeone.net/">Jake Howard</a> is the driving force behind this enhancement. Check out the introduction on <a href="https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/django-tasks-bringing-background-workers-in-to-django-core/32967">the Django forum</a>.</p>
<p>His reference implementation, and simultaneously a backport for earlier versions of Django, is available <a href="https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/django-tasks/">as <code>django-tasks</code> on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>But let's ignore that and play with the more minimal version included in Django 6.0 instead. By creating our very own backend and worker.</p>
<h2>Our project: notifications</h2>
<p>We're going to create an app to send notifications to phones and other devices using <a href="https://ntfy.sh/">ntfy.sh</a>. (<a href="https://roam.be/notes/2025/ping-me-using-ntfy-to-stay-updated/">I'm a fan!</a>)</p>
<p>If you prefer to dive into the code yourself, check out <a href="https://github.com/roam/django-tasks-demo">the final version of the project on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>All that's required to send a notification to your phone using nfty is:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://ntfy.sh/signup">Register for an account</a></li>
<li>Create a topic.</li>
<li>Install the app for your phone and log in.</li>
<li>Send HTTP requests to <code>https://ntfy.sh/&lt;yourtopic&gt;</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The free version only provides public topics and messages. Meaning anyone can see the stuff you're sending <em>if</em> they subscribe to the topic. For our purpose we can simply create a topic with a randomized name, like a UUID.</p>
<p>The project's settings expect the URL from step 4 to be supplied as an environment variable. For example:</p>
<p><code>NTFY_URL=https://ntfy.sh/062519693d9c4913826f0a39aeea8a4c</code></p>
<p>Here's our function that does the heavy lifting:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>httpx</span>
<span>from</span><span> </span><span>django.conf</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>settings</span>

<span>def</span><span> </span><span>send_notification</span><span>(</span><span>message</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>title</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span> <span>|</span> <span>None</span><span>):</span>
    <span># Pass the title if specified.</span>
    <span>headers</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>"title"</span><span>:</span> <span>title</span><span>}</span> <span>if</span> <span>title</span> <span>else</span> <span>{}</span>
    <span>httpx</span><span>.</span><span>post</span><span>(</span>
        <span>settings</span><span>.</span><span>NTFY_URL</span><span>,</span>
        <span>content</span><span>=</span><span>message</span><span>,</span>
        <span>headers</span><span>=</span><span>headers</span><span>,</span>
    <span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Really. That's all there is to it to start sending and receiving notifications.</p>
<p><img src="https://roam.be/media/img/2025/ntfy-notifications.png" alt="Ntfy notifications"></p>
<h2>A quick primer</h2>
<p>You really should have a look at the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/topics/tasks/">Django documentation on the Task framework</a> for details, but we'll save you a bit of time and give a quick primer.</p>
<h3>Defining a task</h3>
<p>This is the main goal of the new framework: defining tasks using Django's standard API, rather than using task queue specific decorators, or other methods.</p>
<p>So here it goes:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># ...</span>
<span>from</span><span> </span><span>django.tasks</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>task</span>

<span>@task</span>
<span>def</span><span> </span><span>send_notification</span><span>(</span><span>message</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>title</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span> <span>|</span> <span>None</span><span>):</span>
    <span># ...as before</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Our function is now a task. In fact it's a <code>django.tasks.Task</code>. </p>
<p>You cannot call <code>send_notification</code> directly anymore. Tasks can only be run by using the <code>enqueue</code> method. It might not be the behavior you'd expect or want, but this seems to be the best option. This design eliminates the possibility of accidentally invoking a task in-process, rather than in the background.</p>
<p>The <code>task</code> decorator allows you to specify the task's priority, queue name and backend name. You can override these settings with the <code>using</code> method, which returns a new <code>django.tasks.Task</code> instance.</p>
<p>If you need more control over task behavior, you can set <code>takes_context</code> to <code>True</code> in the decorator and add <code>context</code> as the first argument. This context currently provides you with access to the task result and thereby useful information like the number of attempts. </p>
<p>There's no way of defining retries and backoffs, or other fancy things you might expect from a full-blown task queue implementation. But that's <em>not</em> what this is. You can easily add your own retry logic by inspecting the task context if needed.</p>
<h3>Enqueuing a task</h3>
<p>Adding a task to the queue is easy:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>task_result</span> <span>=</span> <span>send_notification</span><span>.</span><span>enqueue</span><span>(</span>
    <span>message</span><span>=</span><span>"Season's greeting!"</span><span>,</span> 
    <span>title</span><span>=</span><span>"Santa has something to tell you"</span>
<span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>Executing a task</h3>
<p>This is where things start to fall short. At least right now. Django 6.0 will ship with the <code>ImmediateBackend</code> and the <code>DummyBackend</code>. The first will execute the task immediately, while the latter will not execute the task at all. </p>
<p>Which is why our project includes a (demo) backend backed by the database and a worker process!</p>
<h3>Fetching the result</h3>
<p>If you're not going to wait around for the result, you can get a hold of it later on using its id. Simply call <code>get_result(result_id)</code> on your task. </p>
<p>Our project includes a view that's polled periodically for outstanding results using <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a>. </p>
<p><img src="https://roam.be/media/img/2025/ui.png" alt="Project UI"></p>
<p>The list underneath the form shows the results for each execution of our task. When the form's submitted, a new result is added to the top of the list. Htmx is instructed to keep polling for changes as long as the result's status isn't <code>FAILED</code> or <code>SUCCESSFUL</code>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>task_result</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>,</span> <span>result_id</span><span>,</span> <span>status</span><span>):</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>send_notification</span><span>.</span><span>get_result</span><span>(</span><span>result_id</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>result</span><span>.</span><span>status</span> <span>==</span> <span>status</span><span>:</span>
        <span># No need to swap the result.</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>HttpResponse</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>=</span><span>204</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>TemplateResponse</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>,</span> <span>"index.html#result"</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>"result"</span><span>:</span> <span>result</span><span>})</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Wondering what <code>index.html#results</code> is doing? Django 6.0 also introduces <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/releases/6.0/#template-partials">template partials</a>. In this case our view effectively sends a response containing only the template partial named <code>result</code>.</p>
<h2>Behind the scenes</h2>
<p>When you decorate a callable with <code>task</code>, the configured backend's <code>task_class</code> is used to wrap the callable. The default's <code>django.task.Task</code>.</p>
<p>That class's <code>enqueue</code> method will in turn invoke the configured backend's <code>enqueue</code> method.</p>
<p>Calling its <code>get_result</code> method is similar: call the configured backend's <code>get_result</code> method and pass on the result.</p>
<p>Since there's no workers, that's basically all a task backend needs to provide. Cool. Let's add one, shall we?</p>
<h2>A task database backend</h2>
<p>Our goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>A basic task backend, backed by our database.</li>
<li>We want to support "automagic" retries</li>
</ul>
<p>Our <code>enqueue</code> and <code>get_result</code> methods will return an instance of the default <code>django.tasks.TaskResult</code>. This determines the minimum amount of data we need to store, and we're going to do so in a model called <code>Task</code>.</p>
<h3>Models</h3>
<p>Let's create a first draft of our <code>Task</code> model, based on the properties of <code>TaskResult</code> and <code>Task</code> in <code>django.tasks</code> (the "dataclasses"):</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>Task</span><span>(</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Model</span><span>):</span>

</pre></div>
<p>What's missing? For one, the <code>TaskResult</code> also includes a list of encountered errors, and ids of the workers that processed the task. Something that we could <em>perhaps</em> ignore. </p>
<p>Except the <code>TaskResult.attempts</code> property is based on the number of worker ids. And if you're using the task context within a task, you're bound to be relying on that type of information.</p>
<p>We could add these details to the <code>Task</code> model by adding a <code>JSONField</code> for each. This is the current approach in the reference implementation. </p>
<p>But let's be more explicit in our approach and define models for these as well. We'll record each attempt to execute a task and its potential error, linking them to the task with a foreign key:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Model</span><span>):</span>
    <span>exception_class_path</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>TextField</span><span>()</span>
    <span>traceback</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>TextField</span><span>()</span>

</pre></div>
<p>This setup ensures we have all necessary information to execute a task, plus we can provide every single bit of detail when a <code>TaskResult</code> is requested.</p>
<p>All fine and dandy, but we need to think about the worker's requirements as well. It needs to be able to: </p>
<ol>
<li>Quickly check for outstanding tasks</li>
<li>Claim one of those tasks</li>
<li>Process that task and either mark it as failed, successful or ready (to retry later)</li>
</ol>
<p>We could do all of that with how it's set up right now, but I'd like to refine things a bit.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>Task</span><span>(</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Model</span><span>):</span>
    <span># ...</span>
    <span># This field is used to keep track of when to run a task (again).</span>
    <span># run_after remains unchanged after enqueueing.</span>
    <span>available_after</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>DateTimeField</span><span>()</span>
    <span># Denormalized count of attempts.</span>
    <span>attempt_count</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>IntegerField</span><span>(</span><span>default</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
    <span># Set when a worker starts processing this task.</span>
    <span>worker_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>CharField</span><span>(</span><span>max_length</span><span>=</span><span>MAX_LENGTH_WORKER_ID</span><span>,</span> <span>blank</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
    <span># ...</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The <code>available_after</code> field will contain the earliest time at which the task can be executed. If the task's <code>run_after</code> is specified (which can be done by using a task's... <code>using()</code> method), <code>available_after</code> is set to that value. Otherwise we're using the current datetime; all in UTC.</p>
<p>Once a task needs to be retried, <code>available_after</code> will be set to the next possible point in time the task can be executed. In other words: we can <strong>back off.</strong></p>
<p>The <code>attempt_count</code> field makes querying for available tasks a bit easier. Any tasks with an <code>attempt_count</code> greater than the maximum allowed value can be ignored. Yes, their status should have been set to <code>FAILED</code> which means they should be excluded by default, but we could change the configuration and tweak the maximum number of attempts.</p>
<p>The <code>worker_id</code> field is filled when a worker claims a task. This, among other things, prevents any other workers from picking up the task. Assuming the worker id is unique.</p>
<h3>Enqueueing and fetching a result</h3>
<p>Enqueueing a task could not be easier: create a <code>Task</code> <em>model instance</em> from the <code>Task</code> <em>dataclass instance</em>, save it, done! Well, at least after turning the end result into a <code>TaskResult</code>. </p>
<p>We use the string version of the model's database id as the id of the result.</p>
<p>Retrieving a result is likewise only a matter of loading the task and its attempts, and turning that into a <code>TaskResult</code>. </p>
<p>Here's a simplified version of our task backend as it stands:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>DatabaseBackend</span><span>(</span><span>BaseTaskBackend</span><span>):</span>
    <span>supports_defer</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>

            <span># ...</span>
            <span># More properties being set</span>
            <span># ...</span>
        <span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>task_result</span>

    <span>def</span><span> </span><span>get_result</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>result_id</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>model_to_result</span><span>(</span>
            <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>queue_store</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>result_id</span><span>)</span>
        <span>)</span>

    <span>def</span><span> </span><span>model_to_result</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>model</span><span>:</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Task</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>TaskResult</span><span>:</span>
        <span>...</span>
</pre></div>
<p>At lot of functionality is deferred to this <code>queue_store</code> property. Before we dive into that, we'll explain the configuration options for this backend.</p>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>We want to be able to specify defaults for:</p>
<ul>
<li>the maximum number of attempts (retries)</li>
<li>the backoff factor; i.e. we'll back off using <code>math.pow(factor, attempts)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These can be customized for each individual queue. So we end up with something like this in our <code>OPTIONS</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>TASKS</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"default"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>"BACKEND"</span><span>:</span> <span>"messagecenter.dbtasks.backend.DatabaseBackend"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"OPTIONS"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>"queues"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>"low_priority"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
                    <span>"max_attempts"</span><span>:</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span>
                <span>}</span>
            <span>},</span>
            <span>"max_attempts"</span><span>:</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span>
            <span>"backoff_factor"</span><span>:</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span>
            <span>"purge"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>"finished"</span><span>:</span> <span>"10 days"</span><span>,</span> <span>"unfinished"</span><span>:</span> <span>"20 days"</span><span>},</span>
        <span>},</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>A task added to the <code>low_priority</code> queue will be attempted up to five times, with a backoff factor of <code>3</code>. Other tasks will be attempted up to ten times with the same backoff factor.</p>
<h3>Queue store</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/roam/django-tasks-demo/blob/main/src/messagecenter/dbtasks/backend.py#L279"><code>QueueStore</code> class</a> is a companion of our backend. It's focus is on retrieving and enqueueing tasks, checking for tasks to execute and claiming tasks. </p>
<p>However the main reason it's included is to simplify the worker. As we'll see, the worker gets it's own copy of the queue store, <em>limited to the queues it needs to process.</em></p>
<h3>The worker</h3>
<p>The worker's job, at least in this project, is to provide information on outstanding tasks to the runner and to drive the processing of those tasks <em>by the backend</em>. Which means it looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>Worker</span><span>:</span>
    <span>def</span><span> </span><span>__init__</span><span>(</span>

</pre></div>
<p>All we need to do to have a functioning worker runner:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an instance of the worker.</li>
<li>Ask it if there's tasks to execute using <code>has_more</code>.</li>
<li>If so: tell it to <code>process</code> the first available task. If not: go to 4.</li>
<li>Wait, then return to 2.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's what our <a href="https://github.com/roam/django-tasks-demo/blob/main/src/messagecenter/dbtasks/management/commands/dbtasks_worker.py"><code>dbtasks_worker</code> command</a> does.</p>
<h3>Claiming a task</h3>
<p>Our queue store provides a <code>peek</code> method which returns the id of the task in our queues with the most urgency; a combination of <code>available_after</code>, <code>priority</code> and <code>attempt_count</code>.</p>
<p>This lets the runner know whether there's more tasks to process. The next step is to claim one of those tasks. So we call <code>peek</code> again and if it returns a task id, we'll try to claim that particular task.</p>
<p>Here's a more basic, clearer version than the one included in our project's <code>QueueStore</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>claim_first_available</span><span>(</span>
    <span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>worker_id</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>attempts</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Task</span> <span>|</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
    <span>qs</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Task</span><span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span>
        <span>worker_id</span><span>=</span><span>""</span><span>,</span> 
        <span>status</span><span>=</span><span>TaskResultStatus</span><span>.</span><span>READY</span><span>,</span>
    <span>)</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>_</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>attempts</span><span>):</span>
        <span>task_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>peek</span><span>()</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>not</span> <span>task_id</span><span>:</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>None</span>
        <span>count</span> <span>=</span> <span>qs</span><span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>pk</span><span>=</span><span>task_id</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>update</span><span>(</span>
            <span>worker_id</span><span>=</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>id_</span><span>,</span>
            <span>status</span><span>=</span><span>TaskResultStatus</span><span>.</span><span>RUNNING</span><span>,</span>
        <span>)</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>count</span><span>:</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Task</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>pk</span><span>=</span><span>task_id</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>None</span>
</pre></div>
<p>If the <code>count</code> is zero, we failed to claim the task. Otherwise we retrieve it from the database and can start processing. </p>
<p>The loop is included because we ended up here after trying to claim the task identified by <code>peek</code>. Which apparently has already been picked up by another worker. We might as well make the most of it and try to grab another task from the queue.</p>
<h3>Processing the task</h3>
<p>And finally the thing that actually does something!</p>
<p>The <code>process_task</code> method of our backend:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creates an <code>Attempt</code> and constructs the current <code>TaskResult</code>.</li>
<li>Executes the task, capturing anything extending <code>BaseException</code>, or returning the <code>return_value</code> of the task when everything went according to plan.</li>
<li>Either updates the <code>Task</code> model, the <code>Attempt</code> <em>and</em> the <code>TaskResult</code> with the final details of the successful execution, or with details about the failure to do so.</li>
<li>And in the latter case: check if the task can be retried.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again: if you want to dive into the details, have a look at <a href="https://github.com/roam/django-tasks-demo">the repository</a>.</p>
<h2>That's it</h2>
<p>Of course this demo project leaves out all the things you really need to think hard about. Like signals for the worker. Or database transaction logic. That's not to say it's impossible. Far from it. It just wasn't the goal of this article.</p>
<p>The inclusion of this functionality in Django will certainly allow new libraries or adapters for existing task queues to pop up. And we'll probably soon see some complaints that <code>django.tasks</code> isn't extensive enough.</p>
<p>Because, if you're currently using the more advanced functionality of your task queue, there's probably a few things you're missing in <code>django.tasks</code>.</p>
<h3>Complex orchestration</h3>
<p>Some task queue libraries, like Celery, provide ways of combining tasks. You can feed the result of one task into another, enqueue tasks for each item in a list, and so on.</p>
<p>It should be clear by now that supporting this kind of orchestration isn't the goal of <code>django.tasks</code>. And I don't mind at all. There's no feasible way of creating a unified API to support this. I've had my share of problems with libraries that <em>do</em> claim to support it.</p>
<h3>Retry</h3>
<p>As mentioned before, there's currently no way to automatically retry a failed task, unless your backend does the heavy lifting. Like ours does. </p>
<p>Depending on your backend this might be easy enough to handle yourself. For example using a decorator:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>retry</span><span>(</span><span>func</span><span>):</span>
    <span>@functools</span><span>.</span><span>wraps</span><span>(</span><span>func</span><span>)</span>

        <span>except</span> <span>BaseException</span> <span>as</span> <span>e</span><span>:</span>

<p>True. But the <a href="https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/django-tasks/">reference implementation</a> does provide actual workers. Be patient, or even better: start helping out!</p>
<h2>There is no perfect solution</h2>
<p>I reckon <code>django.tasks</code> will soon result in covering at least the most common 80% of use cases. Yes, its API is simple and limited, but to me that's more a benefit rather than a fault. I think this is as close as you can get to a standardized approach.</p>

		<p>According to aviation insiders, there’s a possible grounding of Airbus narrowbodies coming worldwide. Watchdog <b>JonNYC</b> was first to share this information.  However I do not expect aircraft to be grounded for long, and I’d expect a staggering to minimize flight disruptions.
</p><blockquote>
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">also 100%++ unconfirmed</p>
<p>"someone says AA Will be doing cxl package for A320 fleet … but this will effect ALL a320 worldwide</p>
<p>",mandatory software update"</p>
<p>— JonNYC (@xJonNYC) <a href="https://twitter.com/xJonNYC/status/1994452977218670968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">All signs say this A320 issue is accurate, airworthiness directive from Airbus imminent </p>
<p>Unconfirmed</p>
<p>— JonNYC (@xJonNYC) <a href="https://twitter.com/xJonNYC/status/1994454548488843704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Jon <a href="https://x.com/xJonNYC/status/1994455143656366494" target="_blank">suggests</a> that the issue is an with an aileron computer.  This was <a href="https://airlinegeeks.com/2025/11/05/a320s-sudden-descent-linked-to-faulty-computer/" target="_blank">identified as the cause</a> of a JetBlue A320 issue on October 30th where a Cancun to Newark flight “unexpectedly pitched downward without pilot input” and diverted to Tampa. The Thales ELAC 2 computer malfunctioned and was replaced.  This interpets pilot commands to control the aircraft.  </p>
<p>10-15 passengers <a href="https://avherald.com/h?article=52f1ffc3&amp;opt=0" target="_blank">were hospitalized</a> after the aircraft rapidly descended without being instructed by pilots to do so.  The uncontrolled descent “likely occurred during an ELAC switch change” according to the National Transportation Safety Board.  This is not supposed to happen!  If there’s an issue with one ELAC computer, the other is supposed to take control without missing a beat.  </p>	<!-- /1019006/BoardingArea_DynamicContent -->
	
	
<p>Presumably, then, what’s being anticipated is a requirement related to these computers.<br>
</p><ul><li>Each aircraft has two, supplied primarily by Thales. There’s also a repair and overhaul ecosystem, not just new equipment production. 
</li><li>The U.S. FAA <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/06/20/2018-12885/airworthiness-directives-airbus-airplanes" target="_blank">proposed an airworthiness directive in 2018</a> requiring all ELAC units on Airbus A320 family aircraft to be upgraded with new software or replaced with upgraded units due to angle of attack issues. 
</li><li>With about 10,000 A320-family aircraft in service (all variants and engine options), you can’t just pull and replace every ELAC on the planet quickly.  The FAA airworthiness directive used compliance windows and software load options.  </li></ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://viewfromthewing.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_3266_zpsd3d82b341.jpg"></p>
<p>I’m fascinated to see how this plays out, because the suggestion is there will be an immediate flight cancellation package, while I’d expect it to be small.  Normally you’d expect to see a software upgrade loaded onto existing boxes first, with staggered compliance (different deadlines by serial number, block or hours flown, often tied to C-check/D-check intervals). Meanwhile, Airbus, Thales and Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul shops would ramp production and repair.</p>	<!-- /1019006/BoardingArea_DynamicContent -->
	
	
<p>That is, unless the issue that’s been found is more significant than much of what we’ve seen in the past (on the scale of 737 MAX MCAS system which grounded that aircraft), I’d expect cancellations to be minor and phased.  So I’ll be watching to see exactly what happens here.  JonNYC notes that tomorrow’s flights with these aircraft do not currently show any cancellations.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://viewfromthewing.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/frontier-airlines.jpg"></p>
<p>And indeed, Jon now confirms that it’s a software upgrade that’s expected:</p>
<blockquote>
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I consider this fully confirmed at this point. ELAC , software update needed.</p>
<p>Should take a couple hours for each plane, will take longer on some than others. Plan with FAA being worked on now. <a href="https://t.co/v8fEgne6wv">https://t.co/v8fEgne6wv</a></p>
<p>— JonNYC (@xJonNYC) <a href="https://twitter.com/xJonNYC/status/1994455745811644439?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Airbus, for its part, has <a href="https://www.airbus.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-11-airbus-update-on-a320-family-precautionary-fleet-action" target="_blank">issued a vaguely-worded statement</a> that “intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls” and that they have:</p>
<blockquote><p>[W]orked proactively with the aviation authorities to request immediate precautionary action from operators via an Alert Operators Transmission (AOT) in order to implement the available software and/or hardware protection, and ensure the fleet is safe to fly. </p>
<p>…Airbus acknowledges these recommendations will lead to operational disruptions to passengers and customers.</p></blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://viewfromthewing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/a321neo.jpg"></p>
<p>Specific details of timing and flight cancellations will be forthcoming. </p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-11-13-electron-vs-tauri/">https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-11-13-electron-vs-tauri/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46082291">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="blog-post-text" data-astro-cid-fzx4jmue=""> <p>The <a href="https://github.com/dolthub/dolt-workbench/">Dolt Workbench</a> is an open-source SQL workbench supporting MySQL, Postgres, <a href="https://github.com/dolthub/dolt">Dolt</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/dolthub/doltgresql">Doltgres</a> databases. We built the workbench using <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a>, which is a popular framework that allows you to convert web apps built with traditional web technologies like HTML, CSS, and Javascript to desktop applications. Since the workbench shares much in common with <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/">DoltHub</a> and <a href="https://hosted.doltdb.com/">Hosted Dolt</a>, the architecture is very similar to those products. That is, the workbench uses <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> for the frontend with an additional GraphQL layer that handles database interactions. For this reason, it made a lot of sense to use Electron to get the desktop version of our application up and running.</p>
<p>That said, Electron comes with a few rather significant drawbacks, and those drawbacks have started to become more apparent as the workbench has matured. Because of this, I spent some time exploring <a href="https://v2.tauri.app/">Tauri</a>, a newer framework that supports the same web-to-desktop use case as Electron. In this article, we’ll discuss how well Electron and Tauri integrate with the workbench, and weigh some pros and cons between the two frameworks.</p>
<h2 id="nextjs-support">Next.js Support<a aria-label="Link to heading" href="#nextjs-support">#</a></h2>
<p>Next.js doesn’t translate very cleanly to a desktop application context. This is primarily due to the framework’s architecture around server-side rendering and API routing features. In a desktop app, there’s no application server interacting with a client; we just need to render HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a window. For these reasons, Electron only loosely supports Next.js applications. That’s not to say you can’t build an Electron app with Next.js, but it requires some workarounds to make it function properly. One of the more popular workarounds is a project called <a href="https://github.com/saltyshiomix/nextron">Nextron</a>, which aims to wire Next.js applications to the Electron framework and streamline the build process. This is the project we use for the workbench. The issue is that, at the time of writing, it appears that Nextron is no longer being maintained, and we started hitting a few bugs with it.</p>
<p>Tauri is largely frontend-framework agnostic. For Next, specifically, you still can’t use the server-side features, but Tauri makes the integration process much simpler by relying on Next’s static-site generation capabilities. To make a Next app work with Tauri, you just need to set <code>output: 'export'</code> in your Next configuration file, and Tauri handles the rest.</p>
<h2 id="the-webview">The Webview<a aria-label="Link to heading" href="#the-webview">#</a></h2>
<p>The biggest difference between Electron and Tauri comes from how they render the UI. The Electron framework comes with a full Chromium browser engine bundled in your application, which is the same engine that backs Google Chrome. This is useful because it means you don’t have to worry about browser compatibility issues. Regardless of the end user’s machine or architecture, the same Chromium instance renders your application UI. This results in a very standardized experience that ensures your app will look the same regardless of where it’s running. However, this also results in a fair amount of bloat. For the vast majority of desktop apps, a full Chromium browser engine is overkill. Even the simplest “Hello World” applications using Electron can run you up to 150 megabytes of disk space.</p>
<p>Tauri solves this problem by leveraging the system’s native webview. Instead of bundling a full browser engine, Tauri uses a library called <a href="https://crates.io/crates/wry/0.33.0">WRY</a>, which provides a cross-platform interface to the appropriate webview for the operating system. As you’d expect, this makes Tauri apps far more lightweight. The downside here is that you no longer have a hard guarantee on compatibility. From what I can tell, however, this mostly seems to be a non-issue. Compatibility issues across system webviews are exceedingly rare, especially for the major operating systems.</p>
<h2 id="nodejs-vs-rust">Node.js vs. Rust<a aria-label="Link to heading" href="#nodejs-vs-rust">#</a></h2>
<p>Another major difference between the two frameworks is how they handle the “main” process. This refers to the backend process that orchestrates the application windows, menus, and other components of a desktop app that require interaction with system APIs. In Electron, the main process runs in a Node.js environment. This means you get access to all the typical Node APIs, you can import things like normal, and, perhaps most importantly, you can write your Electron-specific code in pure JavaScript. This is a huge bonus for Electron’s target audience: web developers.</p>
<p>Tauri, on the other hand, uses Rust. All the framework code and the main process entrypoint are written in Rust. Obviously, this makes it a bit less accessible to the average web developer. That said, Tauri provides a fairly robust set of JavaScript APIs to interact with the Rust layer. For most applications, these APIs will be sufficient to do what you need to do. In the case of the workbench, I was able to fully replicate the functionality of the Electron version using the JavaScript APIs and some minimal Rust code.</p>
<p>In my experience, I found the Tauri APIs to fit more naturally in our application code. With Electron, if you need the main process to do something, you must always use inter-process communication, even for the simplest of tasks. If you want to write to a file on the host machine, for instance, your frontend needs to send a signal to the Electron main process, which will then spawn a new process and run the function you wrote that performs the write. With Tauri, you can just use Tauri’s filesystem API directly in your application code. Under the hood, the same sort of IPC pattern is happening, but I think the Tauri abstraction is a bit nicer.</p>
<h2 id="sidecars">Sidecars<a aria-label="Link to heading" href="#sidecars">#</a></h2>
<p>Since Electron runs on Node.js, it also bundles a full Node.js runtime with your application. This comes with some pros and cons. For the workbench, specifically, this is beneficial because the GraphQL layer is itself a separate Node.js application that needs to run alongside the frontend. Since Electron ships with Node.js, this means we can directly spin up the GraphQL server from the Electron main process using the Node runtime. This eliminates a lot of the headache associated with bundling and running a typical sidecar process. For instance, our app also ships with a copy of Dolt, which allows users to start up local Dolt servers directly from the workbench. To make this work, we have to bundle the appropriate Dolt binary with each workbench release that corresponds to the correct architecture. Without the Node runtime, we’d have to do something similar for the GraphQL layer.</p>
<p>With Tauri, this is exactly the problem we run into. To get around it, we need to compile the GraphQL server into a binary using a tool like <code>pkg</code>, then run it as a sidecar the same way we run Dolt. Thankfully, this seems to be a fairly common use case for Tauri applications, and they have a useful guide on <a href="https://v2.tauri.app/learn/sidecar-nodejs/">how to run Node.js apps as a sidecar</a>.</p>
<p>It’s also worth mentioning that the full Node.js runtime is quite heavy, which also contributes to bloated Electron app sizes. After building the workbench using both Electron and Tauri, the difference in size was substantial. The left is the Electron version and the right is Tauri:</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations<a aria-label="Link to heading" href="#limitations">#</a></h2>
<p>After replicating the workbench’s functionality in Tauri, we’re holding off on making the full transition for a couple reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4818">Lack of support for .appx and .msix bundles on Windows</a> - Currently, Tauri only support .exe and .msi bundles on Windows. This means your Microsoft Store entry will only link to the unpacked application. The workbench is currently bundled and published using the .appx format. To address this, we would need to take down the workbench entirely from the Microsoft store and create a new application that uses the .exe format.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/6052">Issues with MacOS universal binaries</a> - This is more an annoyance than a bug, but I ran into a few issues related to codesigning universal binaries for MacOS. Namely, Tauri doesn’t seem to be able to create Mac universal binaries from their arm64 and x64 subcomponents. It also seems to be codesigning the Mac builds twice.</li>
</ol>
<p>Neither of these are hard blockers, but they’re annoying enough that I’m holding off on migrating until they’re resolved or our issues with Nextron become more problematic. For now, I’m leaving <a href="https://github.com/dolthub/dolt-workbench/pull/672">my branch with the migration</a> open and hope to revisit soon. If you’re on the Tauri team, let us know if you have solutions!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a aria-label="Link to heading" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Overall, I’m impressed with Tauri. It eliminates much of the classic Electron bloat and integrates naturally with our existing codebase. If you’re curious about Tauri or the Dolt Workbench, let us know on <a href="https://discord.gg/gqr7K4VNKe">Discord</a>.</p> </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><header></header><section><p>Every couple of years <a href="https://ziglang.org/news/migrating-from-github-to-codeberg/">somebody</a> <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/10362">notices</a> that large tech companies sometimes produce surprisingly sloppy code. If you haven’t worked at a big company, it might be hard to understand how this happens. Big tech companies pay well enough to attract many competent engineers. They move slowly enough that it looks like they’re able to take their time and do solid work. How does bad code happen?</p>
<h3>Most code changes are made by relative beginners</h3>
<p>I think the main reason is that <strong>big companies are full of engineers working outside their area of expertise</strong>. The average big tech employee stays for only <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/04/19/whats-the-average-tenure-of-an-engineer-at-a-big-tech-company-ep-434/">a year or two</a><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>. In fact, big tech compensation packages are typically designed to put a four-year cap on engineer tenure: after four years, the initial share grant is fully vested, causing engineers to take what can be a 50% pay cut. Companies do extend temporary yearly refreshes, but it obviously incentivizes engineers to go find another job where they don’t have to wonder if they’re going to get the other half of their compensation each year.</p>
<p>If you count internal mobility, it’s even worse. The longest I have ever stayed on a single team or codebase was three years, near the start of my career. I expect to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDcaRklX7q4">re-orged</a> at least every year, and often much more frequently.</p>
<p>However, the average tenure of a codebase in a big tech company is a lot longer than that. Many of the services I work on are a decade old or more, and have had many, many different owners over the years. That means many big tech engineers are constantly “figuring it out”. <strong>A pretty high percentage of code changes are made by “beginners”:</strong> people who have onboarded to the company, the codebase, or even the programming language in the past six months.</p>
<h3>Old hands</h3>
<p>To some extent, this problem is mitigated by “old hands”: engineers who happen to have been in the orbit of a particular system for long enough to develop real expertise. These engineers can give deep code reviews and reliably catch obvious problems. But relying on “old hands” has two problems. </p>
<p>First, <strong>this process is entirely informal</strong>. Big tech companies make surprisingly little effort to develop long-term expertise in individual systems, and once they’ve got it they seem to barely care at all about retaining it. Often the engineers in question are moved to different services, and have to either keep up their “old hand” duties on an effectively volunteer basis, or abandon them and become a relative beginner on a brand new system.</p>
<p>Second, <strong>experienced engineers are always overloaded</strong>. It is a <em>busy</em> job being one of the few engineers who has deep expertise on a particular service. You don’t have enough time to personally review every software change, or to be actively involved in every decision-making process. Remember that <em>you also have your own work to do</em>: if you spend all your time reviewing changes and being involved in discussions, you’ll likely be punished by the company for not having enough individual output.</p>
<h3>The median productive engineer</h3>
<p>Putting all this together, what does the median productive<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> engineer at a big tech company look like? They are usually:</p>
<ul>
<li>competent enough to pass the hiring bar and be able to do the work, but either</li>
<li>working on a codebase or language that is largely new to them, or</li>
<li>trying to stay on top of a flood of code changes while also juggling their own work.</li>
</ul>
<p>They are almost certainly working to a deadline, or to a series of overlapping deadlines for different projects. In other words, <strong>they are trying to do their best in an environment that is not set up to produce quality code.</strong></p>
<p>That’s how “obviously” bad code happens. For instance, a junior engineer picks up a ticket for an annoying bug in a codebase they’re barely familiar with. They spend a few days figuring it out and come up with a hacky solution. One of the more senior “old hands” (if they’re lucky) glances over it in a spare half-hour, vetoes it, and suggests something slightly better that would at least work. The junior engineer implements that as best they can, tests that it works, it gets briefly reviewed and shipped, and everyone involved immediately moves on to higher-priority work. Five years later somebody notices this<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> and thinks “wow, that’s hacky - how did such bad code get written at such a big software company”?</p>
<h3>Big tech companies are fine with this</h3>
<p>I have written a lot about the internal tech company dynamics that contribute to this. Most directly, in <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/seeing-like-a-software-company"><em>Seeing like a software company</em></a> I argue that big tech companies consistently prioritize internal <em>legibility</em> - the ability to see at a glance who’s working on what and to change it at will - over productivity. Big companies know that treating engineers as fungible and moving them around destroys their ability to develop long-term expertise in a single codebase. <strong>That’s a deliberate tradeoff.</strong> They’re giving up some amount of expertise and software quality in order to gain the ability to rapidly deploy skilled engineers onto whatever the problem-of-the-month is.</p>
<p>I don’t know if this is a good idea or a bad idea. It certainly seems to be working for the big tech companies, particularly now that “how fast can you pivot to something AI-related” is so important. But if you’re doing this, then <em>of course</em> you’re going to produce some genuinely bad code. That’s what happens when you ask engineers to rush out work on systems they’re unfamiliar with.</p>
<p><strong>Individual engineers are entirely powerless to alter this dynamic</strong>. This is particularly true in 2025, when <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/good-times-are-over">the balance of power has tilted</a> away from engineers and towards tech company leadership. The most you can do as an individual engineer is to try and become an “old hand”: to develop expertise in at least one area, and to use it to block the worst changes and steer people towards at least minimally-sensible technical decisions. But even that is often swimming against the current of the organization, and if inexpertly done can cause you to get <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1et7miz/what_you_need_to_know_about_performance/">PIP-ed</a> or worse.</p>
<h3>Pure and impure engineering</h3>
<p>I think a lot of this comes down to the distinction between <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/pure-and-impure-engineering">pure and impure software engineering</a>. To pure engineers - engineers working on self-contained technical projects, like <a href="https://ziglang.org/">a programming language</a> - the only explanation for bad code is incompetence. But impure engineers operate more like plumbers or electricians. They’re working to deadlines on projects that are relatively new to them, and even if their technical fundamentals are impeccable, there’s always <em>something</em> about the particular setup of this situation that’s awkward or surprising. To impure engineers, bad code is inevitable. As long as the overall system works well enough, the project is a success.</p>
<p>At big tech companies, engineers don’t get to decide if they’re working on pure or impure engineering work. It’s <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/not-your-codebase">not their codebase</a>! If the company wants to move you from working on database infrastructure to building the new payments system, they’re fully entitled to do that. The fact that you might make some mistakes in an unfamiliar system - or that your old colleagues on the database infra team might suffer without your expertise - is a deliberate tradeoff being made by <strong>the company, not the engineer</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s fine to point out examples of bad code at big companies. If nothing else, it can be an effective way to get those specific examples fixed, since execs usually jump at the chance to turn bad PR into good PR. But I think it’s a mistake<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup> to attribute primary responsibility to the engineers at those companies. If you could wave a magic wand and make every engineer twice as strong, <em>you would still have bad code</em>, because almost nobody can come into a brand new codebase and quickly make changes with zero mistakes. The root cause is that <strong>most big company engineers are forced to do most of their work in unfamiliar codebases</strong>.</p>
