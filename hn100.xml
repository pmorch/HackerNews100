<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><blockquote>
<p>Effective January 1, 2024, we will introduce a new Unity Runtime Fee that’s based on game installs. We will also add cloud-based asset storage, Unity DevOps tools, and AI at runtime at no extra cost to Unity subscription plans this November.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As many of you know, the Unity Engine is in fact two substantial software components – the Unity Editor and the Unity Runtime. The Unity Runtime is code that executes on player devices and makes Made with Unity games work at scale, with billions of monthly downloads.</p>

<p>We are introducing a Unity Runtime Fee that is based upon each time a qualifying game is downloaded by an end user. We chose this because each time a game is downloaded, the Unity Runtime is also installed.&nbsp; Also we believe that an initial install-based fee allows creators to keep the ongoing financial gains from player engagement, unlike a revenue share.</p></div><div><h2><p>Thresholds for revenue and installs</p></h2></div><div><p>Games qualify for the Unity Runtime Fee after two criteria have been met: 1) the game has passed a minimum revenue threshold in the last 12 months, and 2) the game has passed a minimum lifetime install count. We set high revenue and game install thresholds to avoid impacting those who have yet to find scale, meaning they don’t need to pay the fee until they have reached significant success.</p>

<p>Only games that meet the following thresholds qualify for the Unity Runtime Fee:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Unity Personal </strong>and <strong>Unity Plus: </strong>Those<strong> </strong>that have made $200,000 USD or more in the last 12 months AND have at least 200,000 lifetime game installs.</li>
	<li><strong>Unity Pro </strong>and <strong>Unity Enterprise</strong>: Those that have made $1,000,000 USD or more in the last 12 months AND have at least 1,000,000 lifetime game installs.</li>
</ul></div><div><h2><p>Flexibility and discounts for Unity Personal, Pro, and Enterprise</p></h2></div><div><p>With this new policy, as of January 1, 2024, we will offer Unity Personal to anyone regardless of how much revenue they make to provide more flexibility in how creators manage their licenses. Once a game passes the revenue and install thresholds, the studio would pay a small flat fee for each install (see the table below).</p>

<p>To adjust for scale, Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise subscribers will be eligible for volume discounts that rapidly reduce the per-install cost of the Unity Runtime Fee. This means that in addition to other benefits, the cost of Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise licenses can be offset by the savings as the game grows.</p>

<p>Finally, we structured our fees so that they take into account the variability of game monetization between more established regions like North America and Europe versus emerging gaming regions such as India. A breakdown of the pricing and discount structure is below. See the <a href="http://www.unity.com/pricing-updates" target="_blank">FAQ</a> for additional details.</p></div><div><table><thead><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th><strong>Unity Personal and Unity Plus</strong></th><th><strong>Unity Pro</strong></th><th><strong>Unity Enterprise</strong></th></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><strong>Unity Runtime Fee thresholds to be met</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Revenue Threshold (USD)</strong></td><td>$200,000&nbsp;(last 12mo)</td><td>$1,000,000&nbsp;(last 12mo)</td><td>$1,000,000&nbsp;(last 12mo)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Install&nbsp;Threshold</strong></td><td>200,000&nbsp;(life to date)</td><td>1,000,000&nbsp;(life to date)</td><td>1,000,000&nbsp;(life to date)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Installs over the Install Threshold</strong></td><td colspan="3"><strong>Standard monthly rate</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>1–100,000</strong></td><td rowspan="4">$0.20 per install</td><td>$0.15 per install</td><td>$0.125 per install</td></tr><tr><td><strong>100,001–500,000</strong></td><td>$0.075 per install</td><td>$0.06 per install</td></tr><tr><td><strong>500,001–1,000,000</strong></td><td>$0.03 per install</td><td>$0.02 per install</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1,000,001+</strong></td><td>$0.02 per install</td><td>$0.01 per install</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td><strong>Installs over the Install Threshold</strong></td><td colspan="3"><strong>Emerging market monthly rate</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>1+</strong></td><td>$0.02 per install</td><td>$0.01 per install</td><td>$0.005 per install</td></tr></thead></table>
</div><div><h2><p>Fee reduction for use of Unity services</p></h2></div><div><p>Qualifying customers may be eligible for credits toward the Unity Runtime Fee based on the adoption of Unity services beyond the Editor, such as Unity Gaming Services or Unity LevelPlay mediation for mobile ad-supported games. This program enables deeper partnership with Unity to succeed across the entire game lifecycle. Please reach out to your account manager to learn more.</p></div><div><h2><p>New services and tools. No seat price changes.</p></h2></div><div><p>This November, we will update some of the Unity subscription plans to add extra value. New capabilities include better collaboration (Unity DevOps), cloud-based asset management (Unity Asset Manager), role and access controls (Team Administration), and the ability to add AI functionality at runtime (Unity Sentis). These new tools and services will come with no increase in seat prices as we continue to help creators adapt to the growing complexity of game development. Here’s a breakdown:</p>

<ul><li><strong>All Unity plans</strong> will get <a href="https://unity.com/products/sentis" target="_blank">Unity Sentis</a>, which enables you to embed a running AI model in the Unity Runtime, inside your game or application, without needing to pay additional cloud-compute costs or introducing latency.</li>
	<li><strong>Unity Personal</strong> will include the Unity Asset Manager free tier (10GB storage total), a maximum of 3 Unity DevOps seats featuring 5GB of storage and 200 Windows build minutes, and Team Administration base roles.</li>
	<li><strong>Unity Pro</strong> will include the Unity Asset Manager (50GB of storage per seat, pooled for a team to share) along with an equal number of Unity DevOps seats featuring 5GB of storage and 200 Windows build minutes. Team Administration tools to manage access will also be included.</li>
	<li><strong>Unity Enterprise </strong>will include the Unity Asset Manager (120GB of storage per seat, pooled for a team to share) along with an equal number of Unity DevOps seats with 5GB of storage and 200 Windows build minutes. Team Administration tools, including custom roles and SSO, provide a higher degree of control.</li>
</ul><p>Finally, Unity Plus is being retired for new subscribers effective today, September 12, 2023, to simplify the number of plans we offer. Existing subscribers do not need to take immediate action and will receive an email mid-October with an offer to upgrade to Unity Pro, for one year, at the current Unity Plus price.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.appsignal.com/2023/09/12/phoenix-1-7-for-elixir-edit-a-form-in-a-modal.html">https://blog.appsignal.com/2023/09/12/phoenix-1-7-for-elixir-edit-a-form-in-a-modal.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37479323">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In part one of this series, we introduced the <code>CoreComponents</code> that get generated when bootstrapping a new
Phoenix project. In part two, we implemented a create modal.</p>
<p>Now, we will implement
an edit modal.</p>
<p><em>You can continue following along with our <a href="https://github.com/Adzz/petacular">companion repo</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="editing-a-form-in-a-modal">Editing a Form in a Modal</h2>
<p>You will first notice that each item will need a different changeset. We
want to edit each item, so we need to be able to build a changeset from
a different struct each time.</p>
<p>You <em>could</em> do this by iterating over all of the items in <code>mount</code>
and rendering a different modal for every row, but this won't work at all. You would have to have
one changeset per assign, which doesn't work when you have a list to add to. It would
also mean a lot more HTML because you'd render the whole modal once per row. It's an all-round bad idea.</p>
<p>Instead, we need a way to build the correct changeset based on the item we click on.
We can do that by using another <code>JS</code> function — <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.JS.html#push/1"><code>push</code></a>.
This will push an event to the backend, along with any attributes that we want to send. If we add an edit button per row, the click action can push an event to the backend
with the <code>pet_id</code> as a param. Then, we can select the pet from the list of assigns and build
a changeset out of it.</p>
<p>First, add the button to the markup. It might be nice to use an icon for this, so let's take
a quick detour to icons.</p>
<h2 id="icons-in-phoenix">Icons in Phoenix</h2>
<p>Phoenix 1.7 ships with a vendored heroicons library and an <code>&lt;.icon&gt;</code> component in <code>CoreComponents</code>.
It works by supplying the name of an icon as a <code>name</code> attr, like so:</p>

<p>The names for the available icons are the filenames contained in the following
path: <code>assets/vendor/heroicons/optimized/20/solid/</code>.
Looking at the files doesn't tell us much about what they look like because we just see svg
markup.</p>
<p>What would be cool is if we could render a dev-only route that displays all icons on one page.
Then when we consider using an icon, we can go to that page and peruse them all at our leisure.</p>
<p>First, let's add the route:</p>

<p>Then, we can make the necessary <code>PetacularWeb.Pages.StoryBookLive</code> module. We'll now write a function that
generates all the icon names from the files in the assets folder, then iterate over them
and create an icon from each one. This will give us a dynamic list of icons to render.</p>
<p>Here are the <code>icon_names</code> (this assumes you will start your server from the project's route):</p>

<p>Then the markup:</p>

<p>There is one more thing to do, though. Tailwind will purge all classes it doesn't see
being used when the app is built. Usually, this is great because it means the bundle size is
smaller, with more lightweight pages. However, here, it is going to bite us. When you
refer to classes dynamically, Tailwind doesn't see those classes being used, so it purges them. <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/content-configuration#dynamic-class-names">Tailwind's docs warn about this</a>.</p>
<p>We need to tell Tailwind <em>not</em> to purge all the icon modules so we can render them. We do that by adding a line of config into <code>tailwind.config.js</code>, like so:</p>

<p>Now, we can head to <code>http://localhost:4000/dev/storybook</code> and see all the icons. See
<a href="https://github.com/Adzz/petacular/commit/91a0ff0e3af688a47864dc030a83b0f705e8f021">this commit</a>
for all of the changes.</p>

<h3 id="back-to-editing-our-form">Back to Editing Our Form</h3>
<p>Okay, now we can select our edit icon and put it on the page.</p>

<p>We will put this in a button and add a <code>phx-click</code> that opens our edit modal for us. All
this can live in the <a href="https://github.com/Adzz/petacular/blob/main/lib/petacular_web/pages/home_live.ex">homepage</a> we used in parts one and two.</p>

<p>We also need to create our <code>Edit</code> modal. This will be similar to our <code>Create</code> modal, but a bit different, so we'll just create a new modal.</p>
<p>We can put this in our <code>~H</code> component just before the other modal:</p>

<p>Now we need to add a changeset to the assigns. Initially, we can put any changeset in mount because when we open the modal, we are going to seed it:</p>

<h2 id="add-the-open_edit_modal-function">Add the <code>open_edit_modal</code> Function</h2>
<p>Now let's implement the <code>open_edit_modal</code> function. This has to do two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the modal.</li>
<li>Trigger a message to the backend so we can seed the changeset.</li>
</ol>

<p>The handler for this event needs to select the relevant pet from the list of pets and
put that into the changeset:</p>

<p>When we open the modal, the page will re-render the form because the changeset has changed,
and the form will be seeded with the correct data. We can verify this by using
<code>|&gt; IO.inspect(limit: :infinity, label: "")</code> on the form value:</p>

<h3 id="debugging-an-issue-with-the-open_edit_modal">Debugging an Issue with the <code>open_edit_modal</code></h3>
<p>If you open the modal, you will see the correct value printed. But there is a problem — it's
not showing on the page! What on earth could be the issue? This one is a doozy, so I will
save you some hours of debugging.</p>
<p>The function that we use to <a href="https://github.com/Adzz/petacular/blob/main/lib/petacular_web/components/core_components.ex#L591">open our modal</a> has this line, which focuses the first "focussable"
element in the modal:</p>

<p>This is done for accessibility, and so is generally a good idea.</p>
<p>The input happens to be the first focussable thing in our edit form. Phoenix also ensures
that the client is the source of truth for <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/form-bindings.html#javascript-client-specifics">an input's value</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For any given input with focus, LiveView will never overwrite the input's current value, even if it deviates from the server's rendered updates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what happens in our case? We push an asynchronous message to the backend, which changes an assign (the edit
form), causing a re-render — <code>|&gt; JS.push("open_edit_modal", value: %{pet_id: pet_id})</code>. Then we
open the modal with JavaScript, but because the message to the server is async, the modal
opens <em>before</em> we get a reply. The first focussable element is the input field, so that gets
focus, then the server responds. This would normally re-render the input field, but now won't, because the input has focus!</p>
<h3 id="fixing-the-issue">Fixing the Issue</h3>
<p>We've done everything right, yet are left adrift. What are our options?</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the auto-focus capabilities of the modal.</li>
<li>Have the edit modal focus on something that is not the input first.</li>
<li>Somehow make the form opening synchronous to the server message.</li>
</ol>
<p>I honestly don't know which is better, but let's reason them out. One is easy to do — just <a href="https://github.com/Adzz/petacular/blob/main/lib/petacular_web/components/core_components.ex#L600">remove this line</a>
from the <code>show_modal</code> function — but may have accessibility implications, which makes it a non-starter.</p>
<p>The second option seems reasonable at first. We could maybe set the <code>tabindex</code> on the heading,
but <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG/Keyboard">mdn</a>
recommends the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If an element can be focused using the keyboard, then it should be interactive; that is, the user should be able to do something to it and produce a change of some kind (for example, activating a link or changing an option).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that's out.</p>
<p>The third option is possible, but requires some ceremony. Instead of opening the modal with JS, you could have the backend trigger a JS event that opens the modal when it's finished
seeding the changeset. That requires adding a handler in JS to listen for the event
and also means that the modal open is slower, because it requires at least one round trip to
the server. For me, that is out as well.</p>
<p>The solution? A secret fourth option — set the value of the field with JS. This means
the field will open quickly, be set to the correct value, and auto-focus.</p>
<p>To support that, we alter our <a href="https://github.com/Adzz/petacular/blob/main/lib/petacular_web/pages/home_live.ex#L74"><code>open_edit_modal</code></a>
function to accept the name, then use <code>JS.set_attribute</code> to set the field value.</p>

<h2 id="implementing-the-update-in-our-phoenix-application">Implementing the Update in Our Phoenix Application</h2>
<p>Now the only thing left to do is implement the <code>edit_pet</code> handler. This is similar to the
create version, where we flash an error and close the modal on success. We first want to
select the pet we are editing, which means we need the pet's id. How can we get that?</p>
<p>The easiest way is to use a hidden input on the form. That way, when the form is submitted, the pet id will also be sent. To do that, we need to add the hidden input:</p>

<p>And set the value when we open the modal:</p>

<p>We will see the id of the pet appear in the params, allowing us to select
the pet we are editing from the assigns:</p>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/Adzz/petacular/commit/364bec4c35c796bcd19f63ccd42ad230c0ed4afc">this commit</a>
for all the relevant changes.</p>
<p>And with that, we are done!</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>This concludes our three-part series in which we took a fresh Phoenix 1.7 application and built a create and edit modal for
it.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this gives you some new ideas you can extend and implement for your own apps.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>

Almost nine times the mass of Earth, it is, Nasa, says: “a Hycean exoplanet, one which has the potential to possess a hydrogen-rich atmosphere and a water ocean-covered surface”.</p><p>The space agency said that its observations of the chemical make-up of the planet’s atmosphere suggested the possibility of an ocean world. “The abundance of methane and carbon dioxide, and shortage of ammonia, support the hypothesis that there may be a water ocean underneath a hydrogen-rich atmosphere in K2-18 b,” it said.</p><p>But the agency also hinted at even more remarkable possibility in the potential finding of a molecule called dimethyl sulfide (DMS), which on Earth is only produced by life.</p><p>“The bulk of the DMS in Earth’s atmosphere is emitted from phytoplankton in marine environments,” the Nasa press release said.</p><p>The presence of DMS, however, is still to be confirmed, and requires further investigation. “Upcoming Webb observations should be able to confirm if DMS is indeed present in the atmosphere of K2-18 b at significant levels,” said Nikku Madhusudhan, a University of Cambridge astronomer and lead author of the Nasa research.</p><p>It would not be the first time Nasa has found indications of water on other planets. Water vapor was previously discovered on the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/specials/ocean-worlds/#:~:text=Are%20there%20oceans%20on%20planets,in%20a%20five%2Dday%20orbit." data-link-name="in body link">smaller exoplanet, HAT-P-11b</a>, roughly the size of Neptune in the constellation Cygnus, also 120 light years away.</p><p>But scientists are excited by the revelation, even though they caution it does not necessarily mean the planet could support life.</p><p>“Our findings underscore the importance of considering diverse habitable environments in the search for life elsewhere,” said Madhusudhan.</p><p>“Traditionally, the search for life on exoplanets has focused primarily on smaller rocky planets, but the larger Hycean worlds are significantly more conducive to atmospheric observations.”</p><p>Orbiting the cool dwarf star K2-18, the exoplanet, 2.6 times the radius of Earth, lies in what Nasa calls the <a href="https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-8c9217a9-bf37-4563-863a-4b60ff8f5576" data-link-name="in body link">habitable zone</a>, a region around a star where planets with liquid water may be present.</p><p>Its interior likely contains a large mantle of high-pressure ice, similar to Neptune, Nasa says, but likely has a thinner hydrogen-rich atmosphere and an ocean surface. Hycean worlds are predicted to have oceans of water, but on K2-18 b it is also possible the ocean is too hot to be habitable.</p><p>The planet’s existence was first discovered by <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/ames/nasas-k2-mission-the-kepler-space-telescopes-second-chance-to-shine" data-link-name="in body link">Nasa’s K2 mission</a> in 2015, but Webb’s improved technology over the earlier telescopes allowed for a more detailed analysis, and revelation it could be an ocean world. Scientists were able to study a tiny fraction of the star’s light as it passed through the exoplanet’s atmosphere.</p><p>“This result was only possible because of the extended wavelength range and unprecedented sensitivity of Webb, which enabled robust detection of spectral features with just two transits,” Madhusudhan said.</p><p>“For comparison, one transit observation with Webb provided comparable precision to eight observations with Hubble conducted over a few years and in a relatively narrow wavelength range.”</p><p>Nasa celebrated the first anniversary of operation of the Webb space telescope in July by releasing an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jul/12/nasa-releases-image-of-star-forming-region-rho-ophiuchi-james-webb" data-link-name="in body link">“unprecedented” closeup image</a> of the nearest star-forming region to Earth.</p><p>In little more than a year, it has allowed humans to look closer towards the origins of the universe than ever before, and produced high-resolution pictures of far-distant worlds and the mysterious structures that surround them.</p><p>They include the “rare and fleeting” phase of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/mar/15/james-webb-space-telescope-dying-star-nasa" data-link-name="in body link">star on the cusp of death</a>; early galaxies formed just <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/nov/18/james-webb-telescope-finds-two-of-the-oldest-and-most-distant-galaxies-ever-seen" data-link-name="in body link">350m years after the big bang</a>; and evidence of “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/feb/22/universe-breakers-james-webb-telescope-detects-six-ancient-galaxies" data-link-name="in body link">universe breaker galaxies</a>” far larger than scientists thought possible, with the potential to upend current theories of cosmology.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have been using my own domain for email for over 10 years. I am grandfathered into the free version of Google Workspace and have also used Fastmail and ProtonMail.</p>
<p>One of my concerns is that, if I were unable to renew my domain (e.g., in case of death), someone else could register it and start receiving my emails. This is a serious issue because your email account is as good as a password due to most websites using it as a way to reset your password. Can you imagine if someone in the future got a hold of gmail.com?</p>
<p>Another concern is privacy. Using a unique domain name for email stands out, especially when it has your name. I am starting to use iCloud's Hide My Email to change my email address on accounts I have created over the years because of this. I can also change where the emails are forwarded whenever I want to.</p>
<p>Your domain name can be the weakest link to accessing your online accounts. Make sure to take extra steps to protect your information, such as enabling 2FA.</p>
<p>Domain names registered by the more conventional email hosts are not immune to these problems. We need to start assuming email addresses are only temporarily in use by the current user. Or should we implement regulations? I shudder at the thought.</p>

  </p>
  <h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><b>Quiet</b></h2>
  

Quiet is an alternative to team chat apps like Slack, Discord, and Element that does not require trusting a central server or running one's own. In Quiet, all data syncs directly between a team's devices over <a href="https://torproject.org/" rel="nofollow">Tor</a> with no server required.
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">NOTE: Quiet is not audited and should not be used when privacy and security are critical. It lacks basic features and probably won't replace your Slack or Discord yet. That said, it works surprisingly well and we use it daily as a Slack replacement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Quiet is for fans of software freedom, decentralization and privacy tech, and for anyone craving a future where humanity can collaborate effectively online without trusting our communities, networks, and data to giant corporations.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Quiet is written (mostly) in TypeScript, with Electron and React Native frontends, and welcomes outside contributions! See: <a href="#contributing-to-quiet">Contributing to Quiet</a></strong></p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How it works</h2>
<p dir="auto">While apps like Slack, Discord, and Signal use central servers, Quiet syncs messages directly between a team's devices, over Tor, with no server required.</p>
<p dir="auto">Each group of people (Quiet calls them "communities") gets their own insular network, so that data from one community never touches the devices of Quiet users in <em>other</em> communities. Not even in encrypted form!</p>
<p dir="auto">Message syncing is taken care of by a project called <a href="https://orbitdb.org/" rel="nofollow">OrbitDB</a>, which works like a mashup of Git, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_protocol" rel="nofollow">gossip protocol</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent" rel="nofollow">BitTorrent</a>; it broadcasts new messages, syncs the latest messages, and fetches files. Syncing means that users typically receive all messages sent while they were offline.</p>
<p dir="auto">Invites, access, and usernames are granted by a community owner, i.e. whoever creates the community. The owner hands out an "invitation code" which invitees use to connect to the owner's device, register a username, and get a standard cryptographic certificate so they can prove to other peers they're part of the community.</p>
<p dir="auto">See our <a href="https://github.com/TryQuiet/monorepo/wiki/Quiet-FAQ">FAQ</a> for answers to common questions and a comparison of Quiet with similar apps.</p>

</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Technical overview</h2>
<p dir="auto">This is a concise technical summary of the main points.</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Granting access:</strong> community owners use standard PKI (<a href="https://pkijs.org/" rel="nofollow">PKI.js</a>) to grant access, with each community owner serving as the community's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority" rel="nofollow">certificate authority</a>; this is handled by Quiet and transparent to users.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication:</strong> a valid signed certificate from the community owner is required to connect to peers, receive connections from peers, and for messages to be visible to other peers.</li>
<li><strong>Networking:</strong> peers connect via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network)#Onion_services" rel="nofollow">Tor onion services</a>, exclusively with their fellow community members.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Tor encrypts all data in transit, and a Quiet user's device connects only to the devices of their fellow community members, so all messages are encrypted to recipients.</li>
<li><strong>Syncing:</strong> IPFS and <a href="https://orbitdb.org/" rel="nofollow">OrbitDB</a>, an <a href="https://ipfs.io/" rel="nofollow">IPFS</a>-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type" rel="nofollow">CRDT</a>, ensure that all data (messages, user data, etc) syncs between peers with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00472" rel="nofollow">eventual consistency</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous messaging:</strong> because messages sync to all members, members can communicate without being contemporaneously online, provided that there is "continuous liveness", a continuous chain of online peers who each sync the latest updates, between the sender and the recipient.</li>
<li><strong>Identity:</strong> a valid certificate from the community owner on account creation establishes a username, which the owner attests is unique; in future versions, Quiet will warn all members if community owners are caught issuing non-unique usernames, to protect against impersonation by malicious or compromised owners. (See: <a href="https://github.com/TryQuiet/monorepo/issues/119" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/TryQuiet/quiet/issues/119/hovercard">#119</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Invitation:</strong> to invite new members, community owners provide (via some other secure channel) an onion address that points to a registration API which accepts a certificate signing request, responds with a signed certificate, and provides sufficient peer information to connect to other peers; in future versions this onion address will expire. (See: <a href="https://github.com/TryQuiet/monorepo/issues/536" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/TryQuiet/quiet/issues/536/hovercard">#536</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Account recovery:</strong> owners must back up their data (e.g. by copying a folder, or someday with a wallet-style passphrase) and members request new accounts from owners.</li>
<li><strong>User removal:</strong> TBD, but likely a combination of expiring invitation onion addresses, certificate revocation, and message-layer encryption with updated keys.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple device support:</strong> TBD, but most likely based on <a href="https://github.com/local-first-web/auth">local-first-web/auth</a></li>
<li><strong>Mobile push notifications:</strong> barring a major victory for consumer rights, iOS notifications require using a centralized push notification service that connects to Apple, but message data can still be encrypted; in proof-of-concept, Quiet works well as an always-on background app on Android, so Android versions will likely not require a push notification server.</li>
<li><strong>Stack:</strong> Our backend is in Node.js (on iOS/Android we use <a href="https://github.com/nodejs-mobile">nodejs-mobile</a>); we use Electron on desktop and React Native on mobile.</li>
</ol>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Our Mission</h2>
<p dir="auto">We are building Quiet to sharpen the tools that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_society" rel="nofollow">open societies</a> use to hold power accountable. Each year, movements use the Internet to hold power accountable in breathtaking new ways. But the rise of big tech has made the Internet <em>itself</em> seem like <em>yet another</em> unaccountable power. The medium that brought us <em>Occupy</em> Wall Street now looks like regular old Wall Street. We believe this happened because software became too dependent on company-run infrastructure, which undermined the role <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software" rel="nofollow">free software</a> has historically played in holding the software industry accountable. Our goal is to fix that.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the 2000s, when key dominant tech products had viable free software competitors that were radically pro-user (products like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox" rel="nofollow">Firefox</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent" rel="nofollow">BitTorrent</a>, <a href="https://www.videolan.org/" rel="nofollow">VLC</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HandBrake" rel="nofollow">Handbrake</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" rel="nofollow">Linux</a>) there was a limit to how much big tech could abuse users before users fled.</p>
<p dir="auto">But software for communication and collaboration seemed to require servers, whose cost grew with the software's popularity, so the question "who runs the server?" became a dilemma for free software projects. Should the project itself run the server? What about when costs grew too high? Should users run the server? But only a small niche of hobbyists have servers! Should an organization run the server? If so, then that organization now controls the data and relationships that make the product useful, limiting the freedom to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)#Forking_of_free_and_open-source_software" rel="nofollow">fork</a> and flee that makes free software so accountable and desirable. Reddit, for example, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/6xfyfg/an_update_on_the_state_of_the_redditreddit_and/" rel="nofollow">was once free software</a>, but because forking Reddit's <em>code</em> would never have resulted in anything more than an empty website (since all the conversations and relationships that make Reddit what it is sit on <em>company-run servers</em>) Reddit being free software never gave Reddit's users any real power to hold it accountable.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_(information_technology)" rel="nofollow">Federation</a> is a proposed solution to this dilemma, but Gmail shows its limits. After all, email is the most well-known federated product, but Google can still build must-have features like spam filtering on the server side, and Gmail controls a user's email address, so exiting Gmail means updating dozens or hundreds of accounts created with that address. Exiting Gmail might be easier than exiting Facebook or Instagram, but no Gmail competitor can make exiting Gmail as easy and delightful an experience as Firefox made exiting Internet Explorer, because Gmail controls infrastructure, where Internet Explorer never did. So while federation does help, we must do better if we want to hold big tech accountable.</p>
<p dir="auto">Regulation is an even weaker proposed solution. Even when regulation works—and a quick look at the media, telecom, energy, or banking industries will illustrate its limits—regulation tends to create a cozy relationship between industry and regulators that makes industries easy targets for government subversion. For example, the highly-regulated telecom industry <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order" rel="nofollow">bends</a> <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wx8jax/researchers-find-powerful-ss7-cellphone-location-surveillance-in-europe-middle-east-australia" rel="nofollow">over</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_641A" rel="nofollow">backwards</a> every time governments want help carrying out unpopular mass surveillance. Is this what we want from big tech?</p>
<p dir="auto">We're building Quiet because we believe that, for a broad and growing class of software, the best answer to the "who runs the server?" dilemma is "no one." Eliminate the server; in terms of accountability, it is a burden and a weakness. By eliminating servers from software's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface" rel="nofollow">attack surface</a>, software can be more private and secure. By eliminating exponentially growing server costs and the expertise-intensive work of scaling servers, software can be built by smaller teams under less financial pressure to betray users. Most importantly, by eliminating the server operator's control of relationships and data, users will be free to fork and exit, so they will once again have real power to hold software accountable.</p>
<p dir="auto">We're building Quiet to spark a new phase of the free software movement where it is easy and normal to build apps this way. We want to make a private alternative to Slack &amp; Discord that people love, to figure out the best and easiest technical approach along the way, and—by doing all this—to blaze a trail that other free software teams building other products can follow. Once one team (us, we hope!) can build a good alternative to Slack that doesn't use servers, other teams can build alternatives to Google Docs, Figma, Asana, Trello, 1Password, and so on, until someday—and this is technically much more difficult—humanity can build fully-forkable alternatives to things like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or even more complex applications. Big tech's users will be free to flee, and the Internet can stop being yet another unaccountable power, and keep being the breathtaking medium for holding power accountable that open societies need.</p>
<p dir="auto">Join us, and let's figure this out.</p>

    <h3 id="the-church-of-complexity">The Church of Complexity</h3>

<p>There is a pretty well-known sketch in which an engineer is explaining to the project manager how an overly complicated maze of 
microservices works in order to get a user’s birthday - and fails to do so anyway. The scene accurately describes the 
absurdity of the state of the current tech culture. We laugh, and yet bringing this up in a 
serious conversation is tantamount to professional heresy, rendering you borderline un-hirable.</p>

</p>

<p>How did we get here? How did our aim become not addressing the task at hand but instead setting a pile of 
cash on fire by <strong>solving problems we don’t have</strong>?</p>

<h3 id="the-perfect-storm">The perfect storm</h3>

<p>There are a few things in recent history that may have contributed to the current state of things. First, a whole army of 
developers 
writing Javascript for the browser started self-identifying as 
“full-stack”, diving into server development and asynchronous code. Javascript is Javascript, right? What difference does it make 
what you create using it - user interfaces, servers, games, or embedded systems. <em>Right</em>? 
Node was still kind of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3BM9TB-8yA" target="_blank">learning project of one person</a>, and 
Javascript back then was a deeply problematic choice for server development.
<a href="https://notes.ericjiang.com/posts/751" target="_blank">Pointing this out</a> to still green server-side developers usually 
resulted in a lot of huffing and puffing. This is all they knew, after all. The world outside of Node 
effectively did not exist, the Node way was the only known way, and so this was the genesis of the 
stubborn, dogmatic thinking 
that we deal with to this day.</p>

<photo-element source="complexity/theway.webp" aspect="landscape" alt="Performance"></photo-element>

<p><strong>And then</strong>, a steady stream of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech" target="_blank">FAANG</a> veterans started merging into the river of startups, 
mentoring the newly-minted and highly impressionable young Javascript server-side engineers. The apostles of the Church of Complexity would 
assertively claim that “how they did things over at Google” was unquestionable and correct - even if it made no sense under 
current context and size. What 
do you <em>mean</em> you don’t have a separate <em>User Preferences Service</em>? That just <em>will not scale, bro!</em></p>

<p>But, it’s easy to blame the veterans and the newcomers for all of this. What else was happening? Oh yeah - easy money.</p>

<p>What do you do when you are flush with venture capital? You don’t 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BzAdXyPYKQo?si=3lOVi1rhtaPC-nv4" target="_blank">go for revenue</a>, surely! On more than one 
occasion I received an email from management, asking everyone to be in the office, tidy up their desks and look busy, as a 
clouder of Patagonia vests was about to be paraded through the office. Investors needed to see explosive growth, but not in 
profitability, 
no. They just needed to see how quickly the company could hire ultra-expensive software engineers to do … <em>something</em>.</p>

<p>And now that you have these developers, what do you do with them? Well, they could build a simpler system that is easier to 
grow and
maintain, or they could conjure up a monstrous constellation of “microservices” that no one really 
understands. Microservices 
- the new way of writing scalable software! Are we just going to pretend that the concept of “distributed systems” never existed?
(Let’s skip the whole parsing of the nuances that microservices are not real distributed systems).</p>

<p>Back in the days when the tech industry was not such a bloated farce, distributed systems were respected, feared, and generally 
avoided - reserved only as the weapon of last resort for particularly gnarly problems. Everything with a distributed system 
becomes more challenging and time-consuming - development, debugging, deployment, testing, resilience. But I don’t know - maybe 
it’s all 
super easy now because 
<em>toooollling</em>.</p>

<p>There is no standard tooling for microservices-based development - there is no common 
framework. Working on distributed systems has gotten only marginally easier in 2020s. The Dockers and the 
Kuberneteses of the world did not magically take away the inherent complexity of a distributed setup.</p>

<p>I love referring to this
<a href="https://kenkantzer.com/learnings-from-5-years-of-tech-startup-code-audits/" target="_blank">summary of 5 years of startup audits</a>, 
as it is packed with common-sense conclusions based on hard evidence (and paid insights):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… the startups we audited that are now doing the best usually had an almost brazenly ‘Keep It Simple’ approach to
engineering. Cleverness for cleverness sake was abhorred. On the flip side, the companies where we were like ”woah,
these folks are smart as hell” for the most part kind of faded.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Literally - “complexity kills”.</p>

<p>The 
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/mt/podcast/lessons-from-5-years-of-startup-code-audits/id341623264?i=1000567623452" target="_blank">audit</a>
revealed an interesting pattern, where many startups experienced a sort of collective imposter syndrome while building 
straight-forward, simple,
performant systems. There is a dogma attached to not starting out with microservices on day one - 
no matter the problem. “Everyone is doing microservices, yet we have a single Django monolith maintained by just a few engineers, 
and a MySQL instance - what are we doing wrong?”. The answer is almost always “nothing”.</p>

<p>Likewise, it’s common for seasoned engineers to experience 
hesitation and inadequacy in today’s tech world, and the good news is 
that, 
no - it’s probably not you. It’s common for teams to pretend like they are doing “webs cale”, hiding behind libraries, ORMs, and 
cache - 
confident in their expertise (they crushed that Leetcode!), yet they may not even be
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/f46f5a/comment/fhp26k8/?context=3" target="_blank">aware of database indexing basics</a>. 
You are operating in a sea of unjustified overconfidence, waste, and Dunning-Kruger, so who is really the imposter here?</p>

<h3 id="there-is-nothing-wrong-with-a-monolith">There is nothing wrong with a monolith</h3>

<p>The idea that you cannot grow without a system that looks like the infamous diagram of Afghanistan war 
strategy is largely a myth.</p>

<photo-element source="complexity/af.png" aspect="landscape"></photo-element>

<p>Dropbox, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Shopify, Stack Overflow - these companies and others started out as monolithic 
code bases. Many have a monolith at their core to this day. Stack Overflow makes it a 
<a href="https://stackexchange.com/performance" target="_blank">point of pride</a> how little hardware they need to run the massive site. 
Shopify is still a <a href="https://blog.quastor.org/p/shopify-ensures-consistent-reads">Rails monolith</a>, leveraging the tried and true 
<a href="https://twitter.com/ShopifyEng/status/1597983928018948096" target="_blank">Resque</a> to proces billions of tasks.</p>

<p>WhatsApp went supernova with their 
<a href="https://blog.quastor.org/p/whatsapp-scaled-1-billion-users-50-engineers" target="_blank">Erlang monolith and 50 engineers</a>.
How?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>WhatsApp consciously keeps the engineering staff small to only about 50 engineers.</p>

  <p>Individual engineering teams are also small, consisting of 1 - 3 engineers and teams are each given a great deal of autonomy.</p>

  <p>In terms of servers, WhatsApp prefers to use a smaller number of servers and vertically scale each server to the highest 
extent possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instagram was acquired for billions - with a crew of 12.</p>

<p>And do you imagine Threads as an effort involving a whole Meta campus? Nope. They followed the
<a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/static-analysis-at-scale-an-instagram-story-8f498ab71a0c" target="_blank">Instagram model</a>, 
and this is the entire Threads team:</p>

<photo-element source="complexity/threads-team.webp" aspect="landscape"></photo-element>

<p>Perhaps claiming that <em>your</em> particular problem domain requires a massively complicated distributed system and an open office 
stuffed 
to the gills with turbo-geniuses is just crossing over into 
arrogance rather than brilliance?</p>

<h3 id="dont-solve-problems-you-dont-have">Don’t solve problems you don’t have</h3>

<p>It’s a simple question - what problem are you solving? Is it scale? How do you know how to break it all up for scale and performance? 
Do you have enough data to show what needs to be a separate service and why? Distributed systems are built for size and 
resilience. Can your system scale and be resilient at the same time? What happens if one of the services goes down or comes to a crawl? 
Just scale it up, yes? What about the <em>other</em> services that will get flooded with load? Did you war-game the endless permutations 
of things that can and will go wrong? Is there back pressure? Circuit breakers? Queues? Jitter? Sensible timeouts on every 
endpoint? Are there fool-proof guards to make sure a simple change does not bring everything down? 
The knobs you need to be aware of and tune are endless, and they are all specific to your system’s particular signature of 
usage and traffic.</p>

<p>The truth is that most companies will never reach the massive size that will actually require building a true distribute 
system. Your cos playing Amazon and Google - without 
their scale, expertise, and endless resources - is very likely just an egregious waste of money and time.</p>

<p><em>The only thing harder than a distributed system is a BAD distributed system</em>.</p>

<photo-element source="complexity/twitter3.png" aspect="landscape" alt="Performance"></photo-element>

<h3 id="but-each-teambut-separate-but-api">“But each team…but separate… but API”</h3>

<p>Trying to shove a distributed topology into your company’s structure is a noble effort, but it almost always backfires. It’s a 
common approach 
to break up a problem into smaller pieces and then solve those one by one. So, the thinking goes, if you break up one service 
into multiple ones, everything becomes easier, right?</p>

<p>The theory is sweet and elegant - each microservice is being maintained rigorously by a dedicated team, 
walled off behind a beautiful, backward-compatible, versioned API. In fact, this is all so steely that you rarely even have to 
communicate with that team - as if the microservice was maintained by a 3rd party vendor. It’s <em>simple</em>!</p>

<p>If that doesn’t sound familiar, that’s because this rarely happens. In reality, our Slack channels are <em>flooded</em> with 
messages from teams communicating about releases, bugs, configuration updates, breaking changes, and PSAs. Everyone 
needs to be on top of everything, all the time. And if that wasn’t great, it’s normal for one 
already-slammed team to half-ass multiple 
microservices instead of doing a great job on a single one, often changing ownership as people come and go.</p>

<p>In order to win the race, we don’t build <em>one</em> good race car - we build a fleet of shitty golf carts.</p>

<photo-element source="complexity/twitter2.png" aspect="landscape" alt="Performance"></photo-element>

<h3 id="what-you-lose">What you lose</h3>

<p>There are multiple pitfalls to building with microservices, and often that minefield is either not fully appreciated or simply 
ignored. Teams spend months writing highly customized tooling and learning lessons not 
related at all to the core product. Here are just some often overlooked aspects…</p>

<h4 id="say-goodbye-to-dry">Say goodbye to DRY</h4>

<p>After decades of teaching developers to write Don’t Repeat Yourself code, it seems we just stopped talking about it altogether.
Microservices by default are not DRY, with every service stuffed with redundant boilerplate. Very often the overhead of such 
“plumbing” is so heavy, and the size of the microservices is so small, that the average instance of a service has more “service” 
than 
“product”. So what about the common code that <em>can</em> be factored out?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a common library?</li>
  <li>How does the common library get updated? Keep different versions everywhere?</li>
  <li>Force updates regularly, creating dozens of pull requests across all repositories?</li>
  <li>Keep it all in a monorepo? That comes with its <em>own</em> set of problems.</li>
  <li>Allow for some code duplication?</li>
  <li>Forget it, each team gets to reinvent the wheel every time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each company going this route faces these choices, and there are no good “ergonomic” options - you <em>have</em> to 
choose your version of the pain.</p>

<h4 id="developer-ergonomics-will-crater">Developer ergonomics will crater</h4>

<p>“Developer ergonomics” is the friction, the amount of effort a developer
must go through in order to get something done, be it working on a new feature or resolving a bug.</p>

<p>With microservices, an engineer has to have a mental map of the entire system in order to know what services  to bring up for any 
particular task, what teams to talk to, whom to talk to, and what about. The “you have to know everything before 
doing anything” 
principle. How 
do you keep on top of it? Spotify, a 
multi-billion dollar company, spent probably not negligible internal resources to build 
<a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/" target="_blank">Backstage</a>, software for cataloging its endless systems and services.</p>

<p>This should at least give you a clue that this game is not for everyone, and the price of the ride is <em>high</em>. So what about 
the <em>tooooling</em>? The Not Spotifies of the world are left with McGivering their own solutions, robustness and portability of 
which you can probably guess.</p>

<p>And how many teams actually streamline the process of starting a <em>YASS</em> - “yet another stupid service”? 
This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Developer privileges in GitHub/GitLab</li>
  <li>Default environment variables and configuration</li>
  <li>CI/CD</li>
  <li>Code quality checkers</li>
  <li>Code review settings</li>
  <li>Branch rules and protections</li>
  <li>Monitoring and observability</li>
  <li>Test harness</li>
  <li>Infrastructure-as-code</li>
</ul>

<p>And of course, multiply this list by the number of programming languages used throughout the company. Maybe you have a 
usable 
template or a runbook? Maybe a frictionless, one-click system to 
launch a new service from scratch? It takes months to iron out all the kinks with this kind of automation. So, you can either 
work on your product, or you can be working on <em>toooooling</em>.</p>

<h4 id="integration-tests---lol">Integration tests - LOL</h4>

<p>As if the everyday microservices grind was not enough, you also forfeit the peace of mind offered by solid integration tests. 
Your single-service and unit tests are passing, but are your critical paths still intact after 
each commit? Who is in charge of the overall integration test suite, in Postman or wherever else? Is there one?</p>

<photo-element source="complexity/unit.gif" aspect="original-size" alt="Service tests"></photo-element>

<p>Integration testing a distributed setup is a nearly-impossible problem, so we pretty much gave up on that and replaced it with 
another one - Observability. Just like “microservices” are the new “distributed systems”, “observability” is the new 
“debugging in production”. Surely, you are not writing real software if you are not doing…. observability!</p>

<p>Observability has become its own sector, and you will pay in both pretty penny and in developer 
time for it. It doesn’t come as plug-and-pay either - you need to understand and implement canary releases, feature flags, etc. 
Who is doing that? One already 
<a href="https://renegadeotter.com/2023/07/26/i-am-not-your-cloud-person.html">overwhelmed</a> engineer?</p>

<p>As you can see, breaking up your problem does not make solving it easier - all you get is another set of <em>even 
harder problems</em>.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-just-services">What about just “services”?</h3>

<p>Why do your services need to be “micro”? What’s wrong with
<a href="https://leeatchison.com/app-architectures/moving-beyond-microservices-hype/" target="_blank">just services</a>? Some
startups have gone as far as create <em>a service for
each function</em>, and yes, “isn’t that just like Lambda” is a valid question. This 
gives you an idea of how far gone this unchecked cargo cult is.</p>

<p>So what do we do? 
<a href="https://www.fearofoblivion.com/build-a-modular-monolith-first" target="_blank">Starting with a monolith</a>
is one obvious choice. A pattern that could also  work in many instances is “trunk &amp; 
branches”, where the main “meat and potatoes” monolith is helped by “branch” services. A branch service can be a service that 
takes care of a clearly-identifiable and
separately-scalable load. A CPU-hungry <em>Image-Resizing Service</em> makes way more sense than a <em>User Registration Service</em>. Or do you
get so many registrations per second that it requires independent horizontal scaling?</p>

<photo-element source="complexity/really.gif" aspect="original-size" alt="Vertical"></photo-element>



<h3 id="the-pendulum-is-swinging-back">The pendulum is swinging back</h3>
<p>The hype, however, seems to be dying down. The VC cash faucet is tightening, and so the
businesses have been market-corrected into exercising common-sense decisions, recognizing that perhaps splurging on 
web-scale architectures when they don’t have web-scale problems is not sustainable.</p>

<photo-element source="complexity/twitter1.png" aspect="landscape" alt="Vertical"></photo-element>

<photo-element source="complexity/twitter4.png" aspect="landscape" alt="AWS"></photo-element>

<p>Ultimately, when faced with the need to travel from New York to Philadelphia, you have two options. 
You can either attempt to construct a highly intricate spaceship for an orbital descent to your destination, or you can simply 
purchase an Amtrak train ticket for a 90-minute ride. <em>That</em> is the problem at hand.</p>

But most notably the famous Kefrens Bars effect does not display - the screen just goes blank.&nbsp; What's going wrong on the Book8088 vs a real IBM PC 5150?</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@davidly_33504/the-book-8088-is-too-fast-c0a2f01a1cc8" target="_blank">As others have noted</a>, even with an 8088 swap, there's something a little fishy going on.</p><h2>DRAM Refresh DMA</h2><p>The original IBM PC used DRAM - 'dynamic' memory that had to be periodically refreshed, or it would lose charge and subsequently its memory contents. IBM was trying to keep the costs of the IBM PC down, so decided to utilize some of the accessory chips that the PC had to perform the task of DRAM refresh rather than add dedicated circuitry to handle it. Therefore one of three channels of the system's timer chip and one of four channels of the system's DMA controller are dedicated solely to the task of refreshing memory.&nbsp;</p><p>By default, every 72 CPU cycles, the timer chip counts down to 0 and sends an output pulse to the DMA controller, triggering a DMA request which eventually pulls the READY line to the CPU low, potentially stalling the CPU if it is in the middle of a bus transaction. During this time certain address lines are strobed, which is all that is needed to refresh the memory cells.</p><p>This has a variable impact on system performance. If the CPU is primarily performing long, arithmetic instructions such as division or multiplication, it won't really slow things down at all. If the CPU is instead copying memory with a string instruction, or executing a sequence of very short instructions&nbsp; requiring rapid fetching, then the impact can be quite substantial.&nbsp; Averaged out, the 8088 CPU in the IBM PC is about 5% slower than it otherwise would be without DRAM refresh.</p><p>If you're curious to know more about how DMA works on the IBM PC, I wrote a <a href="https://martypc.blogspot.com/2023/05/exploring-dma-on-ibm-pc.html" target="_blank">previous article on it</a>.</p><p>The Book8088 and many modern hobby PC clones like it usually forgo DRAM and its complications and instead use SRAM chips. The S stands for Static, and like the name suggests it does not require refreshing. Therefore we don't need to have this process going on at all, so we don't need to have timer channel #1 ticking away and we don't need DMA channel #0 configured for DRAM refresh, and our CPU can run 5% faster. Isn't that just a bonus?</p><p>Well, yes and no. When talking about compatibility with the original IBM PC, there were several software titles that made assumptions about the exact speed of the 8088 CPU, and they made those assumptions with the DRAM refresh performance impact baked-in. If we don't simulate DRAM refresh, we open ourselves up to compatibility issues.</p><p>The Kefrens effect in the 8088MPH demo is a good example. It is a perfectly cycle-counted effect. This effect does not tightly poll the CGA status register to determine when the CGA card is in hblank or vblank, or really where it is on the screen at all. It does not set up a normal screen resolution - instead, it draws a scanline at a time, 'racing the beam'. This is possible due to the fact that the CGA clock is an exact multiple of the CPU clock, so that a single CPU cycle equates to 3 pixels or 'hdots' on screen. Knowing that a single scanline takes 912 hdots to display means if we execute an effect somehow utilizing exactly 304 CPU cycles per scanline, that effect will run in perfect synchronization with the CGA card. And so that's exactly what the Kefrens effect does - it's some impressive coding.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimrhVOWMuCJZzaX5gLtvs-K7mybXE9YXpMZ5_BYG9sNgFeLLjw5pR_Yckxgdy-vfLzbsHLObw2_06bTn50GQri-yJ250FNnBEB3WSiU_2x-1M4xUhxJzTr0KGeSty4udEsyvrPL-0fzdcrV-lPSGCUxuIw8pQhEolIyqa-4WAZjR_94lgqp8-BllKI8zmV/s658/kefrens_02.png"><img data-original-height="547" data-original-width="658" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimrhVOWMuCJZzaX5gLtvs-K7mybXE9YXpMZ5_BYG9sNgFeLLjw5pR_Yckxgdy-vfLzbsHLObw2_06bTn50GQri-yJ250FNnBEB3WSiU_2x-1M4xUhxJzTr0KGeSty4udEsyvrPL-0fzdcrV-lPSGCUxuIw8pQhEolIyqa-4WAZjR_94lgqp8-BllKI8zmV/s16000/kefrens_02.png"></a></td></tr><tr><td>Kefrens Bars in 8088MPH - it looks better in motion!</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The reason that this effect does not work on a stock Book8088 is that the painstaking cycle counting done for the effect takes into account the wait state cycles incurred by DRAM refresh DMA on the IBM PC.</p><p>Since the Book8088 isn't doing DRAM refresh, the corresponding wait states don't occur, the effect runs too fast, and quickly is out of sync with the CGA card. Vsync signals happen at the wrong times, and I imagine the LCD controller on the Book8088 gets very upset and refuses to display an image at all.</p><h2>Can we just turn DMA on?</h2><p>It would be nice if we could just program the timer channel #1 to the appropriate value, and set up DMA channel #0 like the BIOS does, and then DRAM refresh would operate as it does on the IBM PC, just harmlessly addressing the system's SRAM but making our 8088 CPU operate at the correct speed.</p><p>We can write a short assembly program that attempts to do just that, and assemble it to 'startdma.com':</p>

Be sure to check there is no connectivity between adjacent pins - the stranded wires can splay out and potentially short.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi3yq9pM-fvtCa6mBoJowWsO91kZ-U-J3YT5SQR4PAZkooyfuTGcVM9a3eQJKPlwK-CDq678gtF28o5rjULzEwrAqjHsSMtffG-qZ6QVqbrGTl8IdoQ0oPEyuWMf6CnYYiMS4RL_NjltLhniWUOKo97n5kc3wbljC353GYw4awyto6ZA6EUxEtFlFk1jzlH/s1575/dmac_wires01.JPG"><img data-original-height="1160" data-original-width="1575" height="295" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi3yq9pM-fvtCa6mBoJowWsO91kZ-U-J3YT5SQR4PAZkooyfuTGcVM9a3eQJKPlwK-CDq678gtF28o5rjULzEwrAqjHsSMtffG-qZ6QVqbrGTl8IdoQ0oPEyuWMf6CnYYiMS4RL_NjltLhniWUOKo97n5kc3wbljC353GYw4awyto6ZA6EUxEtFlFk1jzlH/w400-h295/dmac_wires01.JPG" width="400"></a></p><p>DREQ0 will go over to the timer chip, but it can't connect to the output of timer channel #1 directly.&nbsp; The timer is driven in Rate Generator mode, which stays high most of the time, dropping low on a 1 count for one tick.&nbsp; DREQ0 is level-triggered; if directly connected, DRAM refresh DMA would run constantly, and our PC would be much slower than intended.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhdLHZyNdc308_1Mj5wmXKFtBvTF2Kfls2S2r2OQsgxkRutENe7DCfYeiEto2ciKm59oYIuPyp0aALTK5ywY_capRquzNPgyZjdc7FrEwQZTGzXpmgy2ydNZyJ511XZrb6izyJdtASx7qfiI-uYGhI5PP24dqqie_rZt64K_mxqLnWk5Wq0m5A9WD0EcpPk/s779/dma_circuit02.PNG"><img data-original-height="266" data-original-width="779" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhdLHZyNdc308_1Mj5wmXKFtBvTF2Kfls2S2r2OQsgxkRutENe7DCfYeiEto2ciKm59oYIuPyp0aALTK5ywY_capRquzNPgyZjdc7FrEwQZTGzXpmgy2ydNZyJ511XZrb6izyJdtASx7qfiI-uYGhI5PP24dqqie_rZt64K_mxqLnWk5Wq0m5A9WD0EcpPk/s16000/dma_circuit02.PNG"></a></td></tr><tr><td>The IBM 5150 DREQ0 logic circuit</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Instead, DREQ0 is driven by the output of a 74LS74 flip-flop, which is clocked by the channel #1 output.

<p><strong>Caddy is the first and only web server to use HTTPS automatically <em>and by default</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Automatic HTTPS provisions TLS certificates for all your sites and keeps them renewed. It also redirects HTTP to HTTPS for you! Caddy uses safe and modern defaults -- no downtime, extra configuration, or separate tooling is required.</p>

<p>Here's a 28-second video showing how it works:</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="480" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nk4EWHvvZtI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<li><a href="#storage">Storage</a></li>
<li><a href="#wildcard-certificates">Wildcard certificates</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><strong>By default, Caddy serves all sites over HTTPS.</strong></p>

<p>Caddy keeps all managed certificates renewed and redirects HTTP (default port <code>80</code>) to HTTPS (default port <code>443</code>) automatically.</p>
<p><strong>For local HTTPS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Caddy may prompt for a password to install its unique root certificate into your trust store. This happens only once per root; and you can remove it at any time.</li>
<li>Any client accessing the site without trusting Caddy's root CA certificate will show security errors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For public domain names:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If your domain's A/AAAA records point to your server,</li>
<li>ports <code>80</code> and <code>443</code> are open externally,</li>
<li>Caddy can bind to those ports (<em>or</em> those ports are forwarded to Caddy),</li>
<li>your <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/conventions#data-directory">data directory</a> is writeable and persistent,</li>
<li>and your domain name appears somewhere relevant in the config,</li>
</ul>
<p>then sites will be served over HTTPS automatically. You won't have to do anything else about it. It just works!</p>
<p>Because HTTPS utilizes a shared, public infrastructure, you as the server admin should understand the rest of the information on this page so that you can avoid unnecessary problems, troubleshoot them when they occur, and properly configure advanced deployments.</p>
<h2 id="activation">Activation</h2>
<p>Caddy implicitly activates automatic HTTPS when it knows a domain name (i.e. hostname) or IP address it is serving. There are various ways to tell Caddy your domain/IP, depending on how you run or configure Caddy:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/concepts#addresses">site address</a> in the <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile">Caddyfile</a></li>
<li>A <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/http/servers/routes/match/host/">host matcher</a> in a <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http#servers/routes">JSON route</a></li>
<li>Command line flags like <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/command-line#caddy-file-server">--domain</a> or <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/command-line#caddy-reverse-proxy">--from</a></li>
<li>The <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/tls/certificates/automate/">automate</a> certificate loader</li>
</ul>
<p>Any of the following will prevent automatic HTTPS from being activated, either in whole or in part:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explicitly disabling it <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/http/servers/automatic_https/">via JSON</a> or <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/options#auto-https">via Caddyfile</a></li>
<li>Not providing any hostnames or IP addresses in the config</li>
<li>Listening exclusively on the HTTP port</li>
<li>Prefixing the <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/concepts#addresses">site address</a> with <code>http://</code> in the Caddyfile</li>
<li>Manually loading certificates (unless <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/http/servers/automatic_https/ignore_loaded_certificates/"><code>ignore_loaded_certificates</code></a> is set)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Special cases:</strong></p>

<h2 id="effects">Effects</h2>
<p>When automatic HTTPS is activated, the following occurs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Certificates are obtained and renewed for <a href="#hostname-requirements">all domain names</a></li>
<li>The default port (if any) is changed to the <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http#https_port">HTTPS port</a> <code>443</code></li>
<li>HTTP is redirected to HTTPS (this uses <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http#http_port">HTTP port</a> <code>80</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Automatic HTTPS never overrides explicit configuration.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/http/servers/automatic_https/">customize or disable automatic HTTPS</a> if necessary; for example, you can skip certain domain names or disable redirects (for Caddyfile, do this with <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/options">global options</a>).</p>
<h2 id="hostname-requirements">Hostname requirements</h2>
<p>All hostnames (domain names) qualify for fully-managed certificates if they:</p>
<ul>
<li>are non-empty</li>
<li>consist only of alphanumerics, hyphens, dots, and wildcard (<code>*</code>)</li>
<li>do not start or end with a dot (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034#section-3.5">RFC 1034</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, hostnames qualify for publicly-trusted certificates if they:</p>
<ul>
<li>are not localhost (including <code>.localhost</code> and <code>.local</code> TLDs)</li>
<li>are not an IP address</li>
<li>have only a single wildcard <code>*</code> as the left-most label</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="local-https">Local HTTPS</h2>
<p>Caddy uses HTTPS automatically for all sites with a host (domain, IP, or hostname) specified, including internal and local hosts. Some hosts are either not public (e.g. <code>127.0.0.1</code>, <code>localhost</code>) or do not generally qualify for publicly-trusted certificates (e.g. IP addresses -- you can get certificates for them, but only from some CAs). These are still served over HTTPS unless disabled.</p>
<p>To serve non-public sites over HTTPS, Caddy generates its own certificate authority (CA) and uses it to sign certificates. The trust chain consists of a root and intermediate certificate. Leaf certificates are signed by the intermediate. They are stored in <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/conventions#data-directory">Caddy's data directory</a> at <code>pki/authorities/local</code>.</p>
<p>Caddy's local CA is powered by <a href="https://smallstep.com/certificates/">Smallstep libraries <img src="https://caddyserver.com/resources/images/external-link.svg"></a>.</p>
<p>Local HTTPS does not use ACME nor does it perform any DNS validation. It works only on the local machine and is trusted only where the CA's root certificate is installed.</p>
<h3 id="ca-root">CA Root</h3>
<p>The root's private key is uniquely generated using a cryptographically-secure pseudorandom source and persisted to storage with limited permissions. It is loaded into memory only to perform signing tasks, after which it leaves scope to be garbage-collected.</p>
<p>Although Caddy can be configured to sign with the root directly (to support non-compliant clients), this is disabled by default, and the root key is only used to sign intermediates.</p>
<p>The first time a root key is used, Caddy will try to install it into the system's local trust store(s). If it does not have permission to do so, it will prompt for a password. This behavior can be disabled in the configuration if it is not desired. If this fails due to being run as an unprivileged user, you may run <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/command-line#caddy-trust"><code>caddy trust</code></a> to retry installation as a privileged user.</p>

<p>After Caddy's root CA is installed, you will see it in your local trust store as "Caddy Local Authority" (unless you've configured a different name). You can uninstall it any time if you wish (the <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/command-line#caddy-untrust"><code>caddy untrust</code></a> command makes this easy).</p>
<p>Note that automatically installing the certificate into the local trust stores is for convenience only and isn't guaranteed to work, especially if containers are being used or if Caddy is being run as an unprivileged system service. Ultimately, if you are relying on internal PKI, it is the system administrator's responsibility to ensure Caddy's root CA is properly added to the necessary trust stores (this is outside the scope of the web server).</p>
<h3 id="ca-intermediates">CA Intermediates</h3>
<p>An intermediate certificate and key will also be generated, which will be used for signing leaf (individual site) certificates.</p>
<p>Unlike the root certificate, intermediate certificates have a much shorter lifetime and will automatically be renewed as needed.</p>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>To test or experiment with your Caddy configuration, make sure you <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/tls.issuance.acme#ca">change the ACME endpoint</a> to a staging or development URL, otherwise you are likely to hit rate limits which can block your access to HTTPS for up to a week, depending on which rate limit you hit.</p>
<p>One of Caddy's default CAs is <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt <img src="https://caddyserver.com/resources/images/external-link.svg"></a>, which has a <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/staging-environment/">staging endpoint <img src="https://caddyserver.com/resources/images/external-link.svg"></a> that is not subject to the same <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/">rate limits <img src="https://caddyserver.com/resources/images/external-link.svg"></a>:</p>
<pre><code>https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
</code></pre>
<h2 id="acme-challenges">ACME challenges</h2>
<p>Obtaining a publicly-trusted TLS certificate requires validation from a publicly-trusted, third-party authority. These days, this validation process is automated with the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555">ACME protocol <img src="https://caddyserver.com/resources/images/external-link.svg"></a>, and can be performed one of three ways ("challenge types"), described below.</p>
<p>The first two challenge types are enabled by default. If multiple challenges are enabled, Caddy chooses one at random to avoid accidental dependence on a particular challenge. Over time, it learns which challenge type is most successful and will begin to prefer it first, but will fall back to other available challenge types if necessary.</p>
<h3 id="http-challenge">HTTP challenge</h3>
<p>The HTTP challenge performs an authoritative DNS lookup for the candidate hostname's A/AAAA record, then requests a temporary cryptographic resource over port <code>80</code> using HTTP. If the CA sees the expected resource, a certificate is issued.</p>
<p>This challenge requires port <code>80</code> to be externally accessible. If Caddy cannot listen on port 80, packets from port <code>80</code> must be forwarded to Caddy's <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/http/http_port/">HTTP port</a>.</p>
<p>This challenge is enabled by default and does not require explicit configuration.</p>
<h3 id="tls-alpn-challenge">TLS-ALPN challenge</h3>
<p>The TLS-ALPN challenge performs an authoritative DNS lookup for the candidate hostname's A/AAAA record, then requests a temporary cryptographic resource over port <code>443</code> using a TLS handshake containing special ServerName and ALPN values. If the CA sees the expected resource, a certificate is issued.</p>
<p>This challenge requires port <code>443</code> to be externally accessible. If Caddy cannot listen on port 443, packets from port <code>443</code> must be forwarded to Caddy's <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/http/https_port/">HTTPS port</a>.</p>
<p>This challenge is enabled by default and does not require explicit configuration.</p>
<h3 id="dns-challenge">DNS challenge</h3>
<p>The DNS challenge performs an authoritative DNS lookup for the candidate hostname's <code>TXT</code> records, and looks for a special <code>TXT</code> record with a certain value. If the CA sees the expected value, a certificate is issued.</p>
<p>This challenge does not require any open ports, and the server requesting a certificate does not need to be externally accessible. However, the DNS challenge requires configuration. Caddy needs to know the credentials to access your domain's DNS provider so it can set (and clear) the special <code>TXT</code> records. If the DNS challenge is enabled, other challenges are disabled by default.</p>
<p>Since ACME CAs follow DNS standards when looking up <code>TXT</code> records for challenge verification, you can use CNAME records to delegate answering the challenge to other DNS zones. This can be used to delegate the <code>_acme-challenge</code> subdomain to another zone. This is particularly useful if your DNS provider doesn't provide an API, or isn't supported by one of the DNS plugins for Caddy.</p>
<p>DNS provider support is a community effort. <a href="https://caddy.community/t/how-to-use-dns-provider-modules-in-caddy-2/8148">Learn how to enable the DNS challenge for your provider at our wiki.</a></p>
<h2 id="on-demand-tls">On-Demand TLS</h2>
<p>Caddy pioneered a new technology we call <strong>On-Demand TLS</strong>, which dynamically obtains a new certificate during the first TLS handshake that requires it, rather than at config load. Crucially, this does <strong>not</strong> require hard-coding the domain names in your configuration ahead of time.</p>
<p>Many businesses rely on this unique feature to scale their TLS deployments at lower cost and without operational headaches when serving tens of thousands of sites.</p>
<p>On-demand TLS is useful if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you do not know all the domain names when you start or reload your server,</li>
<li>domain names might not be properly configured right away (DNS records not yet set),</li>
<li>you are not in control of the domain names (e.g. they are customer domains).</li>
</ul>
<p>When on-demand TLS is enabled, you do not need to specify the domain names in your config in order to get certificates for them. Instead, when a TLS handshake is received for a server name (SNI) that Caddy does not yet have a certificate for, the handshake is held while Caddy obtains a certificate to use to complete the handshake. The delay is usually only a few seconds, and only that initial handshake is slow. All future handshakes are fast because certificates are cached and reused, and renewals happen in the background. Future handshakes may trigger maintenance for the certificate to keep it renewed, but this maintenance happens in the background if the certificate hasn't expired yet.</p>
<h3 id="using-on-demand-tls">Using On-Demand TLS</h3>
<p><strong>On-demand TLS must be both enabled and restricted to prevent abuse.</strong></p>
<p>Enabling on-demand TLS happens in <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/tls/automation/policies/">TLS automation policies</a> if using the JSON config, or <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/tls">in site blocks with the <code>tls</code> directive</a> if using the Caddyfile.</p>
<p>To prevent abuse of this feature, you must configure restrictions. This is done in the <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/tls/automation/on_demand/"><code>automation</code> object of the JSON config</a>, or the <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/options#on-demand-tls"><code>on_demand_tls</code> global option</a> of the Caddyfile. Restrictions are "global" and aren't configurable per-site or per-domain. The primary restriction is an "ask" endpoint to which Caddy will send an HTTP request to ask if it has permission to obtain and manage a certificate for the domain in the handshake. This means you will need some internal backend that can, for example, query the accounts table of your database and see if a customer has signed up with that domain name.</p>
<p>Be mindful of how quickly your CA is able to issue certificates. If it takes more than a few seconds, this will negatively impact the user experience (for the first client only).</p>
<p>Due to its deferred nature and the extra configuration required to prevent abuse, we recommend enabling on-demand TLS only when your actual use case is described above.</p>
<p><a href="https://caddy.community/t/serving-tens-of-thousands-of-domains-over-https-with-caddy/11179">See our wiki article for more information about using on-demand TLS effectively.</a></p>
<h2 id="errors">Errors</h2>
<p>Caddy does its best to continue if errors occur with certificate management.</p>
<p>By default, certificate management is performed in the background. This means it will not block startup or slow down your sites. However, it also means that the server will be running even before all certificates are available. Running in the background allows Caddy to retry with exponential backoff over a long period of time.</p>
<p>Here's what happens if there's an error obtaining or renewing a certificate:</p>
<ol>
<li>Caddy retries once after a brief pause just in case it was a fluke</li>
<li>Caddy pauses briefly, then switches to the next enabled challenge type</li>
<li>After all enabled challenge types have been tried, <a href="#issuer-fallback">it tries the next configured issuer</a>
<ul>
<li>Let's Encrypt</li>
<li>ZeroSSL</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After all issuers have been tried, it backs off exponentially
<ul>
<li>Maximum of 1 day between attempts</li>
<li>For up to 30 days</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>During retries with Let's Encrypt, Caddy switches to their <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/staging-environment/">staging environment <img src="https://caddyserver.com/resources/images/external-link.svg"></a> to avoid rate limit concerns. This isn't a perfect strategy, but in general it's helpful.</p>
<p>ACME challenges take at least a few seconds, and internal rate limiting helps mitigate accidental abuse. Caddy uses internal rate limiting in addition to what you or the CA configure so that you can hand Caddy a platter with a million domain names and it will gradually -- but as fast as it can -- obtain certificates for all of them. Caddy's internal rate limit is currently 10 attempts per ACME account per 10 seconds.</p>
<p>To avoid leaking resources, Caddy aborts in-flight tasks (including ACME transactions) when config is changed. While Caddy is capable of handling frequent config reloads, be mindful of operational considerations such as this, and consider batching config changes to reduce reloads and give Caddy a chance to actually finish obtaining certificates in the background.</p>
<h3 id="issuer-fallback">Issuer fallback</h3>
<p>Caddy is the first (and so far only) server to support fully-redundant, automatic failover to other CAs in the event it cannot successfully get a certificate.</p>
<p>By default, Caddy enables two ACME-compatible CAs: <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/"><strong>Let's Encrypt</strong> <img src="https://caddyserver.com/resources/images/external-link.svg"></a> and <a href="https://zerossl.com/"><strong>ZeroSSL</strong> <img src="https://caddyserver.com/resources/images/external-link.svg"></a>. If Caddy cannot get a certificate from Let's Encrypt, it will try with ZeroSSL; if both fail, it will backoff and retry again later. In your config, you can customize which issuers Caddy uses to obtain certificates, either universally or for specific names.</p>
<h2 id="storage">Storage</h2>
<p>Caddy will store public certificates, private keys, and other assets in its <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/storage/">configured storage facility</a> (or the default one, if not configured -- see link for details).</p>
<p><strong>The main thing you need to know using the default config is that the <code>$HOME</code> folder must be writeable and persistent.</strong> To help you troubleshoot, Caddy prints its environment variables at startup if the <code>--environ</code> flag is specified.</p>
<p>Any Caddy instances that are configured to use the same storage will automatically share those resources and coordinate certificate management as a cluster.</p>
<p>Before attempting any ACME transactions, Caddy will test the configured storage to ensure it is writeable and has sufficient capacity. This helps reduce unnecessary lock contention.</p>
<h2 id="wildcard-certificates">Wildcard certificates</h2>
<p>Caddy can obtain and manage wildcard certificates when it is configured to serve a site with a qualifying wildcard name. A site name qualifies for a wildcard if only its left-most domain label is a wildcard. For example, <code>*.example.com</code> qualifies, but these do not: <code>sub.*.example.com</code>, <code>foo*.example.com</code>, <code>*bar.example.com</code>, and <code>*.*.example.com</code>.</p>
<p>If using the Caddyfile, Caddy takes site names literally with regards to the certificate subject names. In other words, a site defined as <code>sub.example.com</code> will cause Caddy to manage a certificate for <code>sub.example.com</code>, and a site defined as <code>*.example.com</code> will cause Caddy to manage a wildcard certificate for <code>*.example.com</code>. You can see this demonstrated on our <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/patterns#wildcard-certificates">Common Caddyfile Patterns</a> page. If you need different behavior, the <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/">JSON config</a> gives you more precise control over certificate subjects and site names ("host matchers").</p>
<p>Wildcard certificates represent a wide degree of authority and should only be used when you have so many subdomains that managing individual certificates for them would strain the PKI or cause you to hit CA-enforced rate limits.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/">Let's Encrypt requires <img src="https://caddyserver.com/resources/images/external-link.svg"></a> the <a href="#dns-challenge">DNS challenge</a> to obtain wildcard certificates.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>During the COVID-19 lockdown, Courtney bought a bounce house for her two young children. Soon after, her son, Alex, then 4, began experiencing pain.</p><p>“(Our nanny) started telling me, ‘I have to give him Motrin every day, or he has these gigantic meltdowns,’” Courtney, who asked not to use her last name to protect her family’s privacy, tells TODAY.com. “If he had Motrin, he was totally fine."</p><p>Then Alex began chewing things, so Courtney took him to the dentist. What followed was a three-year search for the cause of Alex's increasing pain and eventually other symptoms.</p><br><figure><picture><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:eco,dpr_2.0/rockcms/2023-09/chat-gpt-diagnosis-jp-230911-f1cc83.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-09/chat-gpt-diagnosis-jp-230911-f1cc83.jpg 1x"><source srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:eco,dpr_2.0/rockcms/2023-09/chat-gpt-diagnosis-jp-230911-f1cc83.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-09/chat-gpt-diagnosis-jp-230911-f1cc83.jpg 1x"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-09/chat-gpt-diagnosis-jp-230911-f1cc83.jpg" alt="Chat GPT helped diagnosis her son" height="4032" width="3024"></picture><figcaption><span data-testid="caption__container">Ever since undergoing surgery to fix his tethered cord syndrome, Alex can't stop smiling.
</span><span>Courtesy Courtney</span></figcaption></figure><p>The beginning of the end of the journey came earlier this year, when Courtney finally got some answers from an unlikely source, ChatGPT. The frustrated mom made an account and shared with the artificial intelligence platform everything she knew about her son's symptoms and all the information she could gather from his MRIs. </p><p>“We saw so many doctors. We ended up in the ER at one point. I kept pushing,” she says. “I really spent the night on the (computer) … going through all these things." </p><p>So, when ChatGPT suggested a diagnosis of tethered cord syndrome, "it made a lot of sense," she recalls.</p><h2>Pain, grinding teeth, dragging leg</h2><p>When Alex began chewing on things, his parents wondered if his molars were coming in and causing pain. As it continued, they thought he had a cavity. </p><p>“Our sweet personality — for the most part —&nbsp;(child) is dissolving into this tantrum-ing crazy person that didn’t exist the rest of the time,” Courtney recalls. </p><p>The dentist “ruled everything out” but thought maybe Alex was grinding his teeth and believed an orthodontist specializing in airway obstruction could help. Airway obstructions impact a child’s sleep and could explain why he seemed so exhausted and moody, the dentist thought. The orthodontist found that Alex’s palate was too small for his mouth and teeth, which made it tougher for him to breathe at night. She placed an expander in Alex’s palate, and it seemed like things were improving. </p><p>“Everything was better for a little bit,” Courtney says. “We thought we were in the home stretch.” </p><p>But then she noticed Alex had stopped growing taller, so they visited the pediatrician, who thought the pandemic was negatively affecting his development. Courtney didn’t agree, but she still brought her son back in early 2021 for a checkup. </p><p>"He'd grown a little bit," she says.</p><p>The pediatrician then referred Alex to physical therapy because he seemed to have some imbalances between his left and right sides.</p><p>“He would lead with his right foot and just bring his left foot along for the ride,” Courtney says.</p><p>But before starting physical therapy, Alex had already been experiencing severe headaches that were only getting worse. He visited a neurologist, who said Alex had migraines. The boy also struggled with exhaustion, so he was taken to an ear, nose and throat doctor to see if he was having sleep problems due to his sinus cavities or airway.</p><p>No matter how many doctors the family saw, the specialists would only address their individual areas of expertise, Courtney says.</p><p>“Nobody’s willing to solve for the greater problem,” she adds. “Nobody will even give you a clue about what the diagnosis could be.”</p><p>Next, a physical therapist thought that Alex could have something called Chiari malformation, a congenital condition that causes abnormalities in the brain where the skull meets the spine, according to the <a href="https://www.aans.org/en/Patients/Neurosurgical-Conditions-and-Treatments/Chiari-Malformation" target="_blank">American Association of Neurological Surgeons</a>. Courtney began researching it, and they visited more doctors — a new pediatrician, a pediatric internist, an adult internist and a musculoskeletal doctor — but again reached a dead end.</p><p>In total, they visited 17 different doctors over three years. But Alex still had no diagnosis that explained all his symptoms. An exhausted and frustrated Courtney signed up for ChatGPT and began entering his medical information, hoping to find a diagnosis.</p><p>“I went line by line of everything that was in his (MRI notes) and plugged it into ChatGPT,” she says. “I put the note in there about ... how he wouldn’t sit crisscross applesauce. To me, that was a huge trigger (that) a structural thing could be wrong.” </p><p>She eventually found tethered cord syndrome and joined a Facebook group for families of children with it. Their stories sounded like Alex's. She scheduled an appointment with a new neurosurgeon and told her she suspected Alex had tethered cord syndrome. The doctor looked at his MRI images and knew exactly what was wrong with Alex.</p><p>“She said point blank, ‘Here’s occulta spina bifida, and here’s where the spine is tethered,” Courtney says.</p><p>Tethered cord syndrome occurs when the tissue in the spinal cord forms attachments that limit movement of the spinal cord, causing it to stretch abnormally, according to the <a href="https://www.aans.org/en/Patients/Neurosurgical-Conditions-and-Treatments/Tethered-Spinal-Cord-Syndrome" target="_blank">American Association of Neurological Surgeons</a>. The condition is closely associated with spina bifida, a birth defect where part of the spinal cord doesn’t develop fully and some of the spinal cord and nerves are exposed.</p><p>With tethered cord syndrome, “the spinal cord is stuck to something. It could be a tumor in the spinal canal. It could be a bump on a spike of bones. It could just be too much fat at the end of the spinal cord,” Dr. Holly Gilmer, a pediatric neurosurgeon at the Michigan Head &amp; Spine Institute, who treated Alex, tells TODAY.com. "The abnormality can’t elongate ... and it pulls.”&nbsp;</p><p>In many children with spina bifida, there’s a visible opening in the child’s back. But the type Alex had is closed and considered “hidden,” also known as spina bifida occulta, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/spinabifida/facts.html" target="_blank">according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p><p>“My son doesn’t have a hole. There’s almost what looks like a birthmark on the top of his buttocks, but nobody saw it,” Courtney says. “He has a crooked belly button.”</p><p>Gilmer says doctors often find these conditions soon after birth, but in some cases, the marks — such as a dimple, a red spot or a tuft of hair — that indicate spina bifida occulta can be missed. Then doctors rely on symptoms to make the diagnosis, which can include dragging a leg, pain, loss of bladder control, constipation, scoliosis, foot or leg abnormalities and a delay in hitting milestones, such as sitting up and walking.</p><p>“In young children, it can be difficult to diagnose because they can’t speak,” Gilmer says, adding that many parents and children don't realize that their symptoms indicate a problem. "If this is how they have always been, they think that’s normal.”&nbsp;</p><p>When Courtney finally had a diagnosis for Alex, she experienced "every emotion in the book, relief, validated, excitement for his future."</p><h2>ChatGPT and medicine</h2><p>ChatGPT is a type of artificial intelligence program that responds based on input that a person enters into it, but it can't have a conversation or provide answers in the way that many people might expect.</p><p>That's because ChatGPT works by "predicting the next word" in a sentence or series of words based on existing text data on the internet, Andrew Beam, Ph.D., assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard who studies machine learning models and medicine, tells TODAY.com. “Anytime you ask a question of ChatGPT, it’s recalling from memory things it has read before and trying to predict the piece of text.”</p><p>When using ChatGPT to make a diagnosis, a person might tell the program, "I have fever, chills and body aches,” and it fills in “influenza” as a possible diagnosis, Beam explains.</p><p>“It’s going to do its best to give you a piece of text that looks like a … passage that it’s read,” he adds.</p><p>There are both free and paid versions of ChatGPT, and the latter works much better than the free version, Beam says. But both seem to work better than the average symptom checker or Google as a diagnostic tool. “It’s a super high-powered medical search engine,” Beam says.</p><p>It can be especially beneficial for patients with complicated conditions who are struggling to get a diagnosis, Beam says.</p><p>These patients are "groping for information," he adds. "I do think ChatGPT can be a good partner in that diagnostic odyssey. It has read literally the entire internet. It may not have the same blind spots as the human physician has."</p><p>But it’s not likely to replace a clinician’s expertise anytime soon, he says. For example, ChatGPT fabricates information sometimes when it can't find the answer. Say you ask it for studies about influenza. The tool might respond with several titles that sound real, and the authors it lists may have even written about flu before — but the papers may not actually exist.</p><p>This phenomenon is called "hallucination," and "that gets really problematic when we start talking about medical applications because you don’t want it to just make things up," Beam says.</p><p>&nbsp;Dr. Jesse M. Ehrenfeld, president of leading U.S. physicians' group the American Medical Association, tells TODAY.com in a statement that the AMA "supports deployment of high-quality, clinically validated AI that is deployed in a responsible, ethical, and transparent manner with patient safety being the first and foremost concern. While AI products show tremendous promise in helping alleviate physician administrative burdens and may ultimately be successfully utilized in direct patient care, OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other generative AI products currently have known issues and are not error free."</p><p>He adds that "the current limitations create potential risks for physicians and patients and should be utilized with appropriate caution at this time. AI-generated fabrications, errors, or inaccuracies can harm patients, and physicians need to be acutely aware of these risks and added liability before they rely on unregulated machine-learning algorithms and tools."&nbsp;</p><p>“Just as we demand proof that new medicines and biologics are safe and effective, so must we insist on clinical evidence of the safety and efficacy of new AI-enabled healthcare applications," Ehrenfeld concludes.</p><h2>Diagnosis and treatment</h2><p>Alex is “happy go lucky” and loves playing with other children. He played baseball last year, but he quit because he was injured. Also, he had to give up hockey because wearing ice skates hurts his back and knees. He found a way to adapt, though. </p><p>“He’s so freaking intelligent,” Courtney says. “He’ll climb up on a structure, stand on a chair, and starts being the coach. So, he keeps himself in the game.”</p><p>After receiving the diagnosis, Alex underwent surgery to fix his tethered cord syndrome a few weeks ago. </p><p>“We detach the cord from where it is stuck at the bottom of the tailbone essentially,” Gilmer says. “That releases the tension.”&nbsp;</p><p>Alex is still recovering.<strong> </strong>Gilmer says children bounce back from this surgery relatively quickly. Often the treatment, reduces any symptoms children were having, she says. Alex's mom can see the joy on his face now. </p><p>Courtney shared their story to help others facing similar struggles. </p><p>“There’s nobody that connects the dots for you,” she says. “You have to be your kid’s advocate.”</p><p><em>This story was updated to include a statement from the American Medical Association.</em></p></div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><p><span></span><span><a href="https://www.today.com/author/meghan-holohan-tdpn511">Meghan Holohan</a></span><span></span></p><p>Meghan Holohan is a contributing writer who covers health and parenting for TODAY.com.

<p>Having grown up in the '90s, gaming on PC was nothing like it is today. I can still recall the excitement on my dad's face when he brought home our second family computer, excitedly telling me about the 1GB of storage space we'd now have. A whole Gig! We'd <em>never </em>fill that up! That was also the first computer we ever took online, and back in those early glory days when whatever was on AOL made up the bulk of my online experience, there were still a few times I'd stray from the AOL message board and chatrooms and take trepid step into the dreaded URL bar, typing in a secret code starting with www that I'd read in a book. (Yes, I used to find websites through books; it as a different time). I don't know that you could truly consider them all games by today's standard — they were more like little animated communities where minigames were present, but community and website exploration made up a good deal of the action.</p>

<p>So when I saw our own Jack Coleman stepping outside the box to revisit his <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/wizard-101-still-active/">childhood love for Wizard 101</a> a while back, it made me nostalgic for a simpler time when I was but a bored and curious teen on the Internet (not like that, ya pervs. Get your minds out of the gutter). In the last couple of weeks, I've re-embraced my childhood love of Neopets, a splendiferous online virtual pet playground of games and merriment launched in 1999. To my surprise, I've discovered that you're still free to explore Neopets today, though it's safe to say it's not quite the online tour-de-force it once was.</p>

<p>Oh, and Neopets was dependent on Flash, and, well, Flash is dead, with the end result being that the site doesn't function the way that it should. Choose-your-own-adveture-style stories are abruptly cut off as soon as a movie is encountered, and about 80 percent of the minigames scattered throughout the site crash as soon as I click the start button. I found out through Reddit that you <em>can</em> get everything (or almost everything) to function properly if you download and install an off-the-mainstram web browser that still supports flash, but I'm already middle-aged and stalking around a website designed for kids. Installing a special web browser just to hang around the Neopets community? That feels like the sort of thing that'd get me put on a government watchlist — and I think I'm in the majority of people who aren't going to add an extra Internet browser for the sake of one nostalgic website — so I think I'll just keep poking around in good ol' Chrome.</p>

<p>The site is still filled with brightly-colored maps beckoning me into a wonderful array of shops and games and other attractions. There's the dual medieval-themed kingdoms of Brightvale and Meridell, the under-the-sea realm of Maraqua, the orbital Virtupets Space Station, and more than a dozen others. It's like that feeling you get on a glorious summer morning when your parents have driven you out to an amusement park; a place where enjoyment is king, and you can really just run wild and be a kid.</p>

<p>But the more and more I clicked around this world of wonder and merriment, the more it lost that magical glow, and it started to feel like those eerie photo essays of abandoned theme parks, where nature has reclaimed the empty walkways and rides sit idly in a dilapidated state of inoperable decay. Most of the games scattered throughout the map are inaccessible by conventional means (more on that later), simply popping up a plugin error whenever I try to play.</p>

<p>You're still allowed to spend your hard-won Neopoints on things like scratch cards, but good luck actually trying to scratch them off and cash them in once the irritatingly smiling shopkeepers have taken your virtual currency. Even the tutorial just displays an endless screen of blank white, and creating a NeoHome, one of the boxes on my new user checklist, is staying permanently unchecked, as the website lets me pick what region of the virtual world I'd like to live in but won't let me close on the deal. To their credit, the devs had announced a long time ago that they'd been working on porting the game to mobile, but it's been that way for years and the whole thing's still in a semi-broken beta state on my phone too.</p>

<p>Despite feeling like some sort of spiritually tortuous purgatory where everything that you used to love is right in front of you and you just can't touch it, the NeoBoards forums are still packed to the Flotsam gills with a dedicated player base. And to make me feel less like an old creeper on a website designed with kids in mind, it kindly displays the number of months since each user that posts there has had an account, letting me know that, yes, there are plenty of players who have been around for 200+ months, maintaining that sweet virtual escape from their own days of youth.</p>

<p>There's still some charming stuff here. You can find a few card games that still work scattered throughout Neopia, and there's a handy games page that lists 14 other games that are currently still functioning. Just don't play for too long in one session, because most of them seem to randomly change your score to NAN or decide after a while that you don't get your NeoPoints rewards because you're a "suspicious user." I mean, I already admitted to being too old to be here, but you don't have to make me feel bad about it; this ain't Chuck E. Cheese!</p>

<p>My old favorite, the hot potato-like Gormball, is sadly unavailable, but there's still some mindless, lighthearted fun to be had with the games that are fully functional, like Hasee Bounce, in which you control two adorable little something-or-others as they catapult each other on a seesaw to catch doughnut-fruits, culminating in either a scene of them happily munching on their treasures or sobbing their pwecious widdle eyes out.</p>

<p>And of course, the core of the game — the feeding, grooming, and training of virtual pets that was a defining feature of '90s kids everywhere — is still intact. It really doesn't matter what you feed them, but there's a lot of fun to be had just stocking up on food for your little buds, from berry picking at Meridell Farms to grabbing a slice on the massive omelette on Tyranian Plateau. The arena still makes no sense to me, but reflecting on it, I don't think it made sense to teenage me either, like it was tacked on to cash in on the Pokemon hype and still hasn't been developed in the nearly two-and-a-half decades that it's been around.</p>

<p>All in all, it's been a nice little nostalgic visit to Neopia, but I don't think I'll be settling down here — and not just because my pedestrian, mainstream web browser won't let me create a NeoHome. My old account and pets are gone, lost to the ages among website maintenance and increased security measures of the past. Neopets now belongs to the diehards; the people who've stayed around through the thick and thin of things. In my hubris, I mistakenly thought I'd grown too cool for it, and it passed me by.</p>

<p>But that doesn't mean I won't be popping in every few days — my Korbat and Grundo would be starving otherwise — and if you've ever been a Neopets player, I'd encourage you to pop in and have a look around too.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>OpenSSL 1.1.1 series has reached its End of Life (EOL).
As such it will no longer receive publicly available security fixes.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>OpenSSL 1.1.1 was released on 11th September 2018 as a <a href="https://www.openssl.org/policies/general/versioning-policy.html#supported-releases">Long Term Support</a> (LTS)
release.  LTS lasts five years and consequently OpenSSL 1.1.1 has reached
its EOL as of today, 11th September 2023.</p>

<p>If your copy of OpenSSL 1.1.1 is from an Operating System vendor (e.g. via
<code>.rpm</code> or <code>.deb</code> packages) or another third party then the support periods
for them may differ to those provided by the OpenSSL Project itself.
Check with the OS vendor/other third party on what support for OpenSSL
they provide.</p>

<p>If you downloaded your copy of OpenSSL 1.1.1 direct from the OpenSSL
project then it is time to upgrade to a more recent version.  Our most
recent version is OpenSSL 3.1 which will be supported until 14th March 2025.
Also available is OpenSSL 3.0 which is an LTS release and will
be supported until 7th September 2026.  Our <a href="https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.1/man7/migration_guide.html">migration guide</a> provides
useful information on the issues to consider when upgrading.</p>

<p>Another option is to purchase a <a href="https://www.openssl.org/support/contracts.html#premium">premium support contract</a> which offers
extended support (i.e. ongoing access to security fixes) for 1.1.1 beyond
its public EOL date.  There is no defined end date for this extended
support and we intend to continue to provide it for as long as it remains
commercially viable for us to do so (i.e. for the foreseeable future).
Further information is available on our <a href="https://www.openssl.org/support/contracts.html">support contracts</a> page. Email
osf-contact@openssl.org for further information.</p>

<p dir="auto">Features marked with a <strong>*</strong> have been back-ported to youtube-dl</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Differences in default behavior</h3>
<p dir="auto">Some of yt-dlp's default options are different from that of youtube-dl and youtube-dlc:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>yt-dlp supports only <a href="##" title="Windows 7">Python 3.7+</a>, and <em>may</em> remove support for more versions as they <a href="https://devguide.python.org/versions/#python-release-cycle" rel="nofollow">become EOL</a>; while <a href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/30568#issue-1118238743" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/30568/hovercard">youtube-dl still supports Python 2.6+ and 3.2+</a></li>
<li>The options <code>--auto-number</code> (<code>-A</code>), <code>--title</code> (<code>-t</code>) and <code>--literal</code> (<code>-l</code>), no longer work. See <a href="#Removed">removed options</a> for details</li>
<li><code>avconv</code> is not supported as an alternative to <code>ffmpeg</code></li>
<li>yt-dlp stores config files in slightly different locations to youtube-dl. See <a href="#configuration">CONFIGURATION</a> for a list of correct locations</li>
<li>The default <a href="#output-template">output template</a> is <code>%(title)s [%(id)s].%(ext)s</code>. There is no real reason for this change. This was changed before yt-dlp was ever made public and now there are no plans to change it back to <code>%(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s</code>. Instead, you may use <code>--compat-options filename</code></li>
<li>The default <a href="#sorting-formats">format sorting</a> is different from youtube-dl and prefers higher resolution and better codecs rather than higher bitrates. You can use the <code>--format-sort</code> option to change this to any order you prefer, or use <code>--compat-options format-sort</code> to use youtube-dl's sorting order</li>
<li>The default format selector is <code>bv*+ba/b</code>. This means that if a combined video + audio format that is better than the best video-only format is found, the former will be preferred. Use <code>-f bv+ba/b</code> or <code>--compat-options format-spec</code> to revert this</li>
<li>Unlike youtube-dlc, yt-dlp does not allow merging multiple audio/video streams into one file by default (since this conflicts with the use of <code>-f bv*+ba</code>). If needed, this feature must be enabled using <code>--audio-multistreams</code> and <code>--video-multistreams</code>. You can also use <code>--compat-options multistreams</code> to enable both</li>
<li><code>--no-abort-on-error</code> is enabled by default. Use <code>--abort-on-error</code> or <code>--compat-options abort-on-error</code> to abort on errors instead</li>
<li>When writing metadata files such as thumbnails, description or infojson, the same information (if available) is also written for playlists. Use <code>--no-write-playlist-metafiles</code> or <code>--compat-options no-playlist-metafiles</code> to not write these files</li>
<li><code>--add-metadata</code> attaches the <code>infojson</code> to <code>mkv</code> files in addition to writing the metadata when used with <code>--write-info-json</code>. Use <code>--no-embed-info-json</code> or <code>--compat-options no-attach-info-json</code> to revert this</li>
<li>Some metadata are embedded into different fields when using <code>--add-metadata</code> as compared to youtube-dl. Most notably, <code>comment</code> field contains the <code>webpage_url</code> and <code>synopsis</code> contains the <code>description</code>. You can <a href="#modifying-metadata">use <code>--parse-metadata</code></a> to modify this to your liking or use <code>--compat-options embed-metadata</code> to revert this</li>
<li><code>playlist_index</code> behaves differently when used with options like <code>--playlist-reverse</code> and <code>--playlist-items</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/302" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/pull/302/hovercard">#302</a> for details. You can use <code>--compat-options playlist-index</code> if you want to keep the earlier behavior</li>
<li>The output of <code>-F</code> is listed in a new format. Use <code>--compat-options list-formats</code> to revert this</li>
<li>Live chats (if available) are considered as subtitles. Use <code>--sub-langs all,-live_chat</code> to download all subtitles except live chat. You can also use <code>--compat-options no-live-chat</code> to prevent any live chat/danmaku from downloading</li>
<li>YouTube channel URLs download all uploads of the channel. To download only the videos in a specific tab, pass the tab's URL. If the channel does not show the requested tab, an error will be raised. Also, <code>/live</code> URLs raise an error if there are no live videos instead of silently downloading the entire channel. You may use <code>--compat-options no-youtube-channel-redirect</code> to revert all these redirections</li>
<li>Unavailable videos are also listed for YouTube playlists. Use <code>--compat-options no-youtube-unavailable-videos</code> to remove this</li>
<li>The upload dates extracted from YouTube are in UTC <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/89e4d86171c7b7c997c77d4714542e0383bf0db0/yt_dlp/extractor/youtube.py#L3898-L3900">when available</a>. Use <code>--compat-options no-youtube-prefer-utc-upload-date</code> to prefer the non-UTC upload date.</li>
<li>If <code>ffmpeg</code> is used as the downloader, the downloading and merging of formats happen in a single step when possible. Use <code>--compat-options no-direct-merge</code> to revert this</li>
<li>Thumbnail embedding in <code>mp4</code> is done with mutagen if possible. Use <code>--compat-options embed-thumbnail-atomicparsley</code> to force the use of AtomicParsley instead</li>
<li>Some internal metadata such as filenames are removed by default from the infojson. Use <code>--no-clean-infojson</code> or <code>--compat-options no-clean-infojson</code> to revert this</li>
<li>When <code>--embed-subs</code> and <code>--write-subs</code> are used together, the subtitles are written to disk and also embedded in the media file. You can use just <code>--embed-subs</code> to embed the subs and automatically delete the separate file. See <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/630#issuecomment-893659460" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/630/hovercard">#630 (comment)</a> for more info. <code>--compat-options no-keep-subs</code> can be used to revert this</li>
<li><code>certifi</code> will be used for SSL root certificates, if installed. If you want to use system certificates (e.g. self-signed), use <code>--compat-options no-certifi</code></li>
<li>yt-dlp's sanitization of invalid characters in filenames is different/smarter than in youtube-dl. You can use <code>--compat-options filename-sanitization</code> to revert to youtube-dl's behavior</li>
<li>yt-dlp tries to parse the external downloader outputs into the standard progress output if possible (Currently implemented: <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/5931" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/5931/hovercard"><del>aria2c</del></a>). You can use <code>--compat-options no-external-downloader-progress</code> to get the downloader output as-is</li>
<li>yt-dlp versions between 2021.09.01 and 2023.01.02 applies <code>--match-filter</code> to nested playlists. This was an unintentional side-effect of <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/8f18aca8717bb0dd49054555af8d386e5eda3a88">8f18ac</a> and is fixed in <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/d7b460d0e5fc710950582baed2e3fc616ed98a80">d7b460</a>. Use <code>--compat-options playlist-match-filter</code> to revert this</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">For ease of use, a few more compat options are available:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>--compat-options all</code>: Use all compat options (Do NOT use)</li>
<li><code>--compat-options youtube-dl</code>: Same as <code>--compat-options all,-multistreams,-playlist-match-filter</code></li>
<li><code>--compat-options youtube-dlc</code>: Same as <code>--compat-options all,-no-live-chat,-no-youtube-channel-redirect,-playlist-match-filter</code></li>
<li><code>--compat-options 2021</code>: Same as <code>--compat-options 2022,no-certifi,filename-sanitization,no-youtube-prefer-utc-upload-date</code></li>
<li><code>--compat-options 2022</code>: Same as <code>--compat-options playlist-match-filter,no-external-downloader-progress</code>. Use this to enable all future compat options</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">You can install yt-dlp using <a href="#release-files">the binaries</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/yt-dlp" rel="nofollow">pip</a> or one using a third-party package manager. See <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Installation">the wiki</a> for detailed instructions</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">UPDATE</h2>
<p dir="auto">You can use <code>yt-dlp -U</code> to update if you are using the <a href="#release-files">release binaries</a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Installation#with-pip">installed with pip</a>, simply re-run the same command that was used to install the program</p>
<p dir="auto">For other third-party package managers, see <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Installation#third-party-package-managers">the wiki</a> or refer their documentation</p>
<a id="user-content-update-channels">
</a><p dir="auto">There are currently two release channels for binaries, <code>stable</code> and <code>nightly</code>.
<code>stable</code> is the default channel, and many of its changes have been tested by users of the nightly channel.
The <code>nightly</code> channel has releases built after each push to the master branch, and will have the most recent fixes and additions, but also have more risk of regressions. They are available in <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds/releases">their own repo</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">When using <code>--update</code>/<code>-U</code>, a release binary will only update to its current channel.
<code>--update-to CHANNEL</code> can be used to switch to a different channel when a newer version is available. <code>--update-to [CHANNEL@]TAG</code> can also be used to upgrade or downgrade to specific tags from a channel.</p>
<p dir="auto">You may also use <code>--update-to &lt;repository&gt;</code> (<code>&lt;owner&gt;/&lt;repository&gt;</code>) to update to a channel on a completely different repository. Be careful with what repository you are updating to though, there is no verification done for binaries from different repositories.</p>
<p dir="auto">Example usage:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>yt-dlp --update-to nightly</code> change to <code>nightly</code> channel and update to its latest release</li>
<li><code>yt-dlp --update-to stable@2023.02.17</code> upgrade/downgrade to release to <code>stable</code> channel tag <code>2023.02.17</code></li>
<li><code>yt-dlp --update-to 2023.01.06</code> upgrade/downgrade to tag <code>2023.01.06</code> if it exists on the current channel</li>
<li><code>yt-dlp --update-to example/yt-dlp@2023.03.01</code> upgrade/downgrade to the release from the <code>example/yt-dlp</code> repository, tag <code>2023.03.01</code></li>

<p dir="auto">To use or redistribute the dependencies, you must agree to their respective licensing terms.</p>
<p dir="auto">The standalone release binaries are built with the Python interpreter and the packages marked with <strong>*</strong> included.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you do not have the necessary dependencies for a task you are attempting, yt-dlp will warn you. All the currently available dependencies are visible at the top of the <code>--verbose</code> output</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">COMPILE</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Standalone PyInstaller Builds</h3>
<p dir="auto">To build the standalone executable, you must have Python and <code>pyinstaller</code> (plus any of yt-dlp's <a href="#dependencies">optional dependencies</a> if needed). Once you have all the necessary dependencies installed, simply run <code>pyinst.py</code>. The executable will be built for the same architecture (x86/ARM, 32/64 bit) as the Python used.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python3 -m pip install -U pyinstaller -r requirements.txt
python3 devscripts/make_lazy_extractors.py
python3 pyinst.py"><pre><code>python3 -m pip install -U pyinstaller -r requirements.txt
python3 devscripts/make_lazy_extractors.py
python3 pyinst.py
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">On some systems, you may need to use <code>py</code> or <code>python</code> instead of <code>python3</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>pyinst.py</code> accepts any arguments that can be passed to <code>pyinstaller</code>, such as <code>--onefile/-F</code> or <code>--onedir/-D</code>, which is further <a href="https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/usage.html#what-to-generate" rel="nofollow">documented here</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong>: Pyinstaller versions below 4.4 <a href="https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller#requirements-and-tested-platforms">do not support</a> Python installed from the Windows store without using a virtual environment.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Important</strong>: Running <code>pyinstaller</code> directly <strong>without</strong> using <code>pyinst.py</code> is <strong>not</strong> officially supported. This may or may not work correctly.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Platform-independent Binary (UNIX)</h3>
<p dir="auto">You will need the build tools <code>python</code> (3.7+), <code>zip</code>, <code>make</code> (GNU), <code>pandoc</code>* and <code>pytest</code>*.</p>
<p dir="auto">After installing these, simply run <code>make</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can also run <code>make yt-dlp</code> instead to compile only the binary without updating any of the additional files. (The build tools marked with <strong>*</strong> are not needed for this)</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Standalone Py2Exe Builds (Windows)</h3>
<p dir="auto">While we provide the option to build with <a href="https://www.py2exe.org/" rel="nofollow">py2exe</a>, it is recommended to build <a href="#standalone-pyinstaller-builds">using PyInstaller</a> instead since the py2exe builds <strong>cannot contain <code>pycryptodomex</code>/<code>certifi</code> and needs VC++14</strong> on the target computer to run.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you wish to build it anyway, install Python and py2exe, and then simply run <code>setup.py py2exe</code></p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="py -m pip install -U py2exe -r requirements.txt
py devscripts/make_lazy_extractors.py

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Related scripts</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong><code>devscripts/update-version.py</code></strong> - Update the version number based on current date.</li>
<li><strong><code>devscripts/set-variant.py</code></strong> - Set the build variant of the executable.</li>
<li><strong><code>devscripts/make_changelog.py</code></strong> - Create a markdown changelog using short commit messages and update <code>CONTRIBUTORS</code> file.</li>
<li><strong><code>devscripts/make_lazy_extractors.py</code></strong> - Create lazy extractors. Running this before building the binaries (any variant) will improve their startup performance.

--no-abort-on-error             Continue with next video on download errors;
                                e.g. to skip unavailable videos in a
                                playlist (default)

--use-extractors NAMES          Extractor names to use separated by commas.
                                You can also use regexes, &quot;all&quot;, &quot;default&quot;
                                and &quot;end&quot; (end URL matching); e.g. --ies
                                &quot;holodex.*,end,youtube&quot;. Prefix the name
                                with a &quot;-&quot; to exclude it, e.g. --ies
                                default,-generic. Use --list-extractors for
                                a list of extractor names. (Alias: --ies)
--default-search PREFIX         Use this prefix for unqualified URLs. E.g.

                                google videos for the search term &quot;python&quot;.
                                Use the value &quot;auto&quot; to let yt-dlp guess
                                (&quot;auto_warning&quot; to emit a warning when
                                guessing). &quot;error&quot; just throws an error. The
                                default value &quot;fixup_error&quot; repairs broken
                                URLs, but emits an error if this is not

--no-config-locations           Do not load any custom configuration files
                                (default). When given inside a configuration
                                file, ignore all previous --config-locations
                                defined in the current file

                                prefixed with &quot;--&quot;. Arguments are parsed
                                according to the Python string formatting
                                mini-language. E.g. --alias get-audio,-X
                                &quot;-S=aext:{0},abr -x --audio-format {0}&quot;
                                creates options &quot;--get-audio&quot; and &quot;-X&quot; that
                                takes an argument (ARG0) and expands to
                                &quot;-S=aext:ARG0,abr -x --audio-format ARG0&quot;.
                                All defined aliases are listed in the --help
                                output. Alias options can trigger more
                                aliases; so be careful to avoid defining
                                recursive options. As a safety measure, each
                                alias may be triggered a maximum of 100
                                times. This option can be used multiple times"><pre><code>-h, --help                      Print this help text and exit

-i, --ignore-errors             Ignore download and postprocessing errors.
                                The download will be considered successful
                                even if the postprocessing fails
--no-abort-on-error             Continue with next video on download errors;
                                e.g. to skip unavailable videos in a
                                playlist (default)
--abort-on-error                Abort downloading of further videos if an

--use-extractors NAMES          Extractor names to use separated by commas.
                                You can also use regexes, "all", "default"
                                and "end" (end URL matching); e.g. --ies
                                "holodex.*,end,youtube". Prefix the name
                                with a "-" to exclude it, e.g. --ies
                                default,-generic. Use --list-extractors for
                                a list of extractor names. (Alias: --ies)
--default-search PREFIX         Use this prefix for unqualified URLs. E.g.
                                "gvsearch2:python" downloads two videos from
                                google videos for the search term "python".
                                Use the value "auto" to let yt-dlp guess
                                ("auto_warning" to emit a warning when
                                guessing). "error" just throws an error. The
                                default value "fixup_error" repairs broken
                                URLs, but emits an error if this is not
                                possible instead of searching
--ignore-config                 Don't load any more configuration files
                                except those given by --config-locations.

--no-config-locations           Do not load any custom configuration files
                                (default). When given inside a configuration
                                file, ignore all previous --config-locations
                                defined in the current file
--config-locations PATH         Location of the main configuration file;
                                either the path to the config or its

--match-filters FILTER          Generic video filter. Any "OUTPUT TEMPLATE"
                                field can be compared with a number or a
                                string using the operators defined in
                                "Filtering Formats". You can also simply
                                specify a field to match if the field is
                                present, use "!field" to check if the field
                                is not present, and "&amp;" to check multiple
                                conditions. Use a "\" to escape "&amp;" or
                                quotes if needed. If used multiple times,
                                the filter matches if atleast one of the
                                conditions are met. E.g. --match-filter

                                while downloading, and reducing the chance
                                of file corruption if download is
                                interrupted. This is enabled by default for

                                from the URL. Needs ffmpeg. This option can
                                be used multiple times to download multiple
                                sections, e.g. --download-sections
                                "*10:15-inf" --download-sections "intro"
--downloader [PROTO:]NAME       Name or path of the external downloader to

                                to set different downloaders for different
                                protocols. E.g. --downloader aria2c
                                --downloader "dash,m3u8:native" will use
                                aria2c for http/ftp downloads, and the
                                native downloader for dash/m3u8 downloads

--downloader-args NAME:ARGS     Give these arguments to the external
                                downloader. Specify the downloader name and
                                the arguments separated by a colon ":". For
                                ffmpeg, arguments can be passed to different
                                positions using the same syntax as
                                --postprocessor-args. You can use this
                                option multiple times to give different
                                arguments to different downloaders (Alias:

                                This is slow due to needing a re-encode, but
                                the resulting video may have fewer artifacts
                                around the cuts

                                postprocessor is invoked. It can be one of
                                &quot;pre_process&quot; (after video extraction),
                                &quot;after_filter&quot; (after video passes filter),

                                and processing all formats of a video), or
                                &quot;playlist&quot; (at end of playlist). This option
                                can be used multiple times to add different

                                You can specify multiple rules; e.g.
                                "aac&gt;m4a/mov&gt;mp4/mkv" will remux aac to m4a,

                                to the end of the command. This option can
                                be used multiple times
--no-exec                       Remove any previously defined --exec
--convert-subs FORMAT           Convert the subtitles to another format
                                (currently supported: ass, lrc, srt, vtt)

--convert-thumbnails FORMAT     Convert the thumbnails to another format
                                (currently supported: jpg, png, webp). You
                                can specify multiple rules using similar
                                syntax as --remux-video
--split-chapters                Split video into multiple files based on
                                internal chapters. The "chapter:" prefix can
                                be used with "--paths" and "--output" to set
                                the output filename for the split files. See
                                "OUTPUT TEMPLATE" for details
--no-split-chapters             Do not split video based on chapters (default)
--remove-chapters REGEX         Remove chapters whose title matches the
                                given regular expression. The syntax is the
                                same as --download-sections. This option can
                                be used multiple times
--no-remove-chapters            Do not remove any chapters from the file
                                (default)
--force-keyframes-at-cuts       Force keyframes at cuts when
                                downloading/splitting/removing sections.
                                This is slow due to needing a re-encode, but
                                the resulting video may have fewer artifacts
                                around the cuts
--no-force-keyframes-at-cuts    Do not force keyframes around the chapters
                                when cutting/splitting (default)
--use-postprocessor NAME[:ARGS]
                                The (case sensitive) name of plugin
                                postprocessors to be enabled, and
                                (optionally) arguments to be passed to it,

                                semicolon ";" delimited list of NAME=VALUE.
                                The "when" argument determines when the
                                postprocessor is invoked. It can be one of
                                "pre_process" (after video extraction),
                                "after_filter" (after video passes filter),

                                and processing all formats of a video), or
                                "playlist" (at end of playlist). This option
                                can be used multiple times to add different

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">CONFIGURATION</h2>
<p dir="auto">You can configure yt-dlp by placing any supported command line option to a configuration file. The configuration is loaded from the following locations:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Main Configuration</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The file given by <code>--config-location</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Portable Configuration</strong>: (Recommended for portable installations)</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>If using a binary, <code>yt-dlp.conf</code> in the same directory as the binary</li>
<li>If running from source-code, <code>yt-dlp.conf</code> in the parent directory of <code>yt_dlp</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Home Configuration</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>yt-dlp.conf</code> in the home path given by <code>-P</code></li>
<li>If <code>-P</code> is not given, the current directory is searched</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>User Configuration</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/yt-dlp.conf</code></li>
<li><code>${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/yt-dlp/config</code> (recommended on Linux/macOS)</li>
<li><code>${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/yt-dlp/config.txt</code></li>
<li><code>${APPDATA}/yt-dlp.conf</code></li>

</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">E.g. with the following configuration file yt-dlp will always extract the audio, not copy the mtime, use a proxy and save all videos under <code>YouTube</code> directory in your home directory:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# Lines starting with # are comments

# Always extract audio
-x

# Do not copy the mtime

# Use this proxy
--proxy 127.0.0.1:3128

# Save all videos under YouTube directory in your home directory
-o ~/YouTube/%(title)s.%(ext)s
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong>: Options in configuration file are just the same options aka switches used in regular command line calls; thus there <strong>must be no whitespace</strong> after <code>-</code> or <code>--</code>, e.g. <code>-o</code> or <code>--proxy</code> but not <code>- o</code> or <code>-- proxy</code>. They must also be quoted when necessary as-if it were a UNIX shell.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can use <code>--ignore-config</code> if you want to disable all configuration files for a particular yt-dlp run. If <code>--ignore-config</code> is found inside any configuration file, no further configuration will be loaded. For example, having the option in the portable configuration file prevents loading of home, user, and system configurations. Additionally, (for backward compatibility) if <code>--ignore-config</code> is found inside the system configuration file, the user configuration is not loaded.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Configuration file encoding</h3>
<p dir="auto">The configuration files are decoded according to the UTF BOM if present, and in the encoding from system locale otherwise.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want your file to be decoded differently, add <code># coding: ENCODING</code> to the beginning of the file (e.g. <code># coding: shift-jis</code>). There must be no characters before that, even spaces or BOM.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Authentication with netrc</h3>
<p dir="auto">You may also want to configure automatic credentials storage for extractors that support authentication (by providing login and password with <code>--username</code> and <code>--password</code>) in order not to pass credentials as command line arguments on every yt-dlp execution and prevent tracking plain text passwords in the shell command history. You can achieve this using a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tags/.netrc/info" rel="nofollow"><code>.netrc</code> file</a> on a per-extractor basis. For that you will need to create a <code>.netrc</code> file in <code>--netrc-location</code> and restrict permissions to read/write by only you:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="touch ${HOME}/.netrc
chmod a-rwx,u+rw ${HOME}/.netrc"><pre><code>touch ${HOME}/.netrc
chmod a-rwx,u+rw ${HOME}/.netrc
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">After that you can add credentials for an extractor in the following format, where <em>extractor</em> is the name of the extractor in lowercase:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="machine <extractor> login <username> password <password>"><pre><code>machine &lt;extractor&gt; login &lt;username&gt; password &lt;password&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">E.g.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="machine youtube login myaccount@gmail.com password my_youtube_password
machine twitch login my_twitch_account_name password my_twitch_password"><pre><code>machine youtube login myaccount@gmail.com password my_youtube_password
machine twitch login my_twitch_account_name password my_twitch_password
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">To activate authentication with the <code>.netrc</code> file you should pass <code>--netrc</code> to yt-dlp or place it in the <a href="#configuration">configuration file</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The default location of the .netrc file is <code>~</code> (see below).</p>
<p dir="auto">As an alternative to using the <code>.netrc</code> file, which has the disadvantage of keeping your passwords in a plain text file, you can configure a custom shell command to provide the credentials for an extractor. This is done by providing the <code>--netrc-cmd</code> parameter, it shall output the credentials in the netrc format and return <code>0</code> on success, other values will be treated as an error. <code>{}</code> in the command will be replaced by the name of the extractor to make it possible to select the credentials for the right extractor.</p>
<p dir="auto">E.g. To use an encrypted <code>.netrc</code> file stored as <code>.authinfo.gpg</code></p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="yt-dlp --netrc-cmd 'gpg --decrypt ~/.authinfo.gpg' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc"><pre><code>yt-dlp --netrc-cmd 'gpg --decrypt ~/.authinfo.gpg' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc
</code></pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Notes about environment variables</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Environment variables are normally specified as <code>${VARIABLE}</code>/<code>$VARIABLE</code> on UNIX and <code>%VARIABLE%</code> on Windows; but is always shown as <code>${VARIABLE}</code> in this documentation</li>
<li>yt-dlp also allow using UNIX-style variables on Windows for path-like options; e.g. <code>--output</code>, <code>--config-location</code></li>
<li>If unset, <code>${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}</code> defaults to <code>~/.config</code> and <code>${XDG_CACHE_HOME}</code> to <code>~/.cache</code></li>
<li>On Windows, <code>~</code> points to <code>${HOME}</code> if present; or, <code>${USERPROFILE}</code> or <code>${HOMEDRIVE}${HOMEPATH}</code> otherwise</li>
<li>On Windows, <code>${USERPROFILE}</code> generally points to <code>C:\Users\&lt;user name&gt;</code> and <code>${APPDATA}</code> to <code>${USERPROFILE}\AppData\Roaming</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">OUTPUT TEMPLATE</h2>
<p dir="auto">The <code>-o</code> option is used to indicate a template for the output file names while <code>-P</code> option is used to specify the path each type of file should be saved to.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>tl;dr:</strong> <a href="#output-template-examples">navigate me to examples</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">The simplest usage of <code>-o</code> is not to set any template arguments when downloading a single file, like in <code>yt-dlp -o funny_video.flv "https://some/video"</code> (hard-coding file extension like this is <em>not</em> recommended and could break some post-processing).</p>
<p dir="auto">It may however also contain special sequences that will be replaced when downloading each video. The special sequences may be formatted according to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#printf-style-string-formatting" rel="nofollow">Python string formatting operations</a>, e.g. <code>%(NAME)s</code> or <code>%(NAME)05d</code>. To clarify, that is a percent symbol followed by a name in parentheses, followed by formatting operations.</p>
<p dir="auto">The field names themselves (the part inside the parenthesis) can also have some special formatting:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Object traversal</strong>: The dictionaries and lists available in metadata can be traversed by using a dot <code>.</code> separator; e.g. <code>%(tags.0)s</code>, <code>%(subtitles.en.-1.ext)s</code>. You can do Python slicing with colon <code>:</code>; E.g. <code>%(id.3:7:-1)s</code>, <code>%(formats.:.format_id)s</code>. Curly braces <code>{}</code> can be used to build dictionaries with only specific keys; e.g. <code>%(formats.:.{format_id,height})#j</code>. An empty field name <code>%()s</code> refers to the entire infodict; e.g. <code>%(.{id,title})s</code>. Note that all the fields that become available using this method are not listed below. Use <code>-j</code> to see such fields</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Addition</strong>: Addition and subtraction of numeric fields can be done using <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> respectively. E.g. <code>%(playlist_index+10)03d</code>, <code>%(n_entries+1-playlist_index)d</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Date/time Formatting</strong>: Date/time fields can be formatted according to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-format-codes" rel="nofollow">strftime formatting</a> by specifying it separated from the field name using a <code>&gt;</code>. E.g. <code>%(duration&gt;%H-%M-%S)s</code>, <code>%(upload_date&gt;%Y-%m-%d)s</code>, <code>%(epoch-3600&gt;%H-%M-%S)s</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Alternatives</strong>: Alternate fields can be specified separated with a <code>,</code>. E.g. <code>%(release_date&gt;%Y,upload_date&gt;%Y|Unknown)s</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Replacement</strong>: A replacement value can be specified using a <code>&amp;</code> separator according to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language" rel="nofollow"><code>str.format</code> mini-language</a>. If the field is <em>not</em> empty, this replacement value will be used instead of the actual field content. This is done after alternate fields are considered; thus the replacement is used if <em>any</em> of the alternative fields is <em>not</em> empty. E.g. <code>%(chapters&amp;has chapters|no chapters)s</code>, <code>%(title&amp;TITLE={:&gt;20}|NO TITLE)s</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Default</strong>: A literal default value can be specified for when the field is empty using a <code>|</code> separator. This overrides <code>--output-na-placeholder</code>. E.g. <code>%(uploader|Unknown)s</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>More Conversions</strong>: In addition to the normal format types <code>diouxXeEfFgGcrs</code>, yt-dlp additionally supports converting to <code>B</code> = <strong>B</strong>ytes, <code>j</code> = <strong>j</strong>son (flag <code>#</code> for pretty-printing, <code>+</code> for Unicode), <code>h</code> = HTML escaping, <code>l</code> = a comma separated <strong>l</strong>ist (flag <code>#</code> for <code>\n</code> newline-separated), <code>q</code> = a string <strong>q</strong>uoted for the terminal (flag <code>#</code> to split a list into different arguments), <code>D</code> = add <strong>D</strong>ecimal suffixes (e.g. 10M) (flag <code>#</code> to use 1024 as factor), and <code>S</code> = <strong>S</strong>anitize as filename (flag <code>#</code> for restricted)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Unicode normalization</strong>: The format type <code>U</code> can be used for NFC <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unicodedata.html#unicodedata.normalize" rel="nofollow">Unicode normalization</a>. The alternate form flag (<code>#</code>) changes the normalization to NFD and the conversion flag <code>+</code> can be used for NFKC/NFKD compatibility equivalence normalization. E.g. <code>%(title)+.100U</code> is NFKC</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">To summarize, the general syntax for a field is:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="%(name[.keys][addition][>strf][,alternate][&amp;replacement][|default])[flags][width][.precision][length]type"><pre><code>%(name[.keys][addition][&gt;strf][,alternate][&amp;replacement][|default])[flags][width][.precision][length]type
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, you can set different output templates for the various metadata files separately from the general output template by specifying the type of file followed by the template separated by a colon <code>:</code>. The different file types supported are <code>subtitle</code>, <code>thumbnail</code>, <code>description</code>, <code>annotation</code> (deprecated), <code>infojson</code>, <code>link</code>, <code>pl_thumbnail</code>, <code>pl_description</code>, <code>pl_infojson</code>, <code>chapter</code>, <code>pl_video</code>. E.g. <code>-o "%(title)s.%(ext)s" -o "thumbnail:%(title)s\%(title)s.%(ext)s"</code>  will put the thumbnails in a folder with the same name as the video. If any of the templates is empty, that type of file will not be written. E.g. <code>--write-thumbnail -o "thumbnail:"</code> will write thumbnails only for playlists and not for video.</p>
<a id="user-content-outtmpl-postprocess-note">
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong>: Due to post-processing (i.e. merging etc.), the actual output filename might differ. Use <code>--print after_move:filepath</code> to get the name after all post-processing is complete.</p>

<p dir="auto">Each aforementioned sequence when referenced in an output template will be replaced by the actual value corresponding to the sequence name. E.g. for <code>-o %(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s</code> and an mp4 video with title <code>yt-dlp test video</code> and id <code>BaW_jenozKc</code>, this will result in a <code>yt-dlp test video-BaW_jenozKc.mp4</code> file created in the current directory.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong>: Some of the sequences are not guaranteed to be present since they depend on the metadata obtained by a particular extractor.

<p dir="auto"><strong>Tip</strong>: Look at the <code>-j</code> output to identify which fields are available for the particular URL</p>

<p dir="auto">Output templates can also contain arbitrary hierarchical path, e.g. <code>-o "%(playlist)s/%(playlist_index)s - %(title)s.%(ext)s"</code> which will result in downloading each video in a directory corresponding to this path template. Any missing directory will be automatically created for you.</p>
<p dir="auto">To use percent literals in an output template use <code>%%</code>. To output to stdout use <code>-o -</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The current default template is <code>%(title)s [%(id)s].%(ext)s</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">In some cases, you don't want special characters such as 中, spaces, or &amp;, such as when transferring the downloaded filename to a Windows system or the filename through an 8bit-unsafe channel. In these cases, add the <code>--restrict-filenames</code> flag to get a shorter title.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">FORMAT SELECTION</h2>
<p dir="auto">By default, yt-dlp tries to download the best available quality if you <strong>don't</strong> pass any options.
This is generally equivalent to using <code>-f bestvideo*+bestaudio/best</code>. However, if multiple audiostreams is enabled (<code>--audio-multistreams</code>), the default format changes to <code>-f bestvideo+bestaudio/best</code>. Similarly, if ffmpeg is unavailable, or if you use yt-dlp to stream to <code>stdout</code> (<code>-o -</code>), the default becomes <code>-f best/bestvideo+bestaudio</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Deprecation warning</strong>: Latest versions of yt-dlp can stream multiple formats to the stdout simultaneously using ffmpeg. So, in future versions, the default for this will be set to <code>-f bv*+ba/b</code> similar to normal downloads. If you want to preserve the <code>-f b/bv+ba</code> setting, it is recommended to explicitly specify it in the configuration options.</p>
<p dir="auto">The general syntax for format selection is <code>-f FORMAT</code> (or <code>--format FORMAT</code>) where <code>FORMAT</code> is a <em>selector expression</em>, i.e. an expression that describes format or formats you would like to download.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>tl;dr:</strong> <a href="#format-selection-examples">navigate me to examples</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">The simplest case is requesting a specific format; e.g. with <code>-f 22</code> you can download the format with format code equal to 22. You can get the list of available format codes for particular video using <code>--list-formats</code> or <code>-F</code>. Note that these format codes are extractor specific.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can also use a file extension (currently <code>3gp</code>, <code>aac</code>, <code>flv</code>, <code>m4a</code>, <code>mp3</code>, <code>mp4</code>, <code>ogg</code>, <code>wav</code>, <code>webm</code> are supported) to download the best quality format of a particular file extension served as a single file, e.g. <code>-f webm</code> will download the best quality format with the <code>webm</code> extension served as a single file.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can use <code>-f -</code> to interactively provide the format selector <em>for each video</em></p>
<p dir="auto">You can also use special names to select particular edge case formats:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>all</code>: Select <strong>all formats</strong> separately</li>
<li><code>mergeall</code>: Select and <strong>merge all formats</strong> (Must be used with <code>--audio-multistreams</code>, <code>--video-multistreams</code> or both)</li>
<li><code>b*</code>, <code>best*</code>: Select the best quality format that <strong>contains either</strong> a video or an audio or both (ie; <code>vcodec!=none or acodec!=none</code>)</li>
<li><code>b</code>, <code>best</code>: Select the best quality format that <strong>contains both</strong> video and audio. Equivalent to <code>best*[vcodec!=none][acodec!=none]</code></li>

</ul>
<p dir="auto">For example, to download the worst quality video-only format you can use <code>-f worstvideo</code>. It is however recommended not to use <code>worst</code> and related options. When your format selector is <code>worst</code>, the format which is worst in all respects is selected. Most of the time, what you actually want is the video with the smallest filesize instead. So it is generally better to use <code>-S +size</code> or more rigorously, <code>-S +size,+br,+res,+fps</code> instead of <code>-f worst</code>. See <a href="#sorting-formats">Sorting Formats</a> for more details.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can select the n'th best format of a type by using <code>best&lt;type&gt;.&lt;n&gt;</code>. For example, <code>best.2</code> will select the 2nd best combined format. Similarly, <code>bv*.3</code> will select the 3rd best format that contains a video stream.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to download multiple videos, and they don't have the same formats available, you can specify the order of preference using slashes. Note that formats on the left hand side are preferred; e.g. <code>-f 22/17/18</code> will download format 22 if it's available, otherwise it will download format 17 if it's available, otherwise it will download format 18 if it's available, otherwise it will complain that no suitable formats are available for download.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to download several formats of the same video use a comma as a separator, e.g. <code>-f 22,17,18</code> will download all these three formats, of course if they are available. Or a more sophisticated example combined with the precedence feature: <code>-f 136/137/mp4/bestvideo,140/m4a/bestaudio</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can merge the video and audio of multiple formats into a single file using <code>-f &lt;format1&gt;+&lt;format2&gt;+...</code> (requires ffmpeg installed); e.g. <code>-f bestvideo+bestaudio</code> will download the best video-only format, the best audio-only format and mux them together with ffmpeg.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Deprecation warning</strong>: Since the <em>below</em> described behavior is complex and counter-intuitive, this will be removed and multistreams will be enabled by default in the future. A new operator will be instead added to limit formats to single audio/video</p>
<p dir="auto">Unless <code>--video-multistreams</code> is used, all formats with a video stream except the first one are ignored. Similarly, unless <code>--audio-multistreams</code> is used, all formats with an audio stream except the first one are ignored. E.g. <code>-f bestvideo+best+bestaudio --video-multistreams --audio-multistreams</code> will download and merge all 3 given formats. The resulting file will have 2 video streams and 2 audio streams. But <code>-f bestvideo+best+bestaudio --no-video-multistreams</code> will download and merge only <code>bestvideo</code> and <code>bestaudio</code>. <code>best</code> is ignored since another format containing a video stream (<code>bestvideo</code>) has already been selected. The order of the formats is therefore important. <code>-f best+bestaudio --no-audio-multistreams</code> will download only <code>best</code> while <code>-f bestaudio+best --no-audio-multistreams</code> will ignore <code>best</code> and download only <code>bestaudio</code>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Filtering Formats</h2>
<p dir="auto">You can also filter the video formats by putting a condition in brackets, as in <code>-f "best[height=720]"</code> (or <code>-f "[filesize&gt;10M]"</code> since filters without a selector are interpreted as <code>best</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto">The following numeric meta fields can be used with comparisons <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>=</code> (equals), <code>!=</code> (not equals):</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>filesize</code>: The number of bytes, if known in advance</li>
<li><code>filesize_approx</code>: An estimate for the number of bytes</li>
<li><code>width</code>: Width of the video, if known</li>
<li><code>height</code>: Height of the video, if known</li>
<li><code>aspect_ratio</code>: Aspect ratio of the video, if known</li>
<li><code>tbr</code>: Average bitrate of audio and video in KBit/s</li>
<li><code>abr</code>: Average audio bitrate in KBit/s</li>
<li><code>vbr</code>: Average video bitrate in KBit/s</li>
<li><code>asr</code>: Audio sampling rate in Hertz</li>
<li><code>fps</code>: Frame rate</li>
<li><code>audio_channels</code>: The number of audio channels</li>
<li><code>stretched_ratio</code>: <code>width:height</code> of the video's pixels, if not square</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Also filtering work for comparisons <code>=</code> (equals), <code>^=</code> (starts with), <code>$=</code> (ends with), <code>*=</code> (contains), <code>~=</code> (matches regex) and following string meta fields:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>url</code>: Video URL</li>
<li><code>ext</code>: File extension</li>
<li><code>acodec</code>: Name of the audio codec in use</li>
<li><code>vcodec</code>: Name of the video codec in use</li>
<li><code>container</code>: Name of the container format</li>
<li><code>protocol</code>: The protocol that will be used for the actual download, lower-case (<code>http</code>, <code>https</code>, <code>rtsp</code>, <code>rtmp</code>, <code>rtmpe</code>, <code>mms</code>, <code>f4m</code>, <code>ism</code>, <code>http_dash_segments</code>, <code>m3u8</code>, or <code>m3u8_native</code>)</li>
<li><code>language</code>: Language code</li>
<li><code>dynamic_range</code>: The dynamic range of the video</li>
<li><code>format_id</code>: A short description of the format</li>
<li><code>format</code>: A human-readable description of the format</li>
<li><code>format_note</code>: Additional info about the format</li>
<li><code>resolution</code>: Textual description of width and height</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Any string comparison may be prefixed with negation <code>!</code> in order to produce an opposite comparison, e.g. <code>!*=</code> (does not contain). The comparand of a string comparison needs to be quoted with either double or single quotes if it contains spaces or special characters other than <code>._-</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong>: None of the aforementioned meta fields are guaranteed to be present since this solely depends on the metadata obtained by particular extractor, i.e. the metadata offered by the website. Any other field made available by the extractor can also be used for filtering.</p>
<p dir="auto">Formats for which the value is not known are excluded unless you put a question mark (<code>?</code>) after the operator. You can combine format filters, so <code>-f "bv[height&lt;=?720][tbr&gt;500]"</code> selects up to 720p videos (or videos where the height is not known) with a bitrate of at least 500 KBit/s. You can also use the filters with <code>all</code> to download all formats that satisfy the filter, e.g. <code>-f "all[vcodec=none]"</code> selects all audio-only formats.</p>
<p dir="auto">Format selectors can also be grouped using parentheses; e.g. <code>-f "(mp4,webm)[height&lt;480]"</code> will download the best pre-merged mp4 and webm formats with a height lower than 480.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Sorting Formats</h2>
<p dir="auto">You can change the criteria for being considered the <code>best</code> by using <code>-S</code> (<code>--format-sort</code>). The general format for this is <code>--format-sort field1,field2...</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The available fields are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>hasvid</code>: Gives priority to formats that have a video stream</li>
<li><code>hasaud</code>: Gives priority to formats that have an audio stream</li>
<li><code>ie_pref</code>: The format preference</li>
<li><code>lang</code>: The language preference</li>
<li><code>quality</code>: The quality of the format</li>
<li><code>source</code>: The preference of the source</li>
<li><code>proto</code>: Protocol used for download (<code>https</code>/<code>ftps</code> &gt; <code>http</code>/<code>ftp</code> &gt; <code>m3u8_native</code>/<code>m3u8</code> &gt; <code>http_dash_segments</code>&gt; <code>websocket_frag</code> &gt; <code>mms</code>/<code>rtsp</code> &gt; <code>f4f</code>/<code>f4m</code>)</li>
<li><code>vcodec</code>: Video Codec (<code>av01</code> &gt; <code>vp9.2</code> &gt; <code>vp9</code> &gt; <code>h265</code> &gt; <code>h264</code> &gt; <code>vp8</code> &gt; <code>h263</code> &gt; <code>theora</code> &gt; other)</li>
<li><code>acodec</code>: Audio Codec (<code>flac</code>/<code>alac</code> &gt; <code>wav</code>/<code>aiff</code> &gt; <code>opus</code> &gt; <code>vorbis</code> &gt; <code>aac</code> &gt; <code>mp4a</code> &gt; <code>mp3</code> &gt; <code>ac4</code> &gt; <code>eac3</code> &gt; <code>ac3</code> &gt; <code>dts</code> &gt; other)</li>
<li><code>codec</code>: Equivalent to <code>vcodec,acodec</code></li>
<li><code>vext</code>: Video Extension (<code>mp4</code> &gt; <code>mov</code> &gt; <code>webm</code> &gt; <code>flv</code> &gt; other). If <code>--prefer-free-formats</code> is used, <code>webm</code> is preferred.</li>
<li><code>aext</code>: Audio Extension (<code>m4a</code> &gt; <code>aac</code> &gt; <code>mp3</code> &gt; <code>ogg</code> &gt; <code>opus</code> &gt; <code>webm</code> &gt; other). If <code>--prefer-free-formats</code> is used, the order changes to <code>ogg</code> &gt; <code>opus</code> &gt; <code>webm</code> &gt; <code>mp3</code> &gt; <code>m4a</code> &gt; <code>aac</code></li>
<li><code>ext</code>: Equivalent to <code>vext,aext</code></li>
<li><code>filesize</code>: Exact filesize, if known in advance</li>
<li><code>fs_approx</code>: Approximate filesize</li>
<li><code>size</code>: Exact filesize if available, otherwise approximate filesize</li>
<li><code>height</code>: Height of video</li>
<li><code>width</code>: Width of video</li>
<li><code>res</code>: Video resolution, calculated as the smallest dimension.</li>
<li><code>fps</code>: Framerate of video</li>
<li><code>hdr</code>: The dynamic range of the video (<code>DV</code> &gt; <code>HDR12</code> &gt; <code>HDR10+</code> &gt; <code>HDR10</code> &gt; <code>HLG</code> &gt; <code>SDR</code>)</li>
<li><code>channels</code>: The number of audio channels</li>
<li><code>tbr</code>: Total average bitrate in KBit/s</li>
<li><code>vbr</code>: Average video bitrate in KBit/s</li>
<li><code>abr</code>: Average audio bitrate in KBit/s</li>
<li><code>br</code>: Average bitrate in KBit/s, <code>tbr</code>/<code>vbr</code>/<code>abr</code></li>
<li><code>asr</code>: Audio sample rate in Hz</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Deprecation warning</strong>: Many of these fields have (currently undocumented) aliases, that may be removed in a future version. It is recommended to use only the documented field names.</p>
<p dir="auto">All fields, unless specified otherwise, are sorted in descending order. To reverse this, prefix the field with a <code>+</code>. E.g. <code>+res</code> prefers format with the smallest resolution. Additionally, you can suffix a preferred value for the fields, separated by a <code>:</code>. E.g. <code>res:720</code> prefers larger videos, but no larger than 720p and the smallest video if there are no videos less than 720p. For <code>codec</code> and <code>ext</code>, you can provide two preferred values, the first for video and the second for audio. E.g. <code>+codec:avc:m4a</code> (equivalent to <code>+vcodec:avc,+acodec:m4a</code>) sets the video codec preference to <code>h264</code> &gt; <code>h265</code> &gt; <code>vp9</code> &gt; <code>vp9.2</code> &gt; <code>av01</code> &gt; <code>vp8</code> &gt; <code>h263</code> &gt; <code>theora</code> and audio codec preference to <code>mp4a</code> &gt; <code>aac</code> &gt; <code>vorbis</code> &gt; <code>opus</code> &gt; <code>mp3</code> &gt; <code>ac3</code> &gt; <code>dts</code>. You can also make the sorting prefer the nearest values to the provided by using <code>~</code> as the delimiter. E.g. <code>filesize~1G</code> prefers the format with filesize closest to 1 GiB.</p>
<p dir="auto">The fields <code>hasvid</code> and <code>ie_pref</code> are always given highest priority in sorting, irrespective of the user-defined order. This behaviour can be changed by using <code>--format-sort-force</code>. Apart from these, the default order used is: <code>lang,quality,res,fps,hdr:12,vcodec:vp9.2,channels,acodec,size,br,asr,proto,ext,hasaud,source,id</code>. The extractors may override this default order, but they cannot override the user-provided order.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that the default has <code>vcodec:vp9.2</code>; i.e. <code>av1</code> is not preferred. Similarly, the default for hdr is <code>hdr:12</code>; i.e. dolby vision is not preferred. These choices are made since DV and AV1 formats are not yet fully compatible with most devices. This may be changed in the future as more devices become capable of smoothly playing back these formats.</p>
<p dir="auto">If your format selector is <code>worst</code>, the last item is selected after sorting. This means it will select the format that is worst in all respects. Most of the time, what you actually want is the video with the smallest filesize instead. So it is generally better to use <code>-f best -S +size,+br,+res,+fps</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Tip</strong>: You can use the <code>-v -F</code> to see how the formats have been sorted (worst to best).</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">MODIFYING METADATA</h2>
<p dir="auto">The metadata obtained by the extractors can be modified by using <code>--parse-metadata</code> and <code>--replace-in-metadata</code></p>
<p dir="auto"><code>--replace-in-metadata FIELDS REGEX REPLACE</code> is used to replace text in any metadata field using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax" rel="nofollow">python regular expression</a>. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html?highlight=backreferences#re.sub" rel="nofollow">Backreferences</a> can be used in the replace string for advanced use.</p>
<p dir="auto">The general syntax of <code>--parse-metadata FROM:TO</code> is to give the name of a field or an <a href="#output-template">output template</a> to extract data from, and the format to interpret it as, separated by a colon <code>:</code>. Either a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax" rel="nofollow">python regular expression</a> with named capture groups, a single field name, or a similar syntax to the <a href="#output-template">output template</a> (only <code>%(field)s</code> formatting is supported) can be used for <code>TO</code>. The option can be used multiple times to parse and modify various fields.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that these options preserve their relative order, allowing replacements to be made in parsed fields and viceversa. Also, any field thus created can be used in the <a href="#output-template">output template</a> and will also affect the media file's metadata added when using <code>--embed-metadata</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">This option also has a few special uses:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">You can download an additional URL based on the metadata of the currently downloaded video. To do this, set the field <code>additional_urls</code> to the URL that you want to download. E.g. <code>--parse-metadata "description:(?P&lt;additional_urls&gt;https?://www\.vimeo\.com/\d+)"</code> will download the first vimeo video found in the description</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">You can use this to change the metadata that is embedded in the media file. To do this, set the value of the corresponding field with a <code>meta_</code> prefix. For example, any value you set to <code>meta_description</code> field will be added to the <code>description</code> field in the file - you can use this to set a different "description" and "synopsis". To modify the metadata of individual streams, use the <code>meta&lt;n&gt;_</code> prefix (e.g. <code>meta1_language</code>). Any value set to the <code>meta_</code> field will overwrite all default values.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong>: Metadata modification happens before format selection, post-extraction and other post-processing operations. Some fields may be added or changed during these steps, overriding your changes.</p>
<p dir="auto">For reference, these are the fields yt-dlp adds by default to the file metadata:</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">EXTRACTOR ARGUMENTS</h2>
<p dir="auto">Some extractors accept additional arguments which can be passed using <code>--extractor-args KEY:ARGS</code>. <code>ARGS</code> is a <code>;</code> (semicolon) separated string of <code>ARG=VAL1,VAL2</code>. E.g. <code>--extractor-args "youtube:player-client=android_embedded,web;include_live_dash" --extractor-args "funimation:version=uncut"</code></p>
<p dir="auto">Note: In CLI, <code>ARG</code> can use <code>-</code> instead of <code>_</code>; e.g. <code>youtube:player-client"</code> becomes <code>youtube:player_client"</code></p>
<p dir="auto">The following extractors use this feature:</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">youtube</h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>lang</code>: Prefer translated metadata (<code>title</code>, <code>description</code> etc) of this language code (case-sensitive). By default, the video primary language metadata is preferred, with a fallback to <code>en</code> translated. See <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/c26f9b991a0681fd3ea548d535919cec1fbbd430/yt_dlp/extractor/youtube.py#L381-L390">youtube.py</a> for list of supported content language codes</li>
<li><code>skip</code>: One or more of <code>hls</code>, <code>dash</code> or <code>translated_subs</code> to skip extraction of the m3u8 manifests, dash manifests and <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/4090#issuecomment-1158102032" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/4090/hovercard">auto-translated subtitles</a> respectively</li>
<li><code>player_client</code>: Clients to extract video data from. The main clients are <code>web</code>, <code>android</code> and <code>ios</code> with variants <code>_music</code>, <code>_embedded</code>, <code>_embedscreen</code>, <code>_creator</code> (e.g. <code>web_embedded</code>); and <code>mweb</code> and <code>tv_embedded</code> (agegate bypass) with no variants. By default, <code>ios,android,web</code> is used, but <code>tv_embedded</code> and <code>creator</code> variants are added as required for age-gated videos. Similarly, the music variants are added for <code>music.youtube.com</code> urls. You can use <code>all</code> to use all the clients, and <code>default</code> for the default clients.</li>
<li><code>player_skip</code>: Skip some network requests that are generally needed for robust extraction. One or more of <code>configs</code> (skip client configs), <code>webpage</code> (skip initial webpage), <code>js</code> (skip js player). While these options can help reduce the number of requests needed or avoid some rate-limiting, they could cause some issues. See <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/pull/860" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/pull/860/hovercard">#860</a> for more details</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><code>formats</code>: Change the types of formats to return. <code>dashy</code> (convert HTTP to DASH), <code>duplicate</code> (identical content but different URLs or protocol; includes <code>dashy</code>), <code>incomplete</code> (cannot be downloaded completely - live dash and post-live m3u8)</li>
<li><code>innertube_host</code>: Innertube API host to use for all API requests; e.g. <code>studio.youtube.com</code>, <code>youtubei.googleapis.com</code>. Note that cookies exported from one subdomain will not work on others</li>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">PLUGINS</h2>
<p dir="auto">Note that <strong>all</strong> plugins are imported even if not invoked, and that <strong>there are no checks</strong> performed on plugin code. <strong>Use plugins at your own risk and only if you trust the code!</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Plugins can be of <code>&lt;type&gt;</code>s <code>extractor</code> or <code>postprocessor</code>.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Extractor plugins do not need to be enabled from the CLI and are automatically invoked when the input URL is suitable for it.</li>
<li>Extractor plugins take priority over builtin extractors.</li>
<li>Postprocessor plugins can be invoked using <code>--use-postprocessor NAME</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Plugins are loaded from the namespace packages <code>yt_dlp_plugins.extractor</code> and <code>yt_dlp_plugins.postprocessor</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">In other words, the file structure on the disk looks something like:</p>

<p dir="auto">See the <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Plugins">wiki for some known plugins</a></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installing Plugins</h2>
<p dir="auto">Plugins can be installed using various methods and locations.</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Configuration directories</strong>:
Plugin packages (containing a <code>yt_dlp_plugins</code> namespace folder) can be dropped into the following standard <a href="#configuration">configuration locations</a>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>User Plugins</strong>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/yt-dlp/plugins/&lt;package name&gt;/yt_dlp_plugins/</code> (recommended on Linux/macOS)</li>
<li><code>${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/yt-dlp-plugins/&lt;package name&gt;/yt_dlp_plugins/</code></li>
<li><code>${APPDATA}/yt-dlp/plugins/&lt;package name&gt;/yt_dlp_plugins/</code> (recommended on Windows)</li>
<li><code>${APPDATA}/yt-dlp-plugins/&lt;package name&gt;/yt_dlp_plugins/</code></li>
<li><code>~/.yt-dlp/plugins/&lt;package name&gt;/yt_dlp_plugins/</code></li>
<li><code>~/yt-dlp-plugins/&lt;package name&gt;/yt_dlp_plugins/</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>System Plugins</strong>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>/etc/yt-dlp/plugins/&lt;package name&gt;/yt_dlp_plugins/</code></li>
<li><code>/etc/yt-dlp-plugins/&lt;package name&gt;/yt_dlp_plugins/</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Executable location</strong>: Plugin packages can similarly be installed in a <code>yt-dlp-plugins</code> directory under the executable location (recommended for portable installations):</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Binary: where <code>&lt;root-dir&gt;/yt-dlp.exe</code>, <code>&lt;root-dir&gt;/yt-dlp-plugins/&lt;package name&gt;/yt_dlp_plugins/</code></li>
<li>Source: where <code>&lt;root-dir&gt;/yt_dlp/__main__.py</code>, <code>&lt;root-dir&gt;/yt-dlp-plugins/&lt;package name&gt;/yt_dlp_plugins/</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>pip and other locations in <code>PYTHONPATH</code></strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Plugin packages can be installed and managed using <code>pip</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-sample-plugins">yt-dlp-sample-plugins</a> for an example.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Note: plugin files between plugin packages installed with pip must have unique filenames.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Any path in <code>PYTHONPATH</code> is searched in for the <code>yt_dlp_plugins</code> namespace folder.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Note: This does not apply for Pyinstaller/py2exe builds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><code>.zip</code>, <code>.egg</code> and <code>.whl</code> archives containing a <code>yt_dlp_plugins</code> namespace folder in their root are also supported as plugin packages.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>e.g. <code>${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/yt-dlp/plugins/mypluginpkg.zip</code> where <code>mypluginpkg.zip</code> contains <code>yt_dlp_plugins/&lt;type&gt;/myplugin.py</code></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Run yt-dlp with <code>--verbose</code> to check if the plugin has been loaded.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Developing Plugins</h2>
<p dir="auto">See the <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-sample-plugins">yt-dlp-sample-plugins</a> repo for a template plugin package and the <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Plugin-Development">Plugin Development</a> section of the wiki for a plugin development guide.</p>
<p dir="auto">All public classes with a name ending in <code>IE</code>/<code>PP</code> are imported from each file for extractors and postprocessors repectively. This respects underscore prefix (e.g. <code>_MyBasePluginIE</code> is private) and <code>__all__</code>. Modules can similarly be excluded by prefixing the module name with an underscore (e.g. <code>_myplugin.py</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto">To replace an existing extractor with a subclass of one, set the <code>plugin_name</code> class keyword argument (e.g. <code>class MyPluginIE(ABuiltInIE, plugin_name='myplugin')</code> will replace <code>ABuiltInIE</code> with <code>MyPluginIE</code>). Since the extractor replaces the parent, you should exclude the subclass extractor from being imported separately by making it private using one of the methods described above.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you are a plugin author, add <a href="https://github.com/topics/yt-dlp-plugins">yt-dlp-plugins</a> as a topic to your repository for discoverability.</p>
<p dir="auto">See the <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#developer-instructions">Developer Instructions</a> on how to write and test an extractor.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">EMBEDDING YT-DLP</h2>
<p dir="auto">yt-dlp makes the best effort to be a good command-line program, and thus should be callable from any programming language.</p>
<p dir="auto">Your program should avoid parsing the normal stdout since they may change in future versions. Instead they should use options such as <code>-J</code>, <code>--print</code>, <code>--progress-template</code>, <code>--exec</code> etc to create console output that you can reliably reproduce and parse.</p>
<p dir="auto">From a Python program, you can embed yt-dlp in a more powerful fashion, like this:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="from yt_dlp import YoutubeDL

URLS = ['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc']
with YoutubeDL() as ydl:
    ydl.download(URLS)"><pre><span>from</span> <span>yt_dlp</span> <span>import</span> <span>YoutubeDL</span>

<span>URLS</span> <span>=</span> [<span>'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc'</span>]
<span>with</span> <span>YoutubeDL</span>() <span>as</span> <span>ydl</span>:

<p dir="auto">Most likely, you'll want to use various options. For a list of options available, have a look at <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/yt_dlp/YoutubeDL.py#L183"><code>yt_dlp/YoutubeDL.py</code></a> or <code>help(yt_dlp.YoutubeDL)</code> in a Python shell. If you are already familiar with the CLI, you can use <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/devscripts/cli_to_api.py"><code>devscripts/cli_to_api.py</code></a> to translate any CLI switches to <code>YoutubeDL</code> params.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Tip</strong>: If you are porting your code from youtube-dl to yt-dlp, one important point to look out for is that we do not guarantee the return value of <code>YoutubeDL.extract_info</code> to be json serializable, or even be a dictionary. It will be dictionary-like, but if you want to ensure it is a serializable dictionary, pass it through <code>YoutubeDL.sanitize_info</code> as shown in the <a href="#extracting-information">example below</a></p>

    </ul>
    

    <h2 id="simple"><center>Prolog is a very simple language</center></h2>

    It is easy to describe Prolog <b>syntax</b> in sufficient detail
    to start working with Prolog immediately.

    <p>

    All <a href="https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/data">data</a> are represented by
    Prolog&nbsp;<a href="https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/data#term"><b>terms</b></a>.

    </p><p>

    There is a single language element, called
    a <a href="https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/concepts#clause"><i>clause</i></a>. A clause is of the
    form:
    </p><p><b><tt>Head :- Body.</tt></b>
    </p>

    <br>

    This means that <b>if</b> <tt>Body</tt>
    holds, <b>then</b> <tt>Head</tt> holds. The infix
    operator <tt>(:-)/2</tt> represents an arrow from right to
    left:&nbsp;←.

    <p>

    If </p><tt>Head</tt> <i>always</i>
    holds, then <tt>:-&nbsp;Body</tt> can be&nbsp;<i>omitted</i>.

    <p>

    <i>The above is enough to write useful first Prolog programs.</i></p><p>

    <b>You may not believe this</b>, so witness the evidence: All
    programs presented in the following consist <i>only</i> of such
    clauses.

    </p><p>

    In fact, <i>all known computations</i> can be described in terms
    of such&nbsp;clauses, making Prolog
    a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">Turing&nbsp;complete</a>
    programming&nbsp;language. One way to implement a
    Turing&nbsp;machine in Prolog is to describe the <i>relation</i>
    between different&nbsp;states of the machine with clauses of the
    form "<i>If</i> the current state is&nbsp;</p><tt>S0</tt> <i>and</i>
    the symbol under the tape&nbsp;head is&nbsp;<tt>T</tt>, <i>and</i>
    ... <i>then</i> the next state is&nbsp;<tt>S</tt>".
    See <a href="https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/showcases/turing.pl"><tt>turing.pl</tt></a> for one
    implementation, and <a href="https://www.metalevel.at/tist/"><i>Thinking
    in&nbsp;States</i></a> for more information.

    <h2 id="declarative"><center>Prolog is a declarative language</center></h2>

    Prolog is a <i>declarative language</i>. This means that we focus
    on stating <i>what</i> we are interested in. We <a href="https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/writing">express
      what <i>holds</i></a> about solutions we want to find. We are less
    concerned about <i>how</i> the Prolog implementation finds these
    solutions.

    <p>

    This declarative nature often allows for very concise, clear and
    general specifications. It is unlikely that shorter formalisms
    that are equally clear and expressive exist.

    </p><p>

    For example, let us describe the <i>relation</i> between
    a <a href="https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/data#list">list</a> and its length,
    using <a href="https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/clpz">integer&nbsp;arithmetic</a>:

    </p><p><b>Note</b>: In <i>some</i> Prolog systems, you currently need to
      include a dedicated library to use declarative integer
      arithmetic. <a href="https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/clpz">More...</a>
    </p>

    <pre>list_length([], 0).
list_length([_|Ls], N) :-
        N #&gt; 0,
        N #= N0 + 1,
        list_length(Ls, N0).
    </pre>

    We can <a href="https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/reading#declarative"><b>read this declaratively</b></a> as follows:

    <ol>
      <li>The length of the <i>empty list</i>&nbsp;<tt>[]</tt> is &nbsp;0.</li>
      <li><b>If</b> the length of the list&nbsp;<tt>Ls</tt>
        is&nbsp;<tt>N0</tt> <b>and</b> <tt>N</tt>
        is <tt>N0+1</tt>, <b>then</b> the length
        of&nbsp;<tt>[_|Ls]</tt> is&nbsp;<tt>N</tt>. Further, this only
        holds <b>if</b> <tt>N</tt> is <i>greater than</i>&nbsp;0.
    </li></ol>

    When programming in Prolog, think in terms of <i>relations</i>
    between entities. Your programs will become very general with this
    approach. In the above example, it is tempting to think and say
    "We are computing the length of a list". And yes, it is true: We
    can indeed use the above definition to compute the length of
    a&nbsp;list:

    <pre>?- list_length([a,b,c], L).
   L = 3.
    </pre>

    However, this <i>imperative</i> reading does not do justice to
    what we have actually implemented, because the definition also
    covers several additional usage&nbsp;patterns. For
    example, <i>given</i> a specific length, we can ask <i>whether</i>
    there are lists of that length:

    <pre>?- list_length(Ls, 3).
   Ls = [_A,_B,_C]
;  false.
    </pre>

    Using the <b>most general query</b>, we can even ask for all
    answers that Prolog finds <i>in&nbsp;general</i>:

    <pre>?- list_length(Ls, L).
   Ls = [], L = 0
;  Ls = [_A], L = 1
;  Ls = [_A,_B], L = 2
;  Ls = [_A,_B,_C], L = 3
;  ... .
    </pre>

    We say that the relation is usable in different <i>modes</i>.
    Characteristically, Prolog reports all answers
    via&nbsp;<i>backtracking</i>.

    <p>

    The predicate </p><tt>length/2</tt> is part of
    the <a href="https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/ulrich/iso-prolog/prologue">Prologue
    for Prolog</a> draft, and already available as
    a <a href="https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/concepts#builtin">built-in</a> predicate in almost all
    Prolog implementations with the above semantics.

    <h2 id="logic"><center>Prolog is a logic programming language</center></h2>

    In the category of <i>declarative</i> languages, we
    find <i>functional</i> programming languages and <i>logic</i>
    programming languages. A function is a special case of a relation,
    and functional programming can be regarded as a restricted form of
    logic&nbsp;programming.

    <p>

    Prolog is firmly rooted in <a href="https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/logic"><b>logic</b></a>. </p><p>

    A <a href="https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/purity">pure</a> Prolog program consists of a set
    of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_clause">Horn&nbsp;clauses</a>.

    Its execution can be regarded as a special case
    of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_(logic)"><i>resolution</i></a>.

    </p><p>

    This connection to formal logic allows us to apply powerful
    <a href="https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/debugging"><b>declarative&nbsp;debugging</b></a> techniques that
    are based on logical properties of the program.  For example,
    adding a <i>constraint</i> can at most <i>reduce</i> the set of
    solutions, and adding a&nbsp;<i>clause</i> can at most extend
    it. This property of pure Prolog programs is
    called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonicity_of_entailment">monotonicity</a>.

    </p><p>

    <i>See
      the <a href="https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/ulrich/gupu/"><b>GUPU
      system</b></a> by Ulrich Neumerkel for an impressive application
      of these&nbsp;ideas.</i></p><h2 id="homoiconic"><center>Prolog is a homoiconic language</center></h2>

    <p><i>homoiconic</i>: from ὁμός = "same" and εικών = "image"
    </p>
    <p>

    Prolog <i>programs</i> are also valid Prolog <i>terms</i>! This
    has many great advantages: It is easy to write Prolog programs
    that analyze, transform and interpret <i>other</i> Prolog
    programs. You can use the built-in predicate </p><tt>read/1</tt> to
    read a Prolog&nbsp;term, and thus also a Prolog&nbsp;clause.

    <p>

    There is a powerful <a href="https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/macros">mechanism</a> to rewrite
    Prolog programs at compilation time, so that you can easily
    implement domain-specific languages that help you solve your tasks
    more naturally.

    </p><p>
    <b>You may not believe this</b>, because some goals—such
    as </p><tt>list_length(Ls,&nbsp;N)</tt>—look like
    Prolog&nbsp;terms as defined above, whereas other goals—such
    as&nbsp;<tt>N&nbsp;#&gt;&nbsp;0</tt>—look quite different.
    The reason for this is that Prolog provides prefix, infix and
    postfix&nbsp;<i>operators</i> that let you write Prolog&nbsp;terms
    in a more readable way. For example, the Prolog
    term&nbsp;<tt>+(a,b)</tt> can also be written using
    operator&nbsp;notation as&nbsp;<tt>a+b</tt>.
    The <i>abstract&nbsp;syntax</i> remains completely uniform, and
    you can read and process all Prolog terms independent of how they
    are written&nbsp;down.

    <p>
    <i>You can dynamically define custom operators for specific use cases.</i></p><h2 id="dynamic"><center>Prolog is a very dynamic language</center></h2>

    Prolog programs can be easily created, called and modified <i>at
    run time</i>. This further increases the expressiveness of Prolog
    and lets you implement <a href="https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/metapredicates">higher-order
    predicates</a> which have other predicates as arguments. It also
    allows the implementation of very dynamic techniques
    like <i>adaptive&nbsp;parsing</i>.

    <p>

    The dynamic nature of Prolog also makes the language ideally
    suited for writing programs that are <i>extensible</i> by
    custom&nbsp;rules that other programmers and even regular users
    provide. <a href="https://www.metalevel.at/proloxy/"><b>Proloxy</b></a>
    and <a href="https://www.gerritcodereview.com/">Gerrit
    Code&nbsp;Review</a> are examples of this approach: You configure
    these programs by supplying
    Prolog&nbsp;<a href="https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/concepts#rule">rules</a> that express your
    requirements in a very readable and flexible&nbsp;way.

    </p><p>
    See <a href="https://www.metalevel.at/acomip/"><b>A Couple of
        Meta-interpreters in&nbsp;Prolog</b></a> for more information.

    </p><p>

    <i>You can define an interpreter for pure Prolog in two lines of
      Prolog&nbsp;code.</i></p><h2 id="versatile"><center>Prolog is a very versatile language</center></h2>

    Prolog is an extremely versatile language. Its relational nature
    makes Prolog programs very flexible and general. This plays an
    important role in <a href="https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/dcg">language processing</a> and
    knowledge representation
    in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/business#database">databases</a>. Modern Prolog
    systems provide everything that is needed for solving
    simple <a href="https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/puzzles">logic&nbsp;puzzles</a> to building huge
    applications, ranging from
    <a href="https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/web">web&nbsp;hosting</a>
    to <a href="https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/theoremproving">verification</a>
    and <a href="https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/optimization">optimization</a> tasks.

    <p>

    Prolog's versatility and power are rooted in <i>implicit</i>
    mechanisms that include search, unification, argument indexing and
    constraint propagation. You can use these mechanisms to your
    advantage, and <i>delegate</i> many tasks to the
    Prolog&nbsp;engine.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Microsoft has made it clear: it will ax third-party printer drivers in Windows.</p>
<p>The death rattle will be lengthy, as the timeline for the end of servicing stretches into 2027 – although Microsoft noted that the dates will be subject to change. There is, after all, always that important customer with a strange old printer lacking Mopria support.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://mopria.org/mopria-alliance">Mopria</a> is part of the Windows' teams justification for removing support. Founded in 2013 by Canon, HP, Samsung and Xerox, the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://mopria.org/">Mopria Alliance</a>'s mission is to provide universal standards for printing and scanning. Epson, Lexmark, Adobe and Microsoft have also joined the gang since then.</p>

    

<p>Since Windows 10 21H2, Microsoft has baked Mopria support into the flagship operating system, with support for devices connected via the network or USB, thanks to the Microsoft IPP Class driver. Microsoft said: "This removes the need for print device manufacturers to provide their own installers, drivers, utilities, and so on."</p>

        


        

<p>The software giant also said that customization can be performed via Print Support Apps from the Windows Store. It added: "This framework improves reliability and performance by moving customization from the Win32 framework to the UWP software development framework."</p>
<p>While some wags have dubbed the framework the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/26/microsofts_uwp_unwanted_windows_platform/">"Unwanted Windows Platform"</a>, it's always good to see legacy tech being retired in favor of something with a bright future ahead of it.</p>

        

<p>Microsoft's timeline for the end of servicing will be staged. The next milestone will occur in 2025 when no new printer drivers will be published to Windows Update – although existing drivers can still be updated. In 2026, driver ranking will be tweaked to bring the IPP inbox class driver to the top, and by 2027 – except for security-related fixes – no printer driver updates will be allowed.</p>

</ul>
<p>To be clear, the end of servicing applies to drivers provided via Windows Update. Manufacturers will, according to Microsoft, "need to provide customers with an alternative means to download and install those printer drivers." Legacy v3 and v4 Windows printer drivers are facing the end of servicing ax.</p>
<p>Microsoft added that multi-function devices – print, scan and fax – will work via the inbox drivers.</p>
<p>Printing and Windows have <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/07/26/windows_10_printer_bork/">long been uneasy bedfellows</a>. While Microsoft hopes the end-of-servicing will take away some legacy driver headaches, there are plenty of other components within the Windows printing subsystem that can <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/18/windows_printing/">occasionally topple</a> when poked the wrong way by a patch. ®</p>

                <p>The purpose of this course is to provide a hands on introduction to Intel hardware support for virtualization. The first part will motivate the challenges of virtualization in the absence of dedicated hardware. This is followed by a deep dive on the Intel virtualization "API" and labs to begin implementing a blue pill / hyperjacking attack made famous by researchers like Joanna Rutkowska and Dino Dai Zovi et al. Finally a discussion of virtualization detection techniques. <br></p>
                
                <p>Hopefully after this course the student will be able to identify, understand, and implement various hypervisor concepts. As virtualization is a powerful tool, it is very important to understand its strengths and weaknesses. The author believes that hands-on experience with virtualization is practical and accessible, particularly when presented alongside other Open Security Training materials.<br></p>

          <p>Research Highlights:</p>

<ul>
	<li>An analysis of data from a long-running study of more than 11,000 adults from four diverse communities in the United States has found that adults who had high blood pressure while both seated upright and lying supine (flat on their backs) had a higher risk of heart disease, stroke, heart failure or premature death compared to adults without high blood pressure while upright and supine.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Adults who had high blood pressure while lying supine but not while seated upright had similar elevated risks of heart attack, stroke, heart failure or premature death as adults who had high blood pressure in both supine and upright positions.</li>
	<li>The increased risk of heart disease, stroke, heart failure or premature death did not differ by the type of blood pressure medication used among participants.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Embargoed until 6:30a.m. CT/7:30 a.m. ET Thursday, Sept. 7, 2023</strong></p>

<p>BOSTON, Sept. 7, 2023 — People who had high blood pressure while lying flat on their backs had a higher risk of heart attack, stroke, heart failure or premature death, according to new research to be presented at the American Heart Association’s <a href="https://professional.heart.org/en/meetings/hypertension" rel="" target="_blank" title="">Hypertension Scientific Sessions 2023</a>, to be held Sept. 7-10, 2023, in Boston. The meeting is the premier scientific exchange focused on recent advances in basic and clinical research on high blood pressure and its relationship to cardiac and kidney disease, stroke, obesity and genetics.</p>

<p>The autonomic nervous system regulates blood pressure in different body positions; however, gravity may cause blood to pool when seated or upright, and the body is sometimes unable to properly regulate blood pressure during lying, seated and standing positions, the authors noted.</p>

<p>“If blood pressure is only measured while people are seated upright, cardiovascular disease risk may be missed if not measured also while they are lying supine on their backs,” said lead study author Duc M. Giao, a researcher and a 4<sup>th</sup>-year M.D. student at Harvard Medical School in Boston.</p>

<p>To examine body position, blood pressure and heart health risk, the researchers examined health data for 11,369 adults from the longitudinal Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. The data on supine and seated blood pressure was gathered during the enrollment period, ARIC visit 1, which took place between 1987–1989. Participants had their blood pressure taken while briefly lying down at a clinic. The average age of participants at that time was 54 years old; 56% of the group self-identified as female; and 25% of participants self-identified as Black race. Participants in this analysis were followed for an average of 25 to 28 years, up through ARIC visit 5, which includes health data collected from 2011-2013.</p>

<p>The researcher’s findings included:</p>

<ul>
	<li>16% percent of participants who did not have high blood pressure — defined in this study as having top and bottom blood pressure measures greater than or equal to 130/80 mm Hg — while seated had high blood pressure while lying supine (flat on their backs), compared to 74% of those with seated high blood pressure who also had supine high blood pressure.</li>
	<li>In comparison to participants who did not have high blood pressure while seated and supine, participants who had high blood pressure while seated and supine had a 1.6 times higher risk of developing coronary heart disease; a 1.83 times higher risk of developing heart failure; a 1.86 times higher risk of stroke; a 1.43 times higher risk of overall premature death; and a 2.18 times higher risk of dying from coronary heart disease</li>
	<li>Participants who had high blood pressure while supine but not while seated had similar elevated risks as participants who had high blood pressure while both seated and supine.</li>
	<li>Differences in blood pressure medication use did not affect these elevated risks in either group.</li>
</ul>

<p>“Our findings suggest people with known risk factors for heart disease and stroke may benefit from having their blood pressure checked while lying flat on their backs,” Giao said.</p>

<p>“Efforts to manage blood pressure during daily life may help lower blood pressure while sleeping. Future research should compare supine blood pressure measurements in the clinic with overnight measurements.”</p>

<p>The study’s limitations included that it focused on adults who were middle-aged at the time of enrollment, meaning the results might not be as generalizable to older populations, Giao said.</p>

<p><strong>Note: Giao presents <em>Seated And Supine Blood Pressure And Risk Of Cardiovascular Disease And Mortality From The Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities Study </em>at 2:15 p.m. ET on Saturday, Sept. 9, 2023, Presentation #071; Abstract #452</strong></p>

<p>Background:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study is an ongoing, community-based cohort of 15,792 adults in the United States enrolled from 1987-1989 to investigate the causes for atherosclerotic disease (plaque or fatty buildup in the arteries). ARIC study participants were ages 45–65 years at the start of the study and from rural areas in the U.S. (Forsyth County, North Carolina, and Washington County, Maryland) and urban areas: Minneapolis and Jackson, Mississippi. The research and data from the ARIC clinical visits — including hospital record abstraction, ECG tracings, and physician and coroner questionnaires, as well as death certificate data — have led to discoveries and guidelines surrounding atherosclerosis, heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes, stroke and cognitive decline.</li>
	<li>The <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000065" target="_blank">2017 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults</a> classifies hypertension as having top and bottom numbers greater than or equal to 130/80 mm Hg, which was the definition of hypertension used in this study.</li>

This was an incompatible language confusingly <i>also</i> called Visual Basic. I don't think Microsoft realized how angry this made developers and businesses, who were being asked to spend hundreds of billions of dollars (USD) to rewrite code just to keep the same functionality. Before that time, many thought that Visual Basic's wide use gave it a kind of "herd immunity". I don't have numbers with me, but I remember that years later that a study found that some were sticking to the original Visual Basic (even though it was no longer supported), a few had moved to Visual .NET, and many other had abandoned Visual Basic entirely (some to C#, others beyond). In short, the Visual Basic community was split into multiple communities, and anyone using Visual Basic would have to worry about either lack of support or yet another harmful change.</p><p>* The rise of the web and of platforms other than Windows (including Android, iOS, MacOS, Linux). Visual Basic is fine when you send files via sneakernet to another Windows user. Now people want to access through their web browser, smartphone, etc. If you have a website, anything can access it (as long as they have the permissions), and you don't have to worry about synchronizing data changes the way you do if people make changes on their local device. Most of the simple "fill in a form" kinds of applications that Visual Basic was used for are more sensibly web applications (server side or client side).</p><p>Visual Basic is still used. And yes, I think there could be better tools for developing software. But as best as I recall, that's how we ended up here.

I'm a big fan of modern .NET, but my biggest complaint is that Microsoft views, and always has, the CLR as the C# Language Runtime and not the Common Language Runtime.<p>For example, see the relationship between F# and C#. The CLR is constantly getting features that are only to support features in C#, leaving F# in a position where they either don't get the feature, can't add the feature, or begrudgingly add the feature to keep up compatibility with C#, which is something it does take seriously. But this has the effect of "dirtying up" the F# language by either adding features that don't really belong in the language or keeping features out.</p><p>The other thing is that C# consistently adds features to itself that are inspired by F#, since F# already implements these features on the CLR, thus showing their viability. So what happens is that C# continually approaches a more bloated language with a subset of it being a poor copy of F#. But then F# gets dragged along towards having a small subset of C# in it for compatibility purposes. So it's simultaneously making both languages worse.</p><p>Even the iron languages project that lead to IronPython, IronRuby, etc. was a bit of a Trojan horse to test out and exercise the CLR and .NET with no intention of ever providing long-term support for those projects. The DLR, which was implemented to support those, appears to be just maintained by a skeleton crew of people invested in it, probably by those interested in keeping IronPython up and running.</p><p>I do not understand why Microsoft takes this approach. It is myopic, shows a misunderstanding of their own technology in the CLR, and ultimately turns C# into another C++, leave dead languages and projects in the wake.

Microsoft really shot themselves in the foot (but the web benefited).</p><p>And then on the hobbyist/personal side, that's also basically when casual developers switched from building fun Windows apps to building fun websites.</p><p>So I'd mark it up entirely to web programming replacing it on both sides.</p><p>As for what a replacement might look like, Google had created App Maker (2016-2020) that got replaced by AppSheet (2020-present), which is the closest I've found for the drag-and-drop GUI/database aspect of VB6.

The closest equivalent today for desktop apps <i>that still has Microsoft's focus on future innovation</i> is C# with Windows Forms.  (I downplay the "obvious" comparison of VB.NET to VB 6.0 because Microsoft already said they will "stop evolving" Visual Basic .NET -- so that's a technology dead end and will fall further and further behind the latest C# as the years go by.)</p><p>I personally don't experience that C#/Winforms has gone backwards from VB 6.0.

And when the think they could again commercialize .NET itself, then .NET would be dead. Modern Java, Flutter and TypeScript would easily swallow their market shares.

The change was too much, there was no path forward for VB, and Microsoft wanted everyone on .Net.</p><p>I eventually switched to C# and we had a hybrid application for a while before it was all ported to C#.  It actually went on to become industry leading software in its space.</p><p>20+ years later, that doesn't seem to have been a bad choice.  Windows Forms is very simple, with a powerful drag-and-drop designer, double-click to hook up events, it's all very similar.  Yes, you have to understand object oriented programming much more than you would have under VB, but that's as close as you are going to get from Microsoft on the desktop.  They try to hide it as best they can.</p><p>I <i>still</i> use Windows Forms if I need to put together something that "just works" on Windows as a desktop app quickly.  It's unmatched for that.</p><p>There are newer technologies, such as WPF, WinUI3, Avalonia and others for .Net but they come with a complexity that would be above your typical use-case for VB6 back in the day.  The VB6 user who just wanted to get stuff done probably doesn't want to have to understand how to implement the MVVM pattern just to get a UI.

The big problem though is that MS keeps failing to make a GUI framework that is quick-and-easy as VB forms were.  Winforms still exists, and it's only a <i>bit</i> clumsier than VB forms, but it's very old and not modern.  The more modern .NET gui-frameworks are much less user-friendly.<p>Linguistically, I think the successor to VB is Powershell.  It's the same mashup of inconsistent flags that let you swap between "this is a serious language" and "I'm smashing crap together" with tons of unexpected weird behavior, but instead of being a quick-and-dirty GUI app maker, it's a Shell.  Hardcore focus on being easy and productive but unforgivably warty.</p><p>As for VB itself, VB.Net just didn't offer much value distinct from C#, so most people who were coding in VB switched to C#.</p><p>So if you're an old longbearded MS LOB programmer who started before .NET, and you're still working in Microsoft LOB shops, you're probably doing similar stuff but with C#.  But realistically, you've probably also switched to Web.</p><p>And the lack of the VB-level ease-of-use in <i>web</i> technologies is a whole other story.  All the hoary mess of using a document-engine for a cross-platform application server makes it pretty untameable.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://news.ucsb.edu/2023/021198/wifi-can-read-through-walls">https://news.ucsb.edu/2023/021198/wifi-can-read-through-walls</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37469920">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-history-node-id="21198">
      

    
                    <div><p><span><span><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span>Researchers in UC Santa Barbara professor Yasamin Mostofi’s lab have proposed a new foundation that can enable high-quality imaging of still objects with only WiFi signals. Their method uses the Geometrical Theory of Diffraction and the corresponding Keller cones to trace edges of the objects. The technique has also enabled, for the first time, imaging, or reading, the English alphabet through walls with WiFi, a task deemed too difficult for WiFi due to the complex details of the letters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span>For more details on this technology, check their video at <span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvqL3gqGDeM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvqL3gqGDeM</a></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span><span>“Imaging still scenery with WiFi is considerably challenging due to the lack of motion,” said Mostofi, a professor of electrical and computer engineering. “We have then taken a completely different approach to tackle this challenging problem by focusing on tracing the edges of the objects instead.”&nbsp; The proposed methodology and experimental results appeared in the Proceedings of the 2023 IEEE </span></span></span></span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span><span>National Conference on Radar</span></span></span></span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span><span> (RadarConf) on June 21, 2023.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
</div>

                  

                  <div><p><span><span><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span>This innovation builds on previous work in the Mostofi Lab, which since 2009 has pioneered sensing with everyday radio frequency signals such as WiFi for several different applications, including crowd analytics, person identification, smart health and smart spaces. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span>“When a given wave is incident on an edge point, a cone of outgoing rays emerges according to the Keller’s Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (GTD), referred to as a Keller cone,” Mostofi explained. The researchers note that this interaction is not limited to visibly sharp edges but applies to a broader set of surfaces with a small enough curvature.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span>“Depending on the edge orientation, the cone then leaves different footprints (i.e., conic sections) on a given receiver grid. We then develop a mathematical framework that uses these conic footprints as signatures to infer the orientation of the edges, thus creating an edge map of the scene,”&nbsp; Mostofi continued. </span></span></span></p>
</div>

                  <div><p><span><span><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span>More specifically, the team proposed a Keller cone-based imaging projection kernel. This kernel is implicitly a function of the edge orientations, a relationship that is then exploited to infer the existence/orientation of the edges via hypothesis testing over a small set of possible edge orientations. In other words, if existence of an edge is determined, the edge orientation that best matches the resulting Keller cone-based signature is chosen for a given point that they are interested in imaging. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span>“Edges of real-life objects have local dependencies,” said Anurag Pallaprolu, the lead Ph.D. student on the project. “Thus, once we find the high-confidence edge points via the proposed imaging kernel, we then propagate their information to the rest of the points using Bayesian information propagation. This step can further help improve the image, since some of the edges may be in a blind region, or <span>can be </span>overpowered by other edges that are closer to the transmitters.” Finally, once an image is formed, the researchers can further improve the image by using image completion tools from the area of vision.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span><span>“It is worth noting that traditional imaging techniques result in poor imaging quality when deployed with commodity WiFi transceivers,” added Pallaprolu, “as the surfaces can appear near-specular at lower frequencies, thus not leaving enough signature on the receiver grid.” &nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span><span>The researchers have also extensively studied the impact of several different parameters, such as curvature of a surface, edge orientation, distance to the receiver grid, and transmitter location on the Keller cones and their proposed edge-based imaging system, thereby developing a foundation for a methodical imaging system design. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
</div>

                  <div><p><span><span><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span><span>In the team’s experiments, three off-the-shelf WiFi transmitters send wireless waves in the area. WiFi receivers are then mounted on an unmanned vehicle that emulates a WiFi receiver grid as it moves.&nbsp; The receiver measures the received signal power which it then uses for imaging, based on the proposed methodology. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span><span>The researchers have extensively tested this technology with several experiments in three different areas, including through-wall scenarios. In one example application, they developed a WiFi Reader to showcase the capabilities of the proposed pipeline. </span></span></span></span></p>
</div>

                  <div><p><span><span><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span><span>This application is particularly informative as the English alphabet presents complex details which can be used to test the performance of the imaging system. Along this line, the group has shown how they can successfully image several alphabet-shaped objects. In addition to imaging, they can further classify the letters. Finally, they have shown how their approach enables WiFi to image and read through walls by imaging the details and further reading the letters of the word “BELIEVE” through walls. They have furthermore imaged a number of other objects as well, showing that they can capture details previously not possible with WiFi. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span>Overall, the proposed approach can open up new directions for RF imaging.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://henvic.dev/posts/uuid/">https://henvic.dev/posts/uuid/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37469857">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        
        
        
        <p><time datetime="2021-05-30 00:00:00 +0000 UTC"></time>Sunday, 30 May 2021.</p>
        
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">UUID</a>, short for Universally Unique Identifier (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc4122">spec</a>), is a 128-bit identifier format widespread on computer systems.
The following is an example, using its prevalent representation: <samp>a73ba12d-1d8b-2516-3aee-4b15e563a835</samp>.
I’ve experienced first-hand how using UUID hurts the usability of computer systems, and I want you to understand why you certainly don’t need it.</p>
<p>Take Amazon. Which do you think is a link to one of their products?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3c6n63N">amzn.to/3c6n63N</a></li>
<li>amzn.to/a73ba12d-1d8b-2516-3aee-4b15e563a835</li>
</ul>
<p>A simple ID like <samp>3c6n63N</samp> is more than enough to represent any product while keeping it readable and making communication easier.
A UUID alternative like <samp>a73ba12d-1d8b-2516-3aee-4b15e563a835</samp> is just wasteful from an user’s perspective.</p>
<p>In a specific case, I’ve witnessed entities that were supposed to be exposed to end-users using user-friendly ids while UUIDs were in use internally.
For this to work, either a one-to-one mapping or a separate list of unique ids for your entities are necessary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You might as well end up with a combination of the worst of both worlds: UUID + sequentially generated (auto increment) numeric identifiers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve seen all sorts of combinations of this on many systems: some entities using only friendly ids, some using only sequential ids, and most using both.</p>
<p>For example, an entity that is used only internally might be using a UUID.
Then a demand to expose it externally appears, and developers add a new friendly ID so that users won’t deal with ridiculously long links.</p>
<ul>
<li>When using UUID, it’s hard to use, track, and compare data manually.</li>
<li>When using sequential ids, you might be leaking sensitive business metrics to the competition or hit scalability and syncing limits.</li>
<li>When using both at the same time, your internal users might have a hard time mapping ids to UUIDs and vice-versa.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, with all this said, I think I’ve made a case for trying to just stick to more accessible ids everywhere!
Next, watch this video, and let’s see a practical alternative.</p>
<div>
                
                <p>
                  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gocwRvLhDf8" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>

        </div>
<h2 id="collisions-and-uniqueness">Collisions and uniqueness</h2>
<p>The UUID textual representation is 36 characters long, being four hyphen separators and 32 hexadecimal digits.
There are four versions.
Version 1 and 2 were date-time and MAC address-based.
Version 3 and 5 are namespace name-based.
Version 4 is completely randomly generated (hence, it has more entropy) and is what most web systems seem to use.</p>
<p>It has 16^32 = 2^128 bits that guarantee uniqueness and has an insignificant risk of collision.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hexadecimal is commonly used in computing as a compact representation for the binary numeral system.
In hexadecimal, 10 is 0xA, 11 is 0xB, 12 is 0xC, 13 is 0xD, 14 is 0xE, 15 is 0xF, 16 is 0x10, and so on.

<h2 id="practical-solutions">Practical solutions</h2>
<p>As Tom Scott shows in his video, 11 base58-encoded characters are enough for YouTube to serve content even when considering that unlisted videos should be undiscoverable.</p>
<p>Let’s see what a simple and elegant solution for generating that in Go might be:</p>

</span></span><span><span>	<span>return</span> string(<span>id</span>)
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div><p><a href="https://play.golang.org/p/T3wvtUNSJcy" lang="en-US">Play with this code</a></p>
<p>This solution uses the human-readable <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-msporny-base58-01.html">base58 encoding scheme</a>.
I cheated a little by using only the least significant bits to create the ID instead of trying to squeeze performance as this is good enough.</p>
<p>There are other possibilities. Base58 is just one option. You might have different needs, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using only lowercase to avoid ambiguity</li>
<li>Limiting the number of chars combinations to avoid words (naughty words) coming out as identifiers</li>
</ul>
<p>You just need to do some basic math to make sure you’ve something solid for your use case.</p>
<h3 id="when-to-use-uuid">When to use UUID?</h3>
<p>UUID was designed thinking about distributed systems, but not all distributed systems are equal.
If you’re talking about a web system composed of microservice architecture all running on the same datacenter, perhaps sharing the same database, I’d say it’s implausible that you need UUIDs at all, even if you’re running things at scale.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you’re ingesting data generated by systems out of your control, it might be a good choice.
I’ve used it when writing a metrics and diagnostics system for CLI tools (<a href="https://github.com/henvic/climetrics">climetrics</a>).
In this specific case, the CLI tool I maintained appended entries to a file flushed to our servers through a background process executed eventually following some heuristics.</p>

Ray and I had met in 1969, and we got married in 1989; he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/10/science/10solomonoff.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">passed away</a> in late 2009. Over the years, I had attended a number of his talks, and I had met many of Ray’s peers and colleagues in AI, so I was curious about the photo.</p><p>I thought, “Gee, that guy in the middle doesn’t look like my memory of Trenchard.” So I called up Trenchard’s son Paul More. He assured me that the unknown person was not his father.</p><p>More recently, I discovered a letter among Ray’s papers. On 8 November 1956, Nat Rochester sent a short note and a copy of the photo to some colleagues: “Enclosed is a print of the photograph I took of the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a> group.” He sent his note to McCarthy, Minsky, Selfridge, Shannon, Solomonoff—and Peter Milner.</p><p data-rm-resized-container="25%"><img alt="A typed letter with the photograph of the six men,  is addressed to six names from Nathaniel Rochester." data-rm-shortcode-id="29a714f8f61d2228ac93efd838df9fb6" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-typed-letter-with-the-photograph-of-the-six-men-is-addressed-to-six-names-from-nathaniel-rochester.jpg?id=33603732&amp;width=980" height="1375" id="1b532" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-typed-letter-with-the-photograph-of-the-six-men-is-addressed-to-six-names-from-nathaniel-rochester.jpg?id=33603732&amp;width=980" width="1338"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Several months after the workshop, Nathaniel Rochester sent a copy of the photo, along with this note, to six people.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Grace Solomonoff</small></p><p>So the unknown person must be Milner! This makes perfect sense. <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/psychology/article/remembering-peter-m-milner-1919-2018" target="_blank">Milner</a> was working on neuropsychology at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/" target="_blank">McGill University</a>, in Montreal, although he had trained as an electrical engineer. He’s not generally lumped in with the other AI pioneers because his research interests diverged from theirs. Even at Dartmouth, he felt he was in over his head, as he wrote in his 1999 autobiography: “I was invited to a meeting of computer scientists and information theorists at Dartmouth College…. Most of the time I had no idea what they were talking about.”</p><p>In his fascinating autobiography, Milner writes about his work in radar development during World War II, and his switch after the war from nuclear-reactor design to psychology. His doctoral thesis in 1954, “<a href="https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zc77sv01t" target="_blank">Effects of Intracranial Stimulation on Rat Behaviour</a>,” examined the effects of electrical stimulation on certain rat neurons, which became widely and enthusiastically known as “pleasure centers.”</p><p>This work led to one of Milner’s most famous papers, “<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1959-00249-001" target="_blank">The Cell Assembly: Mark II</a>,” in 1957. The paper describes how, when a neuron in the brain fires, it excites similar connected neurons (especially those already aroused by sensory input) and randomly excites other cortical neurons. Cells may form assemblies and connect with other assemblies. But the neurons don’t seem to exhibit the same snowballing behavior of atoms that leads to an exponential explosion. How neurons might inhibit this effect were among his ideas that led to new insights at the workshop.</p><p>Milner’s work contributed to the early development of artificial neural networks, and it’s why he was included in the Dartmouth meeting. There was considerable interest among AI researchers in studying the brain and neurons in order to reproduce its functions and intelligence.</p><p>But as Strickland notes in her October 2021 <em>Spectrum</em> article, a division was already forming in AI research. One side focused on replicating the brain, while the other was more interested in what the mind might do to directly solve problems. Scientists interested in this latter approach were also represented at Dartmouth and later championed the rise of symbolic logic, using heuristic and algorithmic processes, which I’ll discuss in a bit.</p><h2>Where Was the Photo Taken?</h2><p>Rochester’s photo from 1956 shows the left-hand side of Dartmouth Hall in the background. In 2006 Dartmouth convened a conference, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI@50" target="_blank">AI@50</a>, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the AI gathering and to discuss AI’s present and future. Trenchard More, the person most often misidentified as the “unknown person” in Nat’s photo, met with the organizers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_H._Moor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">James Moor</a> and Carey Heckman, as well as Wendy Conquest, who was working on a movie about AI for the conference. None of the AI@50 organizers knew exactly where the 1956 meeting had taken place.</p><p>More led them across the lawn and to the left-hand side door of Dartmouth Hall. He showed them the rooms that were used, which in turn triggered an old memory. During the 1956 meeting, as More recalled in a <a href="http://raysolomonoff.com/dartmouth/misc/Trenchardinterview2011.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2011 interview</a>, “Selfridge, and Minsky, and McCarthy, and Ray Solomonoff, and I gathered around a dictionary on a stand to look up the word <em>heuristic</em>, because we thought that might be a useful word.” On that 2006 tour of Dartmouth Hall, he was delighted to find that the dictionary was still there.</p><p>The word <em>heuristic</em> was invoked all through the summer of 1956. Instead of trying to analyze the brain to develop machine intelligence, some participants focused on the operational steps needed to solve a given problem, making particular use of heuristic methods to quickly identify the steps.</p><p>Early in the summer, for instance, Herb Simon and Allen Newell gave a talk on a program they had written, the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1056797" target="_blank">logic theory machine</a>. The program relied on early ideas of symbolic logic, with algorithmic steps and heuristic guidance in list form. They later won the 1975 Turing Award for these ideas. Think of heuristics as intuitive guides. The logic theory machine used such guides to initiate the algorithmic steps—that is, the set of instructions to actually carry out the problem solving.<br></p><h2>Who Wasn’t in the Photo</h2><p>There was one person who was at the Dartmouth Workshop from time to time but was never included in any of the lists of attendees: Gloria Minsky, Marvin’s wife.</p><p>But Gloria was definitely a presence that summer. Marvin, Ray, and John McCarthy were the only three participants to stay for the entire eight-week workshop. Everyone else came and went as their schedules allowed. At the time, Gloria was a pediatrics fellow at Children’s Hospital in Boston, but whenever she could, she would drive up to Dartmouth, stay in Marvin’s apartment, and visit with whoever was at the workshop.</p><p>Several years earlier, in the spring of 1952, Gloria had been doing her residency in pathology at New York’s Bellevue Hospital, when she began dating Marvin. Marvin was a Ph.D. student at Princeton, as was McCarthy, and the two were invited to Bell Labs for the summer to work under Claude Shannon. In July, just four months after their first meeting, Gloria and Marvin got married. Although Marvin was working nonstop for Shannon, Shannon insisted he and Gloria take a honeymoon in New Mexico.</p><p data-rm-resized-container="25%"><img alt="A letter from John McCarthy to Ray Solomonoff on Dartmouth College stationery." data-rm-shortcode-id="85ad1d73a223bb5735e7b0fe2c2fc67d" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-letter-from-john-mccarthy-to-ray-solomonoff-on-dartmouth-college-stationery.jpg?id=33603735&amp;width=980" height="1001" id="4a2b5" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-letter-from-john-mccarthy-to-ray-solomonoff-on-dartmouth-college-stationery.jpg?id=33603735&amp;width=980" width="620"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">In March 1956, John McCarthy, one of the Dartmouth AI workshop’s organizers, invited Ray Solomonoff to the summer workshop in Hanover, N.H.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Grace Solomonoff</small></p><p>Four years later, McCarthy, Shannon, and Minsky, along with Nat Rochester, organized the <a href="http://jmc.stanford.edu/articles/dartmouth/dartmouth.pdf" target="_blank">Dartmouth workshop</a>. Gloria remembered a conversation between her husband and Ray, in which Marvin expressed a thought that later became one of his hallmarks: “You need to see something in more than one way to understand it.” In Minsky’s 2007 book <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Emotion-Machine/Marvin-Minsky/9780743276641" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The Emotion Machine</em></a>, he looked at how emotions, intuitions, and feelings create different descriptions and provide different ways of looking at things. He tended to favor symbolic logic and deductive methods in AI, which he called “good old-fashioned AI.”</p><p>Ray, meanwhile, was focused on probabilities—the likelihood of something happening and predictions of how it might evolve. He later developed algorithmic probability, an early version of algorithmic information theory, in which each different description of something leads with a probabilistic likelihood (some more likely, some less likely) of a given outcome in the future. Probabilistic methods eventually became the underpinnings of machine learning.</p><p>These days, as chatbots enter the limelight, and compression methods are used more in AI, the value of understanding things in many ways and using probabilistic predictions will only grow in importance. That is, logic and probability methods are uniting. These in turn are being aided by new work on neural nets as well as symbolic logic. And so the photo that Nat Rochester took not only captured a moment in time for AI. It also offered a glimpse into how AI would develop.</p><p><em>The author thanks Gloria Minsky, Margaret Minsky,</em><em>Nicholas Rochester, Julie Sussman, Gerald Jay Sussman, and Paul More for their help and patience.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

                  <p><span>Cool idea!  I don't really picture myself using this, but I think this add-on is a great example of how great a browser Firefox is.  I'd be the first to critique Mozilla, and there are definitely things about Firefox I don't like (ex. Pocket, telemetry on by default), but overall I think it's an amazing product in that it allows for multiple levels of isolation (profiles, containers, private mode) and a level of control over them that Chromium either doesn't do as cleanly or doesn't do at all.  As an aside, the only thing I think Chromium does better is the debugging experience; I don't truly understand why Firefox thinks it shouldn't support debugging Node.js like Chromium does.</span></p></div></td></tr>

Chrome has a visually similar functionality to Firefox Containers hidden away behind a feature flag [1] at the moment. BUT under the hood it's simply just tab grouping with no isolation. I presume isolation is against Google's interests so we will never see this kind of feature.</p><p>As for Firefox's API, the Contextual Identities API [2] that allows you to create/delete containers is amazing and easy to work with as a dev. And it works out-of-the-box, it doesn't need the companion addon Multi-Account Containers (MAC) [3] which really should've been part of Firefox in my opinion.</p><p>1. chrome://flags/#tab-groups-save</p><p>2. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/contextualIdentities" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/Web...</a></p><p>3. <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account...</a>

And as far as "isolation", privacy or security are concerned, Chrome's profiles are actually superior due to ability to have different extensions and history per profile. Chrome's extensions in general still have superior security (e.g., activate on click or only for certain websites), so sometimes different profiles aren't even needed.<p>Chrome's Profiles are also remembered when you "install an app" (SSB/PWA), so you could have "apps" started in their own profiles.</p><p>Firefox's containers are only useful if you want multiple logins to the same service in the same browser window. But I never found that usecase to be very compelling.</p><p>Firefox's containers are an often lauded feature, and I don't understand why, given the integration issues or general awkwardness. It's probably a reminiscence of the "Facebook container" extension, which was a bandaid until better site isolation was implemented.

                  <p><span>A counter anecdote is that I have the exact opposite use case. I don't share my computer with other users, so I've never needed something like profiles. Firefox containers are great for keeping different sites, especially those notorious for tracking (e.g. Amazon, Google, LinkedIn) completely isolated from each other or from general browsing. Plus, the extension that allows for creating temporary containers is great for one-off visits to e-commerce sites without needing to switch to a new private/incognito window. I'm not sure I've ever wanted my extensions isolated by container/profile, that seems like it would hinder productivity. Same for history. It's great having all my history commingled, especially if I want to find something from 30 tabs ago.</span></p></div></td></tr>

It's a use case I've often thought about, for the purposes you mention. I wish there was a built in permission to disable AJAX after page load. Bad for ads, I guess.<p>2. Exploit idea (not trying for the bounty, just thinking aloud). I wonder if a website could play background music (or a video) with stenographically encoded data, then another tab could listen to it with microphone permissions on and decode it that way. I'm thinking like a fake video conferencing site, or malicious telephony how-to doc that deals with API calls and such and links to a fake password hasher that then plays the audio for the first tab to hear. Convoluted, I know, just an idea.

If you are the only one using this trick it may work for you, but I assume would be easy to overcome. (e.g. keep the page loading forever or until ads are loaded. Have the ads be J-free after page load, ...)</p><p>&gt; website could play background music ... another tab could listen</p><p>You would need mic access from the other tab, but yes. If you send it over high enough frequency you wouldn't even hear it. You would just have a visual feedback that the tab is playing music.</p><p>On a side-note, I recall there was some kind of hardware device pairing (maybe Chromecast?) that used data over voice to establish that you are physically near the other device.

Looks like Google patented one version and Sonos has their implementation too. In my experience it works better than Bluetooth, especially in (2.4 GHz) noisy environments

And Sonos's own assistant doesn't even support Spotify, last I checked. Their whole UX is... not great. I really wanted to work there and maybe try to fix some of the issues I experience as a user, but they rejected me. Alas.

(e.g. one sets a cookie or local storage and the other one reads it)</p><p>For #3, it would be impossible to detect. Especially if detection is an issue, both tabs could be communicating with unrelated servers which talk with each other.</p><p>For #2, it would be the only interesting one as there is limited options (e.g. Broadcast Channel), but at the same time I assume rarely used in practice. And if detection is an issue, they would switch to #3 to avoid it.
