<p>There’s a certain simple animation thing that I’ve been using almost since I’ve ever started doing anything related to graphics. I use it for rotating &amp; moving the camera, for moving figures in a turn-based game, for moving UI elements, for smoothing volume changes in <a href="https://lisyarus.github.io/blog/programming/2022/10/15/audio-mixing.html">my audio lib</a>, everywhere! So I decided I’ll write about it. The trick itself is nothing new, - in fact, you’ve probably already heard about or even used it, - but I’ll also show it in some examples and explain how it works mathematically :)</p>

<h2 id="toggle-buttons">Toggle buttons</h2>

<p>Speaking of UI, say you’re making some UI component, maybe a toggle button. Something like this (click it!):</p>

<center><canvas id="toggle-none"></canvas></center>




<p>This simply computes the position of the switch as a function of its state:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>turned_on</span> <span>?</span> <span>max_x</span> <span>:</span> <span>min_x</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This works perfectly, but feels a bit lifeless. Adding some <em>animation</em> to it would be cool! Animations are not just a fancy visual thing, they help the user understand what’s going on. Instead of teleporting the toggle indicator to its new position, let’s move it smoothly:</p>

<center><canvas id="toggle-linear"></canvas></center>




<p>The downside is that we need to run some updating animation now:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>+=</span> <span>(</span><span>turned_on</span> <span>?</span> <span>1</span> <span>:</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>dt</span><span>;</span>
<span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>clamp</span><span>(</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>min_x</span><span>,</span> <span>max_x</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>However, this still looks a bit clumsy due to having a constant speed (i.e. the position is a <em>linear</em> function of time). Let’s add some <a href="https://easings.net/">easing</a> function on top of that, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothstep">classic cubic</a> <code>3t^2-2t^3</code>:</p>

<center><canvas id="toggle-cubic"></canvas></center>




<p>or a square root <code>sqrt(t)</code>:</p>

<center><canvas id="toggle-sqrt"></canvas></center>




<p>The difference between these may be hard to see, so let’s slow down the animation by a factor of 8:</p>

<center>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td><p>Linear:     </p></td><td><center><canvas id="toggle-compare1-linear"></canvas></center></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>Cubic:      </p></td><td><center><canvas id="toggle-compare1-cubic"></canvas></center></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>Square root:</p></td><td><center><canvas id="toggle-compare1-sqrt"></canvas></center></td><td></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>




<p>This time, instead of just updating the switch position, we have to keep track of some extra animation state:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>t</span> <span>+=</span> <span>(</span><span>turned_on</span> <span>?</span> <span>1</span> <span>:</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>dt</span><span>;</span>
<span>t</span> <span>=</span> <span>clamp</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>ease</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>3</span> <span>*</span> <span>t</span> <span>*</span> <span>t</span> <span>-</span> <span>2</span> <span>*</span> <span>t</span> <span>*</span> <span>t</span> <span>*</span> <span>t</span><span>);</span>
<span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>lerp</span><span>(</span><span>min_x</span><span>,</span> <span>max_x</span><span>,</span> <span>ease</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Here, I’m using the fact that <code>smoothstep</code> is symmetric in the following sense: <code>1 - f(t) = f(1 - t)</code>, meaning the forward and backward animations can use the same code. With <code>sqrt</code> things are a bit different: we have to explicitly use a different easing function depending on the animation’s direction:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>ease</span> <span>=</span> <span>turned_on</span> <span>?</span> <span>sqrt</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>-</span> <span>sqrt</span><span>(</span><span>1</span> <span>-</span> <span>t</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Whichever looks best is arguably a matter of taste, but of all these <code>sqrt</code> is my favourite: the switch starts moving really fast (this is because <code>sqrt</code> has infinite derivative at zero), but then slows down nicely as it reaches the destination (the cubic one is my second favourite, though). The downside of this version is that we need quite a lot of bookkeeping even in the simplest possible case of a two-state toggle button (later in the article I’ll show how this becomes a nightmare in more complicated scenarios). Another downside is that it has a discontinuity: it jumps suddenly if the user clicks on it the middle of animation (try it!).</p>

<p>Thankfully there’s a similar version which uses the minimal possible state and doesn’t have the “jumping” problem:</p>

<center><canvas id="toggle-exp"></canvas></center>




<p>I call it <em>exponential smoothing</em> (for reasons that will become clear later). I’ve also heard it being called <em>approach</em>, and I’m certain it has it’s own name in every engine. Here it is slowed down 8x and compared to <code>sqrt</code>:</p>

<center>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td><p>Square root:</p></td><td><center><canvas id="toggle-compare2-sqrt"></canvas></center></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>Exponential:</p></td><td><center><canvas id="toggle-compare2-exp"></canvas></center></td><td></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>




<p>Here’s the code for the exponential version:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>target</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>state</span><span>.</span><span>value</span> <span>?</span> <span>max_x</span> <span>:</span> <span>min_x</span><span>);</span>
<span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>+=</span> <span>(</span><span>target</span> <span>-</span> <span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span> <span>-</span> <span>exp</span><span>(</span><span>-</span> <span>dt</span> <span>*</span> <span>speed</span><span>));</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Intuitively, on each frame we nudge the current position towards its <em>target position</em> (which is determind by the on/off state). However, the amount of nudging <code>(1 - exp(- dt * speed))</code> looks really weird, doesn’t it? Before we see where it comes from, let’s have a look at some more complicated animations.</p>

<h2 id="camera-movement">Camera movement</h2>

<p>Say we have some kind of map, and a camera scrolling/moving around.</p>

<center><canvas id="camera-none"></canvas></center>




<p><em>Yes I’ve made a whole procedural map generator &amp; renderer just for this example, and I have zero regrets.</em></p>

<p>Again, this begs us to add some animation. Let’s interpolate it with constant speed:</p>

<center><canvas id="camera-linear-jitter"></canvas></center>




<p>Here’s the code:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>+=</span> <span>sign</span><span>(</span><span>target</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>-</span> <span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>dt</span><span>;</span>
<span>position</span><span>.</span><span>y</span> <span>+=</span> <span>sign</span><span>(</span><span>target</span><span>.</span><span>y</span> <span>-</span> <span>position</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>dt</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>See this jittering after the animation completes? That’s because <code>target.x - position.x</code> keeps alternating between being positive and negative. Instead of <code>sign(delta)</code> we need some function that clamps the delta:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>float</span> <span>update</span><span>(</span><span>float</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>value</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span> <span>target</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span> <span>max_delta</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>float</span> <span>delta</span> <span>=</span> <span>target</span> <span>-</span> <span>value</span><span>;</span>
    <span>delta</span> <span>=</span> <span>min</span><span>(</span><span>delta</span><span>,</span>  <span>max_delta</span><span>);</span>
    <span>delta</span> <span>=</span> <span>max</span><span>(</span><span>delta</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>max_delta</span><span>);</span>
    <span>value</span> <span>+=</span> <span>delta</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>update</span><span>(</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>target</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>dt</span><span>);</span>
<span>update</span><span>(</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>,</span> <span>target</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>,</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>dt</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Quite a mouthful for such a simple thing! And here’s the result:</p>

<center><canvas id="camera-linear"></canvas></center>




<p>Much better, although it’s still a bit clumsy and also weird if we move the camera faster than the animation completes. We could, as before, add some easing function, like the cubic one:</p>

<center><canvas id="camera-cubic"></canvas></center>




<p>although this time it gets really complicated: we have to maintain a queue of requested movement events, and animate them one by one (otherwise I have no idea how to slap the easing function here). This still looks a bit weird when moving the camera fast enough. We could just ignore user’s input while the animation is active, but this is a deadly sin as it is infuriatingly frustrating from the user’s perspective.</p>

<p>The perfect solution? Why, exponential smoothing of course! The code barely changes compared to the toggle button example:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>+=</span> <span>(</span><span>target</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>-</span> <span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>1.0</span> <span>-</span> <span>exp</span><span>(</span><span>-</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>dt</span><span>));</span>
<span>position</span><span>.</span><span>y</span> <span>+=</span> <span>(</span><span>target</span><span>.</span><span>y</span> <span>-</span> <span>position</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>1.0</span> <span>-</span> <span>exp</span><span>(</span><span>-</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>dt</span><span>));</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>and here’s how it looks like:</p>

<center><canvas id="camera-exp"></canvas></center>




<p>Pretty nice, if you ask me! Notice how it speeds up naturally if you click fast enough.</p>

<h2 id="under-the-hood">Under the hood</h2>

<p>Ok, so what’s up with this <code>1 - exp(- speed * dt)</code>, what on Earth is that?</p>

<p>Let’s start with a simplified version: we have some animation, it has a current <code>position</code> and the new position <code>target</code> which it must move towards with some <code>speed</code>. To make the movement faster when the difference between <code>position</code> and <code>target</code> is large, we make the speed proportional to this difference:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>position</span> <span>+=</span> <span>(</span><span>target</span> <span>-</span> <span>position</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>dt</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Notice how it doesn’t require maintaining <em>any</em> state other than the current and the target position! (<code>speed</code> is usually a constant.) It even doesn’t need to keep track of time that elapsed since the start of the animation, and it adjusts automatically if the <code>target</code> suddenly changes.</p>

<p>Now this already works perfectly in many situations, but there’s a small catch. Here’s the toggle button again, with the above udpate code:</p>

<center><canvas id="toggle-exp-bad"></canvas></center>




<p>See the jittering? That’s because I’ve set the <code>speed</code> value so high that <code>speed * dt</code> became larger than 1! Specifically, I used <code>speed = 220</code> and <code>dt = 1 / 125</code>.</p>

<p>To understand what’s happening, it is useful to rewrite the code above using <code>lerp</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>position</span> <span>=</span> <span>lerp</span><span>(</span><span>position</span><span>,</span> <span>target</span><span>,</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>dt</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You can check that this is ultimately the same formula. We can clearly see what’s going on: the formula interpolates between the current value and the target value. The closer the interpolation parameter <code>speed * dt</code> to zero, the slower the interpolation. The closer it is to one, the faster the movement.</p>

<p>Now, what happens when <code>speed * dt</code> is larger than 1 is that the interpolation <em>overshoots</em>! The only reason it still works is that <code>speed * dt</code> is less than 2, so that the <em>absolute</em> delta between <code>position</code> and <code>target</code> still decreases with time. Here’s an example with <code>speed * dt = 248 / 125 &lt; 2</code>:</p>

<center><canvas id="toggle-exp-bad2"></canvas></center>




<p>and here’s one with <code>speed * dt = 252 / 125 &gt; 2</code>:</p>

<center><canvas id="toggle-exp-bad3"></canvas></center>




<p>The last one doesn’t do anything useful at all.</p>

<p>To solve this, we could simply clamp the value by 1:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>position</span> <span>=</span> <span>lerp</span><span>(</span><span>position</span><span>,</span> <span>target</span><span>,</span> <span>min</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>dt</span><span>));</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>However, this doesn’t seem like the right thing to do in all scenarios. Consider why <code>speed * dt</code> might actually happen to be so large?</p>

<p>One reason is that your <code>speed</code> value is too large because you want a really quick animation. However, as we’ve seen with the above toggle buttons, this is actually way too quick for any reasonable user – the actual animation is impossible to notice. So, out <code>speed</code> value is usually not that high.</p>

<p>The other reason is that <code>dt</code> is too large. Maybe because your code runs too slow, and your framerate is dropping. Maybe because the user moved to a different tab/window and your code was sleeping, and now it got woken up with a <code>dt</code> of many seconds.</p>

<p>When applying such a <code>dt</code> to something like physics, you certainly want to clamp it, or subdivide into several updates, etc. With animations, however, wouldn’t it be cool if everything worked perfectly even in this case? Even if your physics might lag, at least the camera &amp; buttons would still work nicely – as a user, I would really appreciate such care.</p>

<h2 id="differential-equations-oh-no">Differential equations (oh no)</h2>

<p>Ok, we want to solve the problem, but how? Here’s the two-step recipe:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Realize that what we’re doing is numerically solving a certain differential equation</li>
  <li>Solve the equation symbolically and use the result directly</li>
</ol>

<p>Time-dependent update that works for small <code>dt</code> but breaks for large <code>dt</code> is pretty typical for numerical solvers of differential equations. What equation does <code>position += (target - position) * speed * dt</code> solve? Whenever you see <code>A += B * dt</code>, this corresponds to an equation</p>

<center><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\small%20\dpi{200}\frac{d}{dt}A=B"></center>

<p>In our case, the equation is</p>

<center><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\small%20\dpi{200}\frac{d}{dt}\text{position}%20=%20(\text{target%20-%20position})\cdot\text{speed}"></center>


<p>I will die if I keep typing these formulas with all words spelled out, so let’s make a few variable changes: call <code>x = position</code>, <code>a = target</code>, and <code>c = speed</code>:</p>

<center><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\small%20\dpi{200}\frac{d}{dt}x%20=%20(a%20-%20x)%20\cdot%20c"></center>


<p>Solving this needs just a few tricks:</p>

<center><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\small%20\dpi{200}\frac{d}{dt}(x%20-%20a)%20=%20\frac{d}{dt}x%20=%20(a%20-%20x)%20\cdot%20c%20=%20-%20(x%20-%20a)%20\cdot%20c"></center>

<center><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\small%20\dpi{200}x%20-%20a%20=%20(x_0%20-%20a)\cdot%20\exp(-c\cdot%20t)"></center>

<center><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\small%20\dpi{200}x%20=%20a%20-%20(a%20-%20x_0)\cdot%20\exp(-c\cdot%20t)"></center>

<center><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\small%20\dpi{200}x%20=%20x_0%20+%20(a%20-%20x_0)\cdot%20(1%20-%20\exp(-c\cdot%20t)%20)"></center>


<p><em>Btw, a similar exponent appears in e.g. volumetric rendering for pretty similar reasons.</em></p>

<p>It’s not important to understand exactly where this all comes from. The point is that if we believe that <code>position += (target - position) * speed * dt</code> is the right formula for <em>small</em> <code>dt</code>, then the formula <code>position += (target - position) * (1 - exp(- speed * dt))</code> is the right formula to use for <em>any</em> <code>dt</code>. This is further supported by expanding the latter equation in terms of Taylor series for the exponent: <code>exp(x) ~ 1 + x</code>, so that <code>1 - exp(- speed * dt) ~ 1 - (1 - speed * dt) = speed * dt</code>, i.e. we get exactly the former equation.</p>

<p>The cool thing is that it doesn’t care about old values: if you have your previous value <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\small%20\dpi{100}x_0"> and you know how much time has passed between the previous and the current iteration, you can compute the new value. (This is a direct consequence of being a first-order differential equation.)</p>

<p>So, the TL;DR is that <code>position += (target - position) * (1 - exp(- speed * dt))</code>  is the right formula that works for any <code>speed</code> and <code>dt</code>. Even if the product <code>speed * dt</code> is too large, <code>exp(- speed * dt)</code> handles it nicely, since <code>exp</code> of a large negative number is just something close to zero, so <code>1 - exp</code> will be close to one.</p>

<p>We can, as before, rewrite this using <code>lerp</code>: <code>position = lerp(position, target, 1 - exp(- speed * dt))</code> or even <code>position = lerp(target, position, exp(- speed * dt))</code>. There are many ways to rewrite this equtaion.</p>

<h2 id="choosing-the-speed">Choosing the speed</h2>

<p>Usually, we think of animation in terms of its <em>duration</em>. Like, the toggle button should move to the new place in 0.125 seconds (the actual value used in the examples in the beginning of the post), after that it stops moving. With this exponential formula, however, the animation technically takes <em>infinite</em> time to complete! <code>exp(- speed * time)</code> gets smaller with time, but it <em>never</em> equals zero, so that <code>position</code> technically <em>never</em> equals <code>target</code> (provided they were different to start with).</p>

<p>However, in practice we have a ton of limitations. If <code>position</code> is floating-point, it quickly reaches the precision limit, and it becomes equal to <code>target</code> in practice. If it is, say, the camera position, the user probably won’t notice that the animation is still going since the delta <code>target - position</code> gets ridiculously small even before it hits floating-point precision limits.</p>

<p>So, what does the <code>speed</code> parameter mean, exactly? It means the following: <code>1 / speed</code> is the time in which <code>position</code> becomes closer to <code>target</code> by a factor of <code>e = 2.71828...</code> exactly. Do whatever you want with this information.</p>

<p>I usually set the <code>speed</code> to something in the range <code>5..50</code>. For a linear/cubic animation of a certain <code>speed</code>, I usually set the exponential version speed to be <code>2 * speed</code>, this feels about right (again, this is what was used in the examples above).</p>



<p>If you google “exponential smoothing” (or “exponential moving average”), you might find the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing">wiki article</a> on something completely unrelated which, nevertheless, features some pretty similar formulas. It actually is the discrete analogue of what we were talking about in this post!</p>

<p>Suppose that our <code>dt</code> is always the same; also suppose that <code>target</code> changes as often as every iteration. Then, indexing the values with the iteration number, we compute something like <code>position[i] = (target[i] - position[i - 1]) * factor</code>, where <code>factor = 1 - exp(- speed * dt)</code>. In this case, one typically sets <code>factor</code> directly to some value between 0 and 1 instead of deriving it from other values (although the aforementioned wiki article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing#Time_constant">does explain</a> what this <code>factor</code> actually means).</p>

<p>People use it in signal processing for the same reasons I do for animations: it doesn’t require maintaining previous values or any other obscure state, just the current averaged value. They also use it in digital audio, where you typically have a fixed <code>dt</code> of <code>1 / freq</code> the inverse sampling frequency (e.g. <code>1/44100</code> or <code>1/48000</code>).</p>

			<p>The creator of the Dragon Ball franchise, Akira Toriyama, has been <a href="https://x.com/DB_official_en/status/1765935471971213816?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> to have passed away on March 1, 2024, due to subdural hematoma at the age of 68.</p>
<p>The rest of the message overviews his accomplishments while also stating that a funeral service was held with his family and very few relatives. The official Dragon Ball account requests that fans do not request interviews from Toriyama’s family, visit them or send items like flowers or condolence gifts. The official account also expressed regret that Toriyama has left several works in the middle of their respective creations, especially given his enthusiasm.</p>
<p>We are deeply saddened to hear about his passing and will always remember him for his legendary contributions to the manga and anime world.</p>
<p>You can view the full message from the official Dragon Ball Twitter account below:</p>

</div><p>The European Space Agency (ESA) Space Debris and Independent Safety Offices are closely monitoring the reentry of a pallet of used ISS batteries and calculating estimates for when and where the reentry will occur.</p><div>
				<p>The batteries, nine in total, were released on 11 January 2021 and will undergo a natural reentry, which is now predicted for around 18:56 CET on&nbsp;8 March +/- 0.4 days.</p><p>The total mass of the batteries is estimated at 2.6 metric tonnes, most of which may burn up during the reentry. While some parts may reach the ground, the casualty risk – the likelihood of a person being hit – is very low.</p><p>The reentry will occur between -51.6 degrees South and 51.6 degrees North. Large uncertainties, primarily driven by fluctuating levels of atmospheric drag, prevent more precise predictions at this time. The closer we get to the expected reentry window, the better the concerned region can be geographically constrained.</p>	</div><div>
				<p>ESA is monitoring the object and, upon request, providing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esa.int/About_Us/Corporate_news/Member_States_Cooperating_States">ESA Member States</a>&nbsp;with the latest predictions for the time and location of the reentry, which they then combine with their own analyses.</p><p>A large space object reenters the atmosphere in a natural way approximately once per week, with the majority of the associated fragments burning up before reaching the ground. Most spacecraft, launch vehicles and operational hardware are designed to limit the risks associated with a reentry.</p>	</div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">It annoys me to no end when a web application prevents me from being able to
paste content into an input field, or copy it out.  If I paste an incorrect

<p dir="auto">Version 2 is a major update to the extension. It makes it much easier to ensure
the extension is only running on sites that are bad actors with copy &amp; paste
events and it also provides visibility into the active/inactive state of the
extension for each tab.</p>
<p dir="auto">In order to provide the smoothest experience as possible, the extension needs
to know when you change active tabs. In order for the extension to know about
that event, it needs the <code>tabs</code> permission, which Chrome describes as "can read
and change all your data on websites you visit." That description is very
scary, and is certainly not what this extension is doing. Being an open-sourced
project, you can always read all the code to see how this extension works, and
what it's [not] doing with your data.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
  <p>
    annas-blog.org, 2022-10-17 (translations: <a href="https://saveweb.othing.xyz/blog/2022/11/12/%e5%a6%82%e4%bd%95%e6%88%90%e4%b8%ba%e6%b5%b7%e7%9b%97%e6%a1%a3%e6%a1%88%e5%ad%98%e6%a1%a3%e8%80%85/">中文 [zh]</a>)
  </p>
  <p>
    Before we dive in, two updates on the Pirate Library Mirror (EDIT: moved to Anna’s Archive):<br>
    1. We got some extremely generous donations. The first was $10k from the anonymous individual who also has been supporting "bookwarrior", the original founder of Library Genesis. Special thanks to bookwarrior for facilitating this donation. The second was another $10k from an anonymous donor, who got in touch after our last release, and was inspired to help. We also had a number of smaller donations. Thanks so much for all your generous support. We have some exciting new projects in the pipeline which this will support, so stay tuned.<br>
    2. We had some technical difficulties with the size of our second release, but our torrents are up and seeding now. We also got a generous offer from an anonymous individual to seed our collection on their very-high-speed servers, so we're doing a special upload to their machines, after which everyone else who is downloading the collection should see a large improvement in speed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Entire books can be written about the <em>why</em> of digital preservation in general, and pirate archivism in particular, but let us give a quick primer for those who are not too familiar. The world is producing more knowledge and culture than ever before, but also more of it is being lost than ever before. Humanity largely entrusts corporations like academic publishers, streaming services, and social media companies with this heritage, and they have often not proven to be great stewards. Check out the documentary Digital Amnesia, or really any talk by Jason Scott.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are some institutions that do a good job archiving as much as they can, but they are bound by the law. As pirates, we are in a unique position to archive collections that they cannot touch, because of copyright enforcement or other restrictions. We can also mirror collections many times over, across the world, thereby increasing the chances of proper preservation.
  </p>
  <p>
    For now, we won't get into discussions about the pros and cons of intellectual property, the morality of breaking the law, musings on censorship, or the issue of access to knowledge and culture. With all that out of the way, let's dive into the <em>how</em>. We'll share how our team became pirate archivists, and the lessons that we learned along the way. There are many challenges when you embark on this journey, and hopefully we can help you through some of them.
  </p>
  <p><img src="https://annas-blog.org/party-guy.png"></p><h2>Community</h2>
  <p>
    The first challenge might be a surprising one. It is not a technical problem, or a legal problem. It is a psychological problem: doing this work in the shadows can be incredibly lonely. Depending on what you're planning to do, and your threat model, you might have to be very careful. On the one end of the spectrum we have people like Alexandra Elbakyan*, the founder of Sci-Hub, who is very open about her activities. But she is at high risk of being arrested if she would visit a western country at this point, and could face decades of prison time. Is that a risk you would be willing to take? We are at the other end of the spectrum; being very careful not to leave any trace, and having strong operational security.
  </p>
  <p>
    * As mentioned on HN by "ynno", Alexandra initially didn't want to be known: "Her servers were set up to emit detailed error messages from PHP, including full path of faulting source file, which was under directory /home/ringo-ring, which could be traced to a username she had online on an unrelated site, attached to her real name. Before this revelation, she was anonymous." So, use random usernames on the computers you use for this stuff, in case you misconfigure something.
  </p>
  <p>
    That secrecy, however, comes with a psychological cost. Most people love being recognized for the work that they do, and yet you cannot take any credit for this in real life. Even simple things can be challenging, like friends asking you what you have been up to (at some point "messing with my NAS / homelab" gets old).
  </p>
  <p>
    This is why it is so important to find some community. You can give up some operational security by confiding in some very close friends, who you know you can trust deeply. Even then be careful not to put anything in writing, in case they have to turn over their emails to the authorities, or if their devices are compromised in some other manner.
  </p>
  <p>
    Better still is to find some fellow pirates. If your close friends are interested in joining you, great! Otherwise, you might be able to find others online. Sadly this is still a niche community. So far we have found only a handful of others who are active in this space. Good starting places seem to be the Library Genesis forums, and r/DataHoarder. The Archive Team also has likeminded individuals, though they operate within the law (even if in some grey areas of the law). The traditional "warez" and pirating scenes also have folks who think in similar ways.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are open to ideas on how to foster community and explore ideas. Feel free to message us on Twitter or Reddit. Perhaps we could host some sort of forum or chat group. One challenge is that this can easily get censored when using common platforms, so we would have to host it ourselves. There is also a tradeoff between having these discussions fully public (more potential engagement) versus making it private (not letting potential "targets" know that we're about to scrape them). We'll have to think about that. Let us know if you are interested in this!
  </p>
  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <p>
    When we do a project, it has a couple of phases:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Domain selection / philosophy: Where do you roughly want to focus on, and why? What are your unique passions, skills, and circumstances that you can use to your benefit?</li>
    <li>Target selection: Which specific collection will you mirror?</li>
    <li>Metadata scraping: Cataloging information about the files, without actually downloading the (often much larger) files themselves.</li>
    <li>Data selection: Based on the metadata, narrowing down which data is most relevant to archive right now. Could be everything, but often there is a reasonable way to save space and bandwidth.</li>
    <li>Data scraping: Actually getting the data.</li>
    <li>Distribution: Packaging it up in torrents, announcing it somewhere, getting people to spread it.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    These are not completely independent phases, and often insights from a later phase send you back to an earlier phase. For example, during metadata scraping you might realize that the target that you selected has defensive mechanisms beyond your skill level (like IP blocks), so you go back and find a different target.
  </p>
  <h3>1. Domain selection / philosophy</h3>
  <p>
    There is no shortage of knowledge and cultural heritage to be saved, which can be overwhelming. That's why it's often useful to take a moment and think about what your contribution can be.
  </p>
  <p>
    Everyone has a different way of thinking about this, but here are some questions that you could ask yourself:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Why are you interested in this? What are you passionate about? If we can get a bunch of people who all archive the kinds of things that they specifically care about, that would cover a lot! You will know a lot more than the average person about your passion, like what is important data to save, what are the best collections and online communities, and so on.</li>
    <li>What skills do you have that you can use to your benefit? For example, if you are an online security expert, you can find ways of defeating IP blocks for secure targets. If you are great at organizing communities, then perhaps you can rally some people together around a goal. It is useful to know some programming though, if only for keeping good operational security throughout this process.</li>
    <li>How much time do you have for this? Our advice would be to start small and doing bigger projects as you get the hang of it, but it can get all-consuming.</li>
    <li>What would be a high-leverage area to focus on? If you're going to spend X hours on pirate archiving, then how can you get the biggest "bang for your buck"?</li>
    <li>What are unique ways that you are thinking about this? You might have some interesting ideas or approaches that others might have missed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In our case, we cared in particular about the long term preservation of science. We knew about Library Genesis, and how it was fully mirrored many times over using torrents. We loved that idea. Then one day, one of us tried to find some scientific textbooks on Library Genesis, but couldn't find them, bringing into doubt how complete it really was. We then searched those textbooks online, and found them in other places, which planted the seed for our project. Even before we knew about the Z-Library, we had the idea of not trying to collect all those books manually, but to focus on mirroring existing collections, and contributing them back to Library Genesis.
  </p>
  <h3>2. Target selection</h3>
  <p>
    So, we have our area that we are looking at, now which specific collection do we mirror? There are a couple of things that make for a good target:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Large</li>
    <li>Unique: not already well-covered by other projects.</li>
    <li>Accessible: does not use tons of layers of protection to prevent you from scraping their metadata and data.</li>
    <li>Special insight: you have some special information about this target, like you somehow have special access to this collection, or you figured out how to defeat their defenses. This is not required (our upcoming project does not do anything special), but it certainly helps!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    When we found our science textbooks on websites other than Library Genesis, we tried to figure out how they made their way onto the internet. We then found the Z-Library, and realized that while most books don't first make their appearance there, they do eventually end up there. We learned about its relationship to Library Genesis, and the (financial) incentive structure and superior user interface, both of which made it a much more complete collection. We then did some preliminary metadata and data scraping, and realized that we could get around their IP download limits, leveraging one of our members' special access to lots of proxy servers.
  </p>
  <p>
    As you're exploring different targets, it is already important to hide your tracks by using VPNs and throwaway email addresses, which we'll talk about more later.
  </p>
  <h3>3. Metadata scraping</h3>
  <p>
    Let's get a bit more technical here. For actually scraping the metadata from websites, we have kept things pretty simple. We use Python scripts, sometimes curl, and a MySQL database to store the results in. We haven't used any fancy scraping software which can map complex websites, since so far we only needed to scrape one or two kinds of pages by just enumerating through ids and parsing the HTML. If there aren't easily enumerated pages, then you might need a proper crawler that tries to find all pages.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before you start scraping a whole website, try doing it manually for a bit. Go through a few dozen pages yourself, to get a sense for how that works. Sometimes you will already run into IP blocks or other interesting behavior this way. The same goes for data scraping: before getting too deep into this target, make sure you can actually download its data effectively.
  </p>
  <p>
    To get around restrictions, there are a few things you can try. Are there any other IP addresses or servers that host the same data but do not have the same restrictions? Are there any API endpoints that do not have restrictions, while others do? At what rate of downloading does your IP get blocked, and for how long? Or are you not blocked but throttled down? What if you create a user account, how do things change then? Can you use HTTP/2 to keep connections open, and does that increase the rate at which you can request pages? Are there pages that list multiple files at once, and is the information listed there sufficient?
  </p>
  <p>
    Things you probably want to save include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Title</li>
    <li>Filename / location</li>
    <li>ID: can be some internal ID, but IDs like ISBN or DOI are useful too.</li>
    <li>Size: to calculate how much disk space you need.</li>
    <li>Hash (md5, sha1): to confirm that you downloaded the file properly.</li>
    <li>Date added/modified: so you can come back later and download files that you didn't download before (though you can often also use the ID or hash for this).</li>
    <li>Description, category, tags, authors, language, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We typically do this in two stages. First we download the raw HTML files, usually directly into MySQL (to avoid lots of small files, which we talk more about below). Then, in a separate step, we go through those HTML files and parse them into actual MySQL tables. This way you don't have to re-download everything from scratch if you discover a mistake in your parsing code, since you can just reprocess the HTML files with the new code. It's also often easier to parallelize the processing step, thus saving some time (and you can write the processing code while the scraping is running, instead of having to write both steps at once).
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, note that for some targets metadata scraping is all there is. There are some huge metadata collections out there that aren't properly preserved.
  </p>
  <h3>4. Data selection</h3>
  <p>
    Often you can use the metadata to figure out a reasonable subset of data to download. Even if you eventually want to download all the data, it can be useful to prioritize the most important items first, in case you get detected and defences are improved, or because you would need to buy more disks, or simply because something else comes up in your life before you can download everything.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, a collection might have multiple editions of the same underlying resource (like a book or a film), where one is marked as being the best quality. Saving those editions first would make a lot of sense. You might eventually want to save all editions, since in some cases the metadata might be tagged incorrectly, or there might be unknown tradeoffs between editions (for example, the "best edition" might be best in most ways but worse in other ways, like a film having a higher resolution but missing subtitles).
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also search your metadata database to find interesting things. What is the biggest file that is hosted, and why is it so big? What is the smallest file? Are there interesting or unexpected patterns when it comes to certain categories, languages, and so on? Are there duplicate or very similar titles? Are there patterns to when data was added, like one day in which many files were added at once? You can often learn a lot by looking at the dataset in different ways.
  </p>
  <p>
    In our case, we deduplicated Z-Library books against the md5 hashes in Library Genesis, thereby saving a lot of download time and disk space. This is a pretty unique situation though. In most cases there are no comprehensive databases of which files are already properly preserved by fellow pirates. This in itself is a huge opportunity for someone out there. It would be great to have a regularly updated overview of things like music and films that are already widely seeded on torrent websites, and are therefore lower priority to include in pirate mirrors.
  </p>
  <h3>5. Data scraping</h3>
  <p>
    Now you're ready to actually download the data in bulk. As mentioned before, at this point you should already manually have downloaded a bunch of files, to better understand the  behavior and restrictions of the target. However, there will still be surprises in store for you once you actually get to downloading lots of files at once.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our advice here is mainly to keep it simple. Start by just downloading a bunch of files. You can use Python, and then expand to multiple threads. But sometimes even simpler is to generate Bash files directly from the database, and then running multiple of them in multiple terminal windows to scale up. A quick technical trick worth mentioning here is using OUTFILE in MySQL, which you can write anywhere if you disable "secure_file_priv" in mysqld.cnf (and be sure to also disable/override AppArmor if you're on Linux).
  </p>
  <p>
    We store the data on simple hard disks. Start out with whatever you have, and expand slowly. It can be overwhelming to think about storing hundreds of TBs of data. If that is the situation that you're facing, just put out a good subset first, and in your announcement ask for help in storing the rest. If you do want to get more hard drives yourself, then r/DataHoarder has some good resources on getting good deals.
  </p>
  <p>
    Try not to worry too much about fancy filesystems. It is easy to fall into the rabbit hole of setting up things like ZFS. One technical detail to be aware of though, is that many filesystems don't deal well with lots of files. We've found that a simple workaround is to create multiple directories, e.g. for different ID ranges or hash prefixes.
  </p>
  <p>
    After downloading the data, be sure to check the integrity of the files using hashes in the metadata, if available.
  </p>
  <h3>6. Distribution</h3>
  <p>
    You have the data, thereby giving you possession of the world's first pirate mirror of your target (most likely). In many ways the hardest part is over, but the riskiest part is still ahead of you. After all, so far you've been stealth; flying under the radar. All you had to do was using a good VPN throughout, not filling in your personal details in any forms (duh), and perhaps using a special browser session (or even a different computer).
  </p>
  <p>
    Now you have to distribute the data. In our case we first wanted to contribute the books back to Library Genesis, but then quickly discovered the difficulties in that (fiction vs non-fiction sorting). So we decided on distribution using Library Genesis-style torrents. If you have the opportunity to contribute to an existing project, then that could save you a lot of time. However, there are not many well-organized pirate mirrors out there currently.
  </p>
  <p>
     So let's say you decide on distributing torrents yourself. Try to keep those files small, so they are easy to mirror on other websites. You will then have to seed the torrents yourself, while still staying anonymous. You can use a VPN (with or without port forwarding), or pay with tumbled Bitcoins for a Seedbox. If you don't know what some of those terms mean, you'll have a bunch of reading to do, since it's important that you understand the risk tradeoffs here.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can host the torrent files themselves on existing torrent websites. In our case, we chose to actually host a website, since we also wanted to spread our philosophy in a clear way. You can do this yourself in a similar manner (we use Njalla for our domains and hosting, paid for with tumbled Bitcoins), but also feel free to contact us to have us host your torrents. We are looking to build a comprehensive index of pirate mirrors over time, if this idea catches on.
  </p>
  <p>
    As for VPN selection, much has been written about this already, so we'll just repeat the general advice of choosing by reputation. Actual court-tested no-log policies with long track records of protecting privacy is the lowest risk option, in our opinion. Note that even when you do everything right, you can never get to zero risk. For example, when seeding your torrents, a highly motivated nation-state actor can probably look at incoming and outgoing data flows for VPN servers, and deduce who you are. Or you can just simply mess up somehow. We probably already have, and will again. Luckily, nation states don't care <em>that</em> much about piracy.
  </p>
  <p>
    One decision to make for each project, is whether to publish it using the same identity as before, or not. If you keep using the same name, then mistakes in operational security from earlier projects could come back to bite you. But publishing under different names means that you don't build a longer lasting reputation. We chose to have strong operational security from the start so we can keep using the same identity, but we won't hesitate to publish under a different name if we mess up or if the circumstances call for it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Getting the word out can be tricky. As we said, this is still a niche community. We originally posted on Reddit, but really got traction on Hacker News. For now our recommendation is to post it in a few places and see what happens. And again, contact us. We would love to spread the word of more pirate archivism efforts.
  </p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Hopefully this is helpful for newly starting pirate archivists. We're excited to welcome you to this world, so don't hesitate to reach out. Let's preserve as much of the world's knowledge and culture as we can, and mirror it far and wide.

<h2 data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Today, we’re releasing Answer.AI’s first project: a fully open source system that, for the first time, can efficiently train a 70b large language model on a regular desktop computer with two or more standard gaming GPUs (RTX 3090 or 4090). This system, which combines FSDP and QLoRA, is the result of a collaboration between Answer.AI, Tim Dettmers (U Washington), and Hugging Face’s Titus von Koeller and Sourab Mangrulkar.</p>
<p>This system will help the open source community release better models. Teknium, the creator of the extremely popular OpenHermes models and datasets, with over half a million downloads, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em>With this capability we can take huge models to new heights locally, and gigantic, hundreds of billions of parameter models are now accessible by small labs.</em>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At Answer.AI we made this our first project because it’s a key foundation of our north star: helping make useful AI available to everyone. Just being able to use <em>other</em> people’s models is not enough. We want everyone to be able to create their <em>own</em> personalized models, so that they are in control of their own AI systems.</p>
</section>
<section id="background">
<h2 data-anchor-id="background">Background</h2>
<section id="the-big-idea">
<h3 data-anchor-id="the-big-idea">The big idea</h3>
<p>There are two very different levels of hardware used to train deep learning models. There is the data center class hardware, such as H100s and A100s, costing <a href="https://shop.lambdalabs.com/deep-learning/servers/blade/customize">hundreds of thousands of dollars</a>. Then there are desktop computers containing gaming GPUs, such as dual 4090s, costing <a href="https://shop.lambdalabs.com/gpu-workstations/vector/customize">under $10,000</a> (and which can be assembled from 2nd hand parts for less than half the price of a pre-built system).</p>
<p>But here’s the key point: the gaming GPUs have similar performance to the data center GPUs that cost over 10x more! It would be great if we could use these 10x cheaper (but nearly as fast) cards to train large language models, but we can’t, because they have much less memory. The best currently available data center cards have 80GB RAM, whilst gaming cards max out at 24GB RAM. Since only the largest models produce the best results, creating the best models has been largely inaccessible to most people.</p>
<p>We realized that there’s actually no intrinsic reason for this. The super fast hardware is there, waiting to be used – we just need a way to feed it with the model and the data in a way that meets its memory constraints. The obvious question is: why hasn’t this been done then? All the big industry labs have the 10x more expensive hardware already, so they don’t really have the incentive to figure this out.</p>
<p>The big idea here is simple: figure out how to use these cheaper, lower-memory gaming GPUs to train the best available open source models. So the goal is this: train<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> a 70 billion parameter (70b) model using only gaming GPUs, which means our per-GPU memory will be at most 24GB. It’ll be a challenge, because each parameter normally takes 16 bits (2 bytes), so that’s 70*2=140GB to even store the weights – and that’s without including all the other data such as activations, gradients, and optimization state!</p>

<section id="why-this-project">
<h3 data-anchor-id="why-this-project">Why this project?</h3>
<p>Answer.AI is a very unusual type of organization – a for-profit R&amp;D lab closer in spirit to <a href="https://www.answer.ai/posts/2024-01-26-freaktakes-lessons.html">19th century electricity labs</a> than to today’s AI research groups. Figuring out how to make large model training inexpensive and accessible is just the kind of thing Eric Ries and Jeremy Howard hoped we’d be able to do when the organization was <a href="https://www.answer.ai/posts/2023-12-12-launch.html">launched at NeurIPS</a> last year.</p>
<p>Solving this problem is hard. It requires understanding many separate libraries (e.g bitsandbytes, PEFT, Transformers, Accelerate, and PyTorch), and computer science and math concepts (e.g discretization, distributed computing, GPU programming, linear algebra, SGD concepts such as gradient checkpointing), and how they all interact.</p>
<p>Academia is full of brilliant people that solve hard problems. But academia hasn’t solved this particular problem. That’s because it’s difficult for university researchers to justify spending time on this kind of work. Combining existing tools and techniques together isn’t generally considered “novel” enough to result in publication in a high impact journal, but that’s the currency that academics need. Furthermore, academics are generally expected to become highly specialized within their field, making it challenging to bring together so many pieces into a single solution.</p>
<p>And, of course, big tech companies are also full of brilliant people that solve hard problems. But this particular problem, training models with consumer GPUs, isn’t a problem they need to solve – they’ve already bought the big expensive GPUs! Many startups are also full of brilliant people that solve hard problems! But, as <a href="https://ltse.com/about/mission">Eric Ries explains</a>, “today’s financial market forces businesses to prioritize short-term gains over everything else”. It’s extremely hard for a startup to justify to investors why they’re spending their funds on open source software and public research.</p>
<p>Whilst academia, big tech, and startups had good reasons for not solving this problem, these are <a href="https://www.answer.ai/posts/2023-12-12-launch.html">the exact reasons</a> that this problem was a great fit for Answer.AI. Everyone who works at the company has built the kinds of systems that we had to work with on this problem, so we were able to understand how all the pieces fit together. People who love to both deeply understand the foundations of software and AI, and also love to hack at fun and interesting end-to-end systems are the kinds of people who are drawn to Answer.AI, and vice versa.</p>
<p>The problems we choose to solve together are selected by the same people that will do the solving. So we tend to pick up projects that involve bringing together multiple ideas together to create practically useful solutions. And because we’re a public benefit company with a charter to produce <em>long term</em> benefit from AI, open source software and public research are directly in line with our mission.</p>

<section id="qlora-train-bigger-models-on-a-single-gpu">
<h3 data-anchor-id="qlora-train-bigger-models-on-a-single-gpu">QLoRA: Train bigger models on a single GPU</h3>
<p>Two projects have been released recently that took the first critical steps towards making this a reality: QLoRA (by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314">Tim Dettmers et al</a>), and FSDP (by Meta’s <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/07/15/open-source/fsdp/">PyTorch team</a>).</p>
<p>QLoRA is a simple but brilliant combination of two critically important advances in modern neural networks: <em>quantization</em>, and <em>LoRA</em>. Quantization is a technique where, instead of using 16 or even 32 bits to store the weights of a neural network, 4 (or even fewer) bits are used. There are only 16 possible values of a 4 bit number, but <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09720">Dettmers and Zettlemoyer showed</a> that this can be enough in the large language models that are popular today. Tim Dettmers made these 4-bit “quantized” models easy to create, thanks to his bitsandbytes library, and recently Hugging Face has stepped in to help <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/bitsandbytes/main/en/index">maintain and document</a> this library, particularly thanks to the initiative of Titus von Koeller.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, once a model is quantized, it can not be trained any further with regular approaches – with just 16 possible values, the gradient descent method used for model training will observe zero gradients nearly everywhere, so it can’t make any updates to the quantized weights. This is a major problem, because it means that quantization can only be used for inference, not for continued pre-training or fine-tuning. Whilst inference is useful and important, it’s really just <em>consuming</em> models. But we want everybody to be able to <em>contribute</em> to <em>creating</em> models!</p>
<p>The trick to avoiding this limitation is to use <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685">LoRA</a> – “Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models”. LoRA doesn’t train the whole large language model at all, but instead adds “adaptors”, which are very small matrices (generally smaller than 1% of the full model) that are trained, whilst keeping the rest of the model constant. If you’ve played with models like Stable Diffusion, you will have probably seen these adapters many times; it’s how those models are generally shared, and why they are so small and fast to download.</p>
<p>Tim realized that LoRA can be combined with quantization: use a quantized base model, which is not changed at all by the training, and add trainable LoRA adaptors that are not quantized. This combination is <em>QLoRA</em>. Tim’s team was able to use this to, for the first time, train a model that (unquantized) is larger than the GPU: they trained a 65b model (which is 130GB unquantized) on a 48GB card.</p>
<p>Hugging Face stepped in once again here, creating the <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/peft">PEFT</a> library, which made LoRA training far simpler, and also integrating it directly with bitsandbytes to allow anyone to use QLoRA with just a few lines of code. The Hugging Face team has been working tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure that the open source community can use these technologies to train their models. If you’ve ever used Transformers to load a 4-bit model using a single function argument, then you’ve got them to thank (and even if you haven’t, you’ve almost certainly used the work of folks that have built their model with this ecosystem).</p>
<p>QLoRA didn’t quite slay the problem we set out to solve, to train a 70b model on 24GB cards, but it got closer than anything before. When quantized to 4 bits (which is 0.5 bytes), the 70b model takes 70/2 = 35 GB, which is larger than the 24GB gaming GPUs we want to use.</p>
<p>There are other limitations to QLoRA. A 48GB card is very expensive, and training a 65b model only just fits on such a card. That can be a problem, because we need to store lots of other things too, including the activations<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, gradients, and optimization state of the model during training. If there’s not much memory left over after loading the model weights, there’s not enough working memory to support training.</p>
<p>For instance, one of the benefits of language models is that we can use them to “chat” with, or understand, or analyze long documents or conversations. To make models that can handle long sequences like that, we need to show them examples of long sequences during training. The longest sequence used in training is called the “sequence length”. Trying to use anything but a short sequence length will cause an error when training a 65b QLoRA model on a 48GB card, because there isn’t enough memory to store all the information about the sequence; nearly all the memory is used just to store the model itself.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the model can only look at a single sequence at a time, it’s going to take a really long time to get through all the data in our training set. So instead we want to be able to “batch” a few sequences together at a time. The number of sequences included is the “batch size”. When there’s very little space left on the GPU after loading the model weights, we can only use very small batch sizes, resulting in extremely slow training.</p>
</section>
<section id="fsdp-scale-training-to-multiple-gpus">
<h3 data-anchor-id="fsdp-scale-training-to-multiple-gpus">FSDP: Scale training to multiple GPUs</h3>
<p>One obvious solution to the problem of the RAM limitations of a single consumer GPU, is to use more than one GPU! A very common approach in the open source community is to simply place a few layers of the model on each card. So then to train, you run the first few layers on the first GPU, then the next few on the second GPU, and so forth. For instance, a 70b (140GB) model could be spread over 8 24GB GPUs, using 17.5GB on each. There’s even a convenient setting in Hugging Face Transformers, <code>device_map=’auto’</code>, which you may well have used; that’s what this is actually doing behind the scenes. This does the job, but there’s a giant downside: only one GPU is ever active at a time, as all the others wait for their “turn”. That means that ⅞ of the compute is wasted.</p>
<p><em>Distributed Data Parallel</em> (DDP) was previously the gold standard approach to training models across multiple GPUs efficiently. This requires keeping the full model on each GPU – if you have a small model (e.g.&nbsp;a 2b model, which takes 4GB RAM) you can simply load the whole thing onto each GPU separately, and have each GPU then churn through training examples in parallel. So for instance, if you had 4 GPUs, that’s a 4x training speedup. But DDP doesn’t work if the model doesn’t fit onto a GPU, with enough room to spare for the data needed for the training process.</p>
<p>So we need something that can split a model across GPUs (like <code>device_map=’auto’</code>) and also use them in parallel (like DPP). This is where Meta’s <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/FSDP_tutorial.html">Fully Sharded Data Parallel</a> (FSDP) library comes in. It “shards” a large model, by splitting its parameters across multiple GPUs, allowing all the GPUs to be used simultaneously. When a layer of the neural network is calculated on a particular GPU during training, all the required shards are copied there. Then, the calculation is made, and finally the copied parts are deleted from that GPU. Whilst this sounds terribly inefficient, actually by being smart about copying the data of the next layer at the same time the current layer is busy calculating, it’s possible for this approach to result in no slowdown compared to DDP.</p>
<p>FSDP’s ability to bring the performance of DDP to models that are larger than any one GPU has been a revelation. For instance, a 70b (70 billion parameter) unquantized model takes 140GB of RAM (because each parameter is stored as 16 bits, which is 2 bytes), but even NVIDIA’s H100 card (which costs around $40,000 for a single card!) falls short of what’s needed, with its 80GB RAM. But with FSDP, four H100 GPUs can be combined for a total of 320GB RAM.</p>
<p>(Mind you, such a machine is going to set you back around $150,000…)</p>

<h2 data-anchor-id="bringing-fsdp-and-qlora-together">Bringing FSDP and QLoRA together</h2>
<p>At Answer.AI our north star is making useful AI more accessible. $150,000 to create your own high-quality personalized model definitely doesn’t count as accessible! So the first project we embarked on was to make it possible to use a desktop with consumer gaming GPUs to efficiently train a 70b model. We figured that if we could use QLoRA to reduce the size of a model by around 400% (so a 70b model would fit into 35GB RAM), and then we used FSDP to shard that across two or more 24GB consumer cards, that would leave enough RAM left over to train a model.</p>
<section id="first-steps">
<h3 data-anchor-id="first-steps">First steps</h3>
<p>Jeremy and Tim in late 2023 discussed the idea of bringing FSDP and QLoRA together. Tim connected Jeremy with Titus von Koeller, and Jeremy and Titus worked together to try, explore, understand, and document the issues that occurred when the two libraries were combined.</p>
<p>Answer.AI’s Johno Whitaker put together an important first step: a simple standalone test script which allowed us to more deeply understand the problem, and test solutions. A key breakthrough came in early 2024 when Answer.AI’s Benjamin Warner and Titus independently came up with a key idea: store the quantized parameters in a selectable data type, where that storage data type is the same data type as the “computation type” of the model<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Benjamin had this prototyped within 24 hours of developing the idea, but then we discovered another problem: FSDP was not copying the quantization information needed for each shard to use the model! That’s because FSDP is quite opinionated on the subset of data it will sync between GPUs<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. We realized that if we quantized the model on each GPU the missing metadata would remain untouched on all GPUs. Furthermore, we had to move the “quantization state” (the information necessary to (de)quantize the parameters) from the parameters into the layers, in order to ensure they were not removed when FSDP moved shards.</p>
<p>Once we had those issues resolved, we were able to successfully train our first batch of data with a quantized model using FSDP! Benjamin and Answer.AI’s Kerem Tugutlu were able to package this up with all the tests and refactoring needed into a <a href="https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes/pull/970">pull request</a> for bitsandbytes. We’re extremely grateful to the maintainers of the bitsandbytes project, who were very responsive in shepherding our PR through their processes.</p>
</section>
<section id="mission-accomplished-nearly">
<h3 data-anchor-id="mission-accomplished-nearly">Mission accomplished, nearly</h3>
<p>At this point, we once again figured that we’d have things tied up pretty quickly, and once again we under-estimated the complexity of the task! The first thing we realized was that it still wasn’t actually possible to load a quantized model that’s larger than a single GPU, since the loading and quantization process itself required the whole model to be put on one GPU.</p>
<p>Jeremy had spent a few weeks carefully studying Meta’s fantastic <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama-recipes">Llama-Recipes</a> project, which was the best complete FSDP fine tuning implementation he had found, and by closely tracking how it worked together with bitsandbytes, along with Hugging Face’s PEFT, Transformers, and Accelerate projects, he managed to construct a minimal standalone script which manually complete all the steps needed to fine tune a model.</p>
<p>Benjamin realized that with some tweaks it would be possible to do the loading and discretization one layer at a time, thus avoiding the need to ever have the whole model on a single GPU. He also figured out how to prevent the PEFT library from moving the quantization state to CPU. Kerem wrote a custom implementation of the LoRA algorithm so that it could work with Benjamin’s changes.</p>
<p>And with that, we were able to fine tune a 70b model on dual 3090 gaming GPUs for the first time!</p>
<p>To make this work, we were benefiting not just from FSDP and QLoRA, but also from a vast array of clever techniques developed over the last couple of years by the academic and open source communities. We used:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06174">Gradient checkpointing</a> (also known as activation checkpointing) to avoid storing full gradients, instead saving activations at a number of ‘checkpoints’ throughout the model and then re-computing gradients by re-running the forward computation step as needed</li>
<li><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/fsdp.html#torch.distributed.fsdp.CPUOffload">CPU offloading</a> to store weights in CPU RAM rather than on the GPU when they are not in use, drastically reducing the GPU memory required. This technique isn’t very useful to the “GPU rich” using H100 GPUs, which have highly optimized ways to pass weights to each other. But for our use case, it’s absolutely necessary, since gaming GPUs and motherboards don’t have these systems</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08691">Flash Attention 2</a> to efficiently calculate attention using a memory-optimized Cuda kernel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Making these work together with FSDP and QLoRA wasn’t always straightforward. For instance, when using CPU offloading, Benjamin discovered and fixed a problem in bitsandbytes. Each time an “offloaded” weight was copied back to the GPU, it was being automatically re-quantized, which effectively turning the pretrained model into random weights! We made a pull request to bitsandbytes that kept track of which parameters had already been quantized, so we could avoid the redundant computation.</p>
<p>After all this work, we were very pleased to see that we could train large models with consumer GPUs. Jeremy had run detailed benchmarking of the original llama-recipes across a range of GPU hardware, and Kerem developed a comprehensive benchmarking system for the new project. In comparing the two we realized that we were still not able to use the sequence lengths or batch sizes we’d hoped – for some reason more memory was being used than we expected.</p>
<p>When we looked closely, it turned out that it wasn’t due to our FSDP/QLoRA integration at all – but actually as we increased seqlen in bitsandbytes even without FSDP, the memory usage went up super-linearly, eventually resulting in even higher memory usage than without quantization! It turns out that we’re <a href="https://github.com/RahulSChand/gpu_poor/issues/1">not the first</a> people to discover this problem. We don’t have a bitsandbytes solution yet (but it’s being investigated), but it did lead us to an exciting discovery…</p>
</section>
<section id="discovering-hqq">
<h3 data-anchor-id="discovering-hqq">Discovering HQQ</h3>
<p>We love collaborating with like minded people, so when we saw the amazing work being done by Daniel Han on <a href="https://unsloth.ai/">Unsloth</a> we wanted to learn more, and see whether we might be able to help each other out. We asked Daniel if there were other interesting projects in this space that we should be watching, and he pointed us to <a href="https://mobiusml.github.io/hqq_blog/">HQQ</a>.</p>
<p>To explain HQQ, we’ll need to give a bit of background first… The 4-bit quantization done by bitsandbytes uses a simple, fast, and clever approach where each group of parameters is normalized to a consistent range, and then each parameter is placed in a bucket, where the bucket breakpoints are based on an assumption that the parameters are normally distributed. This has the benefit that quantization is nearly instant, but because real model parameters will not exactly fit the assumed distribution, accuracy can suffer.</p>
<p>Other approaches such as GPTQ and the more recent AWQ go in a different direction, where the quantization parameters are optimized based on the actual behavior of the model when representative data is passed to it.<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> These methods tend to produce more accurate models, potentially with even fewer than 4 bits per parameter; but they have the downside that the optimization process can take hours or even days for each model.</p>
<p>HQQ combines the best of both worlds. It is 50x faster to process a 70b model compared to GPTQ, yet is more accurate than it. Kerem decided to investigate whether HQQ would work well with FSDP.</p>
<p>He discovered that making HQQ and FSDP work well together took nearly the exact same steps as was required for bitsandbytes, and as result he had a complete working example completed within days. The <a href="https://www.mobiuslabs.com/">mobius.ml folks</a> couldn’t have been more responsive and helpful in ensuring that our PR was successfully merged – so we are now delighted to announce that FSDP works with HQQ too!</p>

<section id="how-to-use-fsdpqlora">
<h2 data-anchor-id="how-to-use-fsdpqlora">How to use FSDP/QLoRA</h2>
<p>To use FSDP, you will of course need more than one GPU. If you don’t have access to such a system, you can rent a dual 3090 box from the <a href="https://www.runpod.io/">Runpod Community Cloud</a> for around $0.60/hour. There are many other providers to choose from; <a href="https://cloud-gpus.com/">cloud-gpus</a> is a great place to see what’s on offer.</p>
<p>You’ll need to install the latest version of Transformers, PEFT, and bitsandbytes (and HQQ if you’re using that). Then, clone <a href="https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/fsdp_qlora/tree/main">our repo</a> and follow the README there. Running <code>python train.py --help</code> will show the available options. To train llama2-7b on the included alpaca dataset on two 24GB cards you might run:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>python train.py --train_type qlora --dataset alpaca --batch_size 8 --gradient_accumulation_steps 2 --output_dir qlora_output --log_to wandb</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ve crammed everything required into this single file to make it easier to see what is going on and modify things if necessary.</p>
<p>You should treat this script as an alpha/preview release. Whilst we’ve used it to successfully train a variety of practically useful models on a range of hardware, it’s still early days. If you’re not comfortable with testing and debugging models, we’d suggest holding off for a few months whilst the community more fully tests the approach.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-first-step">
<h2 data-anchor-id="a-first-step">A first step</h2>
<p>Originally we’d planned to show some benchmarks in this article, along with guidance based on the benchmark results about how to best take advantage of FSDP/QLoRA. However, we had to keep delaying posting this, because we kept making major improvements every few days! So we’ll follow up with a benchmarking and recommendations article in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>What we’ve shown here is just the first step. We have lots of ideas for improvements, and we’re sure that the open source community will have many other ideas we haven’t even thought of yet!</p>
<p>We hope that seeing this proof of concept, that it’s possible to scale resource-efficient QLoRA training across inexpensive gaming GPUs, will help bring more attention to the problem of bringing down the cost of model training. It’s in everyone’s interest to make AI more accessible – and to enable more people to not only consume, but also build, valuable models.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content-blocks"><div><p><img alt="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/07dd780d-2452-4bb6-b916-05bb0f28cbcf/email-banner.jpg?t=1704584495"></p></div><p> My first year of college, I sat in my dorm room staring at the shadow on the wall cast by the sun coming in through the window. I wouldn’t have internet for another year, and I didn’t have a TV, so I often had to come up with creative ways to entertain myself. </p><p> So I decided to turn my dorm room into a sundial clock, using the shadow on the wall to tell the time. Every hour, I marked on the wall with a pencil where the shadow was. But I very quickly realized that this was not going to work as well as I hoped. </p><p> For one thing, my dorm window faced due West, which meant it didn’t even get sunlight for half the day. For another thing, it occurred to me that as the seasons change and the days get longer or shorter, the shadow would be in a different place each day until it was no longer even remotely accurate — at least until the same day the following year. </p><p> That’s when I realized that sundials suck. </p><p> Even a properly calibrated sundial that aligns with the Earth’s tilt will still be 14 minutes ahead part of the year and 16 minutes behind later. So they depend on the user referring to something called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_time?utm_source=ironicsans.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=the-life-and-death-of-the-bulbdial-clock" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Equation of Time</a> to convert sundial time to actual time. </p><p> And they still won’t work on a cloudy day. </p><p> And if you live in the southern hemisphere, they run backwards. </p><p> In 2008, I came up with a solution to this problem. I <a href="https://www.ironicsans.com/2008/03/idea_the_bulbdial_clock.html?utm_source=ironicsans.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=the-life-and-death-of-the-bulbdial-clock" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">wrote on my blog</a> about an idea I called “The Bulbdial Clock”: </p><p><img alt="" src="https://www.ironicsans.com/images/bulbdial.jpg"></p><div><p>The Bulbdial Clock has no hands — just one pole in the center of the clock, and three light sources of varying heights which revolve around the pole casting shadows. In the model illustrated above, the light sources are each attached to a ring which rotates around the pole. The innermost ring rotates once per minute, casting a “second hand” shadow. The middle ring rotates once per hour, and casts the “minute hand” shadow. And the outer ring rotates once every 12 hours, casting the “little hand” shadow.</p><p>The Bulbdial Clock can be used flat like a traditional sundial, or mounted vertically on a wall. A variation on the design intended for large-scale installation (such as in a museum) involves a pole sticking up in the middle of a room, while the light sources are mounted on the ceiling, shining down on the pole as they rotate around it.</p><p>The Bulbdial Clock solves most of the sundial’s problems, but it still has a problem of its own: It doesn’t work in bright light. So the Bulbdial Clock is best suited for dim spaces such as restaurants and nightclubs.</p></div><p> I wrote a lot of “idea” posts back then, and my blog had active commenters who frequently used them as a <a href="https://www.ironicsans.com/you_made_it/?utm_source=ironicsans.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=the-life-and-death-of-the-bulbdial-clock" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">jumping off point</a> to imagine how they might be even better. I loved that. Sometimes I even held back some of my own thoughts in the hopes that someone else would have the same thought and chime in — a subtle way of fostering conversation in the comments. </p><p> Some of the thoughts I held back for this were: What if instead of being white lights, they were red, green, and blue? Then you would get all the primary and secondary colors where the lights overlap, and white in the middle! That would be cool. And if three rotating lights were too complex to build, it could be a ring of lights that turn on and off so there are no moving parts. </p><p> Sure enough, the post had barely been up for an hour before someone named Windell Oskey left <a href="https://www.ironicsans.com/2008/03/idea_the_bulbdial_clock.html?utm_source=ironicsans.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=the-life-and-death-of-the-bulbdial-clock#comment-276015" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">this comment</a>: </p><div><p>If you used three rings of 60 LEDs each, you could just light up one LED in each of the rings, making it so that you could build this without even using any motors.</p><p>I think that I could build this in about an hour. :)</p></div><p> What I didn’t know at the time is that Windell Oskey was <i>exactly</i> the kind of person who <i>would</i> make something like this. He and his wife Lenore ran a business called Evil Mad Scientist which sold electronic kits for projects people could build themselves. </p><p> Exactly one year later to the day after my post, <a href="https://www.evilmadscientist.com/2009/a-bulbdial-clock/?utm_source=ironicsans.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=the-life-and-death-of-the-bulbdial-clock" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Windell shared</a> on the Evil Mad Scientist website that he had built a working prototype using red, green and blue LEDs: </p><p><img alt="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/111dd296-a214-40e6-91f1-f4f3cef3fcd4/prototype.jpg?t=1709388071"></p><p> And he sent me an email about it which said in part: </p><div><p>We have also toyed with the idea of making a small kit version of our project-- we make soldering kits. Just say the word and we won't touch it, but I suspect that it might work out nicely if we were to sell a few tens or hundeds of kits and send you a small royalty from each.</p></div><p> I was thrilled by the idea of the Bulbdial Clock being something people could buy and build! And a royalty? I’ll take it! </p><p> A quick aside: In the United States, from the time an idea for an invention is publicly disclosed, the inventor has exactly one year to file a patent (or at least a provisional patent which lets you say there’s a “patent pending”). After that grace period, they lose out on any exclusive rights to their invention. </p><p> I had no intention of patenting the Bulbdial Clock, but I mention this because there was no legal reason why Windell owed me a royalty. In fact, Evil Mad Scientist projects were all open source, so anyone could make and learn from them without paying a cent. A royalty was their very kind way of recognizing my idea, and I hugely appreciated it. </p><p> (It’s also worth noting that if I ever did file a patent application, it may have been invalidated by prior art.

<h2>Introduction</h2>









<p>Sine, one of the fundamental trigonometric functions, plays a crucial role in various fields, including mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science. Its calculation is not trivial, especially when it comes to implementing it in electronic calculators, where efficiency and accuracy are paramount.</p>



<p>In previous entries of the series, we looked into <a href="https://androidcalculator.com/how-do-calculators-solve-equations">how calculators solve equations</a> and <a href="https://androidcalculator.com/how-does-a-calculator-computes-square-roots">how they calculate square roots</a>. In this blog post, we’ll delve into the intricate process of calculating the sine function, starting from simple approximations to more sophisticated methods.</p>



<h2>How sine is calculated</h2>



<p>To begin, let’s inspect the plot of the sine function:</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://androidcalculator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/sin-2.svg"><img src="https://androidcalculator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/sin-2.svg" alt="" width="538" height="195"></a></figure></div>



<p>It is immediately obvious, that the function is periodic, and has a strong symmetry of the interval between 0 and $\pi/2$:</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://androidcalculator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/sin_period.svg"><img src="https://androidcalculator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/sin_period.svg" alt="" width="538" height="195"></a></figure></div>



<p>In other words, it is enough to calculate the function on the interval $[0;\pi/2]$. Then, we can just use flipping and negation to get the final value. To calculate $\sin(x)$ within the reduced interval, one option is to use the well-known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series">Taylor series</a> approximation:<br>$$\sin(x) = x-\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^5}{5!}-\ldots$$Visualized:</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://androidcalculator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/taylor.svg"><img src="https://androidcalculator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/taylor.svg" alt="" width="538" height="195"></a><figcaption>The sine function and its Taylor series up to the ninth degree</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>While this method is simple, we need to calculate very high exponentials, and the approximation errors can get quite large around $\pi/2$. For example, with a nine-degree approximation, the result at $ \pi/2 $ would be 1.00000354258428. This is an error of 3e-6, which is quite bad, since most calculations are done to 15 digits precision. In other words, that’s a loss of precision around 10 digits!</p>



<h2>How sine is really calculated</h2>



<p>While the method presented in the previous paragraph is quite bad, it does serve as a blueprint for better methods. Essentially, every implementation of sine uses the following three steps:</p>



<ol>
<li>
<strong>Reduction:</strong> Using some algebraic tricks, reduce $x$ to a small number $r$.</li>
<li>
<strong>Approximation:</strong> Calculate the value of $\sin(r)$ using an approximation method, such as the Taylor series.</li>
<li>
<strong>Reconstruction:</strong> Calculate the final value of $\sin(x)$ based on $\sin(r)$.</li>
</ol>



<p>There are many ways to approach this problem. In the following , I present what Intel uses in their processors, based on their <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/papers/itj.pdf">paper</a>. They start with the formula<br>$$r = x-N\frac{\pi}{16}.$$ Here, $N$ is the integer chosen such that $|r|$ is minimized. In other words, we approximate $x$ by $N\cdot\frac{\pi}{16}$, and $r$ is the approximation error. How can we use this? Using the identities of the sum of arguments:</p>



<p>$$\displaylines{\sin(x)=\sin\left(r+N\frac{\pi}{16}\right)=\sin\left(N\frac{\pi}{16}\right)\cos(r)+\cos\left(N\frac{\pi}{16}\right)\sin(r)=\\=\sin\left(\frac{N}{32}2\pi\right)\cos(r)+\cos\left(\frac{N}{32}2\pi\right)\sin(r)}$$</p>



<p>We have to calculate $\sin(r)$ and $\cos(r)$ – this is the approximation step, more on this later. For now, assume we know both $\sin(r)$ and $\cos(r)$. We still have to find the sine and cosine of $\frac{N}{32}2\pi$. Notice, that both $\sin$ and $\cos$ are periodic by $2\pi$, so we only really have to calculate $N$ for $N=0,1,2,\ldots,31$. These are 32 values in total, we can easily precompute them. During the calculation of the final value, we just have to look up them up from a list, which is quite efficient.</p>



<p>Only one piece of the puzzle remains: how to calculate $\sin(r)$? In the paper, Intel does not publish the exact polynomial but they do mention that they use minimax approximation. This approximation finds a polynomial that minimizes the maximum error over an interval:<br>$$\max_{0\le r&lt;\frac{\pi}{16}}|p(r)-\sin(r)|,$$ where $p$ is the approximating polynomial. One way to calculate $p$ is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remez_algorithm">Remez’s algorithm</a>. The results might look like this:$$x -0.166667x^3 + 0.00833x^5 -0.00019x^7 + 2.6019\cdot10^{-6}x^9.$$The maximum error of this polynomial is $4.1\cdot10^{-9}$, which is a thousand times better than the original Taylor-approximation!</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>In conclusion, calculating sine in computers involves a combination of reduction, approximation, and reconstruction steps. From simple reduction and Taylor series to more precise methods like minimax approximation, computers employ various techniques to compute sine efficiently while maintaining acceptable levels of accuracy. Understanding these methods sheds light on the underlying mathematics that power computational tools and simulations in numerous fields.</p>

            <h2>What is the Pile?</h2>
            <p>
              The Pile is a <span>825 GiB</span> diverse, open
              source language modelling data set that consists of 22 smaller,
              high-quality datasets combined together.

            <h2>Why is the Pile a good training set?</h2>
            <p>
              Recent work has shown that especially for large models, diversity
              in data sources improves general cross-domain knowledge of the
              model, as well as downstream generalization capability. In our
              evaluations, not only do models trained on the Pile show moderate
              improvements in traditional language modeling benchmarks, they
              also show significant improvements on Pile BPB.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Why is the Pile a good benchmark?</h2>
            <p>
              To score well on Pile BPB (bits per byte), a model must be able to
              understand many disparate domains including books, github
              repositories, webpages, chat logs, and medical, physics, math,
              computer science, and philosophy papers. Pile BPB is a measure of
              world knowledge and reasoning ability in these domains, making it
              a robust benchmark of general, cross-domain text modeling ability
              for large language models.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="storywrap-433747">


<h3>from the <i>behold-our-self-immolation</i> dept</h3>

<p>When last we checked in with Hewlett Packard (HP), the company&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/01/11/hp-hit-with-yet-another-lawsuit-over-bricking-printers-that-use-third-party-ink-cartridges/">had just been sued</a>&nbsp;(for the second time) for crippling customer printers if owners attempt to use cheaper, third-party printer cartridges. It was just the latest in a long saga where printer manufacturers use DRM or dodgy software updates to wage all out war on consumer choice.</p>
<p>There hasn’t been a whole lot of introspection going on at the company since. Shortly after the lawsuit HP CEO Enrique Lores&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPRMyQSZGuY">went on CNBC</a>&nbsp;to double down on the company’s position. First by making up claims that HP <strong>has</strong> to be obnoxious about cartridges to protect consumer security (false), then by basically stating that any consumer who intelligently shops for cartridges is a “bad investment.” </p>
<p>This week HP unveiled its latest plan on this track: printing as a service. The company’s new “<a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/all-in-plan/printers.html">All-In Plan</a>” requires that you pay anywhere from $7 a month to $36 a month to rent a printer with a set printable page limit. During your rental, HP sends you, of course, their ink cartridges. </p>
<p>As Ars Technica notes, the printer must remain connected to the internet for monitoring. And the company’s <a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/privacy/privacy.html?jumpid=in_R11928_%2Fus%2Fen%2Fcorp%2Fprivacy-central%2Fprivacy-statements&amp;utm_medium=af&amp;utm_source=aw&amp;utm_campaign=Skimlinks&amp;utm_content=78888_Skimlinks_">privacy policy</a> effectively gives HP full control over, well, everything: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Subject to the terms of this Agreement, You hereby grant to HP a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right to use, copy, store, transmit, modify, create derivative works of and display Your non-personal data for its business purposes..”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And of course the subscription comes with long term contracts and early termination fees should you not subscribe for the full two-year term. All told, the tone-deafness is fairly stunning. </p>
<p>Paying for the same several-hundred dollar printer for all eternity is precisely the sort of concept Lores has been pushing for a while. The problem is it’s not clear that anybody <em>actually wants this</em>. It’s also not really clear that paying up to $36 for a printer you never really own makes much value sense. Printers inherently aren’t that expensive. And ink isn’t either, if companies aren’t being restrictive tyrants. </p>
<p>For HP, none of that matters. Lores isn’t thinking about building quality products or building solid relationships. He’s thinking exclusively of finding creative ways to goose profits and deliver Wall Street improved quarterly returns <strong>at any cost</strong>. You can’t do that by simply providing users a quality, affordable product people like; you inevitably have to start cutting corners and nickel-and-diming users. </p>
<p>Once they’ve established renting a printer as a norm, they’ll just steadily jack the rental price skyward as they make the underlying value proposition steadily worse. Ultimately the business becomes less and less about making popular quality products, and more and more about making unnecessarily convoluted subscriptions with creative restrictions and ever-skyrocketing monthly prices. </p>

Demand will increase because AI will help people </span><a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-emea/marketing-strategies/automation/how-ai-helps-marketers/" rel="">target ads better</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Almost no one is talking about the massive threat AI poses to the </span><strong>supply side</strong><span> of the online ads business over the next 10 years.</span></p><p><span>Google, Facebook and TikTok make $383bn in ad revenue between them (2023). The whole adtech industry is worth </span><a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/adtech-market-report#:~:text=The%20global%20AdTech%20market%20size%20was%20estimated%20at%20USD%20886.19,USD%202%2C422.35%20billion%20by%202030." rel="">$1 trillion</a><span> a year. But four words could wipe this revenue out:</span></p><p>“AI, no ads please.”</p><p>(Three, if you’re rude to your AI.)</p><p>Availability of inventory underpins the entire adtech industry: the amount of advertising space platforms have for sale.</p><p>What is this inventory? Nothing more than our attention, sold by Big Tech via the pixels and speakers of our devices.</p><p><span>The size of this inventory, and therefore the $1 trillion figure, is directly related to </span><strong>how much time all 8 billion humans give to ads every day</strong><span>.</span></p><p>How do 8 billion humans consume so many ads every day that we create inventory for a $1 trillion industry?</p><p>Well, people want great content. So the platforms that provide it make sure that ads are positioned between, around, before, after and inside the great content. You’re going to see ads whether you like it or not.</p><p><span>But that’s strange, when you think about it. It’s a wholesale infiltration. Most of the content we consume is via our own devices. We own the pixels and speakers of our devices (even if Apple </span><a href="https://12challenges.substack.com/p/help-me-stop-the-eu-bullying-apple" rel="">disagrees</a><span>). Why are they betraying us — allowing Big Tech to use them to position ads wherever they like?</span></p><p>It’s complicated. The betrayal is propped up by many pillars: technical complexity, a lack of regulation, interoperability and therefore competition, Big Tech’s lawyers, the surveillance capitalism business model, and a huge gap in resources between ad platforms and those opposed to them.</p><p>Now AI is making those pillars unstable. AI has the potential to undo the betrayal and lay waste to ad inventory. And before you roll your eyes, I’m not spinning a David vs. Goliath yarn. This is not about underdog developers creating the next generation of AI-powered adblockers.</p><p>This is more like Goliath vs. Goliath: Apple, Microsoft, and OpenAI on the one side, Meta and Alphabet on the other.</p><p>As I’ve started diving into this, many questions have come up. So many questions that I’m listing them below to not go crazy. Because the AI vs. ads scenario is so complex, I’ve decided to write about it in a series of articles, instead of addressing all questions at once.</p><p>But I’ll answer just one question right away: huh, really?</p><p><span>Will AI </span><em>really</em><span> destroy a $1tn industry?</span></p><p><span>Not necessarily. Plenty of things could stop this scenario playing out. But I do think it’s </span><em>plausible</em><span>. And even just a plausible AI vs. ads scenario is a huge threat to Meta and Alphabet, both riding high at (or near) their record valuations. It’s a scenario that, even in its weakest form, could wipe out $100bns of their value. Even if it’s just </span><em>1% likely</em><span> — it’s still worth thinking about.</span></p><p><span>But I think it’s much more likely than that. And as a </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-bans-unfollow-everything-developer-delete-news-feed-2021-10?r=US&amp;IR=T" rel="">completely impartial third party</a><span>, I’m happy to have a crack at that thinking.</span></p><p><span>That’s what I’ll be doing in the coming weeks and months.</span><strong> </strong><span>Make sure you subscribe to catch the whole AI vs. ads series:</span></p><p><em>Here are the questions I mentioned. I’ve gone ahead and ad libbed a few answers as starting points, but I’ll be diving far deeper. Your thoughts are very welcome.</em></p><p><strong>How will AI reduce the ads we see?</strong></p><p><span>By giving us the content we want, and nothing more. This is already happening — look at ChatGPT and </span><a href="https://arc.net/" rel="">Arc</a><span>. But the exact mechanics need spelling out.</span></p><p><strong>Which actual AI feature or product will reduce the ads we see?</strong></p><p>A few, but AI operating systems (OSes) in particular.</p><p><strong>What is an AI OS?</strong></p><p>I’ll be defining this more precisely in the series, but something like:</p><p>An OS which uses AI to enhance existing human inputs (e.g. voice), and which allows those inputs to control some/all software installed on the OS.</p><p><strong>Why not just talk about chatbots, agents, etc.?</strong></p><p>AI will be a primary way we’re going to operate computer systems. Hence, it makes sense to talk about AI OSes. It feels like the natural unit of analysis to consider the primary role that AI will have in computing’s future.</p><p><strong><span>Aren’t AI OSes going to cause the </span><a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=7266" rel="">paperclipalypse</a><span> or something even worse?</span></strong></p><p>Maybe, but that’s out of scope for this series. Humanity going extinct isn’t that big of a deal compared to Meta experiencing a decline in its revenue.</p><p><strong>Any more questions about AI OSes?</strong></p><p><span>Hm, just a few. How do AI OSes relate to a chatbot like ChatGPT, or a device like the Humane AI Pin? Which existing technologies already look like AI OSes? (Quite a few, not least ChatGPT and </span><a href="https://arc.net/" rel="">Arc</a><span>.)</span></p><p>What would an AI OS look like precisely? How will we interact with AI OSes? What is the mechanism by which human intention turns into action in existing OSes, and how does this compare to AI OSes?</p><p>What are the ways AI OSes will reduce ad consumption? Will ad reduction be a deliberate intention of the user, or just a side-product of how AI OSes give information?</p><p><span>What is </span><a href="https://louisbarclay.medium.com/why-i-made-an-app-called-go-away-and-why-we-need-more-software-like-it-357ceb8860ce" rel="">nudgeware</a><span>, and how do AI OSes link to it?</span></p><p>Will AI OSes be able to control all the software on your device? If so, how? Isn’t there a ton of thinking on this already? (Yes, and I’m reading through as much as I can find.)</p><p><strong>Who will be the winners and the losers of AI vs. ads?</strong></p><p>Winners: hopefully the consumer, as well as OpenAI, Microsoft, and maybe Apple.</p><p>Losers: Meta, Alphabet, TikTok.</p><p><strong>Why would OpenAI, Microsoft and Apple want to reduce the ads we see?</strong></p><p><span>They won’t, necessarily. But OpenAI </span><em>have </em><span>established a model where people are happy to pay a monthly subscription to get precisely the content they want, and nothing more. That paradigm shift in consumers being socialized to pay for information directly (rather than through ads) is a big part of the danger for Meta and Alphabet. More thinking through the plans and incentives of these players is needed.</span></p><p><strong>Does the AI vs. ads scenario depend on the actions of OpenAI, Microsoft and Apple?</strong></p><p>No, I don’t think so. I believe there will be a race to create the best AI OS, and in most versions of that race, ads lose.</p><p><strong>How is AI making those pillars of the ad industry you talked about unstable?</strong></p><p>That’s a big one, related to a bunch of questions above, and I’m not going to try answer it here.</p><p><strong>How does AI relate to other sources of pillar instability, e.g. regulation?</strong></p><p>C’mon, I have plans this evening.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>turns out, you can even search for them with powerful search engines!</em></p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Popular malware/url analysis tools like <a href="https://urlscan.io/">urlscan.io</a>, <a href="https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/">Hybrid Analysis</a> and <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/scan">Cloudflare radar url scanner</a> store a large number of links for intelligence gathering and sharing. It is however not so widely known that these services also store a large amount of <strong>private</strong> and <strong>sensitive</strong> links, thanks to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sensitive links mistakenly submitted by users for scanning unaware that these are public information</li>
  <li>Misconfigured scanners and extensions submitting private links scanned from emails as public data</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="so-what-are-all-these-links-you-refer-to">So what are all these links you refer to?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Files shared using cloud storage tools (e.g. <code>Dropbox</code>, <code>iCLoud</code>, <code>Sync</code>, <code>Egnyte</code>, <code>Ionos Hidrive</code>, <code>AWS S3</code>)</li>
  <li>Cloud connected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage">NAS</a> tools (e.g. <code>Western Digital Mycloud</code>)</li>
  <li>Corporate communication (e.g. <code>Slido</code>, <code>Zoom</code>, <code>Onedrive</code>, <code>Airtable</code>)</li>
  <li>Password reset links, Oauth sign-in links</li>
</ul>

<p>All these have one thing in common, the way they are so widely used allows anyone to access their services using a single private link containing random identifiers to ensure security of the links. Sometimes, they can be protected further using a password or passphrase, in those cases just having access to the links does not result in data exposure.</p>

<p>Some screenshots I grabbed from urlscan.io before they were filtered out after I reached out to them (they were quick to respond):</p>

<p><img src="https://vin01.github.io/piptagole/assets/mycloud.png" alt="Western digital mycloud">
<img src="https://vin01.github.io/piptagole/assets/egnyte.png" alt="Egnyte">
<img src="https://vin01.github.io/piptagole/assets/s3.png" alt="AWS S3"></p>

<p>A lot of these submissions came from <a href="https://urlscan.io/search/#task.tags:%22falconsandbox%22">falconsandbox</a> as shown in tags by urlscan.io, so I broadened my analysis to include Hybrid Analysis (<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/payload-security">owned by Crowdstrike</a>) as well.</p>

<p><img src="https://vin01.github.io/piptagole/assets/ha_icloud.png" alt="iCloud"></p>

<p><img src="https://vin01.github.io/piptagole/assets/ha_google_photos.png" alt="Google Photos"></p>

<p><img src="https://vin01.github.io/piptagole/assets/google_drive.png" alt="Google Drive"></p>

<p>Another new tool with potential to become more widely used and already containing some private links as public data is <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Radar</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://vin01.github.io/piptagole/assets/cloudflare.png" alt="Cloudflare google photos">
<img src="https://vin01.github.io/piptagole/assets/cf1.png" alt="Cloudflare link">
<img src="https://vin01.github.io/piptagole/assets/cf2.png" alt="Cloudflare invoices"></p>

<p>Some broad categories of sensitive content I came across:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Private files including tax documents, invoices, photos, business communications</li>
  <li>Shared secrets using <a href="https://onetimesecret.com/">onetimesecret</a></li>
  <li>Smart home device recordings</li>
  <li>Meeting recordings stored in the cloud</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://vin01.github.io/piptagole/assets/data.png" alt="Leaks"></p>

<h2 id="who-is-responsible">Who is responsible?</h2>

<p>Now that is a tough one to answer. From <a href="https://hybrid-analysis.com/terms">terms and conditions of use</a> from Hybrid Analysis:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hybrid Analysis analyses, publishes, and shares Submitted Content from users as part of providing a cybersecurity community resource and is not responsible for the content or information which may incidentally appear in such submissions or be included in automatically-generated reports.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From urlscan.io:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You specifically acknowledge that urlscan shall not be liable for any user content or conduct.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your account.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As such, there does not seem to be any mechanism in place to review the existing content and flag/remove potentially sensitive links. Implementing it in an automated fashion might also not be trivial.</p>

<p>As a security researcher, it is also hard to figure out the source of these links. I came across this <a href="https://positive.security/blog/urlscan-data-leaks">wonderful analysis by Positive Security</a> who focused on urlscan.io and used canary tokens to detect potential automated sources (security tools scanning emails for potentially malicious oinks), and also reached out via email to users. I was able to validate this behavior using canary links as well.</p>

<h2 id="we-are-threat-hunters-all-your-links-are-belong-to-us">We are Threat hunters! All your links are belong to us!</h2>

<p><a href="https://urlscan.io/pricing/urlscanpro/">urlscan Pro</a> allows access for paid users/companies to a broader category of scans, including not just <code>Public</code> but also <code>Unlisted</code> scans.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unlisted means that the scan will not be visible on the public page or search results, but will be visible to customers of the urlscan Pro platform. We only admit customers to urlscan Pro which are either vetted security researchers or reputable corporations. <a href="https://urlscan.io/blog/2022/07/27/scan-visibility-best-practices/">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://github.com/TheHive-Project/Cortex/blob/master/README.md">Cortex-Analyzers</a> from <a href="https://thehive-project.org/">TheHive</a> is an example I would like to outline.</p>

<p>It explicitly uses <code>public</code>:<code>on</code> configuration for scans in urlscan.io analyzer, making the links appear as <code>unlisted</code> even if an account’s visibility in urlscan is set to Private. These can then easily be accessed by urlscan pro users and platforms based on that information.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/TheHive-Project/Cortex-Analyzers/blob/master/analyzers/Urlscan.io/urlscan.py#L28">https://github.com/TheHive-Project/Cortex-Analyzers/blob/master/analyzers/Urlscan.io/urlscan.py#L28</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I would expect much more sensitive information to be prone to leaks in this manner, although the data is not public but only visible to urlscan pro users. I hope they vet the users carefully.</p>

<p>Counts for scans in each category from <code>urlscan.io</code> for last 24 hours:</p>

<ul>
  <li>398563 <code>Public</code></li>
  <li>328147 <code>Unlisred</code></li>
  <li>955432 <code>Private</code></li>
</ul>

<p>I used canary tokens to establish:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A link submitted to <code>urlscan.io</code> as <code>unlisted</code>, was accessed 12 times within 1 hour of submission</li>
  <li>A link submitted to <code>hybrid-analysis.com</code> via the <code>API</code> (not through the browser with explicit warning of them being <code>public</code> content), was accessed 10 times within 1 hour of submission</li>
  <li>Some IP addresses accessed both unique links submitted to these services simulataneously and use source IP anonymization services.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://vin01.github.io/piptagole/assets/threat_hunter_ips.txt">a list of these IP addresses is here</a></p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-sensitive-links-removed">How to get sensitive links removed?</h2>

<p>Urlscan and Hybrid Analysis allow flagging the links to get them removed.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://urlscan.io/docs/faq/">https://urlscan.io/docs/faq/</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/knowledge-base/removing-uploaded-sensitive-files">https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/knowledge-base/removing-uploaded-sensitive-files</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For Hybrid Analysis, it is a bit more complex. Quoting from their knowledge base link above:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All files submitted to the public Sandbox at https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/ will be searchable and available to the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even if the checkbox “Do not share my sample with the community” is checked, the screenshots and actual report will still be made available. The “do not share” portion only applies to the actual input sample.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This does leave me with mixed feelings. I am quite sure that this problem is here to stay. Perhaps a default of “keep the scans private” would work best, but would defeat the purpose of most of threat intelligence and analysis sharing practices in security community. Be mindful of scan visibility while using these services.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, bounty hunters are using this already to report leaked data to companies directly ;) Hell, one of my submissions to a notable payment processing company even turned out to be a “Duplicate”, so I am definitely not the first one to notice this in the wild.</p>

<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>

<p>If you choose to access some of these links/files from url databases, please be wary of actual malicious files and links. Some of these are just phishing attempts and may contain actual malware. Please use a sandbox environment.</p>

The American Telephone and Telegraph company had been established as a legal, nation-wide monopoly in the USA via the Kingsbury Commitment in late 1913. This position was further cemented during World War I when the United States’ federal government nationalized the phone system. Following the end of the war, the phone system went back into the hands of AT&amp;T and the company achieved some rather remarkable regulatory capture with the Willis Graham Act of 1921 and the Communications Act of 1934. This complicated legal history presented a very serious question to AT&amp;T’s legal department when people began asking for UNIX: were computer operating systems part of the common carrier services of the phone company and therefore required to be distributed? If they were not, then the company needn’t distribute UNIX at all, but if they were indeed, then it was only a matter of time before the FCC would force AT&amp;T to distribute UNIX. In the end, the decision was made to distribute UNIX to universities and research centers at the cost of the media plus shipping. Somehow, quite magically, this resulted in a nice round number of $150.00 (or around $927 in 2024) for Katholieke Universiteit in Nijmegen, The Netherlands in December of 1974. There are some rather important points within the license that Katholieke was granted. Licensees were granted source code for the operating system as computer systems of the day weren’t standardized in any meaningful way. The license then granted free use and modification within the university, but disallowed any spread outside. Specifically, the license mentioned that employees and students had access.</p><div data-component-name="FileToDOM"><div><p><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Fattachment_icon.svg"></p><div><p>UNIX license from Western Electric to Katholieke</p><p>438KB ∙ PDF file</p></div><p><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/api/v1/file/ea99ff77-8f06-4c00-ae95-2a1f60410a44.pdf" rel=""><span>Download</span></a></p></div><p>UNIX license from Western Electric to Katholieke</p><p><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/api/v1/file/ea99ff77-8f06-4c00-ae95-2a1f60410a44.pdf" rel=""><span>Download</span></a></p></div><p><span> At this point in the computer industry, user groups were somewhat common. IBM had </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-history-of-gm-naa-io-and-share" rel="">SHARE</a><span>, and that had inspired similar groups around DEC, Burroughs, Rand, and so on. It was therefore somewhat natural that a group would form around UNIX. Thus, Mel Ferentz and Lou Katz organized a meeting of UNIX users in New York on the 15th of May in 1974. Around twenty people were in attendance, and by this time there were just over thirty UNIX installations outside of AT&amp;T and its subsidiaries. This user group grew to become USENIX over time. Following the user group’s formation, a mailing list started. From the first list on the 30th of July in 1975, we have the following organizations listed as installation/user sites: AT&amp;T, Brooklyn College, Carleton College, Case Western Reserve University, The Children's Museum, City University of New York, Columbia University, Duke Medical Center, East Brunswick High School, Harvard University, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Heriot-Watt University, Johns Hopkins University, Knox College, Naval Postgraduate School, Oregon Museum of Science, Polytechnic University of NY, Princeton University, Rand Corporation, St. Olaf College, Stanford University, The Spence School, University Catholique de Louvain, University of Alberta, University of California (Berkeley), University of Manitoba, University of North Carolina, University of Saskatchewan, University of Texas (Dallas), University of Toronto, University of Utah, University of Waterloo, and the University of Wisconsin. As we know from the license granted to Katholieke, there were more UNIX user sites than this, but they weren’t members of the user group (or at least not at first).</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3926f41f-c121-450b-8e10-e46ccc1c5448_652x522.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3926f41f-c121-450b-8e10-e46ccc1c5448_652x522.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3926f41f-c121-450b-8e10-e46ccc1c5448_652x522.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3926f41f-c121-450b-8e10-e46ccc1c5448_652x522.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3926f41f-c121-450b-8e10-e46ccc1c5448_652x522.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3926f41f-c121-450b-8e10-e46ccc1c5448_652x522.jpeg" width="720" height="576.4417177914111" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3926f41f-c121-450b-8e10-e46ccc1c5448_652x522.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:522,&quot;width&quot;:652,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:720,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3926f41f-c121-450b-8e10-e46ccc1c5448_652x522.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3926f41f-c121-450b-8e10-e46ccc1c5448_652x522.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3926f41f-c121-450b-8e10-e46ccc1c5448_652x522.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3926f41f-c121-450b-8e10-e46ccc1c5448_652x522.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Dennis Ritchie (standing), Ken Thompson at the teletype, PDP-11 1972</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>In this early time period, UNIX only ran on the PDP-11, but that changed in 1976. The first port was at Princeton where UNIX was ported to the IBM 360 in late 1976. From the history I can find, this wasn’t a fully functional port until later in the following year. The second port was to the Interdata 7/32 at Wollongong University by Richard Miller on the 4th of February in 1977. This was an interesting one as the UNIX kernel was running on top of the Interdata operating system at first. The Wollongong port became a stand-alone and fully functional port on the 28th of April in 1977. The next target was the Interdata 8/32 in 1977 which was undertaken by Ritchie and Steve Johnson (author of yacc, lint, pcc). But, porting efforts took off only after John Lions at the University of New South Whales wrote a commentary on the UNIX sources and distributed them as a book, </span><em>Code and Commentary</em><span>, for teaching students about operating systems. Western Electric tried to stop dissemination, but this was apparently impossible. Likewise, modifications of UNIX began circulating following the release of Lions’ book, and a culture we would recognize today as “</span><em>open source</em><span>” began to develop helped in no small part by AT&amp;T’s policies regarding UNIX that essentially stated UNIX would have no advertising, no support, no bug fixes, and payment in advance. To color the time period more thoroughly, Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf published the first description of TCP/IP in 1974 and by January of 1976 there were sixty three hosts on ARPAnet, and UNIX while being used globally would run only on hardware that cost over $9000 (around $48000 in 2024).</span></p><p>Professor Robert (Bob) Fabry was at the Symposium on Operating Systems Principles where UNIX had first been announced and he was very excited. Returning to UC Berkeley where he was then employed, he assembled a group to purchase a PDP-11/45. As this was a large purchase, he coordinated the departments of computer science, math, and statistics. With the machine purchased, Fabry then ordered a tape of UNIX from Thompson. The actual installation of UNIX was first undertaken by Keith Standiford in January of 1974. In 1973/1974, it was somewhat routine for Thompson himself to be involved in nearly every UNIX installation for a licensee. The folks at Berkeley seemed to be interested in doing everything themselves, but things didn’t go well. Eventually, Standiford reached out to Thompson, and Thompson would connect to the University’s 11/45 over a three hundred baud acoustic coupler to remotely debug crash dumps from New Jersey. I personally like to imagine that it was a Novation CAT 300, but I haven’t been able to find a model number of the modem, and I haven’t found any reference to what system Thompson was actually using. Plus, the Novation CAT 300 wouldn’t be released for several years.</p><p>Following the purchase of the PDP-11/45, the departments involved began having issues with scheduling time on the machine. Berkeley bought several more computers. One of these was a PDP-11/70, and its arrival coincided with the arrival of Thompson as a visiting professor. Thompson, Bob Kridle, and Jeff Schriebman then setup V7 UNIX on the 11/70. Shortly after the installation was completed, two graduate students, Chuck Haley and William Nelson (Bill) Joy, arrived on campus. They were intrigued by the computer system, and they began hacking on Thompson’s Pascal compiler. Within a few weeks (from what I have been able to find), the teletypes attached to the 11/70 were replaced with ADM-3 screen terminals.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98f22ee6-2f34-4ffd-b8bd-b37fb059cbe5_1887x1860.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98f22ee6-2f34-4ffd-b8bd-b37fb059cbe5_1887x1860.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98f22ee6-2f34-4ffd-b8bd-b37fb059cbe5_1887x1860.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98f22ee6-2f34-4ffd-b8bd-b37fb059cbe5_1887x1860.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98f22ee6-2f34-4ffd-b8bd-b37fb059cbe5_1887x1860.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98f22ee6-2f34-4ffd-b8bd-b37fb059cbe5_1887x1860.jpeg" width="1456" height="1435" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/98f22ee6-2f34-4ffd-b8bd-b37fb059cbe5_1887x1860.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1435,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;undefined&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="undefined" title="undefined" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98f22ee6-2f34-4ffd-b8bd-b37fb059cbe5_1887x1860.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98f22ee6-2f34-4ffd-b8bd-b37fb059cbe5_1887x1860.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98f22ee6-2f34-4ffd-b8bd-b37fb059cbe5_1887x1860.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98f22ee6-2f34-4ffd-b8bd-b37fb059cbe5_1887x1860.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>ADM-3, image by Chris Jacobs, CC BY-SA 3.0</figcaption></figure></div><p>For Bill Joy, using ed or em on a screen terminal wasn’t really sufficient.

Somewhere around June, Pascal had been further improved, the C shell had been written, vi had been written (by Joy), and termcap had been written (by Joy). These new tools comprised the bulk of the Second Berkely Software Distribution or 2BSD. Joy was the man running the show, and he’d answer the phone, create the tapes, incorporate feedback, package, and mail the software. Seventy five copies of 2BSD were sent out.</p><p>The DEC VAX was first introduced in 1977. It was a 32 bit ISA with virtual memory. In the first half of 1978, Professor Richard Fateman at Berkeley was looking for a machine with a lot of memory for a project of his. The VAX-11/780 met his requirements and his budget, and he got some folks together to purchase it with a bit of help from the National Science Foundation. The VAX did have one disadvantage in the minds of those at UC Berkeley; the VAX ran VMS. Luckily, UNIX had already been ported to VAX as UNIX/32V (V7 UNIX variant) by John Reiser and Tom London at Bell Labs. This port, however, didn’t take advantage of the main VAX feature, virtual memory, which limited the available memory to 1MB.</p><p>This had to be fixed. For Fateman, virtual memory was a requirement, and UNIX was a requirement. He then contacted Professor Domenico Ferrari about getting virtual memory support in UNIX. One of the graduate students working with Ferrari, Özalp Babaoğlu, then set about this task. Along the way, Babaoğlu reached out to Joy for assistance. Joy helped integrate Babaoğlu’s memory system into 32V and helped him debug the resulting UNIX variant.</p><p>The new version of UNIX was good. Joy knew that the 32 bit VAX running UNIX would render the 16 bit PDP-11 obsolete, and he started porting 2BSD to 32V. Peter Kessler and Marshall Kirk McKusick worked on porting Pascal, while Joy handled ex, vi, C shell, and many other BSD utilities. The group had completed their work by the end of 1979, and Joy shipped 3BSD in December.</p><p><span>At this point, it’s important to delineate the family tree. 1BSD and 2BSD were improvements to UNIX version 6 while 3BSD was an improvement to 32V which was itself of a port and modification of UNIX version 7. During the creation of 3BSD, 2BSD had continued to see additions, fixes, and releases. One important distinction to be made is that the filename for the kernel in 3BSD became </span><em>vmunix</em><span> for virtual memory UNIX.</span></p><p>Computer hardware and software were highly varied in 1979 and most often nothing was compatible with anything else. For the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, this was an issue. They felt that the best they could hope for was unity at the operating system level for the growing network of networks, ARPAnet, and to this end they chose to standardize on UNIX due to its proven portability resulting from having been written in C. This same system would also be used by DARPA for work in the VLSI Project. In the autumn of 1979, Fabry reached out to DARPA offering 3BSD as the solution to their problem. Initially, this wasn’t well received, but the success of 3BSD that December changed opinions. Fabry secured an eighteen month contract with DARPA that began in April of 1980. This contract stipulated that Berkeley’s new Computer Systems Research Group would add the features to 3BSD needed by DARPA which was left rather open. In a technical report on the matter, the government doesn’t actually list anything too specific.</p><div data-component-name="FileToDOM"><div><p><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Fattachment_icon.svg"></p><div><p>ARPA Standard UNIX Report</p><p>182KB ∙ PDF file</p></div><p><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/api/v1/file/2c12ca84-b921-4d68-97a1-c046f60372c4.pdf" rel=""><span>Download</span></a></p></div><p>ARPA Standard UNIX Report</p><p><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/api/v1/file/2c12ca84-b921-4d68-97a1-c046f60372c4.pdf" rel=""><span>Download</span></a></p></div><p>Fabry hired Laura Tong to be the project administrator, and Fabry then set about finding a tech lead. On an evening in early March, Joy rang Fabry at his home and expressed his desire to lead UNIX development, and Fabry agreed. Unlike earlier BSD releases (and on-going releases of 2BSD) a more robust system of distribution needed to be in place to handle a higher number of orders. Tong setup just such a system, and had Fabry coordinate with Bob Guffy at AT&amp;T as well as the university’s lawyers to find license terms that would satisfy all parties. The system that Joy and the software team would create was 4BSD which was available in October of 1980. This release brought job control to the C shell initially developed by Jim Kulp and integrated by Joy, delivermail (predecessor of sendmail), job control signals that worked more reliably (so if you sent SIGHUP the job would actually hangup), the curses library, the control-z suspend/resume functionality we know today, a filesystem that supported block sizes up to 1K, and greater hardware support. Notably, 4BSD supported the VAX-11/750. Like prior BSD releases, 4BSD included the Pascal compiler and that saw still more improvements, and it included the Franz Lisp system by Richard Fateman. 4BSD saw nine months as the system de jour, and about one hundred fifty copies were shipped. Licenses were per institution and not per machine, and estimates are that the distribution was running on about five hundred computers.</p><p>4BSD drew criticism from David Kashtan at Stanford Research Institute. He’d run some benchmarks on VMS and BSD and he claimed that VMS was the clear winner. This didn’t sit well with Joy. He went and made a series of performance improvements to BSD (mostly in vmunix), and a few weeks later released a paper rebutting Kashtan’s claims and showing that BSD was every bit the match to VMS. The improved kernel was coupled with Kevin Robert Elz’s auto-configuration and a system featuring them was released as 4.1BSD in June of 1981, and 4.1BSD for VAX became 2.8BSD for the PDP-11.. This version was current for two years and shipped four hundred copies. This version was good enough to win CSRG another two years of funding from DARPA, and the CS department at Berkeley also saw funding.</p><p>Interestingly, the reason for a point release was political. The CSRG had wanted to call this release 5BSD, but AT&amp;T blocked that name. AT&amp;T were releasing System V UNIX at the time, and they felt that a Berkeley release also named “five” would confuse customers. Point releases of 4.?BSD were then the agreed upon solution.</p><p>The new funding round came with some more concrete goals. Specifically, DARPA wanted a better filesystem with higher throughput, support for multi-gigabyte adress spaces, better IPC, and integrated networking. Marshall Kirk McKusick outlines how these decisions were made:</p><blockquote><p><em>To assist in defining the new system, Duane Adams, Berkeley's contract monitor at DARPA, formed a group known as the "steering committee" to help guide the design work and ensure that the research community's needs were addressed. This committee met twice a year between April 1981 and June 1983. It included Bob Fabry, Bill Joy, and Sam Leffler of the University of California at Berkeley; Alan Nemeth and Rob Gurwitz of Bolt, Beranek, and Newman; Dennis Ritchie of Bell Laboratories; Keith Lantz of Stanford University; Rick Rashid of Carnegie-Mellon University; Bert Halstead of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Dan Lynch of The Information Sciences Institute; Duane Adams and Bob Baker of DARPA; and Jerry Popek of the University of California at Los Angeles. Beginning in 1984, these meetings were supplanted by workshops that were expanded to include many more people.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>What was developed largely by McKusick, Joy, Sam Leffler, and Rob Gurwitz is astounding. These developments were iterated in releases 4.1a, 4.1b, and 4.1c but ultimately culminated in 4.2 which was released in August of 1983. The two largest innovations were the Berkeley Sockets API and the Berkeley Fast File System. The sockets interface allowed multiple different network protocols to be used at any time and exposed them as files. The Berkeley FFS allowed blocksizes from 128 bytes to larger than 4096 bytes if needed. Thus, with Berkeley’s FFS, a system operator could optimize either for disk use or for disk performance. 4.2BSD included a full TCP/IP stack and NFS support as well. Starting in the early iterated releases, small tools like </span><code>rcp</code><span>, </span><code>rsh</code><span>, </span><code>rlogin</code><span>, and </span><code>rwho</code><span> appeared to demonstrate capabilities. These were intended to be short lived, but those familiar with UNIX will certainly recognize them. 4.2BSD also brought disk quota facilities, a better install process, better documentation, and some new filesystem related system calls.</span></p><p>Events less visible to users also occurred between 1982 and 1983. Joy left the project in late spring of 1982 for Sun Microsystems, but still spent a little time that summer working on IPC and reorganizing the UNIX kernel sources to isolate machine dependent code. Once at Sun, contributions to BSD continued with Sun sending their modifications for running BSD on the Motorola 68000 back to Berkeley. Leffler then took over Joy’s previous duties. Joy’s work, however, would make BSD the single most easily ported operating system for about the next twenty years. Pauline Schwartz was hired to take over distribution duties in April of 1983. In June of 1983, Fabry went on sabbatical and Ferrari and Susan Graham took over running the CSRG. In 1984, Leffler went to work for Lucasfilm and Mike Karels took over as the UNIX dev lead. He’d previously worked on the 2.?BSD series for the PDP-11. Later that year McKusick joined CSRG full-time.</p><p>4.2BSD gained over a thousand site licenses in a year and a half, and most UNIX system vendors actually shipped 4.2BSD (or a system based on it) rather than AT&amp;T’s System V UNIX.  Likewise, many varieties of corporate UNIX would be based upon 4.1c or 4.2BSD such as SunOS and DEC Ultrix. An important point at this time is that BSD’s codebase was largely divergent from that of AT&amp;T while still mostly maintaining compatibility. Additionally, AT&amp;T had started shipping UNIX without source, and those customers who bought AT&amp;T’s commercial UNIX would often then separately obtain BSD sources if they wanted to modify some aspect of the system. For those using microcomputers, Microsoft’s (and SCO’s) XENIX was the standard.</p><p>Over on the PDP-11, a mixture of 4.1a and 4.1c formed 2.9BSD, but 4.2BSD never showed up.</p><p>In 1976, comic artist Phil Foglio drew the first versions of Beastie as T-shirt art for Mike O’Brien as payment for unlocking a safe.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b00a913-e45d-44e7-b206-763ebac84cd4_688x833.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b00a913-e45d-44e7-b206-763ebac84cd4_688x833.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b00a913-e45d-44e7-b206-763ebac84cd4_688x833.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b00a913-e45d-44e7-b206-763ebac84cd4_688x833.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b00a913-e45d-44e7-b206-763ebac84cd4_688x833.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b00a913-e45d-44e7-b206-763ebac84cd4_688x833.jpeg" width="688" height="833" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1b00a913-e45d-44e7-b206-763ebac84cd4_688x833.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:833,&quot;width&quot;:688,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;\\begin{pic}{foglio.ps}{foglio}{Phil Foglio's 1976 artwork}\n\\end{pic}&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="\begin{pic}{foglio.ps}{foglio}{Phil Foglio's 1976 artwork}

The majority of the complaints were centered on performance. The team then spent two years improving performance, refining the networking stack, and they felt that they were ready to announce an impending release at USENIX in June of 1985. This didn’t go well. The fine folks of Bolt, Beranek, and Newman (part of the steering commitee) noted that 4.2BSD had shipped without the final version of the their networking code, and was instead using a heavily modified version of their initial prototype. After some bickering back and forth, DARPA provided both network stacks to Mike Muuss (author of ping) of the Ballistics Research Laboratory for testing. Berkeley’s code was better. 4.3BSD was released in June of 1986.</p><p>Keith Bostic joined CSRG in 1986 with the condition that he be allowed to continue and to complete a prior project. He was working to port 4.3BSD to the PDP-11. This meant that a 250K minimal system on VAX would be made to fit in the 64K address space of the PDP-11… no one thought this would work. No one. The man was clearly mad, but despite what madness may have lurked within him, Bostic made it work using a set of overlays and auxiliary processor states, and this formed the 2.10BSD release. He also began attending USENIX and he’d announce the progress of the removal of all AT&amp;T code from BSD which started in 1986 at thirty five percent AT&amp;T license free, and the announcement was met with widespread cheers and applause. This became important due to price increases from AT&amp;T. As of the 24th of February in 1984, the price for a commercial license of UNIX System V Release 2 with source for a single CPU stood at $43000 (about $126000 in 2024), and each additional CPU was a further $16000 (nearly $47000 in 2024). For educational institutions, the price was lower at $800 (or $2300 in 2024) and an additional $400 for each CPU.</p><p>Getting well into the 1980s, it became rather obvious to CSRG members that VAX wouldn’t go on forever. Computer Consoles Inc had opened a development center in Irvine and there they developed a proprietary minicomputer called the Power 6/32 code named Tahoe. This new platform was aimed to compete directly with VAX. In need of an operating system, CCI turned to CSRG. CCI provided the team several machines and the team set about porting 4.3BSD to the 6/32. This became 4.3BSD-Tahoe in June of 1988. Importantly, they were able to push forward Joy’s work of separating machine dependent code from the rest of the system, and 4.3BSD-Tahoe introduced an OSI network protocol stack, improved the kernel’s virtual memory system, and introduced more efficient TCP/IP support. Unfortunately, 4.3BSD-Tahoe was short lived as CCI changed their company’s focus, and Sperry and Burroughs released rebranded minicomputers based on the Power 6/32 platform. Where this effort did live on, however, was in a merger of 4.3BSD-Tahoe and 2.10BSD into 2.11BSD for the PDP-11. The Tahoe effort also meant that much of the BSD codebase had been rewritten furthering the aim of removing AT&amp;T licensed code.</p><p>BSD was released in source format only. Any prospective user would be required to compile his or her system from source entirely. Given this, any user would first need to acquire an AT&amp;T source license before he/she would be able to make use of BSD. As noted previously, UNIX license fees were ridiculous. Yet, the TCP/IP stack in 4.3BSD was unique to Berkeley. Several software developers requested that BSD’s networking code be offered separately from UNIX, and this was done in June of 1989 as Networking Release 1. Pricing for a tape from Berkeley was $400 (around $983 in 2024), but the license terms allowed for free modification, free redistribution, and free application to any use case provided that the copyright notices on Berkeley’s code remain in place, and that products incorporating the code mention in documentation that code from the University of California and its contributors was included. It was also available via anonymous FTP shortly following the initial release. This newsgroup post was made on the 7th of December in 1988, but other documentation states public availability was November:</p><blockquote><pre><code>Path: utzoo!utgpu!watmath!clyde!att!osu-cis!tut.cis.ohio-state.edu!mailrus!

We are happy to announce the availability of the first release of the BSD networking software. It consists of the standard user level applications, (along with their manual pages and some related documentation) and some kernel and C library support. It should be noted that this software has only been tested for compilation and operation on 4.3BSD and 4.3BSD-tahoe. A complete list of files is attached to this message.

The TCP and IP code is approximately the same as that recently made
available via the ARPANET and Usenet. Several new algorithms are used in TCP, in particular Van Jacobson's slow start and dynamic window size
selection algorithms and Phil Karn's modification to the roundtrip timing algorithm. These changes increase throughput and reduce congestion and retransmission. Several fixes were made in the handling of IP options and other gateway support.

This software suite is copyright The Regents of the University of California and may be freely redistributed. No previous license, either AT&amp;T or Berkeley is required. The release costs $400.00 US.

It included arp, ftp clients and servers (yes, plural on both), route, telnet, dns tools, ifconfig, inetd, pieces of the BSD libc, sendmail, syslog, ping, and uucp.</p><p>While the networking release was being made, 4.3BSD development continued. A new virtual memory system was implemented from MACH at Carnegie-Melon with the porting and merging work done by Mike Hibler. The interface for that VM system was, however, a purely Berkeley design adhering to the architecture descriptions found in 4.2BSD. The NFS system was upgraded to be Sun-compatible via the use of Rick Macklem’s work at the University of Geulph. This became 4.3BSD-Reno.</p><p>The original BSD license in Reno:</p><blockquote><p><em>Copyright (c) 1987 Regents of the University of California.

At a meeting of CSRG, he mentioned the popularity of the networking release and he proposed an expanded release that would include more than networking. Discussion went on for a while, but eventually McKusick and Karels took up the kernel work with Bostic handling the utilities and C library.  Obviously, this would be a seriously large undertaking for a single individual, and Bostic figured that others would be willing to help. Bostic then encouraged people to coordinate over the budding Internet with people across the globe submitting contributions. He also encouraged people to contribute at USENIX. In a little over a year, most of the utilities and libraries had been rewritten with major contributions coming from Bill Jolitz, Donn Seeley, Trent Hein, Vadim Antonov, Mike Karels, Igor Belchinsky, Pace Willisson, Jeff Polk, and Tony Sanders. Karels and McKusick hadn’t actually expected Bostic to succeed, but with the work completed, Bostic walked into their office with his head held high and inquired as to their progress on the kernel. The two then went off to work on it file by file, removing everything originally included in the 32V release, but they were short by six files. Rather than getting a new license and name created by the university’s lawyers, the group reused what they had and this became Network Release 2 announced on the 3rd of July in 1991.</p><blockquote><pre><code>Path: gmdzi!unido!fauern!ira.uka.de!sol.ctr.columbia.edu!spool.mu.edu!

We are happy to announce the availability of the second release of the
BSD networking software. The distribution includes approximately 75% of
the utilities distributed as part of 4.3BSD-Reno and the C library  (along with manual pages and some related documentation), and much of the kernel. We wish to *strongly* emphasize, however, that significant portions of the kernel are missing and that no binary support is supplied for any architecture. Please note also that this software has only been tested for compilation and operation on 4.3BSD-Reno.

This release is intended for system developers and others who wish to
preview or experiment with the most recent Berkeley system. It may also
be useful as an update to earlier BSD or BSD-derived systems, although
substantial work will be required to integrate portions of this release
into older systems. This distribution is *not* intended to be used on
production systems, nor is it intended for sites without the expertise
to find and fix problems that are encountered.

This software suite is Copyright (C) 1991 The Regents of the University
of California and may be freely redistributed without further charge.  No previous license, either from AT&amp;T or Berkeley is required.  The release costs $850.00 US on 6250 BPI 9-track magnetic tape or 8mm Exabyte cassette or $950.00 US on 1600 BPI 9-track magnetic tape. The distribution is approximately 90Mb in size.

Only a few short months later, a group of 386/BSD users formed NetBSD to continue enhancements and releases of Jolitz’s system. This occurred because Jolitz still had a full-time job, and the number of bug fixes, enhancements, and additions coming into his project were beyond his capabilities to manage alone. NetBSD has and continues to emphasize porting NetBSD to absolutely everything, including but not limited to ARM, MIPS, i386, AMD64, SPARC, PowerPC, Motorola 68K, SH3, HPPA, Itanium, RISC-V, and VAX. If your toaster has a chip in it, NetBSD will probably run on it. NetBSD has also engaged in some research and experimentation that has led to many security and system hardening technologies, an amazing package management system, kernel level hardware virtualization, and some surprising levels of backward compatibility. As is the BSD tradition, NetBSD has also merged in changes from systems like Solaris with ZFS.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9930c00b-0270-4a9d-ae51-bfa22c05721d_499x374.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9930c00b-0270-4a9d-ae51-bfa22c05721d_499x374.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9930c00b-0270-4a9d-ae51-bfa22c05721d_499x374.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9930c00b-0270-4a9d-ae51-bfa22c05721d_499x374.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9930c00b-0270-4a9d-ae51-bfa22c05721d_499x374.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9930c00b-0270-4a9d-ae51-bfa22c05721d_499x374.jpeg" width="725" height="543.3867735470942" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9930c00b-0270-4a9d-ae51-bfa22c05721d_499x374.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:374,&quot;width&quot;:499,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:725,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9930c00b-0270-4a9d-ae51-bfa22c05721d_499x374.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9930c00b-0270-4a9d-ae51-bfa22c05721d_499x374.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9930c00b-0270-4a9d-ae51-bfa22c05721d_499x374.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9930c00b-0270-4a9d-ae51-bfa22c05721d_499x374.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>A toaster at the Linux World Expo in 2005, running NetBSD</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>While NET2 was being worked on and released, the last version of 2.11BSD was also being prepared and released, but this time by USENIX.

                        (Revised January 1991)

The USENIX Association is pleased to announce the distribution of a new release of the "Second Berkeley Software Distribution" (2.11BSD).

This release will be handled by USENIX, and is available to all V7,  System III, System V, and 2.9BSD licensees. The Association will continue to maintain the non-profit price of $200. The release will consist of two 2400 ft. 1600 bpi tapes or one TK50 tape cartridge
(approximately 80M) and approximately 100 pages of documentation.

If you have questions about the distribution of the release, or require  800 bpi tapes, please contact USENIX. USENIX's address and phone number is as follows:

This release is in celebration of the 20th anniversary of the PDP-11!  Work has been ongoing since the release of 2.10.1BSD in January 1989.  This release incorporates all fixes and changes posted to the USENET newsgroup comp.bugs.2bsd since 2.10.1BSD was released.

Present in this release are several more missing pieces from the 4.3BSD distribution:

1) the kernel logger (/dev/klog)
2) the namei cache and argument encapsulation calling sequence
3) readv(2)/writev(2) as system calls rather thane mulation/compatibility routines
4) shadow password file implementation (the May 1989 4.3BSD update)
5) a TMSCP (TK50/TU81) driver with standalone support (boot-block and standalone driver)
6) Pronet and LH/DH IMP networking support
7) the portable ascii archive file format (ar, ranlib)
8) the Unibus Mapping Register (UMR) handling of the network was rewritten to avoid allocating excessive UMRs.
9) the necessary mods to the IP portion of the networking were made to allow traceroute (which is present in 2.11BSD) to run
10) long filenames in the file system

This last addition is the reason a coldstart kit is necessary. The 4.3BSD on-disk directory structure has been ported (along with the
utilities that know about on-disk directories via the raw filesystem: fsck, ncheck, icheck, dcheck, etc.) and is not compatible with previous versions of UNIX for the PDP-11.

A limited amount of filesystem backward compatibility with earlier  versions of 2BSD (2.9BSD, 2.10BSD and 2.10.1BSD) is present in a version of dump(8) which can read old filesystems. The disk partition sizes have not changed from 2.10.1BSD (the urge to standardize the haphazard partition sizes was suppressed in the interest of backwards compatibility). The restor(8) utility automatically converts old dump 
tapes to the new format on input.

The constant MAXNAMLEN is now 63 instead of 14. While it is possible the limit could be higher, with MAXPATHLEN at 256 a MAXNAMLEN of 63 was  judged sufficient.

MANY other fixes and changes have also been made, see the "Changes To The Kernel" document which describes the changes made to both the kernel and the application programs.

They chose to target the PC architecture specifically and to make their system a bit easier to use. In contrast to NetBSD which was solely a product offered over the internet, the FreeBSD group offered their product on CD-ROM. FreeBSD did expand to ARM, PowerPC, and MIPS, and like NetBSD they did continue the CSRG spirit of research and experimentation with things like bhyve virtualization and jails. Additionally, they have continued the legacy of borrowing the best bits of other systems like dtrace, and ZFS, but also via their immense collection of software in </span><code>ports</code><span>.</span></p><p><span>Richard L. Adams Jr (Rick) was the founder of one of the earliest internet service providers (if not </span><em>the</em><span> first), UUNET, after first creating SLIP (TCP/IP over serial). He also maintained the most popular usenet transport in the early 1980s, B News. After the release of 386/BSD, he got together with Keith Bostic, Marshall Kirk McKusick, Mike Karels, and Bill Jolitz and the group founded Berkeley Software Design, Inc otherwise known as BSDi. Their first product was BSD/386 based off of Networking Release 2 and it first released in January of 1992. Their system retailed for $995 (about $2160 in 2024). The target market for BSDi was the nascent internet infrastructure market. In their advertising they touted their “</span><em>99% discount over System V</em><span>” and advised interested parties to contact 1-800-its-unix.</span></p><p>Of course, this didn’t sit well with Unix System Labs (AT&amp;T subsidiary). Shortly after BSDi began sales, they received a cease and desist from USL with a particular request to stop using the phone number that included “it’s UNIX,” as the ownership of the UNIX trademark was firmly in USL’s hands. BSDi complied changing their advertisements, the number, and explaining that BSD wasn’t precisely UNIX. This, however, wasn’t quite enough. USL brought a lawsuit against BSDi seeking an injunction against the sale of BSD/386. As part of the suit, USL claimed that BSDi’s product contained USL code and trade secrets, and that further sales of BSDi’s product would irreparably harm USL. BSDi then claimed that they shouldn’t be held liable for any code contained in Berkeley’s original source offerings, but that they were completely willing to discuss the six added, BSDi-original files. BSDi’s argument won and USL was required to restate their complaint or have the case dismissed. USL then filed suit against both BSDi and the University of California with roughly the same complaints but this time seeking an injunction against the sale and distribution of both Networking Release 2 and BSD/386. The employees of both CSRG and BSDi were deposed.</p><p>In December of 1992, US District Judge Debevoise in New Jersey took the arguments for injunction under advisement. Six weeks later, he dismissed all but two of the complaints and suggested that the matter should be taken to a state court before being heard in a federal court. The University listened and filed a lawsuit against USL the following Monday in California. The suit by the University of California claimed that USL had failed to provide credit to the University for BSD code contained within System V as required by their prior licensing agreement. The University of California wasn’t asking for financial compensation but rather that USL reprint all of their System V documentation with proper credit and attribution for BSD code, that USL notify licensees of their mistake, and that USL run advertisements in print news publications informing the public of USL’s mistake.</p><p>On the 21st of December in 1992, Novell announced that it would be acquiring Unix System Laboratories including the UNIX copyright, trademarks, and licensing contracts. The LA Times stated that this transaction was completed with an exchange of stock wherein all of the shares of USL would be traded for twelve million three hundred thousand shares of Novell, and after which USL would be a wholly owned subsidiary of Novell. Discussions around a settlement of legal proceedings began in the summer of 1993, but were not resolved until January of 1994. The result was that three files were removed from Networking Release 2, minor changes were made to a few other files, and USL copyrights were added to about seventy files though the license of those files would continue to be the BSD license. On the part of USL, they agreed that with those terms met, the company would not bring litigation against any company, group, or user who used or distributed the resulting open source BSD system.</p><p>That resulting system was 4.4BSD-Lite and 4.4BSD-Encumbered in March of 1994. 4.4BSD-Encumbered included the prior USL code and required a USL UNIX license. 4.4BSD-Lite was fully free and open source software. This version was merged into FreeBSD 2.0, NetBSD 1.0, and a newly named BSD/OS which was previously BSD/386. For CSRG, the revenue received from 4.4BSD allowed the group to continue as a part-time effort integrating bug fixes and enhancements made locally and from the BSD community. As focus shifted into the other distributions like BSD/OS, NetBSD, and FreeBSD the rate of submissions to Berkeley slowed. The final release from the University was 4.4BSD-Lite Release 2 in June of 1995. This version was merged into FreeBSD 3.0, Rhapsody (and later Darwin), NetBSD 1.3, OpenBSD 2.3, and BSD/OS 3.0.</p><p>By 1995, BSDi’s BSD/OS was the most common operating system used in the datacenters of the early internet. This is a market that BSDi had intentionally targeted, and this would prove to be a sword of Damocles. The strand of hair holding the sword broke as the Dot Com Bubble began bursting and BSDi merged with Walnut Creek which itself was later sold to Wind River Systems.</p><p>Today, BSD is among the most common operating systems on Earth despite people not recognizing it as such. Modern macOS descends from 4.4BSD, as do NetBSD, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Dragonfly BSD, and a few others. In the past, various versions of BSD formed the basis of SunOS, DYNIX, NeXTSTEP, Ultrix, and Tru64. Various editions of BSD were merged into AT&amp;T UNIX, and this means that modern commercial UNIX systems like AIX and HP-UX are also running some BSD code. BSD has been used in many commercial products owning to its permissive licensing, and some of the most notable of those are the Sony Playstation 3, 4, and Vita, the Netflix Open Connect Appliance, Juniper routers, Isilon IQ clustered storage systems, Dell Compellent storage systems, and the Weather Channel’s IntelliStar forecast computer. </p><p>I now have readers from many of the companies whose history I cover, and many of you were present for time periods I cover.

<p><span>I've already talked about tidal-locked planets at length
    <a href="https://worldbuildingpasta.blogspot.com/2020/12/an-apple-pie-from-scratch-part-ivd.html">in the past</a>
    (<a href="https://worldbuildingpasta.blogspot.com/2019/06/an-apple-pie-from-scratch-part-ii-stars.html#tidallockedplanets">several</a>

    it'd be nice to have a single <i>relatively</i> short place to address the
    most common myths about tidal-locked planets, and particularly their
    climate, for easy reference.</span>
</p>

<p><span>The very short version is that the popular perception of tidal-locked
    planets</span><span>—</span><span>hostile worlds split between a burning desert on the lit hemisphere, ice on
    the dark side, and, at best, a thin "twilight strip" of habitable
    temperatures in between, wracked by gale-force winds</span><span>—</span><span>is not a strictly impossible scenario in all its particulars, but our
    <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac135c/meta">current best climate models</a></span><span><span><sup>1</sup></span></span><span></span><span>
    predict (and
    <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103597957936">have</a></span><span><span><sup>2</sup></span></span><span></span><span>
    for quite some time now) that tidal-locked planets in the habitable zone
    with Earth-like atmospheres and quantities of surface water can more
    typically expect
    <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa9f1f/meta">far more hospitable conditions</a></span><span><span><sup>3</sup></span></span><span></span><span>, with comfortable temperatures and moderate prevailing winds across the
    lit hemisphere; that the hottest part of the planet
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.08463.pdf">will usually actually be the wettest</a></span><span><span><sup>4</sup></span></span><span></span><span>; and that this habitable climate state may actually be
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0515">more stable</a></span><span><span><sup>5</sup></span></span><span> in some ways than
    that of a planet more like our own.</span>
</p>

<p><span>For a more detailed explanation, let's back up a bit and set the scene.
    <b>Tidal-locking</b> describes a phenomenon whereby the tidal influence of a
    star on a planet (or between a planet and moon) causes the planet's rotation
    to slow until one side of the planet faces permanently towards the star, and
    the opposite side faces away. Because the planet still orbits in a loop
    around the star, this requires that it also rotates around once on its axis
    to keep that star-side face pointed to the star, so this is also sometimes
    called a <b>1:1 spin-orbit resonance</b>; for every 1 orbit, the planet
    spins around exactly once. The tidal influence of the star helps ensure this
    exact timing, hence the "locking" aspect. There are other spin-orbit
    resonances that tidal forces might lock a planet into, like the
    <b>3:2 spin-orbit resonance</b> of Mercury (the planet spins 3 times for
    every 2 orbits), but whether these planets should also be called
    "tidal-locked" varies between sources; in colloquial usage, "tidal-locking"
    is used almost exclusively to refer to the 1:1 resonance.</span>
</p>


<p><span>The strength of tidal forces is strongly dependent on the distance between
    the planet and star. Smaller <b>red dwarf stars</b> that are substantially
    dimmer than our sun have habitable zones that are correspondingly much
    closer to the star, so any habitable-zone planets of these stars are much
    more likely to be tidal-locked. These are by far the most common type of
    star in the universe, accounting for over 3/4 of the total number, so the
    habitability of tidal-locked planets is a major factor in the prevalence in
    habitability in the cosmos generally.<br></span>
</p>

<p><span>Unsurprisingly, keeping one side of the planet pointed at the star has a
    profound effect on how light from the star</span><span>—and thus heat</span><span>—is spread over the planet's surface. On Earth, a flat surface directly
    facing the sun (with no obstructions and ignoring filtering by the
    atmosphere) receives about 1360 Watts per square meter (W/</span><span>m</span><span><span><sup>2</sup></span></span><span>) of light. But Earth's rotation and axial tilt spread out this light, such
    that the average light any single part of the surface receives across the
    whole year (averaging together summer, winter, day, and night) varies
    between a bit over 400&nbsp;</span><span>W/</span><span>m</span><span><span><sup>2</sup></span></span><span>
    near the equator and under 180&nbsp;</span><span>W/</span><span>m</span><span><span><sup>2</sup></span></span><span>
    at the poles (subtracting out the light reflected away by the surface and
    atmosphere leaves about 2/3 of that light on average being actually absorbed
    as heat).</span>
</p>

<p><span>On a tidal-locked world in the same orbit, the <b>substellar point</b> in
    the middle of the daylight side, which faces most directly towards the star,
    would get that full 1360&nbsp;</span><span>W/</span><span>m</span><span><span><sup>2</sup></span></span><span>
    of light continuously.</span><span>
    The heating would decline towards the edge of the dayside, falling to
    0&nbsp;</span><span>W/</span><span>m</span><span><span><sup>2</sup></span></span><span>
    at the <b>terminator</b>, the line dividing the day and night hemispheres;
    over 2/3 of the dayside hemisphere's area would receive more light than the
    average for Earth's equator. The entire nightside receives no light from the
    star at all, save perhaps some meager twilight at the edges refracting
    through the atmosphere.</span>

<p><span>It's understandable, then, that when the prospect of tidal-locked planets

    accompanied by an extreme climate, split between a scorching hot dayside and
    bitter cold nightside.&nbsp;</span><span>Perhaps somewhere in between, near the terminator, there should be at least
    a thin strip of more hospitable temperatures, but that didn't guarantee
    habitability either. </span><span>

    was that any water on the planet's surface and perhaps even </span><span>C</span><span>O</span><span><span><sup>2</sup></span></span><span>
    would become trapped as ice on the nightside, leaving the dayside bone dry
    and even hotter for lack of the moderating influence of water. In the worst
    scenario, sequestration of ices on the nightside and heat-driven escape of
    atmospheric gasses to space on the dayside might remove such a planet's
    atmosphere entirely.<p>Even those who imagined a habitable strip
    imagined it dimly lit, being so close to the terminator, and wracked by
    vicious winds; the planet's strong temperature contrast would create a
    powerful convection cell, with air rising on the dayside, moving at high
    altitude to the nightside, and then descending and shooting back towards the
    dayside close to the surface; prospects for complex life in this constantly
    buffeted twilight strip would be, well, dim.</p></span>

<p><span>This picture of tidal-locked planets as marginally habitable at best but
    more likely prone to complete collapse into dry, sterile, perhaps even
    airless worlds prevailed
    <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00644211">well into the 1990s</a></span><span><span><sup>9</sup></span></span><span></span><span>, but as computing technology improved and we finally gained some
    capability to simulate the climates of such worlds in detail, which painted
    a
    <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103597957936">far different picture</a></span><span><span><sup>2</sup></span></span><span></span><span>.</span>
</p>

<p><span>As it turns out, even an atmosphere substantially thinner than Earth's
    could distribute enough heat to the nightside to prevent atmospheric
    freeze-out, and a more Earth-like atmosphere could keep temperatures
    globally within
    <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3894/JAMES.2010.2.13">about the same range</a></span><span><span><sup>10</sup></span></span><span>
    we experience on Earth. Water, too, can

    becoming completely trapped on the nightside, and global oceans could then
    help distribute heat
    <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.1315215111">even more evenly</a></span><span><span><sup>12</sup></span></span><span>
    across the surface.</span>
</p>

<p><span>In fact, in some circumstances, tidal-locking might even make a habitable
    climate more stable. Near the inner edge of the habitable zone, where the
    sun's light is more intense, the slow rotation and global convection may
    allow for warm planets to develop a permanent cloud formation that reflects
    away much of the star's light, keeping temperatures moderate
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0515">even in orbits</a></span><span><span><sup>5</sup></span></span><span> where a planet
    with Earth-like rotation would boil from runaway greenhouse warming. At the
    habitable zone's outer edge, this cooling effect would be weaker, and the
    sharp gradient in heating from the star on the dayside
    <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab487d">would help prevent</a></span><span><span><sup>13</sup></span></span><span>
    runaway cooling and ice formation of the sort that may have caused Earth to
    freeze over completely in the past.</span>
</p>

<p><span>So, let's take a quick look at what modern modelling predicts the actual
    climate of a tidal-locked planet with otherwise Earth-like properties should
    look like.
    <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa9f1f/meta">Temperatures across the dayside</a></span><span><span><sup>3</sup></span></span><span></span><span>
    could easily vary by less than 30&nbsp;</span><span>°C</span><span>, and the nightside would tend to be even more uniform. Ice could still
    cover much of the nightside, but it needn't stop exactly at the terminator;
    it could extend well into the dayside while still leaving a substantial warm
    region, it could be restricted only to some nightside pockets,
    or&nbsp;</span><span>the nightside could even&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.1315215111">thaw out completely</a><span><span><sup>12</sup></span></span><span></span><span>. Ice cover on Earth has varied considerably over its history through
    warmer and cooler climates, and much the same would be true here.</span>

<p><span>Conversely to the image of a dayside desert, the warmest part of the

    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.08463.pdf">tend to be the wettest</a></span><span><span><sup>4</sup></span></span><span></span><span>.
    Those converging winds would pull in moisture from across the planet, and
    the rising convection would encourage frequent widespread rain. Though some
    climate models briefly predicted a single permanent cyclone in the center of
    the dayside, it
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.03007.pdf">now seems more likely</a></span><span><span><sup>14</sup></span></span><span></span><span> to
    be a less organized mass of stormy and rainy weather, with frequent cloud
    cover but some prospect for occasional breaks. Farther from the center of
    the dayside, rain would taper off, but the unusual atmospheric structure
    (cool winds towards the dayside near the surface, hot winds towards the
    nightside at high altitude) would encourage frequent fog.</span>
</p>

<p><span>Ocean currents could shift around heat considerably: on a planet with no
    continents, they'd tend to carry heat east, north and south of the center of
    the dayside, such that rather than the typically expected "eyeball" pattern

    more of a lobster shape extending onto the nightside. This tendency may vary
    depending on orbital period, though, and the presence of landmasses blocking
    free flow of currents could weaken their overall influence.</span>

</p></div>

<p><span>Exactly why the old image of inhospitable tidal-locked worlds has persisted
    this long, well after the scientific community&nbsp;<a href="https://funkyscience.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Tarter-et-al.-2007.pdf">has moved past it</a></span><span><span><sup>16</sup></span></span><span>, I couldn't say, though it certainly doesn't help when even </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_Worlds_(TV_series)">recent high-budget media claiming scientific accuracy</a><span>
    repeats the old myths. A planet of stark climate extremes is admittedly a
    fairly compelling image, capturing the imagination of speculative authors
    for
    <a href="https://archive.org/details/macmillansmagazi88macmuoft/page/140/mode/1up">over a century</a></span><span>
    now, but a more hospitable world with vast regions of tropical climate under
    eternal sunshine have their own potential as well.&nbsp;</span>
</p>

<p><span>But if you do like the concept of a habitable twilight strip between
    hemispheres of desert and ice, don't despair; though we shouldn't view this
    as the default climate of tidal-locked worlds, but it can still be achieved
    in the right circumstances.&nbsp;</span><span>A lower total volume of surface water, larger nightside continents, and
    lower geothermal heat </span><a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/796/2/L22/meta">will all encourage</a><span><span><sup>11</sup></span></span><span></span><span>
    trapping of water in nightside ice, potentially allowing for drying out of
    the dayside. A dryer dayside and optionally a thinner atmosphere will weaken
    distribution of heat, allowing the center of the dayside to become hotter
    while still allowing the nightside glaciers to spread to the terminator
    (though they might not reach it evenly on all sides; expect them to more
    reliably appear to the dayside's western edge). Meltwater from these
    glaciers
    <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2013/06/aa21042-13/aa21042-13.html">could feed into</a></span><span><span><sup>17</sup></span></span><span></span><span> a fairly broad habitable strip; evaporated water would be carried by
    winds into the dayside, but so long as the overall supply isn't too high,
    too little would accumulate there to cause rain and would instead return
    with high-atmosphere winds to snow down on the nightside glaciers</span><span>—and the habitable region might see some sporadic rainfall or fog as well
    (there could also be slightly wetter climates where only a small region in
    the center of the dayside receives rain, separated from the glacial
    meltwater region by vast deserts). Winds over this habitable strip would
    probably be stiffer than for the more moderate climate state, but still not
    relentless gales.<br></span>
</p>


<p><span>That about covers the main issues I wanted to cover today, but while I'm
    here, I might as well go over a few other common myths and misunderstandings
    regarding tidal-locked planets (and other bodies) as well.</span>
</p>
<div>
  <h3>
    <span>Tidal-Locked Moons<br></span>
  </h3>
  <p><span>Just as a planet can tidal-lock to its star, a moon can tidal-lock to its
      planet. Indeed, because tidal forces scale strongly with distance and
      moon-planet distances are generally far smaller than planet-star
      distances, almost all moons in the solar system are tidal-locked (the few
      known exceptions, like
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_(moon)">Hyperion</a></span><span>, are
      due to the influence of a much larger neighboring moon causing chaotic
      rotation), and we can probably expect this to be the norm for other star
      systems as well.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p><span>But tidal-locking of a moon to its planet means that it points one face
      to that planet and so rotates once for each orbit of the planet. Relative
      to the star, the moon thus spins around about once per orbit of the
      planet, and so should experience a regular day and night cycle in about
      that time (because the planet is moving around the star as the moon orbits
      the planet, the moon needs to complete either slightly more or slightly
      less</span><span>—depending on the orientation of the orbits</span><span>—</span><span>than one full orbit to rotate back around to face the star again; our
      moon, for example, completes an orbit every 27.3 Earth days, but requires
      29.5 Earth days for one of its days). Tidal-locking to the planet can have
      interesting implications for the day-night cycle of the planet-facing side
      of the moon due to potential eclipses by day and reflected light from the
      planet by night, but in general the climate should resemble that of a
      planet with equivalently long days rather than that of a tidal-locked
      planet (because many moons have quite long orbital periods, these climates
      might still be quite different from Earth's).<br></span>
  </p>
  
  <p><span>Tidal-locking of a moon to the planet's star rather than the planet is,
      so far as I can tell, not possible. The physics governing whether a moon
      can be kept in orbit of a planet at all (i.e., the <b>Hill radius</b>) and
      those governing the strength of tidal forces are fundamentally related
      such that any moon in any stable orbit of a planet must necessarily
      experience stronger tidal forces from the planet than from the star. The
      star might still have some influence on the moon's motion, but the balance
      of forces should always drive the moon's rotation towards locking with its
      motion around the planet and not the star.<p>I've occasionally
      heard it proposed that a moon might have an orbit as long as its planet's
      year, such that it can be simultaneously tidal-locked to both planet and
      star, but this doesn't work out either; again, the
      <a href="https://worldbuildingpasta.blogspot.com/2019/09/an-apple-pie-from-scratch-part-iva.html#limitsandstability">physics works out</a></p></span><span>
      such that no moon can have an orbital period longer than about 58% the
      length of the planet's year, and realistically we'd expect most to have
      orbits limited to about 1/5 the length of the year. There is a point
      directly between the planet and star (the <b>L1 Lagrange point</b>) where
      their gravitational influence balances out such that a body can remain
      temporarily locked between the two, following the planet's orbit, but it's
      unstable, like a pencil balanced on its tip; any small perturbation will
      nudge the body away, such that it eventually moves off into another orbit,
      either of the planet or star.<br></span>
  </p>
  
  <p><span>Incidentally, a planet can also be tidal-locked to its moon, facing one
      side towards it as it orbits around the planet. Whether or not the balance
      of tidal forces favors this is more variable, depending on the particulars
      of the relative masses and distances of the objects involved (and in
      <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/754/1/51">some cases</a></span><span><span><sup>18</sup></span></span><span></span><span>
      it may change over the planet's lifetime). If it does happen, much of what
      is true for the surface climate and conditions of a tidal-locked moon are
      true of this sort of planet as well. We can also generally expect that the
      moon is already tidal-locked to the planet at this point, such that
      they're <b>mutually tidal-locked</b>, permanently facing each other, as is
      the case for Pluto and Charon.<br></span>
  </p>
  
  
</div>
<h3>
  <span>Polar Orientation<br></span>
</h3>
<p><span>A common exchange I see online is one person</span><span>
    asking what might happen if a planet had one of its poles pointed towards
    its star, and another person responding that this is equivalent to
    tidal-locking. In a very abstract and conceptual sense this is a reasonable
    response, in that tidal-locking is a realistic case for the idea of having a
    part of a planet permanently facing the star, but in the strictest sense
    it's not true; a tidal-locked planet still rotates, and so still has poles,
    which should usually be somewhere along the terminator, facing at right
    angles to the star rather than towards it.</span>

<p><span>Fair enough, but I sometimes also hear it proposed that perhaps a planet
    could actually keep one of its poles pointed towards the star if there was
    some secondary rotation turning the planet in addition to its main rotation
    around its poles. In isolation, this simply isn't geometrically possible;
    objects in 3-dimensional space can only ever rotate around one axis at a
    time. There would need to be some outside force continuously acting on the
    planet to alter its rotation to allow this to happen. Earth does experience
    some <b>precession</b></span><span>—continuous alteration of its rotational axis</span><span>—due to the influence of the other planets, and this is partially
    responsible for our cycle of cooler glacial periods and warmer interglacials
    (as shifts in axial tilt alter the amount of heating the polar regions get).
    But this is a minor shift over thousands of years. To have one of the poles
    kept pointed directly at the star at all times would, in terms of momentum
    change and energy required, be the equivalent of of stopping Earth's
    rotation completely, starting it at the same rate in the opposite direction,
    stopping the rotation again, and restarting the initial rotation every
    single orbit.</span>
</p>

<p><span>Earth has a total of 2.14 * 10</span><span><span><sup>29</sup></span></span><span>
    J of energy bound up in its rotation; for a planet with similar properties
    and rotation, this twice-over stopping and starting would require 4 times

    what's promptly reflected away) is only 1.74 * 10</span><span><span><sup>17</sup></span></span><span>
    W. Thus, even assuming there was some outside influence capable of providing
    that much power in that specific way, if even a tiny portion of that energy
    was ultimately released as heat (and really we wouldn't expect it to be an
    efficient process at all), it would be plenty sufficient to push the climate
    far past the bounds of habitability and roast the surface, perhaps even
    melting the planet entirely.</span>
</p>

<p><span>Setting that scenario aside, a planet that has one of its poles facing
    towards the sun at one point of the year and then continues on its orbit
    with a constant rotational axis</span><span>—</span><span>pointing each pole towards the sun in turn at opposite seasons</span><span>—</span><span>is a possibility (Uranus is close to this orientation) and has
    <a href="https://worldbuildingpasta.blogspot.com/2022/08/climate-explorations-obliquity.html">its own intriguing implications</a></span><span>
    for the surface climate.</span>
</p>

<p><span>A tidal-locked planet also doesn't need to have its poles pointed at exact
    right angles from the star at all times. Usually we would expect that,
    because the same tidal forces that cause tidal-locking also reduce axial
    tilt, a tidal-locked planet should have no tilt, but the influence of
    multiple other planets or stars
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17908">might lock one</a></span><span><span><sup>19</sup></span></span><span></span><span> into a
    "Cassini state" with some constant effective tilt relative to its orbit. In
    this case, the star would seem to shift north and then back south in the sky
    over the course of an orbit, and the terminator would shift as well,
    allowing for parts of the planet to have periods of day and night. Orbital
    eccentricity
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.01405">can similarly</a></span><span><span><sup>20</sup></span></span><span></span><span> shift the

  <h3>
    <span>Tidal-Locking Limits<br></span>
  </h3>
  <p><span>As mentioned, tidal-locking is expected to be more common in the
      habitable zones of smaller stars, because of how much stronger tidal
      forces should be in the closer habitable zones of these stars. Because of
      doubts about the habitability of tidal-locked planets</span><span>—</span><span>which, even with better and more encouraging climate modelling, still
      cannot be entirely dismissed without empirical evidence</span><span>—researchers investigating the limits of habitability around other stars
      have often found it prudent to indicate which stars are likely to have
      mostly tidal-locked planets. This is why you'll often see charts of the
      habitable zone marked with a line indicated as a "tidal-locking limit" or
      something similar.</span>
  </p>
  
  
  <p><span>This is a convenient way to make the implications of these charts
      readable both for those skeptical and optimistic about the prospects for
      habitable tidal-locked planets, but I think non-researchers sometimes
      misunderstand that line as an absolute limit; all planets on one side of
      the line <i>must</i> be tidal-locked and all those on the other side can
      <i>never</i> be tidal-locked.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p><span>In reality, whether or not a particular planet becomes tidal-locked
      depends on a number of factors beyond just distance from the star. First
      off, tidal-locking takes time; usually these charts assume an age of 4.5
      billion years, presuming that we're interested in habitable worlds with
      intelligent life and that might take about as long as it did on Earth. But
      depending on why you're interested in tidal-locking, you might be
      considering much younger or older planets.</span>

  </p>
  <p><span>The time tidal-locking takes also depends strongly on the initial
      rotation rate of the planet after it has formed; usually something like
      12-13 hour days are assumed for the purpose of drawing these limits in
      habitable zone diagrams (I'm not totally sure why, presumably based on
      some model of Earth's rotational evolution), but in reality it could vary
      greatly depending on random factors like the last few large impacts during
      formation. A planet might just happen to form with very slow rotation
      close to the synchronous rate, so in principle there's no strict outer
      limit where tidal-locking becomes impossible (though the further from the
      star, the more precisely the initial rotation has to happen to match the
      synchronous rate, so the chances of this happening drop pretty
      precipitously past a couple AU from a sun-mass star, for example). At the
      other extreme, a planet can only start out spinning so fast before it
      would tear itself apart with the centrifugal forces (in Earth's case the
      limit is about 2-hour days), so that gives us a more definitive inner
      limit where tidal-locking may be unavoidable (in this simple model,
      anyway).</span>

  <p><span>Finally, the planet's size and the nature of its response to tidal forces
      also have a small influence on the tidal-locking rate. The latter is a bit
      hard to pin down in a model so often represented as a single "dissipation
      factor"; it's generally taken to be about 12 for modern earth, but based
      on some models of the Earth's orbital evolution, may have been as high as
      100 in the past.</span>

    <h3>
      <span>Maybe Planets Won't Tidal-Lock<br></span>
    </h3>
  </p>
  <p><span>This isn't a widespread claim but it has started appearing lately in
      response to a couple recent papers investigating how additional tidal
      influences might prevent tidal-locking of planets that<span>—</span>based on the sort of simple modelling we went over above<span>—we would expect to lock otherwise.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p><span><span>First is a
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.01952.pdf">2015 paper</a></span></span><span><span><sup>24</sup></span></span><span></span><span><span> modelling the influence of a planet's thermal tide, a bulging of
        its atmosphere due to thermal expansion by day, and finding that in some
        cases it could act against the influence of the gravitational tides to
        prevent full tidal-locking, instead settling a planet into rotation
        slightly faster or slower than 1:1 resonance. The implications have
        seemingly been a bit garbled in interpretation; I've heard it claimed
        that the paper implies that any planet with an atmosphere will avoid
        tidal-locking around stars more than 1/4 the sun's mass, but the paper
        itself claims that an atmosphere 10 times denser than Earth's could
        prevent tidal locking for planets in the outer edge of the habitable
        zone of stars about 28% the sun's mass, but a more Earthlike atmosphere
        likely wouldn't stop tidal-locking near the inner HZ edge even for stars
        almost 70% the sun's mass.</span></span>

      has examined the tidal influence of multiple planets on each other in
      tightly-packed systems such as TRAPPIST-1. In these cases it seems that,
      though a planet may tidal-lock initially, the competing influences may
      cause chaotic shifts between synchronous and non-synchronous rotation, and
      substantial drift of the planet's orientation even when close to
      synchronous. Because such tightly-packed systems are expected to be common
      for small stars, this might indicate that such irregular rotation is the
      norm, rather than perfect tidal-locking. But the TRAPPIST-1 system is an
      extreme case, being near the minimum size for a main sequence star and so
      having its planets in very close orbits, with quite a few planets packed
      closely together even for a star of its type</span><span>—</span><span>the closest approach between the two innermost planets is less than twice
      the distance from the Earth to the Moon. For a more moderate case, say, a
      planet pair orbiting a star half the sun's mass, these chaotic
      interactions
      <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/472/3/3217/4082845">can still occur</a></span><span><span><sup>26</sup></span></span><span></span><span>
      but it seems to take a substantially larger neighboring planet orbiting
      quite close in something near to an orbital resonance. Planets in more
      loosely packed systems (or completely alone) could still experience tidal
      locking around any of these stars.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p><span>Still, because this mechanism is strongest for the smallest stars, it
      neatly fills the gaps left by the other mechanisms that could prevent
      tidal-locking; there is, it seems no range of stellar masses for which
      perfect 1:1 synchronous rotation is the only guaranteed outcome for
      habitable-zone planets, nor is there a specific range beyond which
      tidal-locking is forbidden, though the overall trends definitely still
      favor more frequent tidal-locking for smaller stars.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p><span>Besides these new proposals, it's been known for some time that planets
      with some initial orbital eccentricity
      <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103507003077">could end up</a></span><span><span><sup>30</sup></span></span><span></span><span>
      locked into various other types of spin-orbit resonances, giving them a
      more regular day and night cycle</span><span>—though a quite slow one. Such resonances aren't necessarily as stable,
      though; in the habitable zones of the smallest stars, they could be
      accompanied by
      <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aab845">intense tidal heating</a></span><span><span><sup>31</sup></span></span><span></span><span>, enough to partially melt their interiors and alter their tidal dynamics
      enough to break the resonance and settle into the more typical 1:1
      resonance.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p><span>As mentioned, a large, close-orbiting moon could also outcompete a star's
      influence and force the planet to tidal-lock to it rather than the star,
      giving the planet more regular days and nights. However, in any such case
      the overall interactions between star, planet, and moon will cause the
      moon's orbit to migrate towards or away from the planet (more likely the
      latter for the mutually tidal-locked state), and the moon can only migrate
      so far before escaping the planet's orbit or falling below its Roche limit
      and breaking apart. The closer the planet to the star and the stronger the
      tidal forces involved, the quicker this will happen, so Earthlike
      habitable-zone planets orbiting stars less than about half the sun's mass

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>At around 9 <em>A.M.</em> every weekday, a crow caws in the Jardin des Plantes, the oldest botanical garden in Paris. The sound is a warning to every other crow: Frédéric Jiguet, a tall ornithologist whose dark hair is graying around the ears, has shown up for work. As Jiguet walks to his office at the French National Museum of Natural History, which is on the garden’s grounds, dozens of the black vandals take to the trees and rain abuse on him, as though he were a condemned man. “I think I’m the best friend of French crows,” Jiguet told me. “But I am probably the man they hate most.”</p><p>Crows are famous for holding grudges. Their beef with Jiguet started in 2015, when the Paris government hired him to study their movements around the city. Farmers blame crows for crop damage, and hunters shoot hundreds of thousands of the birds each year; in Paris, some district managers wanted permission to cull them for tearing into trash bags and digging up lawns. But Jiguet questioned the wisdom of killing so many crows. “It costs a lot to destroy pests,” he remembers thinking. “Can it really be efficient to destroy all these lives?”</p><p>Outside his office, Jiguet began baiting net traps with kitchen scraps such as raw eggs and bits of chicken. He removed one bird at a time with his bare hands. Then he stuffed the bird into a cloth tube that he had cut from his daughter’s leggings, to immobilize the bird while he recorded its weight on a scale. Finally, he strapped a colorful ring, which was labelled with a three-digit number, to the bird’s leg.</p><p>Eventually, Jiguet erected a metal cage the size of a wood shed in the garden, to trap the birds. Crows could fly in, but they couldn’t escape until Jiguet let them out. Although some of the birds meekly accepted their fates, some pecked at him furiously when he ringed their legs.</p><p>Over the years, Jiguet has caught and released more than thirteen hundred crows. He also built a Web site where people could report sightings. These efforts revealed a big shakeup every spring, in which year-old crows flew the coop and looked for new habitats. Some Parisian crows were spotted as far away as the Dutch countryside, but most formed new flocks in the city’s green spaces, where there was garbage to eat. Jiguet convinced the city government that there was no point in trying to kill a park’s crows: after all, new ones would arrive within a year. “This project definitely changed the view of Parisian politicians on crows,” he said. Recently, he published a book about coexisting with crows.</p><p>The birds were not very appreciative, however. Many of them remembered when Jiguet had caged, manhandled, and banded them. Some had never flown into his trap, but still learned from their peers and joined in the cawing. Crows even recognized him when he showed up for work in a surgical mask, after months of working from home during the pandemic. Jiguet, a lifelong bird-watcher, was learning how it feels when birds watch back.</p><p>For most of the twentieth century, psychologists dismissed the interior lives of birds because avian brains are smaller and differently structured than those of mammals. But it turns out that bird brains are much denser with neurons and consume less energy, giving crows similar cognitive abilities to large-brained mammals such as great apes, elephants, and whales. John Marzluff, an ecologist in Seattle, once wore a rubber caveman mask while catching and releasing seven crows on his university campus; eighteen years later, crows that weren’t alive for the original experiment still caw at the mask. “I really didn’t know they were paying that much attention to me,” Marzluff told me recently. His study showed that crows not only retain long-term memories but also learn from their peers and pass behaviors from one generation to the next. Other experiments have shown that members of the corvid family, which includes crows, jays, and magpies, can read one another’s intentions, plan for the future, and solve puzzles using abstract reasoning and tools.</p><p>To Jiguet, the ridicule of the crows was a revelation. “I’m just realizing how intelligent they are,” he told me. When birds warn one another about individual humans, biologists understand them to have their own culture—defined as a behavioral tradition that a population maintains not through genetic inheritance but through social learning. That struck Jiguet as a cause for celebration, not culling. Wasn’t there a better way to relate to clever creatures? Or was cleverness precisely what made them pests? “It’s hard to live with animals that are intelligent,” Jiguet said. “They can challenge you, and you have to adapt.”</p><p>The nearly fifty species of crow, which include ravens and rooks, emerged long before human civilization. Unlike house sparrows and street pigeons, single species that humans helped to introduce to urban spaces, different crows adapted to different places: American crows to Seattle, house crows to Delhi, large-billed crows to Tokyo, carrion crows to Paris. “All the things we do to make our lives comfortable feed into what they need for habitat and food and shelter,” Marzluff told me. Vast flocks of crows can survive on what humans throw away.</p><p>In 2008, Joshua Klein, a hacker who often wore tight black T-shirts, gave a <em>TED</em> talk about the intelligence of crows. Crows are notorious dumpster divers, but Klein was convinced that a “crow vending machine” could train them to collect trash and other items, like coins. “Let’s build something that’s mutually beneficial,” he said, “and find some way to make a new relationship with these species.”</p><p>First, Klein planned to mix food and coins on the machine’s platform. Once crows got used to feeding there, he would remove the food. When hungry crows knocked a coin down a chute, whether by accident or in frustration, a sensor would command the machine to release some food. Klein predicted that a few crows would learn the association between their undirected action and the reward, and start bringing coins of their own accord. Others would then copy the behavior.</p><p>Millions of people watched Klein’s presentation, and in 2008, the New York <em>Times Magazine</em> reported that he had successfully built his machine. But the magazine effectively retracted the story after discovering that he had exaggerated his success. (Klein said that the errors were the result of a misunderstanding.) Crows were certainly intelligent enough to associate coin or trash collection with food rewards, but they had plenty of other places to eat. In the real world, they largely avoided Klein’s noisy device.</p><p>Although Klein failed, his idea caught on. Designers in the Netherlands and an entrepreneur in Sweden tried to build their own machines; a few hobbyists even managed to teach magpies to bring bottle caps to back-yard machines. However, no one managed to disrupt the waste-collection business with a flock of garbage birds. “We didn’t have a fully working device that was tested with crows,” Ruben van der Vleuten, the Dutch co-founder of a 2017 project to clean up cigarette butts called Crowded Cities, told me. “At the same time, this thing was going viral. We were in so many media outlets.” There <em>was</em> social learning going on—but not in crows. Rather, humans seemed to understand that, in the attention economy, clicks and eyeballs were their own rewards.</p><p>In 2020, another business-school graduate, Jules Mollaret, set out to build a new vending machine for crows, which would exchange trash for bird food. He founded a Marseille-based company, Birds for Change, that aimed to educate people about crows and plastic waste, and he asked Jiguet whether he could experiment in the Jardin des Plantes. “I thought it was a very good opportunity to change people’s mind on the species,” Jiguet told me. He gave Mollaret permission to install the machine in part of the garden where students grow grapes.</p><p>I was intrigued by Mollaret’s experiment because I often <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/the-strangeness-of-our-animal-bonds">fed</a> crows on my apartment balcony, in Berlin. What started as a pandemic-era distraction became an obsession and a daily routine. I had always thought of animal intelligence as something remote and endangered: the most famous brainy beasts, such as chimpanzees and orcas, lived in distant forests and open oceans, not cities. But, in Berlin, a handful of peanuts was enough to bring animal intelligence to me. The same cognitive skills that help crows recognize threats enabled these birds to recognize me as a source of peanuts—and soon they started waking me up at five in the morning, by knocking on my window with their beaks.</p><p>When I called Mollaret, he told me that, after almost two years of tinkering with the machine, the crows were nearing the end of their training. They were almost ready to collect bottle caps on their own, he said. And so, on a bright September morning, I arrived at the Jardin des Plantes. (I knew the garden as the place where Ralph Waldo Emerson deepened his interest in natural history; after visiting in 1833, he wrote that “the limits of the possible are enlarged” here.) I found a bench near Mollaret’s machine.</p></div></div>]]></description>

                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — A former software engineer at Google has been charged with stealing artificial intelligence trade secrets from the company while secretly working with two companies based in China, the Justice Department said Wednesday.</p><p>Linwei Ding, a Chinese national, was arrested in Newark, California, on four counts of federal trade secret theft, each punishable by up to 10 years in prison.</p><p>The case against Ding, 38, was announced at an American Bar Association conference in San Francisco by Attorney General Merrick Garland, who along with other law enforcement leaders has repeatedly warned about the threat of Chinese economic espionage and about the national security concerns posed by advancements in artificial intelligence and other developing technologies.</p><p>“Today’s charges are the latest illustration of the lengths affiliates of companies based in the People’s Republic of China are willing to go to steal American innovation,” FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement. “The theft of innovative technology and trade secrets from American companies can cost jobs and have devastating economic and national security consequences.”</p>




    

<p>Google said it had determined that the employee had stolen “numerous documents” and referred the matter to law enforcement.</p><p>“We have strict safeguards to prevent the theft of our confidential commercial information and trade secrets,” Google spokesman Jose Castaneda said in a statement. “After an investigation, we found that this employee stole numerous documents, and we quickly referred the case to law enforcement. We are grateful to the FBI for helping protect our information and will continue cooperating with them closely.” </p>
    
<p>A lawyer listed as Ding’s defense attorney had no comment Wednesday evening.</p><p>Artificial intelligence is the main battleground for competitors in the field of high technology, and the question of who dominates can have major commercial and security implications. Justice Department leaders in recent weeks have been sounding alarms about how foreign adversaries could harness AI technologies to negatively affect the United States.</p>
    

<p>Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a speech last month that the administration’s multi-agency Disruptive Technology Strike Force would place AI at the top of its enforcement priority list, and <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/fbi-election-interference-wray-2024-campaign-ai-a0c4a95c818839b18f919c6d648c4dcf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wray told a conference last week</a></span> that AI and other emerging technologies had made it easier for adversaries to try to interfere with the American political process.</p><p>Garland echoed those concerns at the San Francisco event, saying Wednesday that, “As with all evolving technologies, (AI) has pluses and minuses, advantages and disadvantages, great promise and the risk of great harm.”</p><p>The indictment unsealed Wednesday in the Northern District of California alleges that Ding, who was hired by Google in 2019 and had access to confidential information about the company’s supercomputing data centers, began uploading hundreds of files into a personal Google Cloud account two years ago.</p><p>Within weeks of the theft starting, prosecutors say, Ding was offered the position of chief technology officer at an early-stage technology company in China that touted its use of AI technology and that offered him a monthly salary of about $14,800, plus an annual bonus and company stock. The indictment says Ding traveled to China and participated in investor meetings at the company and sought to raise capital for it. </p>
    

<p>He also separately founded and served as chief executive of a China-based startup company that aspired to train “large AI models powered by supercomputing chips,” the indictment said. </p><p>Prosecutors say Ding did not disclose either affiliation to Google, which described him Wednesday as a junior employee.</p><p>He resigned from Google last Dec. 26. </p><p>Three days later, Google officials learned that he had presented as CEO of one of the Chinese companies at an investor conference in Beijing. Officials also reviewed surveillance footage showing that another employee had scanned Ding’s access badge at the Google building in the U.S. where he worked to make it look like Ding was there during times when he was actually in China, the indictment says.</p>
    

<p>Google suspended Ding’s network access and locked his laptop, and discovered his unauthorized uploads while searching his network activity history. </p><p>The FBI in January served a search warrant at Ding’s home and seized his electronic devices, and later executed an additional warrant for the contents of his personal accounts containing more than 500 unique files of confidential information that authorities say he stole from Google.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


  
<p><strong>7 March 2024</strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Europe’s top court rules that IAB Europe is responsible under the GDPR for the “TCF” consent spam popups that appear on almost every website</em></strong> </p>



<p>Europe’s highest court today delivered a judgement about the consent spam popups that have plagued people for years all over the Internet in Europe. The Court has ruled that IAB Europe, a tracking industry association, is responsible under the GDPR for the “Transparency and Consent Framework” (TCF)  consent system. Google, Amazon, Microsoft, TikTok, and hundreds of other tracking-based online advertising companies rely on IAB Europe’s consent system, which Europe’s data protection authorities have already found to be in violation of the GDPR following our complaint.</p>



<p>IAB Europe commits multiple violations of the GDPR in its processing of personal data in the context of its TCF and the “Real-Time Bidding” (RTB) online advertising system. The TCF has been used to falsely legitimise the indiscriminate broadcasting of personal data of millions of people in Europe to companies everywhere, including to companies in China and Russia.<a id="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> This happens 71 trillion times per year.<a id="_ftnref2" href="#_ftn2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>



<p>IAB Europe argued that it is not responsible under the GDPR as a “data controller” because it allegedly only sets the rules for how data should be used, but does not process the data itself. The Court rightly rejected this, and confirmed that IAB Europe, as management body for the TCF, is a “data controller” under the GDPR.</p>



<p>The Court’s ruling today shows just how broad the protection of people’s personal data is in Europe. The online tracking and advertising industry is surreptitiously collecting and broadcasting highly sensitive data about everyone who uses the internet. Today’s decision will force the industry to change profoundly. Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and so on can no longer evade their responsibilities by claiming that the data they use is not protected by the law.</p>



<p>“<em>People across Europe have been plagued by fake “consent” popups every day on almost every website and app since the GDPR was introduced almost six years ago</em>”, said Dr Johnny Ryan of ICCL Enforce. “<em>IAB Europe has sought to evade its responsibility for this charade. But the European Court of Justice has set it straight. This decision will not only end the biggest spam operation in history. It will deal a mortal wound to the online tracking-based advertising industry.</em>” </p>



<p><strong>The Court’s summary&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2024-03/cp240044en.pdf">https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2024-03/cp240044en.pdf</a></p>



<p><strong>Background&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The questions answered by the Court today were posed complainants coordinated by Enforce, a unit of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL). The group of complainants includes:&nbsp;Dr Johnny Ryan of <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/enforce/">Enforce</a>, Katarzyna Szymielewicz of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.panoptykon.org/">Panoptykon Foundation</a> (Poland),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bitsoffreedom.nl/">Stichting Bits of Freedom</a>&nbsp;(the Netherlands),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.liguedh.be/">Ligue des Droits Humains</a> (Belgium),&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Jausl00s">Dr Jef Ausloos</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/PiDewitte">Dr Pierre Dewitte</a>. The ruling follows complaints about the insecurity of the online advertising “Real-Time Bidding” (RTB) system that Dr Ryan initiated in 2018.</p>



<p>On 2 February 2022 the Belgian Data Protection Authority, in agreement with 27 other EU data protection authorities, ruled that the “TCF” consent spam system is illegal.<a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> This decision meant that the entire online advertising had unlawfully processed the data of everyone in Europe for years.</p>



<p>However, this was appealed at the Brussels Markets Court. First, IAB Europe appealed the substance of the decision, and the complainants appealed against part of its implementation. Questions that the complainants proposed were referred by the Brussels Markets Court to the European Court of Justice in September 2023.</p>



<p>The Brussels Markets Court can now proceed to rule on the matter with certainty that IAB Europe is indeed responsible, and that the data concerned are protected by the GDPR.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why TinyWasm?</h2><a id="user-content-why-tinywasm" aria-label="Permalink: Why TinyWasm?" href="#why-tinywasm"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Tiny</strong>: TinyWasm is designed to be as small as possible without significantly compromising performance or functionality (&lt; 6000 lines of code).</li>
<li><strong>Portable</strong>: TinyWasm runs on any platform that Rust can target, including other WebAssembly Runtimes, with minimal external dependencies.</li>
<li><strong>Lightweight</strong>: TinyWasm is easy to integrate and has a low call overhead, making it suitable for scripting and embedding.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Status</h2><a id="user-content-status" aria-label="Permalink: Status" href="#status"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">As of version <code>0.3.0</code>, TinyWasm successfully passes all the WebAssembly 1.0 tests in the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/testsuite">WebAssembly Test Suite</a>. Work on the 2.0 tests is ongoing. This enables TinyWasm to run most WebAssembly programs, including executing TinyWasm itself compiled to WebAssembly (see <a href="https://github.com/explodingcamera/tinywasm/blob/main/examples/wasm-rust.rs">examples/wasm-rust.rs</a>). The results of the testsuites are available <a href="https://github.com/explodingcamera/tinywasm/tree/main/crates/tinywasm/tests/generated">here</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The API is still unstable and may change at any time, so you probably don't want to use it in production <em>yet</em>. TinyWasm isn't primarily designed for high performance; it focuses more on simplicity, size, and portability. More details on its performance can be found in <a href="https://github.com/explodingcamera/tinywasm/blob/main/BENCHMARKS.md">BENCHMARKS.md</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Future Development</strong>: The first major version will focus on improving the API and adding support for <a href="https://wasi.dev/" rel="nofollow">WASI</a>. While doing so, I also want to further simplify and reduce the codebase's size and improve the parser's performance.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">TinyWasm can be used through the <code>tinywasm-cli</code> CLI tool or as a library in your Rust project. Documentation can be found <a href="https://docs.rs/tinywasm" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Library</h3><a id="user-content-library" aria-label="Permalink: Library" href="#library"></a></p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">CLI</h3><a id="user-content-cli" aria-label="Permalink: CLI" href="#cli"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The CLI is mainly available for testing purposes, but can also be used to run WebAssembly programs.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Feature Flags</h2><a id="user-content-feature-flags" aria-label="Permalink: Feature Flags" href="#feature-flags"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong><code>std</code></strong><br>
Enables the use of <code>std</code> and <code>std::io</code> for parsing from files and streams. This is enabled by default.</li>
<li><strong><code>logging</code></strong><br>
Enables logging using the <code>log</code> crate. This is enabled by default.</li>
<li><strong><code>parser</code></strong><br>
Enables the <code>tinywasm-parser</code> crate. This is enabled by default.</li>
<li><strong><code>archive</code></strong><br>
Enables pre-parsing of archives. This is enabled by default.</li>
<li><strong><code>unsafe</code></strong><br>
Uses <code>unsafe</code> code to improve performance, particularly in Memory access.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">With all these features disabled, TinyWasm only depends on <code>core</code>, <code>alloc</code> ,and <code>libm</code> and can be used in <code>no_std</code> environments.
Since <code>libm</code> is not as performant as the compiler's math intrinsics, it is recommended to use the <code>std</code> feature if possible (at least <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/2505" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/2505/hovercard">for now</a>), especially on wasm32 targets.</p>
