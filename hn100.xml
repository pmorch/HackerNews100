<p dir="auto">Insomnium is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/ArchGPT/insomnia">Kong/Insomnia at 2023.5.8</a>, the last commit before compulsory account login was introduced. In a sense, Insomnium is a community response to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37680522" rel="nofollow">the latest product update that forces account creation w/o warning</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">I was among the users who were deeply affected by the recent change. I still think Insomnia is a nice product in general, but I have to disagree with the direction it is going. So I have decided to fork it and make it 100% local and privacy-focus.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-roadmap" dir="auto"><a href="#roadmap">Roadmap</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">I have removed user login, tracking, analytics, etc, from Insomnia so it is now a 100% local app. I will be cleaning up the code to make the UI faster, and refactor the local database and config to keep everything lean. If you have any feature request or encountered any bug, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/ArchGPT/insomnium/issues">open an issue</a>. Thanks!</p>
<p dir="auto">I'm also working on a Code Llama plugin for Insomnium to make it more easily customizable and extensible, while keeping the core product fast and 100% local.</p>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Recent advances in generative imagery have brought forth outpainting 
            and inpainting models that can produce high-quality, plausible image 
            content in unknown regions, but the content these models hallucinate is 
            necessarily inauthentic, since the models lack sufficient context about 
            the true scene. In this work, we propose <strong><em>RealFill</em></strong>, a novel 
            generative approach for image completion that fills in missing regions 
            of an image with the content that <u><em>should have been there</em></u>. 
            RealFill is a generative inpainting model that is personalized using 
            only a few reference images of a scene. These reference images do not 
            have to be aligned with the target image, and can be taken with drastically 
            varying viewpoints, lighting conditions, camera apertures, or image styles. 
            Once personalized, RealFill is able to complete a target image with visually 
            compelling contents that are faithful to the original scene. 
            We evaluate RealFill on a new image completion benchmark that covers a set 
            of diverse and challenging scenarios, and find that it outperforms existing 
            approaches by a large margin. 
          </p>

    <h2>Method</h2>
  </p>
  <div>
          <p> 
            <strong>Authentic Image Completion</strong>: 
            Given a few reference images (up to five) and one target image that 
            captures roughly the same scene (but in a different arrangement or appearance), 
            we aim to fill missing regions of the target image with high-quality image 
            content that is faithful to the originally captured scene. Note that 
            for the sake of practical benefit, we focus particularly on the 
            more challenging, unconstrained setting in which the target 
            and reference images may have very different viewpoints, 
            environmental conditions, camera apertures, image styles, or even moving objects.
          </p>
          <p>  
            <strong>RealFill</strong>:
            For a given scene, we first create a personalized generative model by fine-tuning 
            a pre-trained inpainting diffusion model on the reference and target images. 
            This fine-tuning process is designed such that the adapted model not only 
            maintains a good image prior, but also learns the contents, lighting, 
            and style of the scene in the input images. We then use this fine-tuned model to 
            fill the missing regions in the target image through a standard diffusion sampling process.
          </p>
      </div>

    <h2>Results</h2>
  </p>
  <div>
        <p> 
            Given the reference images on the left, RealFill is able to either uncrop or inpaint 
            the target image on the right, resulting in high-quality images that are 
            both visually compelling and also faithful to the references, 
            even when there are large differences between references and targets including 
            viewpoint, aperture, lighting, image style, and object motion.
          </p>
      </div>

    <h2>Comparison with Baselines</h2>
  </p>
 
  <div>
          <p>
            A comparison of RealFill and baseline methods. 
            Transparent white masks are overlayed on the 
            unaltered known regions of the target images.
            </p><ul>
              <li>
                Paint-by-Example does not achieve high scene fidelity because it 
                relies on CLIP embeddings, which only capture high-level semantic information.
              </li> 
              <li>
                Stable Diffusion Inpainting produces plausible results, 
                they are inconsistent with the reference images because 
                prompts have limited expressiveness.
              </li> 
            </ul><p>
            In contrast, RealFill generates high-quality results that have high 
            fidelity with respect to the reference images.

      <h3>Limitations</h3>
        
        <div>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              RealFill needs to go through a gradient-based fine-tuning process 
              on input images, rendering it relatively slow.
            </li>

            <li>
              When viewpoint change between reference and target images is very large, 
              RealFill tends to fail at recovering the 3D scene, especially when 
              there is only a single reference image.
            </li>

            <li>
              Because RealFill mainly relies on the image prior inherited from the 
              base pre-trained model, it also fails to handle cases where that are 
              challenging for the base model, such as text for Stable Diffusion.
            </li>
          </ul>

<!--kg-card-end: html--><p>I recently got my hands on an ordinary-looking iPhone-to-HDMI adapter that mimics Apple’s branding and, when plugged in, runs a program that implores you to “Scan QR code for use.” That QR code takes you to an ad-riddled website that asks you to download an app that asks for your location data, access to your photos and videos, runs a bizarre web browser, installs tracking cookies, takes “sensor data,” and uses that data to target you with ads. The adapter’s app also kindly informed me that it’s sending all of my data to China.</p><p>The cord was discovered by <a href="https://twitter.com/RDKLInc?ref=404media.co">friend of 404 Media John Bumstead</a>, an electronics refurbisher and artist who buys devices in bulk from electronics recyclers. Bumstead tweeted about the cord and was kind enough to send me one so I could try it myself.

After I had powered on the adapter (it requires a separate lightning cable to power it) and connected it to my monitor, a screen with a QR code, a serial number, and the branding “LIVE TV” popped up. I scanned the cord and was taken to the website for EZ Cast, an adapter company that claims to have “more than 10M users around the world who use the complete EZ Cast solution for work and leisure applications.”</p><p>Cybersecurity firm Check Point <a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/research/youre-watching-tv-is-it-also-watching-you/?ref=404media.co">previously analyzed what it described as an “EZCast dongle.”</a> The company found it was easy to brute force the device’s 8-digit numeric password. Check Point writes it contacted EZCast about its findings back in 2016, but did not receive a response. “The EZCast device was never designed with security in mind,” Check Point writes.</p><p>The portal has a headline that says “We do not charge any fees on our website!” and displayed an ad for something called “<a href="https://malwaretips.com/blogs/fanjestic-com-a-dubious-free-trial-offer-explained/?ref=404media.co">FANJESTIC</a>,” which is ostensibly a streaming service that the company is trying to get users to sign up for (and does indeed require a credit card, and costs $49.95 a month). The site <a href="https://malwaretips.com/blogs/fanjestic-com-a-dubious-free-trial-offer-explained/?ref=404media.co">MalwareTips.com</a> has identified this as an autobilling site that is difficult to cancel. FANJESTIC is not the same as the EZ Cast app that the QR code ultimately got me to download in order to use it. The QR code page also has an infographic that implores me click “Trust this computer” when I plug my iPhone in (an ordinary HDMI cable should not be detected as a “computer,” for what it’s worth). </p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/09/IMG_2388-2.PNG" width="1242" height="2688" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/IMG_2388-2.PNG 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/09/IMG_2388-2.PNG 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/09/IMG_2388-2.PNG 1242w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/09/IMG_2389-2.PNG" width="1242" height="2688" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/IMG_2389-2.PNG 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/09/IMG_2389-2.PNG 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/09/IMG_2389-2.PNG 1242w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div><div><p><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/09/IMG_2390-2.PNG" width="1242" height="2688" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/IMG_2390-2.PNG 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/09/IMG_2390-2.PNG 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/09/IMG_2390-2.PNG 1242w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/09/IMG_2391-2.PNG" width="1242" height="2688" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/IMG_2391-2.PNG 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/09/IMG_2391-2.PNG 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/09/IMG_2391-2.PNG 1242w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></div></figure><p>Because I enjoy living dangerously, I did plug my phone in, unlocked it with my passcode, trusted the “computer” and let the website take me to the App Store, where I downloaded the EZ Cast App, which has a 2.1/5 rating and 878 reviews. Example reviews: “It’s not working.” “Useless and frustrating.” “Why go through all this trouble for a mirroring device?” “I don’t understand why I have to buy an app from a third party company to use what looks to be an apple product in appearance” “SCAM!” “Doesn’t work,” “Don’t fall for this app at a karaoke machine,” “Totally fake … It makes me suspicious of Spyware. This App and the cable = JUNK.” Some of the reviews said they bought the cable from Amazon, another mentions it came from Walmart, another mentions eBay.</p><p>After opening the app, I was immediately prompted to give EZ Cast my location and to accept a Privacy Policy from a company called Actions Microelectronics Co., Ltd. that says EZ Cast would be collecting my email address, use tracking cookies, take my location, track my “favorite videos, videos watched, and bookmarks,” as well as “Location Data, Sensor Data, Tracking Cookies Data, Installed Apps Data,” and would be using that data to target ads to me. It also required access to my Local Network, asked for access to my photos, settings, Bluetooth, and camera.</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-29-at-7.38.47-AM.png" width="820" height="1670" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-29-at-7.38.47-AM.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-29-at-7.38.47-AM.png 820w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/09/IMG_2394-2.PNG" width="1242" height="2688" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/IMG_2394-2.PNG 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/09/IMG_2394-2.PNG 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/09/IMG_2394-2.PNG 1242w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div><div><p><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/09/IMG_2400-2.PNG" width="1242" height="2688" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/IMG_2400-2.PNG 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/09/IMG_2400-2.PNG 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/09/IMG_2400-2.PNG 1242w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/09/IMG_2402-2.PNG" width="1242" height="2688" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/IMG_2402-2.PNG 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/09/IMG_2402-2.PNG 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/09/IMG_2402-2.PNG 1242w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></div></figure><p>After doing all of this, I was able to mirror my screen from my iPhone to my monitor. It insisted it needed all of this data in order to mirror the screen from my phone to a monitor that I owned, via a cable that is physically connected between the two. It said it would share this data with advertisers, and that “If you are located outside China and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including Personal Data, to China and process it there” (it should be noted that China-based companies are required by law to store customer data in China, so perhaps this specific provision isn’t that odd or surprising, but the the privacy policy about my data ending up in China was refreshingly blunt.) </p><p>Almost anything I tried to do on the EZ Cast app required a permission of some sort, and ads for streaming services and other apps popped up almost anytime I clicked anything. The app also has its own specific embedded web browser, as well as a specific quasi streaming service called “EZChannel,” which is just an interface for playing YouTube videos, which also requires access to your location. The app also has a camera function that lets you doodle on images, for some reason. It also turned on four different analytics trackers, including something it calls “Google Analytics for dongles,” a term that, when Googled, returns nothing remotely useful. </p><p>While I was interested in getting this cable because I’m generally obsessed with weird cables and crappy gadgets, the existence of this adapter is actually particularly relevant given the FTC’s lawsuit against Amazon, which blasts the company for making its site harder to navigate and for placing tons of spammy ads where relevant search results used to be. A quick search shows various <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/j3hv7r/lightning_to_hdmi_adaptor/?ref=404media.co">Reddit</a> users who are confused by the QR code, some of whom said they <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/ceum22/what_does_trusting_a_computer_entail/?ref=404media.co">bought the cable on Amazon</a>. Bumstead is almost positive that the cord itself came from Amazon leftovers or returns. Amazon does have an EZCast store, but it’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/51B4634F-BD48-4A08-97A7-14480E3A2D76/search?ref_=ast_bln&amp;terms=lightning&amp;ref=404media.co">not currently selling this specific cord</a>, from what I can tell.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ynnZxKyzEz4KLL94wzaHKw7CHIdMMc6WbR6NOrWGubKTTZde6gmMxs2uAbEGs18wY_kTMaaRX-TsR2Yv5-31JFGCIrnl5bp1KKcsmjOd5_8jL044g2jlllQz8gOL1vswc-Ln0ZiepeAt1cGrXGPqQlI" alt="" loading="lazy" width="624" height="833"><figcaption>Some of the cords John Bumstead got. Image: John Bumstead</figcaption></figure><p>“A lot of recyclers end up with Amazon returns boxes, you can buy them for a certain amount of money from Amazon or their partners. They tend to have a bunch of cables on the bottom since they fall below the big items. So I’ve had recyclers dump the ‘crumbs’ into a single box and sell them to me.” Bumstead told me, adding that he had between 20 and 30 of these cords. “It’s pretty wacky stuff and lots of fun, you get bizarre gizmos you’ve never heard of, ie little robots that walk around when you plug their cable into usb, cables that glow in patterns, etc.”</p><p>“I should say I don’t know 100% it’s ALL originating from Amazon, but that’s what all the recyclers in question have told me and shown me when I was there,” he added. “Amazon does dump a lot of stuff that sellers have warehoused via FBA and choose not to have it sent back to them.”</p>

				<p id="speakable-summary"><span>The liquidators behind</span> Three Arrows Capital (3AC), the now-defunct crypto hedge fund, shared that the firm’s co-founder Su Zhu was arrested in Singapore at the Changi Airport while trying to leave the country.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.teneo.com/service/financial-advisory/sector-expertise/financial-services/cryptocurrencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teneo</a>, a financial advisory firm controlling the liquidation and management of affairs for the defunct crypto hedge fund, said it got a “committal order” against Zhu after he failed to comply with court orders to cooperate with the liquidation investigation. The order sentenced Zhu to four months in prison, according to a statement.</p>
<p>The advisory firm added that a similar committal order was granted against the other 3AC co-founder, Kyle Davies, who is also being called for four month imprisonment. Davies’ whereabouts remain unknown, according to Teneo.</p>
<p>For context, the firm once managed an estimated $10 billion in assets and was a major entity among crypto market players. In July 2022, 3AC <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/01/crypto-mega-hedge-fund-three-arrows-capital-reportedly-files-for-bankruptcy-in-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy</a> in New York.</p>
<p>The hedge fund’s prior insolvency forced major crypto players to rearrange their operations and limit customer withdrawals amid a crypto sell-off that seemed to catch plenty of mega firms off guard at the time, after the collapse of the Terra/LUNA project.</p>
<p>Teneo did not immediately reply to a request for comment from TechCrunch.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://proton.me/blog/google-lobbying">https://proton.me/blog/google-lobbying</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37705368">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><time datetime="2023-09-29T09:52:34">Published on September 29, 2023</time></p>
<p>In the public eye, Google presents itself as a champion of privacy. “Privacy is at the heart of everything we do,” its CEO <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/1275835273637576704?lang=en">said<span>(new window)</span></a>.</p>



<p>But behind closed doors, Google is telling a different story to policymakers and actively fighting against privacy laws that would protect you from online surveillance.</p>



<p>We’ve identified numerous examples of Google’s multi-million-dollar lobbying efforts around the world to try to prevent elected officials from protecting your data. From the United States to Europe and beyond, lawmakers increasingly want to respond to public demands for regulations against rampant data exploitation by Big Tech. Google’s lobbyists are there, trying to stop them.</p>



<p>Just as the world’s largest environmental polluters have resorted to “greenwashing” to portray themselves as eco-conscious, Google and other Big Tech companies have used “privacy washing” to avoid scrutiny of their business models.</p>



<p>A simple review of Google’s lobbying efforts shows the hypocrisy behind its marketing.</p>



<h2>Here’s Google’s true position on privacy</h2>



<p>Google spends massive amounts of money to influence elected officials. Since 2019, Alphabet and its subsidiaries have spent more than $125 million on federal lobbying, campaign contributions, and trade associations, according to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/clients/summary?cycle=2022&amp;id=D000067823">lobbying reports<span>(new window)</span></a> and other records.</p>



<p>One of the issues it cares about is privacy — but not protecting it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Google’s view is that “requiring individuals to control every aspect of data processing can create a complex experience that diverts attention from the most important controls without corresponding benefits”, according to its <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/google_framework_responsible_data_protection_regulation.pdf">policy statement<span>(new window)</span></a>.</p>



<p><strong>This is not privacy.</strong> If a company is using your data in ways that are too complicated for you to understand and consent to, then it should never have access to your data in the first place.</p>



<p>Google wants regulators to let companies themselves decide what’s good for you and for society. “Organizations must … take responsibility for using data in a way that provides value to individuals and society and minimizes the risk of harm based on the use of personal information.”</p>



<p>But Big Tech has had this responsibility for decades. The companies’ failures are the reason people are now calling on regulators to protect them from Big Tech.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Pre-empting democracy in the United States</h2>



<p>In 2018, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa#:~:text=The%20California%20Consumer%20Privacy%20Act,how%20to%20implement%20the%20law">California passed the United States’ first online privacy law<span>(new window)</span></a>, giving residents the right to know what data big companies collect about them, to see how they use it, and to delete it upon request. The law took effect Jan. 1, 2020. </p>



<p>It’s the most sweeping general privacy law in the US to date, and that made Google worried.</p>



<p>Before the law kicked in, Google tried to push for last-minute changes that would have exempted its business model from certain requirements. The proposed amendment reportedly sought to allow Google and other companies “to continue collecting user data for targeted advertising, and in some cases, the right to do so even if users opt out”, Bloomberg <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-09-04/google-and-other-tech-companies-attempt-to-water-down-privacy-law">reported<span>(new window)</span></a> at the time.</p>



<p>Although that attempt <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gibsondunn.com/california-consumer-privacy-act-2019-final-amendments-signed">failed<span>(new window)</span></a>, Google and other Big Tech companies appear to have learned not to wait for democracy to run its course. Instead, hundreds of lobbyists have blitzed other state capitals promoting their own watered-down privacy laws. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://fpf.org/blog/effective-dates-of-new-state-privacy-laws">Fifteen state laws<span>(new window)</span></a> have already been passed or are in the works. <strong>Big Tech is hoping to pre-empt stronger privacy rules and undercut the momentum for a federal regulation with teeth. </strong></p>



<p>“It’s been this coordinated national push to advance really weak privacy bills. We’ve definitely felt outnumbered,” an ACLU representative <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2022/05/26/tech-industry-groups-are-watering-down-attempts-at-privacy-regulation-one-state-at-a-time">told The Markup<span>(new window)</span></a>.</p>



<h2>Overwhelming European lawmakers</h2>



<p>When it comes to privacy laws, the European Union is a pioneer. So it’s easy to see why Big Tech has spent so much money (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/22/google-facebook-apple-eu-lobbying-report">about $30 million in 2021<span>(new window)</span></a>) lobbying European lawmakers to protect their most cherished surveillance practices. Google has been among the most aggressive. </p>



<p>Since the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://gdpr.eu/">GDPR<span>(new window)</span></a> took effect in 2018, the European Parliament has sought to expand consumer protections through additional regulations — in particular the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://proton.me/blog/digital-markets-act-explained">Digital Markets Act<span>(new window)</span></a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/digital-services-act-package">Digital Services Act<span>(new window)</span></a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPrivacy_Regulation">ePrivacy Regulation<span>(new window)</span></a>. </p>



<p>Google has worked to water down or slow each of these. Lobbying against the Digital Markets Act was so intense that an EU diplomat <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ft.com/content/8c7527bc-7ab4-41cd-ba94-3145208da9c3">complained<span>(new window)</span></a> their Twitter feed had been overwhelmed with targeted advertising promoting Google’s talking points. And Google <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/22/google-kids-privacy-protections-tech-giants-516834">took credit<span>(new window)</span></a> for stalling the ePrivacy Regulation, which would crack down on tracking cookies.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Perhaps the company’s biggest win was in the Digital Services Act. Three years ago, a European Parliament committee <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-9-2020-0177_EN.html">recommended<span>(new window)</span></a> tough measures against targeted advertising, “including a phase-out leading to a prohibition”. </p>



<p>Google and tech industry allies responded with a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://corporateeurope.org/en/2022/01/how-corporate-lobbying-undermined-eus-push-ban-surveillance-ads">massive lobbying campaign<span>(new window)</span></a> to convince lawmakers banning targeted ads would hurt the global economy. The gambit worked, and the draft law no longer threatens Google’s advertising.</p>



<h2>The plan to become ungovernable</h2>



<p>The United States and Europe aren’t the only countries taking aim at the surveillance economy in defense of their citizens. Google and other Big Tech companies want to prevent any disruptions to their business model. And they’ve identified a clever way to throw sand in the gears of any future regulations.</p>



<p>Big Tech companies, including Google and Apple, have sent trade advisers (i.e., lobbyists) to meet with diplomats negotiating the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, a trade agreement involving 14 countries along the Pacific Ocean, including the United States, India, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, and Australia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their strategy is to add a clause to the treaty that would make it more difficult for member countries to pass laws limiting their market dominance and allowing new privacy-focused business models to compete for customers. We explained <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://proton.me/blog/big-tech-ipef">how they are trying to do this<span>(new window)</span></a> in a previous article. </p>



<p>Taken together, Google’s lobbying activities reveal the company’s true intentions have nothing to do with protecting your privacy. Any claims otherwise are simply privacy washing.</p>



<h2>Google won’t protect your privacy, but you can</h2>



<p>Google will never offer true privacy. The reason the company is so successful is because its targeted advertising product is extremely effective. It is based on knowing you intimately and showing you personalized ads at the moment you’re most receptive to them. This business model earned Google nearly $60 billion in profit in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As long as their profit margins depend on collecting your personal data, privacy will never be “at the heart of everything” Google does.</p>



<p>But regulations aren’t the only way to force privacy onto the internet. We as internet users have power through our choices. The best way to take back control of your online data is to use services that make privacy the default.</p>



<p>It’s easier to opt out of Google than most people think. The first step is to take back control of your email, which functions as your digital identity for account creation, purchase receipts, travel plans, and more. Gmail is at the heart of Google’s surveillance system because it links all your online activities back to you, especially if you’re logged into your Google Account while searching or browsing.</p>



<p>Proton makes it <a href="https://proton.me/easyswitch">easy to switch</a>. And our business model is designed to incentivize us to give you more privacy, not less. Proton offers services for free, but you can upgrade for more storage and extra features. This lets you pay with money instead of with intimate details about your life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We believe the future of the internet is private. People must evaluate companies based on their actions, not just their marketing statements. Privacy washing is just one more obstacle to a better internet where privacy and freedom are the default.</p>

If all goes according to plan, the centre will open in early 2024 and focus on education in the sciences, including biology and computer science, as well as community outreach.

 </article><p>Some researchers worry about the site’s move away from astronomy research, however. Arecibo’s prowess at astronomy was a source of pride in Puerto Rico, and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03270-9" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03270-9" data-track-category="body text link">many have been disappointed with the NSF’s decisions</a>. Without the telescope or any active research on site, Arecibo C3 might struggle to reach as many students as the observatory once did, say sources who spoke to <i>Nature</i>. The site is on a relatively remote part of the island, but the iconic 305-metre telescope dish that stretched across the jungle was enough of an attraction to make the journey worthwhile for schoolchildren and visitors.</p><p>“You don’t have that asset now,” says Ubaldo Córdova Figueroa, a chemical engineer at UPR Mayagüez who submitted a proposal that sought to incorporate more research at the centre, but that was not selected by the NSF. And there are plenty of science museums and centres that are easier to get to in San Juan and elsewhere, he says.</p><p>Williams hopes the location will be a strength of the new centre. Having a place that people must make an effort to travel to increases the likelihood that they will also make an effort to collaborate, he says.</p><h2>A new era</h2><p>The NSF, the site’s main operator, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/541143a" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/541143a" data-track-category="body text link">has been trying to cut back its investment in Arecibo for years</a>. Before the main telescope’s collapse, the agency was contributing $7.5 million annually.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>In the years after the telescope’s destruction, researchers at the observatory <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02503-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02503-x" data-track-category="body text link">continued using other instruments on site</a>, aiming to preserve its reputation as an astronomy powerhouse. Some still hold out hope of eventually securing funding for a telescope that could rival the fallen 305-metre dish.</p><p>But at the moment, Ruffin says, there are no plans to resume operation of Arecibo’s remaining astronomical equipment — including a 12-metre radio telescope that was upgraded earlier this year. But she adds that the NSF will consider proposals to use existing and new equipment on site, through its regular merit-review process for funding projects.</p><p>Instead, Arecibo C3 will shift, in part, towards biology outreach. “We’re going to, for the first time, really bring the life sciences to Arecibo Observatory in a strong way,” Williams says. Cold Spring Harbor will introduce a technique known as DNA barcoding to the site, he says: students will collect DNA samples from the flora and fauna surrounding the former observatory and identify specimens from short genetic sequences, or barcodes, to catalogue the region’s biodiversity.</p><p>The new centre’s one nod to astronomy will be an exhibit that will present historical data collected at Arecibo through sound and touch. The development and maintenance of that exhibit will be led by the centre’s new director, astronomer Wanda Díaz-Merced, who has pioneered <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03597-5" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03597-5" data-track-category="body text link">the practice of using sound to better understand astronomical data</a>.</p><p>“We will be building on the heritage of Arecibo, but we will be building in a wider sense,” she says.</p><h2>Set up for success?</h2><p>Another worry about the education centre is its budget. The $5.5 million over five years that the NSF is contributing won’t be enough to revamp the site to the extent that would be necessary to entice students, researchers and tourists, says Olga Figueroa Miranda, the observatory’s former director. The institutions taking over the site will probably have to spend around $1 million up front to create new exhibits and teaching laboratories, and another $250,000–$500,000 to update the existing exhibits to create “an experience that people will want to come back to”, Figueroa Miranda estimates.</p><p>But, having two private institutions involved — Cold Spring Harbor and the University of the Sacred Heart — might help the centre to raise funds and potentially apply for grants that could supplement the NSF’s award, Figueroa Miranda says.</p><p>Ruffin says that the NSF considers whether a proposal can succeed within “the solicitation funding range” when it decides whether to support a project. The availability of funding is also contingent on what the US Congress allots the agency, she adds.</p><p>In the meantime, scientists will continue to watch progress at the centre and hope that research returns and a new telescope materializes. “But that looks like it’s not going to happen for now,” says Héctor Arce, an astronomer at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, “or in the near future.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Norway has told the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) it believes a countrywide ban on Meta harvesting user data to serve up advertising on Facebook and Instagram should be made permanent and extended across Europe.</p>
<p>The Scandinavian country's Data Protection Authority, Datatilsynet, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.datatilsynet.no/en/news/aktuelle-nyheter-2023/meta-case-brought-to-the-european-level/">had been holding back</a> Facebook parent Meta from scooping up data on its citizens with the threat of fines of one million Kroner (about $94,000) per day if it didn't comply.</p>
<p>In August, it said Meta hadn't been playing ball and started serving up <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/08/norway_meta_fines/">the daily fines</a>.</p>

    

<p>However, the ban that resulted in these fines, put into place in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/19/norway_meta_advertising_ban/">July</a>, expires on November 3 – hence Norway's request for a "binding decision."</p>

        


        

<p>The July order came after a Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) <a target="_blank" href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2023-07/cp230113en.pdf">ruling</a> [PDF] earlier that month stating Meta's data processing operation was also hauling in protected data – race and ethnicity, religious affiliation, sexual orientation etc. – when it cast its behavioral ads net.</p>
<p>Norway is not a member of the EU but is part of the European single market, and the CJEU, as Europe's top court, has the job of making sure the application and interpretation of law within the market is compliant with European treaties (this part would apply to Norway) as well as ensuring that legislation adopted by the EU is applied the same way across all Member States. Datatilsynet's ruling said the central processing of that data by the American company was putting Meta in violation of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation.</p>

        

<p>Meta argued at the time that it already had users' consent for targeted advertising – because they clicked on the Ts&amp;Cs when they signed up to its services, but the CJEU didn't buy that argument.</p>
<p>Datatilsynet, meanwhile, said this week:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/07/norway_meta_fine/">Norway court upholds miniscule fine against Meta for flouting privacy rules</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/08/norway_meta_fines/">Norway to hit Meta with fines over Facebook user privacy from next week</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/19/norway_meta_advertising_ban/">Norway bans Meta's behavioral advertising with threats of wrist-slap fines</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/06/17/new_york_coronavirus_tracing/">NY Attorney General warns Apple, Google to police COVID-19 tracing apps in their souks – or she will herself</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Meta has disputed the attempt to refer the whole shebang to the EDPB. Datatilsynet said the company believes, "among other things, that the decision of the Norwegian DPA is invalid and that the DPA does not have a legal basis to request a binding decision from the EDPB."</p>
<p>Meta, which has been fielding GDPR lawsuits in Europe and the UK for years, said <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/02/meta_eu_gdpr_advertising/">last month</a> it would seek explicit consent from people in the EU, EEA, and Switzerland before using their data to serve up ads targeted at them personally.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Facebook's parent company told us it was "surprised" by the Norwegian authority's actions, "given that Meta has already committed to moving to the legal basis of consent for advertising in the EU/EEA."</p>

        

<p>It added: "We remain in active discussions with the relevant data protection authorities on this topic via our lead regulator in the EU, the Irish Data Protection Commission, and will have more to share in due course."</p>
<p>The United Kingdom was notably absent from that <a target="_blank" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/01/how-meta-uses-legal-bases-for-processing-ads-in-the-eu/">list</a> of countries that Meta is moving to a "consent" basis for processing, despite the rules being roughly the same under UK GDPR.</p>
<p>The British government is in the process of trying to replace the EU legislation –&nbsp;which is still part of UK law under the Data Protection Act – by passing the Data Protection and Digital Information bill. The new bill, on the face of it, removes several data subject protections including oversight of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/06/new_dcms_head_newly_independent/">public surveillance cameras</a>, and potentially <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/05/17/uk_eu_data/">data adequacy</a> with the EU, affecting every UK business that collects and processes EU data. Lawmakers behind the bill <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/06/new_dcms_head_newly_independent/">have criticized</a> the GDPR for having an "overemphasis on consent."</p>
<p>Meta's Twitter-alike platform, Threads, landed in the UK <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/05/threads_comes_to_uk/">but not the EU</a> in July, along with a massive laundry list of <a target="_blank" href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2023/07/05/data_used_by_threads_as_per_app_store.jpg">user data permissions requests</a>.</p>
<p>We wonder if Meta knows something we don't. ®</p>

<p><span>On June 29, a local </span>man was walking along the beach on the island of Khortytsia, in the southeastern <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/ukraine">Ukrainian</a> city of Zaporizhzhia, when he noticed what looked like a log half submerged in water. When he approached, he realized the log was part of a boat, one that was possibly centuries old.</p>
<p>The man called wardens at the <a href="https://ostriv.org/">Khortytsia National Reserve</a>, the large national park on the island. Soon the police arrived to cordon off the area, followed by engineers and archaeologists who started an operation to rescue the precious find.</p>
<p>Less than a month earlier, an explosion had destroyed the Russian-controlled Kakhovka Dam, 125 miles downriver from Khortytsia. The waters rushed downstream, swelling the Dnipro River and eventually flooding a huge portion of the region. Dozens of villages were submerged, livestock and crops destroyed, and communities cut off and isolated.</p>
<p>But the ecological and economic disaster also had an unexpected consequence: As the Kakhovka Reservoir emptied, it exposed thousands of artifacts. In an area never fully explored by archaeologists before the dam’s construction, there was suddenly the prospect of uncovering significant finds, including old boats—perhaps even one long sought by scholars of Cossack maritime history: a classic early <em>chaika</em>, as iconic in Ukrainian history as the longship is in Scandinavia. It was the promise of finding such treasures that drew both archaeologists and curious civilians to the newly exposed shoreline.</p>

<p>Khortytsia, the largest island on the Dnipro, was lucky not to be flooded when the Kakhovka Dam was constructed in the mid-20th century. The island is home to numerous historical settlements, from Stone Age sites to a Mennonite colony established more than two centuries ago.</p>
<p>In Ukrainian history, Khortytsia is synonymous with the Zaporozhian Cossacks, or “Cossacks from beyond the rapids.” The name refers to the Dnipro’s formerly famous treacherous waters; the rapids disappeared when Soviet-built dams transformed the river and surrounding landscape. The Zaporozhian Cossacks were a community formed in the late Middle Ages. Like other Cossack groups, they were known for semi-democratic governance, a significant level of autonomy, and engaging in military campaigns, both on land and sea, often as mercenaries. Khortytsia was a significant Cossack base in the 16th-18th centuries, and is believed by some to have been the site of their first headquarters. Khortytsia seemed like an excellent place to discover a much-sought early classic chaika. Such a find would become a national treasure.</p>
<p>However, archaeologists quickly determined that the boat discovered in June was not their missing link in Cossack maritime history—but it has a historical significance all its own, and may date to a pre-Cossack settlement on Khortytsia that existed from the 10th through early 15th centuries.</p>
<p>The boat is a dugout canoe, made from a tree trunk, likely oak, that was split in half and hollowed out. It is 6.7 meters, or about 22 feet long, and narrow, less than a meter (about three feet) wide. Once freed from the sandy riverbed, it fell apart into several pieces, which were carefully moved to a nearby hangar. Here, the dugout will be conserved by soaking the pieces in a solution that hardens the wood and prevents it from shrinking when it dries. Eventually it will join the collection of the Museum of Navigation in southern Khortytsia.</p>

<p>Oleh Tuboltsev, a Khortytsia National Reserve archaeologist working on the find, says the team sent samples of the wood to Poland for radiocarbon dating, which will help determine the boat’s age. The boat will help researchers learn more about regional boatbuilding evolution, and, crucially, gives them hope of finding other, even more valuable discoveries.</p>
<p>That’s because the dugout boat is a direct ancestor of the elusive early chaika. The dugout was a simple but durable boat for navigating the dangerous rapids. When the Cossacks arrived in the area in the 15th century, they began improving it, such as covering it with bull hide for better hydrodynamics. Chaikas continued to evolve, as did their reputation for maneuverability in naval conflicts. They eventually became one of the most recognizable Ukrainian cultural symbols. While more modern Cossack boats from the 18th century have been found in the past, archaeologists continue to look for a surviving, classic chaika from this early period—and believe the dam destruction, while tragic, provides new opportunities.</p>
<p>“What was hidden may become visible, so we are looking forward to new discoveries,” says Tuboltsev.</p>
<p>The war makes it impossible to conduct excavations, so archaeologists are limited to doing surveys and monitoring newly exposed areas. Already there have been numerous finds, from a first-century Roman silver coin to German helmets from World War II. And, while the Ukrainian government began planning to rebuild the dam immediately after its destruction, others are advocating for restoring the historical, pre-Soviet Dnipro River landscape.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The area is “one of the most important natural and historical objects for Ukraine,” says Oleksii Vasyliuk, an ecologist and activist with the <a href="https://uncg.org.ua/en/">Ukrainian Nature Conservation Group</a>. Vasyliuk was a coauthor on a report prepared by the group urging that the dam not be rebuilt and the river’s natural floodplains be restored instead. Environmentally, such a move would increase forest cover, restore biodiversity, and improve water quality. The team also pointed to the area’s cultural value.</p>
<p>“This part of the Dnipro valley is the cradle of Ukrainian statehood and a concentration of colossal historical and archaeological heritage,” says Vasyliuk. It has also been little studied.</p>
<p>Oleksandr Alfyorov, from the Institute of the History of Ukraine, calls this southeastern corner of the country “the heart of [Cossack lands],” and adds “To flood again the historical artifacts that are part of national identity is a difficult decision.”</p>
<p>However, that decision is likely to be made. Tuboltsev tries to be realistic, noting that thousands of homes, businesses, and farms depended on the reservoir for their water supply, and there simply may not be other options.</p>
<p>“In the meantime, we should get the most out of the situation by monitoring the banks for artifacts,” he says, pragmatically. “Archaeologists of the past never had such a goldmine.”</p>

    <h2 id="game">THE GAME</h2>
    <p>I made this game to teach my daughter how buffer overflows work. Looking at programs as something you can play with, and poke and twist and make it do something else, is my favourite part of modern computing. I  think its the right way to look at programs. When your microwave oven gets an update and starts crashing, you can hack it. Or when your keyboard controller’s firmware is bad, you can hack it (looking at you vortex pok3r). She is 12 yo now but her assembler skills are getting better and better, hopefully one day she will be able to hack her own keyboard :)</p>
    <p>The game is about creating a small shellcode in memory by copying existing instructions and then exploiting a <a href="http://phrack.org/issues/49/14.html#article" target="_blank">buffer overflow</a> to jump into it, so that you can overwrite your opponent’s return address to force them to go to the game_over() function.There are other mechanics as well and more layers of strategy (like setting the exception handler or monkeypatching).</p>

    <p>All players share the same memory, and execute the same program, while time sharing the same processor running <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preemption_(computing)" target="_blank">preemptive scheduling</a> os, so each turn the player executes 10 instructions, after that the process is interrupted by the operating system, and its the other player's turn. Each player's stack pointer starts at a different location. There is no virtual memory.
    </p>

    How it looks when we play the game:
    <img src="https://punkx.org/overflow/play.jpg" width="100%">  
    <p>
      The code is compiled with <i>riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-inline-small-functions -mno-shorten-memrefs -march=rv32g  -mabi=ilp32 -ffreestanding -nostdlib -nostartfiles -T code/link.ld -O0 -fverbose-asm -g -o game game.c</i>, the linker script link.ld has just offsets for the specific functions so the fit nicely on the board. The no optimization -O0 makes the machine code pretty verbose, but also straight forward. Then I use <i>riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -S -l -fd game</i>, parse it and fix the ▲ and ✎ instructions, convert the jump offset from hex to dec and clean the assembly a bit, then match it with the source code and generate a svg which is then covnerted to a pdf with inkscape.

    <h2>Tabletop Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Printer: A3 preferably, A4 works as well but its a bit small</li>
      <li>Pawns: 1 pawn for the loose <b>nop</b> instruction, one pawn for the trap address,  and 2 pawns per player are needed, one for the program counter and one for the stack pointer, I use capacitors with their legs cut off or bicycle tire valve caps</li>
      <li>Pencil and eraser</li>
    </ul>
    <div>
      <h2 id="rules">Game Rules</h2>


      <p><span>✱</span></p><u>Board Setup:</u>
      <ol>
        <li>Both players start with all registers set to zero, except for the return address register (ra), which starts at 1000.</li>
        <li>Player 1's stack pointer (sp) is initialized at address 2244.</li>
        <li>Player 2's stack pointer (sp) is initialized at address 3844.</li>
        <li>The <b>nop</b> instruction pawn is not initially placed on the board.</li>
        <li>Both players' program counters (pc) start at address 1000, which is the beginning of the main function.</li>
        <li>Place the trap pawn at address 1000.</li>
        <li>All memory addresses are set to zero, except for the pre-loaded program.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><span>✱</span></p><u>Gameplay:</u>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Moves per Turn</b>: Players are required to execute 10 instructions during their turn.</li>
        <li><b>Execute Instructions</b>: Players must follow the program counter and execute either 10 instructions or an accumulated number up to 20. All jumps (jal, beq, etc.) must be followed.</li>
        <li><b>Suspend Execution</b>: Players can opt to suspend their turn after executing at least one instruction, saving the remaining instructions for their next turn. A maximum of 20 instructions can be accumulated.</li>
        <li><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch" target="_blank">Monkeypatch</a></b>: At the start of each turn, players can move a nop instruction pawn to any valid address within the program memory, ranging from 128 to 1188. When the program counter reaches this address, the instruction will act as a no-operation (nop). Moving the nop pawn costs the player their current and next turn, allowing the opponent to execute up to 20 instructions on their next turn. Players cannot place the nop pawn immediately after it was placed by the opponent.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><span>◉</span></p><u>Winning Conditions [HARD MODE]:</u>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Game Over</b>: The game ends when one player successfully hacks their opponent to call the game_over() function.</li>
        <li><b>Draw</b>: It is possible that you get the game in a state where nobody can force the other player into game_over(), in this case the game is a draw.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><span>⦿</span></p><u>Winning Conditions [MEDIUM MODE]:</u>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Stack Overflow</b>: Whoever overflows their stack first wins. Player 1's stack ends at 2120 and Player 2's end at 3720.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><span>⊙</span></p><u>Winning Conditions [EASY MODE]:</u>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Break Free</b>: The winner is the first player that leaves the main loop (executing <b>ret</b> in main).</li>
      </ol>


      <p><span>✱</span></p><u>Special Symbols:</u>
      <ol>
        <li><span>✎</span>: This symbol allows players to choose any 12-bit number (0 to 4095) as the immediate value in the li instruction.</li>
        <li><span>▲</span>: This symbol allows players to choose a value for the load instruction that is within ±128 bytes of their stack pointer. For example, if your sp is 2180, you can choose a value between 2052 and 2308.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><span>✱</span></p><u>Rules and Constraints:</u>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Illegal Actions</b>: Overwriting a memory address below 1192, or doing unaligned read or write (read or write to address not multiple of 4), or executing an illegal instruction will crash your program.</li>
        <li><b>Exception Handling</b>: A crash invokes the exception handler, which jumps to the trap address, initially set to 1000 but you can overwrite it from the set_trap() function. Once an exception happen the program counter and the return address to the specific value and you continue execution. Your stack pointer is reset to initial position. (In reality only the program counter will jump to the trap handler, and then it will probably store the registers state deeper on the stack and call some function to deal with the exception, but in our case we also reset the return address and the stack pointer so the game state is not completely corrupted)</li>
        <li><b>Cheating/Mistakes</b>: If a player cheats or makes a mistake and is caught, their program state, including memory and registers, is reset.</li>
      </ol>

      <u>Extended Rules for More Players:</u>
      <ol>
        <li>Player 3's stack pointer (sp) register is set to 2116.</li>
        <li>Player 4's stack pointer (sp) register is set to 3716.</li>
        <li><span>▲</span> symbol now allows you to write only -128 bytes away from your stack pointer.</li>
        <li>The game will be quite unstable with more than 2 players, and it will be corrupted quite fast. It will be harder to get to a winning condition, but the gameplay will be more fun and chaotic.</li>
      </ol>

      <u>Hints and Strategies:</u>

      <ol>
        <li><b>Offensive Crashes:</b> Utilize crashes as an offensive strategy to disrupt your opponent's gameplay.</li>
        <li><b>Trap Handler Modification:</b> Alter the trap handler to point to the game_over function, making the first player to crash the loser of the game. Beware: the <b>nop</b> pawn is extremely powerful tool if the trap is set to game_over, necause you can put it on top of the <b>ret</b> in the function that your opponent is currently executing and they will lose.</li>
        <li><b>Overwriting Return Address:</b> Utilize the bug() function to overwrite your opponent's return address by overflowing the index with a value of 400 or -400, allowing you to access the other player's stack. For instance, to transition from address 3784 (buffer[0] with stack pointer 3780) to address 2184, an index of -400 is required, calculated as (3784 - 2184) / 4 = 400.</li>
        <li><b>Shellcode Creation:</b> Employ the copy() function to replicate specific instructions and formulate a concise shellcode in your memory, enabling arbitrary writes. Exploit the buffer overflow in the bug() function to jump to this shellcode. An example of a simple shellcode for arbitrary write is as follows:
          <ul>
            <li>li a4, ✎ (copy from addr 256, 268)</li>
            <li>li a5, ✎ (available at addr 136, 144, 1016, etc.)</li>
            <li>sw a4, 0(a5) (available at addr 264, 272)</li>
            <li>ret (available at addr 272, 200, 1060, etc.)</li>
          </ul>
          Copying the ret instruction will lead to an infinite loop as the return address will be set to the start of the shellcode when you jump into it, causing continuous execution.
        </li>
        <li><b>Jumping to Memory:</b> To jump to your memory, exploit the buffer overflow in the bug() function. By setting the index variable to 6, you can write the value variable on top of the stored return address on the stack (28(sp)). Upon returning from bug(), the program copies from 28(sp) into the return address register. Place the address of the shellcode you created in the value variable.</li>
      </ol>
      <u>Note:</u>
      <p>
        All jumps are relative to the current program counter, even if they appear as absolute addresses in the disassembler, so <i>jal a4, 0</i> (machine code 1903) is actually an infinite loop when executed.
      </p>

    <h2 id="symbols">SYMBOLS</h2>
    <p>
      The the squares on the left/right are ascii encoded binary message, you can try to decypher it, the white squares are 1, and black on black squares are 0, use the spacing to figure out where the 0's go.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colors are minimal, so people can print it cheaply, and it is also clear on a3 and a4 black and white printers, the only colors used are red (255,0,0), blue(0,0,255), black (0,0,0) and white (255,255,255).
    </p>

    <p>
      I am not a designer, but the current design is maybe 20th iteration or so, and it came out after listening to Ghost In The Shell's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTPNaUsjksM" target="_blank">Making of a Cyborg</a> for 5 hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project logo symbolizes the overflow, and it is randomly generated, the current random seed made me feel a bit uneasey, so I left it like that.
    </p>
    <p>Spacing on the logo and the japanese text is a bit off, this is in order to be able to fold the A3 paper in half and not go through any text.</p>
    <p>
      The japanese text is from the last words of The Pirate King, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFVL45xAPSY">Gol D. Roger</a>: Inherited Will, The Destiny of the Age, and The Dreams of the People. As long as people continue to pursue the meaning of Freedom, these things will never cease to be!
    </p>
    <p>
      No syntax highlighting. I dont use syntax highlighting, and also I dont teach my daughter to use it. I dont have strong preference, but it just forces me to think that certain things in code are more important than others (depending on the theme). Without highlighting I can do my own judgement, and can easilly focus on what I think matters.
    </p>
    <h2 id="credits">CREDITS and THANKS</h2>
    <p>I would like to thank Peter, William, Shantanu, Rares and my daughter who played 50 different versions of the game, all of which were quite bad :) but they didnt give up. And thanks to tn1 who helped me a lot with the design, particularly telling me what is not good.</p>
    <p>Also big thank you to the people working on the <a href="https://terminus-font.sourceforge.net/">Terminus Font</a> which is absolute beauty.</p>
    <p>Special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/OpenMachine-ai/tinyfive">OpenMachine's tinyfive emulator</a> which I used to test the game, until I wrote my own for the web version.</p>
    <p>Thanks to <a href="https://gamesounds.xyz/">gamesounds.xyz</a> for the .wav files I got for the web version, and also Karl Casey @ White Bat Audio for the background music</p>
    <p>And of course many thanks to the people working on RISC-V it is super fun to work with it.</p>
    
    <p>mail: jackdoe@fastmail.com</p>
    <p>If you have an idea about a different board or rules, or you find a bug in the board or the online version please send me an email, also turns out I can play this game with my daughter and like 2 people in my whole contact list 🥹, so if you have fun playing it I would love to hear about it.</p>
    <h2 id="assembly">ASSEMBLY GUIDE</h2>
    <p>
      You can find many RISCV assembly guides such as: <a target="_blank" href="https://riscv-programming.org/">https://riscv-programming.org/</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-asm-manual/blob/master/riscv-asm.md">riscv-asm-manual</a><a>, and many interpreters like: </a><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3410/2019sp/riscv/interpreter/">cs3410 riscv interpreter</a>, or decoders like <a href="https://luplab.gitlab.io/rvcodecjs/" target="_blank">luplab's rvcodecjs</a> which is a great instruction decoder e.g. enter 0x13 (the nop instruction) there and see how it decodes. If you are struggling you can also search youtube for 'risc v assembly tutorial' and there are many really good videos, sadly I am not sure which one will work for you, so don't get discouraged and just try few of them.
    </p>

    <p>I made some exercises for my daughter, each day I printed few <a target="_blank" href="https://punkx.org/overflow/build/mem-1984.pdf">memory templates</a> and few of the code examples below and she just executed the instructions, Some days I changed the code on the fly, or spent more time explaining casting and structures for example. But the basic RISC-V assembly she was able to understand pretty fast.</p>
    <p>The hangman version is the same as the normal pdf, but few of the assembly instructions are missing and you have to fill them in:<br>
      <img loading="lazy" src="https://punkx.org/overflow/hangman.png">
    </p>
    <p>
      If you need to step up your C game, we use Beej's C guide: <a href="https://beej.us/guide/bgc/html/split/" target="_blank">Beej's Guide to C Programming</a>, particularly the first 7-8 chapters. But there are many very good resources. You can also use the following assembly examples to brush up on your C, a good example is this <a href="https://punkx.org/overflow/build/l1-pointers-1.pdf">pointer exercise</a>:
      <a href="https://punkx.org/overflow/build/l1-pointers-1.pdf"><img src="https://punkx.org/overflow/pointers-1.png"></a>
    </p>

      When you print the exercise and the memory template it looks like this:<br>

<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/this-weeks-dead-google-products-google-podcasts-basic-gmail-and-more/">Even more</a> Google products are getting the ax this week. Next up is Google Jamboard, a $5,000 digital whiteboard (and its $600-a-year fee) and software ecosystem marketed to schools and corporations. Google has a new post detailing the <a href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/next-phase-digital-whiteboarding">"Next phase of digital whiteboarding for Google Workspace</a>," and the future for Jamboard is that there is no future. In "<span data-track-type="">late 2024," the whole project will shut down, and we don't just mean the hardware will stop being for sale; the cloud-based apps will stop working, too.</span></p>
<p>Most people probably haven't ever heard of Jamboard, but this was a giant <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/workspace.google.com/en//files/Jamboard_Specs.pdf">55-inch, 4K touchscreen</a> on a rolling stand that launched in 2016. Like most Google touchscreens, this <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/google-jamboard#:~:text=Jamboard%20combines%20Google%20G%20Suite,Marshmallow%20operating%20system%20(OS).">ran Android</a> with a locked-down custom interface on top instead of the usual phone interface. The digital whiteboard could be drawn on using the included stylus or your fingers, and it even came with a big plastic "eraser" that would remove items. The SoC was an Nvidia Jetson TX1 (a quad-core Cortex-A57 CPU attached to a beefy Maxwell GPU), and it had a built-in camera, microphone, and speakers for video calls. There was HDMI input and Google cast support, and it came in whimsical colors like red, gray, and blue (it feels like Google was going for an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZv4Ok4rlc">iMac rainbow</a> and quit halfway).</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Google's secret sauce here was that Jamboard was heavily integrated with Google Workspace, so it could pull in items from Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides, and all your whiteboard work was saved in a filetype called "Jams" in the usual Google storage. Like the other Workspace apps, this all worked live over the Internet. People not in front of the touchscreen could launch the "Jamboard app" instead, letting them get in on the whiteboard action remotely, complete with live handwriting.</p>
<p>On the death of its latest product, Google says, "<span data-track-type="">We're grateful to the consumers, educators, students, and businesses who have used Jamboard since its launch in 2016. While Jamboard users make up a small portion of our Workspace customer base, we understand that this change will impact some of you, and we’re committed to helping you transition...</span>" Yes, that's right, "transition" is usually not something you have to consider when a company kills a hardware product, but the whole cloud system is going down, too, so all of your existing $5,000 whiteboards will soon be useless, and you won't be able to open the cloud data on other devices.</p>
<p>"<span data-track-type="">Over the coming months, we’ll provide Jamboard app users and admins clear paths to retain their Jamboard data or migrate it," Google tells users in its blog post. The migration options are all third-party competitor whiteboard apps—<a href="https://www.figma.com/figjam/">Figma's </a></span><span data-track-type=""><a href="https://www.figma.com/figjam/">FigJam</a>, Lucid Software's <a href="https://lucidspark.com/">Lucidspark</a>, and <a href="https://miro.com/product-overview/">Miro.</a> Google says you can move your data in "</span><span data-track-type="">just a few clicks, well before the Jamboard app winds down in late 2024." Going forward, Google says it has "decided to leverage our partner ecosystem for whiteboarding in Workspace," meaning exiting the whiteboard market, showing users the door, and telling them to take their data with them.<br>
</span></p>
<p>You'll still need a new touchscreen, which means another pricey hardware purchase for existing Jamboard customers. Google seems to feel particularly bad for the schools that bought into this, saying, "<span data-track-type="">We will also work directly with educational institutions to compensate them for their Jamboard devices.</span>"</p>
<p>Jamboard was a pricey item, but $5,000 was just the tip of the iceberg. There was a $600 "annual management and support fee," <em>plus</em> subscriptions to Google Workspace for every user, <em>plus&nbsp;</em>an optional $1,350 for the rolling stand. A one-year total with a single Workspace user is around $7,000. People often ask about a recurring revenue stream when predicting what products will live and die, but even a $600-per-year fee attached to every sale wasn't enough to keep Jamboard running.</p>

                <figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/09/image2-29.png" alt="Encrypted Client Hello - the last puzzle piece to privacy" loading="lazy" width="1201" height="675"></figure><p>Today we are excited to announce a contribution to improving privacy for everyone on the Internet. Encrypted Client Hello, a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-esni/">new proposed standard</a> that prevents networks from snooping on which websites a user is visiting, is now available on all Cloudflare plans. &nbsp;</p><p>Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) is a successor to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-encrypted-sni/">ESNI</a> and masks the Server Name Indication (SNI) that is used to negotiate a TLS handshake. This means that whenever a user visits a website on Cloudflare that has ECH enabled, no one except for the user, Cloudflare, and the website owner will be able to determine which website was visited. Cloudflare is a big proponent of privacy for everyone and is excited about the prospects of bringing this technology to life.</p><h3 id="browsing-the-internet-and-your-privacy">Browsing the Internet and your privacy</h3><p>Whenever you visit a website, your browser sends a request to a web server. The web server responds with content and the website starts loading in your browser. Way back in the early days of the Internet this happened in 'plain text', meaning that your browser would just send bits across the network that everyone could read: the corporate network you may be browsing from, the Internet Service Provider that offers you Internet connectivity and any network that the request traverses before it reaches the web server that hosts the website. Privacy advocates have long been concerned about how much information could be seen in "plain text": &nbsp;If any network between you and the web server can see your traffic, that means they can also see exactly what you are doing. If you are initiating a bank transfer any intermediary can see the destination and the amount of the transfer. </p><p>So how to start making this data more private? To prevent eavesdropping, encryption was introduced in the form of <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-ssl/">SSL</a> and later <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/transport-layer-security-tls/">TLS</a>. These are amazing protocols that safeguard not only your privacy but also ensure that no intermediary can tamper with any of the content you view or upload. But encryption only goes so far.</p><p>While the actual content (which particular page on a website you're visiting and any information you upload) is encrypted and shielded from intermediaries, there are still ways to determine what a user is doing. For example, the DNS request to determine the address (IP) of the website you're visiting and the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-sni/">SNI</a> are both common ways for intermediaries to track usage.</p><p>Let's start with <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/">DNS</a>. Whenever you visit a website, your operating system needs to know which IP address to connect to. This is done through a DNS request. DNS by default is unencrypted, meaning anyone can see which website you're asking about. To help users shield these requests from intermediaries, Cloudflare introduced <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/dns-encryption-explained/">DNS over HTTPS</a> (DoH) in 2019. In 2020, we went one step further and introduced <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/oblivious-dns/">Oblivious DNS over HTTPS</a> which prevents even Cloudflare from seeing which websites a user is asking about.</p><p>That leaves SNI as the last unencrypted bit that intermediaries can use to determine which website you're visiting. After performing a DNS query, one of the first things a browser will do is perform a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-happens-in-a-tls-handshake/">TLS handshake</a>. The handshake constitutes several steps, including which cipher to use, which TLS version and which certificate will be used to verify the web server's identity. As part of this handshake, the browser will indicate the name of the server (website) that it intends to visit: the Server Name Indication. </p><p>Due to the fact that the session is not encrypted yet, and the server doesn't know which certificate to use, the browser must transmit this information in plain text. Sending the SNI in plaintext means that any intermediary can view which website you’re visiting simply by checking the first packet for a connection:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/09/pasted-image-0--8--2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1574" height="1321"></figure><p>This means that despite the amazing efforts of TLS and DoH, which websites you’re visiting on the Internet still isn't truly private. Today, we are adding the final missing piece of the puzzle with ECH. With ECH, the browser performs a TLS handshake with Cloudflare, but not a customer-specific hostname. This means that although intermediaries will be able to see that you are visiting <em>a</em> website on Cloudflare, they will never be able to determine which one. </p><h3 id="how-does-ech-work">How does ECH work?</h3><p>In order to explain how ECH works, it helps to first understand how TLS handshakes are performed. A TLS handshake starts with a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-happens-in-a-tls-handshake/">ClientHello</a> part, which allows a client to say which ciphers to use, which TLS version and most importantly, which server it's trying to visit (the SNI). </p><p>With ECH, the ClientHello message part is split into two separate messages: an inner part and an outer part. The outer part contains the non-sensitive information such as which ciphers to use and the TLS version. It also includes an "outer SNI". The inner part is encrypted and contains an "inner SNI".</p><p>The outer SNI is a common name that, in our case, represents that a user is trying to visit an encrypted website on Cloudflare. We chose cloudflare-ech.com as the SNI that all websites will share on Cloudflare. Because Cloudflare controls that domain we have the appropriate certificates to be able to negotiate a TLS handshake for that server name. </p><p>The inner SNI contains the actual server name that the user is trying to visit. This is encrypted using a public key and can only be read by Cloudflare. Once the handshake completes the web page is loaded as normal, just like any other website loaded over TLS. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/09/pasted-image-0-8.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1574" height="1437"></figure><p>In practice, this means that any intermediary that is trying to establish which website you’re visiting will simply see normal TLS handshakes with one caveat: any time you visit an ECH enabled website on Cloudflare the server name will look the same. Every TLS handshake will appear identical in that it looks like it's trying to load a website for cloudflare-ech.com, as opposed to the actual website. We've solved the last puzzle-piece in preserving privacy for users that don't like intermediaries seeing which websites they are visiting.</p><p>For full details on the nitty-gritty of ECH technology, visit our <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/encrypted-client-hello/">introductory blog</a>. </p><h3 id="the-future-of-privacy">The future of privacy</h3><p>We're excited about what this means for privacy on the Internet. Browsers like <a href="https://chromestatus.com/feature/6196703843581952">Google Chrome</a> and <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/g/dev-platform/c/uv7PNrHUagA/m/BNA4G8fOAAAJ">Firefox</a> are starting to ramp up support for ECH already. If you're a website, and you care about users visiting your website in a fashion that doesn't allow any intermediary to see what users are doing, enable ECH today on Cloudflare. We've enabled ECH for all free zones already. If you're an existing paying customer, just head on over to the Cloudflare dashboard and <a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/ssl-tls/edge-certificates">apply for the feature</a>. We’ll be enabling this for everyone that signs up over the coming few weeks.</p><p>Over time, we hope others will follow our footsteps, leading to a more private Internet for everyone. The more providers that offer ECH, the harder it becomes for anyone to listen in on what users are doing on the Internet. Heck, we might even solve privacy for good.</p><p>If you're looking for more information on ECH, how it works and how to enable it head on over to our <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/ech/">developer documentation on ECH</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article lang="en">
    

    
    

    <div>
  

<p>It’s <a href="https://www.aprilcools.club/">April Cools</a>! It’s like April Fools, except instead of cringe comedy you make genuine content that’s different from your normal stuff.<sup id="fnref:disclosure"><a href="#fn:disclosure">1</a></sup> For example, last year I talked about <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/microscopy/">owning a microscope</a>. This year I debated doing another hobby but settled on a much dumber topic.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen those <a href="https://www.rd.com/list/strange-things-amazon/">lists of weird things you can buy online</a>? It’s always just novelties and gag gifts. I’m much more interested in the weird things <em>with a legitimate use case</em>. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WTVQ171">Nicolas Cage throw pillow</a>? Just weird. Three pounds of live bees? Weird <em>and cool</em>.</p>

<p>Back in 2020, stuck inside and bored out of my mind, I decided to assemble my own Weird Thing list. My (loose) criteria were:</p>

<ol>
<li>Not a one-off. It’s either something a merchant is selling on an ongoing basis or something with an active marketplace of buyers and sellers.</li>
<li>There’s an actual legitimate use. No gag gifts or collectors items.</li>
<li>There’s an actual price. It’s not “call for a quote”. If I have to call for a quote then I can’t just buy it on a whim.</li>
</ol>

<p>After I got a bunch I started a <a href="https://twitter.com/amazingwebdeals">gimmick Twitter account</a> to share them, then within two weeks discovered I hated running a gimmick Twitter account and shut it down. But I do like blogging, so here’s 10 weird things you can buy online and why you might want to.</p>

<h2 id="three-yards-of-books">Three Yards of Books</h2>

<p><a href="https://booksbythefoot.com/product/rainbow-ombre/"><img src="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/weird-things-you-can-buy/img/books.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p><strong>Merchant or Market:</strong> Merchant</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong> <a href="https://booksbythefoot.com/">Books by the Foot</a></p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> Old books, $60/foot. Fiction books, $25/foot. <em>The Joy of Cooking</em>, $50/foot.</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> Two main clientele: clients who want filled bookshelves as part of their decor and filmmakers who need set dressing. These use cases are reflected in how they organize offerings: you can buy a specific genre, but also buy a specific binding style or color. My favorite detail is a bit of pricing: A foot of modern books are $10. Modern books <em>with all the racy stuff removed</em> is $20.</p>

<h2 id="human-milk">Human Milk</h2>

<p><strong>Merchant or Market:</strong> Market</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong> <a href="https://www.breastfeedingmomsunite.com/">BreastfeedingMomsUnite</a></p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> Breast milk, usually around $1-2/oz</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> From the site:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This breast milk market will be of help to women who need to breastfeed their babies but cannot produce enough breast milk. Hence mothers who are willing to donate can help others who are having reduced supply of breast milk.</p>

<p>The government majorly regulates the trade of body fluids and organs (tissues, semen, blood, livers, and kidneys…), but not breast milk, thus donating, buying or selling breast milk is 100% legal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Yes there are creeps on the site too, but their ads are taken down p. quickly)</p>

<p>I really like how this is the perfect example of how marketplaces develop. Some women overproduce milk, some underproduce it, there’s an inefficiency in allocation, therefore market!</p>

<h2 id="a-life-size-animatronic-whale-shark">A life-size animatronic whale shark</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.mydinosaurs.com/product/10m-animatronic-whale-shark-for-sale/"><img src="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/weird-things-you-can-buy/img/animatronic-whale-shark-2.jpg" alt="An animatronic whale shark"></a></p>

<p><strong>Merchant or Market:</strong> Merchant</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong> <a href="https://www.mydinosaurs.com/">My Dinosaurs Culture and Arts Co</a></p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> Life-size <a href="https://www.mydinosaurs.com/product/10m-animatronic-whale-shark-for-sale/">animal animatronics</a> and <a href="https://www.mydinosaurs.com/product/complete-t-rex-skeleton-for-sale/">skeletons</a>. Also for some reason, <a href="https://www.mydinosaurs.com/product/fiberglass-over-size-tea-cup-sculpture-for-sale/">giant teacups</a> and <a href="https://www.mydinosaurs.com/product/miniature-replica-landmarks-of-statue-of-liberty-2/">Statues of Liberty</a>. Price varies per item but it’s roughly mid thousands to low ten-thousands.</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> Theme parks and/or museums, depending on the product. There are more natural history museums in California than there are T-Rex fossils in the whole world. They claim all their skeletons are anatomically accurate.</p>

<p>If you’re in the market for nightmares, they also sell <a href="https://www.mydinosaurs.com/product/customized-realistic-silicone-animatronic-human-model/">animatronic people</a>.</p>

<h2 id="private-islands">Private Islands</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.privateislandsonline.com/caribbean/bahamas/the-exumas/darby-island"><img src="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/weird-things-you-can-buy/img/island.jpg" alt="A large island."></a></p>

<p><strong>Merchant or Market:</strong> Market</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong> <a href="https://www.privateislandsonline.com/">Private Islands inc.</a></p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> Private islands. Surprisingly enough, there are plenty of islands that sell for under half a million dollars. Unsurprisingly, there are also islands that sell for a hundred million. Only one other product on this list comes <em>close</em> to those prices.</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> I guess it’s like owning real estate, except the real estate is an entire island?  Billionaires use the internet too ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

<p>I knew that some people owned private islands, but I didn’t expect there to be an online marketplace. Turns out it’s been around since 1999! They have a <a href="https://www.privateislandsonline.com/magazine-issues/pdf/pim-28-digital.pdf">magazine and everything</a>.</p>

<h2 id="uranium">Uranium</h2>

<p><strong>Merchant or Market:</strong> Merchant</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong> <a href="https://unitednuclear.com/">United Nuclear</a></p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> <a href="https://unitednuclear.com/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=2_5">Radioactive Isotopes</a> for $100 each. You pick the isotope.</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> Calibrating scientific equipment and powering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_chamber">cloud chambers</a>. The isotopes are small enough to be safe.</p>

<p>I looked to see if you could buy (tiny amounts of) weapons-grade uranium but unsurprisingly nobody’s offering that. I <em>did</em> find this <a href="https://measurlabs.com/">cool place</a> which does <a href="https://measurlabs.com/products/radiocarbon-dating/">radiocarbon dating</a> for $500 a sample.</p>

<p>Keeping on the topic of scientific research:</p>

<h2 id="chlamydia">Chlamydia</h2>

<p><strong>Merchant or Market:</strong> Merchant</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong> <a href="https://www.atcc.org/products/vr-903">American Type Culture Collection</a></p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> <a href="https://www.atcc.org/products/vr-903#generalinformation">Clamydia</a> for $1200. You can also buy COVID-19, tuberculosis, and <em>drug-resistant</em> tuberculosis. And, if you really want, you can buy a packet of brewer’s yeast for <a href="https://www.atcc.org/products/18824">$431</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> Biomedical research. Unsurprisingly, you need a license to purchase anything. Still pretty neat that labs who need bioweapons can just go to a website and click “checkout”.</p>

<p>My favorite little bit is this section of the yeast quality control specifications:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>26S ribosomal RNA gene, partial sequence ATATCAATAAGCGGAGGAAAAGAAACCAACCGGGATTGCCTTAGTAACGGCGAGTGAAGCGGCAAAAGCTCAAATTTGAAATCTGGTACCTTCGGTGCCCGAGTTGTAATTTGGAGAGGGCAACTTTGGGGCCGTTCCTTGTCTATGTTCCTTGGAACAGGACGTCATAGAGGGTGAGAATCCCGTGTGGCGAGGAGTGCGGTTCTTTGTAAAGTGCCTTCGAAGAGTCGAGTTGTTTGGGAATGCAGCTCTAAGTGGGTGGTAAATTCCATCTAAAGCTAAATATTGGCGAGAGACCGATAGCGAACAAGTACAGTGATGGAAAGATGAAAAGAACTTTGAAAAGAGAGTGAAAAAGTACGTGAAATTGTTGAAAGGGAAGGGCATTTGATCAGACATGGTGTTTTGTGCCCTCTGCTCCTTGTGGGTAGGGGAATCTCGCATTTCACTGGGCCAGCATCAGTTTTGGTGGCAGGATAAATCCATAGGAATGTAGCTTGCCTCGGTAAGTATTATAGCCTGTGGGAATACTGCCAGCTGGGACTGAGGACTGCGACGTAAGTCAAGGATGCTGGCATAATGGTTATATGCCGCATT</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s just something really funny about the verification being “sequence it and make sure it’s got these 600 characters in a row.”</p>

<h2 id="live-bees">Live Bees</h2>

<p><strong>Where:</strong> <a href="https://mountainsweethoney.com/bees/">Mountain Sweet Honey Company</a></p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> Three pounds of bees for $144.</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> Apiaries! There are over <a href="https://honey.com/newsroom/presskit/honey-industry-facts">100,000 beekeepers</a> in the US and they all had to get their starter colonies from <em>somewhere</em>. It’s either buy the bees or buy a <a href="https://www.arbico-organics.com/product/bee-scent-attractant/pollination-aids">pint of bee pheromones</a> and attract them yourself.</p>

<p>Live bees are one of the few animals explicitly listed as shippable, under USPS postal code <a href="https://pe.usps.com/text/pub52/pub52c5_008.htm">526 Mailable Live Animals</a> along with day-old chicks and live scorpions.<sup id="fnref:scorpions"><a href="#fn:scorpions">2</a></sup> But in general you can ship “small, harmless, cold-blooded animals”,<sup id="fnref:alligators"><a href="#fn:alligators">3</a></sup> so there’s a lot of business in selling insects. In particular, you can buy <a href="https://www.amazon.com/1500-Live-Ladybugs-Guaranteed-Delivery/dp/B00533KOIC">1500 ladybugs</a> for organic pest control and <a href="https://butterflyreleasecompany.com/Item/100-painted-lady-butterflies-for-release">100 butterflies</a> for wedding services.</p>

<p>For the record, the USPS explicitly considers all nonvenomous insects as “harmless”, which means you can ship</p>

<h2 id="bedbugs">Bedbugs</h2>

<p><strong>Merchant or Market:</strong> Seller</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong> <a href="https://www.cheapbedbugs.com/product-page/6-month-subscription">https://www.cheapbedbugs.com/product-page/6-month-subscription</a></p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> 600 bedbugs, $750.</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> The fastest way to check a lot of places (say, a hotel) for bedbugs is with bedbug-sniffing dogs, and you’re trying to train bedbug-sniffing dogs, you need live samples of bedbugs to use for training. Hence, a live bedbug supplier.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the site is run by one guy and he wants a copy of your business license before selling you anything, so no buying bedbugs to torment your enemies. I dunno why but the tone of his <a href="https://www.cheapbedbugs.com/faq">FAQ</a> makes him seem more trustworthy.</p>

<h2 id="rollercoasters">Rollercoasters</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.amusement-rides.com/en/product/g-force-maurer"><img src="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/weird-things-you-can-buy/img/coaster.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p><strong>Merchant or Market:</strong> Both</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong> <a href="https://www.usedrides.com/">usedrides.com</a>, <a href="https://www.amusement-rides.com/en/services">amusement-rides</a>, <a href="https://amusementsupplyco.com/store/categories/New/">amusementsupplyco</a>. Lots more sellers but they’re all “contact for a quote” places.</p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> Anything you’d need for an amusement park. Food carts, kiddie rides, carousels, even <a href="https://www.amusement-rides.com/en/product/g-force-maurer">entire rollercoasters</a>. Prices vary.</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> It makes sense when you think about it. There are over 400 permanent amusement parks in the US alone, not counting the thousands of county and state fairs. Most amusement parks have a static pool of attendees, and people crave novelty. A well-maintained carnival ride can last for <em>decades</em>. There’s plenty supply from parks trying to exchange rides and plenty demand from places trying to buy them, which means marketplaces.</p>

<p>I’m a little more surprised at how <em>many</em> sites I found. On some investigation, it seems this is driven by logistical concerns. Even small rides weigh <a href="https://www.majesticrides.com/quadzilla.html">10+ tons</a> and you’ll want to minimize transportation fees as much as possible. Different regions have different marketplaces.</p>

<h2 id="oil-tankers">Oil Tankers</h2>

<p><a href="https://horizonship.com/ship/228m-double-hull-lr-1-oil-chemical-tanker-imo-iii-73720-dwt-2008/?measure=2"><img src="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/weird-things-you-can-buy/img/tanker.jpg" alt="A god-damn oil tanker"></a></p>

<p><strong>Merchant or Market:</strong> Market</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong> <a href="https://horizonship.com/ship-category/tankers-for-sale/crude-oil-tankers-for-sale/?sort=price&amp;sort_dir=DESC">Horizon Ship Brokers</a></p>

<p><strong>What:</strong>  Ships. Ships of all kinds. Cruise ships. Research vessels. Oil tankers. Anywhere from under a million to over 30 million.</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> It’s insane to think that there’d be a secondhand market for <em>eight-hundred foot oil tankers</em>. This sent me down the <a href="https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/rmt2022_en.pdf">UN Maritime Transport Review</a> rabbit-hole, where I learned that in 2021 shipyards built the tonnage-equivalent of 1200 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aframax">Aframaxes</a> (pdf. 43). Nothing else made me realize just how unimaginably vast world trade is and just how much work goes into keeping the international supply chains running.</p>

<h2 id="honorable-mentions">Honorable mentions</h2>

<p>Some things that I are either interesting but not <em>that</em> surprising, or where I just don’t have much to say about them.</p>

<ul>
<li>I used to buy <a href="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/ghirardelli-25-lb-queen-dark-chocolate-wafers/40863127.html">25 pound chocolate sacks</a> for small-scale chocolatiering.</li>
<li><a href="https://epson.com/For-Work/Printers/Large-Format/SureColor-F2100-Direct-to-Garment-Printer/p/SCF2100WE">T-shirt printers</a>: It’s a printer that takes t-shirts instead of paper! Also it costs $19,000</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Solution-Preserved-Plain-Pail/dp/B005N08FAO/">Pig fetuses</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Barn-Owl-Pellets-Large-Pack/dp/B00FGED110/ref=sr_1_4?crid=27IMXV4TI226A&amp;keywords=owl+pellets&amp;qid=1680203449&amp;sprefix=owl+pellets%2Caps%2C92&amp;sr=8-4">owl poop</a>: science classrooms</li>
<li>Can’t afford an oil tanker? Start small with buying a <a href="https://www.bizquest.com/buy-a-business-for-sale/search/">small business</a> or two.</li>
<li>Priceless cultural artifacts like <a href="https://www.artemission.com/">cuneiform tablets</a> do in fact have a price, and it’s usually in the mid hundreds to low thousands. The site <em>claims</em> they have provenance proof that all their wares come from before the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/27">Dealing in Cultural Objects Act</a> 2003 cutoff, but I don’t know how trustyworthy they are.</li>
<li>Several friends asked that I put in <a href="https://www.chemdirect.com/industry/other/deuterium-oxide/7789-20-0/2221">heavy water</a> and I value my friendships more than my integrity.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Thanks to <a href="https://predr.ag/blog/mediocrity-can-be-a-sign-of-excellence/">Predrag Gruevski</a> and <a href="https://jeremykun.com/?p=119235">Jeremy Kun</a> for feedback and also suggesting things to look into.

Another wrote: “My skin hurts! What is going on with iPhone 15 Pro Max?”</p><p>There are several posts on the Apple forum referring to overheating of the iPhone 15 Pro series, with one user posting a photo of their iPhone 15 next to a thermometer recording a temperature of 44C (<a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255147042" data-link-name="in body link">111F</a>). There are also posts on <a href="https://twitter.com/itz_mohitverma/status/1706201557921083816" data-link-name="in body link">X</a> and Reddit.</p><p>Ming-Chi Kuo, an Apple analyst at TF International Securities, <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/the-iphone-15-pro-series-overheating-issues-are-unrelated-to-tsmcs-advanced-3nm-node-iphone-15-5f354b1ab155" data-link-name="in body link">said</a> any overheating issue was probably due to “compromises” in the phone’s design as the company attempted to reduce the product’s weight.</p><p>The iPhone Pro model has a frame made from titanium, a poor conductor of heat, which could hamper the handset’s ability to disperse heat. Previously, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Apple</a> has used stainless steel for its high-end phones.</p><p>Kuo wrote: “The primary cause is more likely the compromises made in the thermal system design to achieve a lighter weight, such as the reduced heat dissipation area and the use of a titanium frame, which negatively impacts thermal efficiency.”</p><p>He said Apple would probably address the problem through software updates. Kuo said the reported problem was unlikely to have been caused by a new Taiwan-made chip deployed in the Pro models.</p><p>The analyst indicated that the problem could affect iPhone Pro sales if it was not addressed. The iPhone 15 went on sale last week. In the UK, it costs from £799 for the basic model to £999 for the Pro and £1,199 for the larger Pro Max.</p><p>“If Apple does not properly address this issue, it could negatively impact shipments over the product life cycle of the iPhone 15 Pro series,” said Kuo.</p><p>Kyle Wiens, the chief executive of iFixit, an iPhone repair website, said testing by his business showed the iPhone 15 Pro was showing similar characteristics to the stainless steel-clad 14 Pro, which was also “quite hot”. He said unlike the aluminium that was used for the basic iPhone 14 and 15 models, titanium and stainless steel were similar performers in terms of conducting heat, but titanium was lighter and thus absorbed less heat.</p><p>Wiens said Apple could fix the problem “instantly” with a software update that slowed down the performance of the phone’s processor – in effect, the device’s brain – and made the handset produce less heat, but the company would then have to make trade-offs with the phone’s performance. He said the phone’s battery performance could be affected by high temperatures.</p><p>“In our testing it gets to 44C.

<p>By certain absurdities of life that only someone whose hobby perfectly aligns with his job can understand, lately I’ve been involved in the design and architecture of an MMO game.</p>



<p>As much as it may seem that such an application fits perfectly in what we would unconsciously consider “<strong>distributed architectures</strong>“, the specific details (small and large) of this kind of solutions turn what, for any capable engineer would be a simple design process into a <strong>headache</strong> of biblical proportions.</p>



<hr>



<p>Latencies, race conditions, synchrony and availability is something that every architect faces, practically every day, however, in practically all scenarios, the solution is a renegotiation of the functional and technical requirements (is it enough to have latency less than 10 seconds?) and rarely do we design complete solutions due to their complexity.</p>



<p>The world of multiplayer video games is<strong> kinda different</strong>, the spatial complexity goes to infinity, and we try to keep the temporal one to a minimum. We work with multiple strictly deterministic modules that we can easily maintain and deploy in parallel.<br>And sooner or later, we will hit hell, <strong>an evil that lurks behind every MMO</strong>, the  I/O bottleneck in the database.</p>



<p>The main purpose of this post is to explore the limitations that we find at the <strong>data I/O level in the design of MMO systems</strong>, the interactions that the system makes with the data, its derived problems and how to solve them.<br>In addition, we will suffer the cognitive dissonance in its purest state, since the solutions that are adopted in MMO type systems are a certain death in an enterprise environment (e-commerce?).</p>



<p>It is interesting to see<strong> how different the solutions are depending on the problem</strong> and the <strong>system requirements</strong>. The beauty of software architecture ❤</p>



<blockquote>
<p>the source of truth of your game world IS NOT the database.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is a complicated concept to accept for those of us who come from enterprise systems, but it is so.<br>In online games, <strong>the source of truth</strong> of the state of the world <strong>is the in-memory world state, not the database.</strong></p>



<p>In these cases, we consider the database a<strong> persistence medium</strong>, not a source of truth. Whereas the real source of truth of the virtual world we are concerned with always resides in memory.</p>



<p>Heresy! well, a little bit. let’s go deeper into this concept with MATH.</p>



<p>let’s say we have a MMORPG game like world of warcraft with 1000 players, its world is of course divided into zones, so that we can do sharding. what we are interested in here, however, is that all players live together in the same environment.<br>They have to be able to see each other, talk to each other, pass items from one to another, see the level of other players in the world, and so on.<br>By pure data logic, for this to work in normal terms the state of the world has to be unique.</p>



<p>Let’s assume that these players just go around, happily killing boars. Let’s also assume that our game client, in order to make life easier for our infrastructure, sends the players’ actions to the server once per second.<br>Knowing how to multiply is enough to realize that we would be talking about N player position update messages sent <strong>per second</strong>, where N is the number of players.</p>



<p>And that’s <strong>only </strong>taking into consideration <strong>the position of the players</strong> in the world! Now you have to add experience gained, sword strokes, chat messages, etc.</p>



<p>Considering our database as the source of truth, it forces us to persist all this information, which, to put it mildly, is N writings per second.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="3047" data-permalink="https://prdeving.wordpress.com/2023/09/29/mmo-architecture-source-of-truth-dataflows-i-o-bottlenecks-and-how-to-solve-them/image/" data-orig-file="https://prdeving.files.wordpress.com/2023/09/image.png" data-orig-size="503,299" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://prdeving.files.wordpress.com/2023/09/image.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://prdeving.files.wordpress.com/2023/09/image.png?w=503" width="503" height="299" src="https://prdeving.files.wordpress.com/2023/09/image.png?w=503" alt="" srcset="https://prdeving.files.wordpress.com/2023/09/image.png 503w, https://prdeving.files.wordpress.com/2023/09/image.png?w=150 150w, https://prdeving.files.wordpress.com/2023/09/image.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 503px) 85vw, 503px"></figure>



<p>Best of luck.</p>



<p>The solution to such a problem is relatively simple once we get rid of the idea of using the database as the source of truth.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Cache, lots of cache</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When I said earlier that the source of truth of the game world state resides in memory I meant it, though not in the simplest sense.</p>



<p>In these cases our requirements are not too many, though complicated:</p>



<ul>
<li>we need <strong>direct and low latency </strong>connection between game services and world state.</li>

<p>To meet these specifications, we usually use a <strong>data</strong> <strong>broker pattern</strong>.<br>We create a service with direct connection to the database that will keep the <strong>full state in memory</strong> and connect our game world services to it via RPC.<br>So it acts as a kind of cache of the database.</p>

<p>But how does this meet the requirements? Let’s go in parts</p>



<h2><strong>We need direct and low latency connection between game services and world state.</strong></h2>



<p>This is perhaps the simplest part, <strong>our game world services connect by RPC to the game state service and execute actions</strong>.</p>



<div><p>Here comes an important point that, although perhaps slightly out of the scope of this post, is worth mentioning.</p><p>These RPC commands <strong>must be specific to our game logic</strong>, no SQL or obscure requests linked to persistence or the concept of “data”!</p></div>



<p>grantPlayerExperience, playerChangingZone, etc.<br>It is the data service that is responsible for implementing the API so that, when it receives a “grantPlayerExperience” command, it adds N experience points to the player X.</p>



<p>This way, we <strong>keep our layers separate</strong>, we <strong>decouple</strong> the data API from the implementation and keep our game logic <strong>isolated</strong>.</p>



<h2><strong>We need the world state to be persisted in order to replicate or recover from errors or outages</strong></h2>



<p>Persist yes, but What and When? this is more of a philosophical and <strong>product design job</strong> than software architecture per se, but let’s see how we can dig into it a bit.</p>



<p>The first question is, how much is acceptable? sometimes we tend to think that even the smallest movement is likely to be saved for posterity, but often it is not.</p>



<p>Let’s take for example the game League of Legends, what would we save and when in this case?</p>



<p>If you ask me, I would save the <strong>final state of the game, once it is finished</strong> (we ignore replays, obeservability, etc for this example).</p>



<p>The reasons are simple, in a system of this type, we look for persistence to be able to recover from problems,<strong> not as a business definition</strong>.</p>



<p>Let’s suppose that we are saving EVERY change throughout the game and our instance explodes, goes offline or is sucked into the infinite void of space. Can we recover from that error? Can we restore the last saved state?</p>



<p><strong>No, we can’t.</strong></p>



<p>It is likely that, by the time we restore the state, half of the players will no longer be connected.</p>



<p>So what are we going to persist all the changes in the database for?</p>



<p>The tricky part here, as I said above, is <strong>what to save and when to save it.</strong></p>



<p>In the case of the example, what do we save? well, the player’s stats at the end of the game and little else. When? at the end of the game.</p>



<p>In a more complex case like World of warcraft, we could save, for example: the inventory when an item changes hands or is used, the player’s position every certain time (30 seconds maybe?), the zone every time the player changes, etc.</p>



<p>The trick is to <strong>minimize as much as possible the writes to persistence</strong> by writing only those things that are essential for recovery.</p>



<p>everything else, we <strong>keep it in memory</strong> in the game state service.</p>



<h2>We need it to be scalable for the future</h2>



<p>Here perhaps we touch on one of the tricky points.<br>In terms of scalability, having a service that has the entire world state in memory is <strong>perhaps</strong> not the best option a priori, since, although it is easy to scale it vertically, horizontal scaling runs into several problems.<br>Apart from being a <strong>single point of failure</strong>, an important issue that I will not cover in this post.</p>



<p>A relatively simple solution may be to take advantage of the <strong>Redis pub/sub system</strong> to synchronize the state services.</p>



<p>Also, let’s think about it this way, if you have 100 game world services acting against a single state service, we are talking about 100 open sockets, it is not comparable with the amount of thousands of database commands that we would have if we ignore the broker, <strong>right?</strong></p>



<h2>We need to avoid race conditions</h2>



<p>This is perhaps the most trivial point, since, as long as we maintain a single-threaded architecture in our data service, it is practically <strong>guaranteed</strong> that we will not have significant race conditions.</p>



<p>However, when working with distributed data or in multi-threaded environments we have a great friend.</p>



<p><strong>CAS (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap">Compare-and-swap</a>)</strong><br><strong>every write operation</strong> performed on our data services should be done with a CAS instruction, so that we make sure that our writes are synchronous.</p>



<p>The thing is simple, you take a <strong>hash of the state </strong>(or a part of it) before starting the operation which we will call, <strong>version hash</strong>.<br>You prepare the new state, generate a hash for the new state and <strong>ONLY persist</strong> the two things<strong> if the version hash</strong> of the state <strong>matches</strong> the one you took at the beginning.</p>

<p>A simple version control system</p>



<p>and what happens if the CAS fails? <strong>retry</strong>, N times, as many as you think, and if it is not possible, <strong>return error</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Understanding the state of our game world as ephemeral, and knowing how to identify the exact data amenable to persistence is perhaps more of a learned art than a teachable science.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In summary, when working in high traffic distributed systems, with many agents constantly changing dynamic data, considering the database as the source of truth leads to bottlenecks and <strong>availability problems sooner rather than later</strong>.</p>



<p>Strategies, perhaps counter-intuitive or heretical to those of us who come from enterprise architectures, are usually the standard solution accepted by the industry.<br><strong>Not without their own problems and weaknesses.</strong></p>



<p>A <strong>good planning</strong> of the update and persistence windows of our data and a <strong>thorough analysis</strong> of our system’s “use cases” and scenarios, together with a data broker pattern allows us to free the database from <strong>unnecessary writes</strong> and our wallets from bulging invoices.</p>



<p>Understanding the state of our game world as ephemeral, and knowing how to identify the exact data amenable to persistence is perhaps more of a learned art than a teachable science.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>I wanted my first post on this blog to be about the node graph system that I created for my personal graphics engine named “RogueEngine”.
I may talk about the engine itself in another post but for now I’d like to focus on its UI.</p><p>As a teaser, here’s a screenshot of the tool running our <a href="https://www.pouet.net/party.php?which=1550&amp;when=2023">Revision 2023</a> demo:</p><h3 id="a-bit-of-background">A bit of background</h3><p>I started thinking about this project back in 2019 with the aim of releasing some PC demo productions.
I had heard of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene">demoscene</a> for the first time about four years earlier through some coworkers at Sony and it gradually grew on me to the point that I too wanted to participate.
I really wanted to be able to team up with artists and designers for making these rather than, say, other programmers or trying to complete a production on my own.
This seemed like a better way to reach a higher visual bar as well as being more entertaining overall. 🙂</p><p>This translated in my mind to having an interface that anyone could use for interacting with and tweaking the content, although in retrospect, such a system comes in extremely handy for programmers too and I find myself increasingly using it for many purposes, such as research and experimentation.
Regardless, I started looking into interfaces for visual content creation, which were at the time both quite fascinating and mysterious to me having little to no experience with such systems.</p><p>I was initially not particularly fond of node graphs however, for mainly two reasons:</p><ul><li>Many of these systems seemed to be what I’d call “coding with nodes”; while it may be more visual, it isn’t fundamentally any simpler.</li><li>It can get real messy real fast.</li></ul><p><br>Node systems were still appealing to me however for different reasons;
they felt more intuitive and less intimidating than other solutions with more “traditional” UI and they tend to look really nice on screenshots.
Then maybe it’ll be easier for me to convince other people to get on board? 🙂</p><p>So I started thinking about a node system that would <strong>not</strong> be “coding with nodes”.</p><h3 id="node-system">Node system</h3><p>Having little to no experience with node-based systems, I went ahead and looked at other software for inspiration.
Big sources of inspiration for me would be software such as <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>, <a href="https://www.notch.one/">Notch</a>, and <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a>.
In particular, I was wondering how to create a system that’d be both easy to use and expressive enough to allow the creation of interesting and emergent effects rather than simply ticking available engine features on or off…</p><p>Towards the end of 2019, something somewhat cliked in my mind;
I’d design the system to have only two types of nodes (okay, three) and they’d work like this:</p><ul><li>The <strong>root node</strong> from which the graph traversal would start at runtime.</li><li>The <strong>data node</strong> representing a piece of data of a given type.</li><li>The <strong>component node</strong> that can be attached to a data node to modify it.</li></ul><p><img src="https://gboisse.github.io/node-types.png" alt="node-types"><br><em>The different node types.</em></p><p><br>This seemingly simple setup seemed to open up a lot of possibilities. 🙂</p><p>I could have some “geometry data node” being nothing more than an index and a vertex buffer (plus some bounding box and probably other things…) while a “component node” connected to it would act as some kind of vertex shader that could be used for displacement purposes.</p><p>Similarly, a “shading data node” could represent a standard material while a “component node” would be some piece of code to be injected into the fragment shader for various per-pixel procedural shading effects.</p><p>This felt like a good solution; I could instantly see how most features could map to this setup and it most definitely wasn’t a visual programming system…
As an illustration, here’s a collection of the different node categories available in the engine at the time of writing:</p><p><img src="https://gboisse.github.io/node-categories.png" alt="node-categories"><br><em>The available node categories in RogueEngine.</em></p><p><br>The great thing about this approach is that the dependent nodes do not need to know how the data from the data node came to be (in the case of the geometry category, it could be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation">procedurally-generated</a> mesh, geometry loaded through some <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html">glTF</a> file, or even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaballs">metaballs</a> generated from the particle system), the format of the data node being fixed (in this case, an index and a vertex buffer…), we always know how to operate on it. 🙂</p><p><img src="https://gboisse.github.io/metaballs-nodes.png" width="49%">
<img src="https://gboisse.github.io/metaballs.jpg" width="49%"><br><em>Metaballs created using the nodes, a classic of the demoscene.</em></p><h3 id="data-model-vs-gui-code">Data model vs. GUI code</h3><p>Now that I knew how my node system would operate, I had to find how to implement it.
My plan was to use <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui">Dear ImGui</a> for the UI because it’s a joy to use and, I have to admit, I had little intention of investigating other GUI solutions.
ImGui is actually a great fit I found to crafting such a creative UI system.</p><p>The main insight to take away in my opinion is the need to separate the data (what I’d call the <strong>data model</strong>) from the UI logic (often referred to as the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">view</a></strong>).
Having such a separation naturally implies creating an interface for iterating the data inside your “project” that can then be used both by the runtime, when playing back the demo content, and the ImGui code, when running the editor.</p><p>Our first step should therefore be to define that data model, so here goes:</p><p><img src="https://gboisse.github.io/data-model.png" alt="data-mode"><br><em>Data model for RogueEngine’s runtime.</em></p><p><br>There are essentially only three types of resources that a user can interact with through the interface and manipulate within a project (along with a few more as detailed below…):</p><ul><li><strong>Assets</strong>: A list of all your imported 3D models, textures, music files, etc.</li><li><strong>Layers</strong>: These allow to group nodes, mostly to facilitate multi-scene projects.</li><li><strong>Nodes</strong>: Nodes belong to their parent layer and can be executed by the runtime.</li></ul><p>Furthermore, <strong>Ranges</strong> represent the series of time segments for when a particular resource is active on the timeline, while <strong>Properties</strong> represent, as the name suggests, the properties of a given node, such as values and colors, links to assets and/or other nodes, etc.</p><p>Having such a clearly defined data model makes it easy to serialize and deserialize the content of a project (for saving and loading purposes respectively) as we can rely on a well identified distinction between what should be persisted vs. what’s engine specific.</p><p><img src="https://gboisse.github.io/timeline.jpg" alt="timeline"><br><em>The timeline panel allows the edition of ranges, i.e., when is a node or layer active or not.</em></p><p><br>Finally, such a setup makes it rather simple to implement dreaded (but oh so useful!) features such as undo/redo.
I picked the same approach than <a href="https://blog.voxagon.se/2018/07/10/undo-for-lazy-programmers.html">@voxagonlabs</a> and went ahead with serializing the whole project on every change to the data model.
This may sound rather inefficient (and I’m sure it won’t hold up past certain project sizes…) but there isn’t really all that much data you typically have to serialize when saving a project.
So it’s definitely good enough for now and makes undo/redo indeed trivial to manage. 🙂</p><h3 id="animating-the-scene">Animating the scene</h3><p>Next stop on the road was to get things moving.</p><p>My plan here was to allow keyframing any property that’s either a <code>float</code> or a vector of floats (e.g., <code>vec2</code>, <code>vec3</code>, <code>vec4</code>).
For this task, I pretty much mimicked Blender and added a “K” button next to all keyframe-able properties.
Once enabled, the property field would turn green, while modifying it would insert a new keyframe at the current frame index, turning the field orange to highlight the change.
I also found I had to disable the editing of keyframed properties during playback (something that’s otherwise possible and a great way to tweak the rendering of a scene) so as to avoid inserting what’d be one keyframe per frame. 🙂</p><p>Finally, I decided to have the timeline content be encoded for a 24Hz target frequency, meaning you could only ever store up to 24 keyframes inside a given second.
This is fine however, as we can simply turn our frame index into a floating-point number and interpolate between keyframes if the demo ends up running at higher framerates.</p><p><img src="https://gboisse.github.io/curve-editor.jpg" alt="curve-editor"><br><em>Points on a curve; still doing basic linear interpolation, cubic spline coming soon™.</em></p><p><br>One more thing I added was this “M” button, which you can see next to the keyframe toggle in the inspector panel.
Toggling it makes the property appear as a pin onto the node itself in the graph.
The user can then plug in other nodes and modify the property procedurally (adding the elapsed time in seconds, multiplying with a sine wave or noise function, etc.).</p><p>This is a great tool for continuous, repeating, or random animation.
Things that would otherwise be a pain to do with editing a curve.
As it turns out, we ended up using this functionality way more than the curve editor itself!
This probably goes some way as to explaining why this view is the only part of the UI that hasn’t been completed yet…</p><h3 id="code-nodes">Code nodes</h3><p>I’ve mentioned throughout this post that I was mostly trying to steer away from visual programming, but we may still want to allow the use of coding for these moments where built-in nodes aren’t quite flexible enough.
Instead of “coding with nodes” however, here you’d simply create a “code node” letting you write actual text inside a field (or copy/paste from <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/">Shadertoy</a>!).
You can then add “bindings” to create tweakable properties that can be accessed directly from the shader:</p><p><img src="https://gboisse.github.io/code-node.gif" alt="code-node"><br><em>Code node with animated binding.</em></p><p><br>Oh, and these properties are just like any other node property, so they too can be animated and/or plugged into other nodes… 🙂</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>I hope this overview was useful, don’t hesitate to <a href="https://twitter.com/guitio2002">reach out</a> or leave a comment!</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

<p>One fine day in January 2017 I was reminded of something I had
half-noticed a few times over the previous decade.  That is, younger
hackers don’t know the bit structure of ASCII and the meaning of the
odder control characters in it.</p>
<p>This is knowledge every fledgling hacker used to absorb through their
pores. It’s nobody’s fault this changed; the obsolescence of hardware
terminals and the near-obsolescence of the RS-232 protocol is what did
it. Tools generate culture; sometimes, when a tool becomes obsolete, a
bit of cultural commonality quietly evaporates.  It can be difficult
to notice that this has happened.</p>
<p>This document began as a collection of facts about ASCII and related
technologies, notably hardware serial terminals and RS-232 and
modems. This is lore that was at one time near-universal and is no
longer.  It’s not likely to be directly useful today - until you trip
over some piece of still-functioning technology where it’s relevant
(like a GPS puck), or it makes sense of some old-fart war story.  Even
so, it’s good to know anyway, for cultural-literacy reasons.</p>
<p>One thing this collection has that tends to be indefinite in the minds
of older hackers is <em>calendar dates</em>. Those of us who lived through
all this tend to have remembered order and dependencies but not exact
timing; here, I did the research to pin a lot of that down.  I’ve
noticed that people have a tendency to retrospectively back-date the
technologies that interest them, so even if you did live through the
era it describes you might get a few surprises from reading this.</p>
<p>There are lots of references to Unix in here because I am mainly
attempting to educate younger open-source hackers working on
Unix-derived systems such as Linux and the BSDs. If those terms mean
nothing to you, the rest of this document probably won’t either.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_hardware_context">Hardware context</h2>
<div>
<p>Nowadays, when two computers talk to each other, it’s usually via
TCP/IP over some physical layer you seldom need to care much about.
And a "terminal" is actually a "terminal emulator", a piece of
software that manages part of a bit-mapped display and itself speaks
TCP/IP.</p>
<p>Before ubiquitous TCP/IP and bit-mapped displays things were very
different. For most hackers that transition took place within a
few years of 1992 - perhaps somewhat earlier if you had access to
then-expensive workstation hardware.</p>
<p>Before then there were video display terminals - VDTs for short. In
the mid-1970s these had displaced an earlier generation of printing
terminals derived from <strong>really</strong> old technology called a "teletype",
which had evolved around 1900 from Victorian telegraph networks.  The
very earliest versions of Unix in the late 1960s were written for
these printing terminals, in particular for the Teletype Model 33 (aka
ASR-33); the "tty" that shows up in Unix device names was a
then-common abbreviation for "teletype".</p>
<p>(This is not the only Unix device name that is a fossil from a bygone
age.  There’s also /dev/lp for the system default printer; every
hacker once knew that the "lp" stood for "line printer", a type of
line-at-a-time electromechanical printer associated with mainframe
computers of roughly the same vintage as the ASR-33.)</p>
<p>One legacy of those printing terminals is the "Carriage return"
character (Ctrl-r, or "\\r" expressed as a C string escape), so called
because it moved the print head to the left hand end of the line.
Unix dispensed with it, using a bare line feed (Ctrl-N or "\\n") as an
end-of-line marker.  Many other operating systems still use \r\n.  The
reason it’s \r\n rather than the \n\r that the \r actually took more
than one normal chaacter-transmission time to execute on some of the
earliest hardware; you had to do it first so it could finish as the \n
was being performed.</p>
<p>It’s half-forgotten now that these VDTs were deployed in fleets
attached to large central machines.  Today a single personal computer
has multiple processors, but back then all the VDTs and their
users on a machine divided up a single processor; this was called
"timesharing". Modern Unixes still have this capability, if anyone
still cared to use it; the typical setup of having many "virtual
terminals", accessible by pressing Ctrl-Alt-Fsomething, uses the very
mechanism that originally provided access to many terminals for
timesharing.</p>
<p>In those pre-Internet days computers didn’t talk to each other much,
and the way teletypes and terminals talked to computers was a hardware
protocol called "RS-232" (or, if you’re being pedantic, "EIA RS-232C").
<span><br>[Actually, there was an even older style of tty interface
derived from telegraph circuits and called "current loop" that the
ASR-33 originally used; in the 1970s dual-mode ASR-33s that could also
speak RS-232 began to ship, and RS-232 eventually replaced current
loop entirely.]<br></span>  Before USB, when people spoke of a "serial" link,
they meant RS-232, and sometimes referred to the equipment that spoke
it as "serial terminals".</p>
<p>RS-232 had a very long service life; it was developed in the early
1960s, not originally for computer use but as a way for
teletypewriters to talk to modems.  Though it has passed out of
general use and is no longer common knowledge, it’s not quite dead
even today.</p>
<p>I’ve been simplifying a bit here.  There were other things besides
RS-232 and serial terminals going on, notably on IBM mainframes.  But
they’ve left many fewer traces in current technology and its folklore.
This is because the lineage of modern Unix passes back through a
now-forgotten hardware category called a "minicomputer", especially
minicomputers made by the Digital Equipment Corporation.  ASCII,
RS-232 and serial terminals were part of the technology cluster around
minicomputers - as was, for that matter, Unix itself.</p>
<p>Minicomputers were wiped out by workstations and workstations by
descendants of the IBM PC, but many hackers old enough to remember the
minicomputer era (mid-1960s to mid-1980s) tend still to get a bit
misty-eyed about the DEC hardware they cut their teeth on.</p>
<p>Often, however, nostalgia obscures how very underpowered those
machines were. For example: a DEC VAX 11-780 minicomputer in the
mid-1980s, used for timesharing and often supporting a dozen
simultaneous users, had less than 1/1000 the processing power and
less than 1/5000 times as much storage available as a low-end
smartphone does in 2017.</p>
<p>In fact, until well into the 1980s microcomputers ran slowly enough
(and had poor enough RF shielding) that <strong>this</strong> was common knowledge:
you could put an AM radio next to one and get a clue when it was doing
something unusual, because either fundamentals or major subharmonics
of the clock frequencies were in the 20Hz to 20KHz range of human
audibility.  Nothing has run <strong>that</strong> slowly since the turn of the 21st
century.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_the_strange_afterlife_of_the_hayes_smartmodem">The strange afterlife of the Hayes smartmodem</h2>
<div>
<p>About those modems: the word is a portmanteau for
"modulator/demodulator".  Modems allowed digital signals to pass over
copper phone wires - ridiculously slowly by today’s standards, but
that’s how we did our primitive wide-area networking in pre-Internet
times.  It was <strong>not</strong> generally known back then that modems had first
been invented in the late 1950s for use in military communications,
notably the SAGE air-defense network; we just took them for granted.</p>
<p>Today modems that speak over copper or optical fiber are embedded
invisibly in the Internet access point in your basement; other
varieties perform over-the-air signal handling for smartphones and
tablets.  A variety every hacker used to know about (and most of us
owned) was the "outboard" modem, a separate box wired to your computer
and your telephone line.</p>
<p>Inboard modems (expansion cards for your computer) were also known
(and became widespread on consumer-grade computers towards the end of
the modem era), but hackers avoided them because being located inside
the case made them vulnerable to RF noise, and the blinkenlights on an
outboard were useful for diagnosing problems.  Also, most hackers
learned to interpret (at least to some extent) modem song - the

outboards made while attempting to establish a connection. The
happy song of a successful connect was identifiably different from
various sad songs of synchronization failure.</p>
<p>One relic of modem days is the name of the Unix SIGHUP signal,
indicating that the controlling terminal of the user’s process has
disconnected.  HUP stands for "HangUP" and this originally indicated
a serial line drop (specifically, loss of Data Carrier Detect)
as produced by a modem hangup.</p>
<p>These old-fashioned modems were, by today’s standards, unbelievably
slow.  Modem speeds increased from 110 bits per second back at the
beginning of interactive computing to 56 kilobits per second just
before the technology was effectively wiped out by wide-area Internet
around the end of the 1990s, which brought in speeds of a megabit per
second and more (20 times faster).  For the longest stable period of
modem technology after 1970, about 1984 to 1991, typical speed was
9600bps. This has left some traces; it’s why surviving serial-protocol
equipment tends to default to a speed of 9600bps.</p>
<p>There was a line of modems called "Hayes Smartmodems" that could be
told to dial a number, or set parameters such as line speed, with
command codes sent to the modem over its serial link from the machine.
Every hacker used to know the "AT" prefix used for commands and that,
for example, ATDT followed by a phone number would dial the number.
Other modem manufacturers copied the Hayes command set and variants of
it became near universal after 1981.</p>
<p>What was <strong>not</strong> commonly known then is that the "AT" prefix had a
helpful special property.  That bit sequence (1+0 1000 0010 1+0
0010 1010 1+, where the plus suffix indicates one or more repetitions
of the preceding bit) has a shape that makes it as easy as possible
for a receiver to recognize it even if the receiver doesn’t know the
transmit-line speed; this, in turn, makes it possible to automatically
synchronize to that speed <span><br>[A full explanation of the magic of
the AT prefix can be found at
<a href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=7333&amp;cpage=1#comment-1802568">http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=7333&amp;cpage=1#comment-1802568</a>]<br></span>.</p>
<p>That property is still useful, and thus in 2017 the AT
convention has survived in some interesting places.  AT commands have
been found to perform control functions on 3G and 4G cellular modems
used in smartphones.  On one widely deployed variety, "AT+QLINUXCMD="
is a prefix that passes commands to an instance of Linux running in
firmware on the chip itself (separately from whatever OS might be
running visibly on the phone).</p>

<h2 id="_preserving_core_values">Preserving core values</h2>
<div>
<p>From about 1955 to 1975 - before semiconductor memory - the dominant
technology in computer memory used tiny magnetic doughnuts strung
on copper wires.  The doughnuts were known as "ferrite cores" and
main memory thus known as "core memory" or "core".</p>
<p>Unix terminology was formed in the early 1970s, and compounds like
"in core" and "core dump" survived into the semiconductor era.
Until as late as around 1990 it could still be assumed that every
hacker knew from where these terms derived; even microcomputer
hackers for which memory had always been semiconductor RAM tended
to pick up this folklore rapidly on contact with Unix.</p>
<p>After 2000, however, as multiprocessor systems became increasingly
common even on desktops, "core" increasingly took on a conflicting
meaning as shorthand for "processor core". In 2017 "core" can still
mean either thing, but the reason for the older usage is no longer
generally understood and idioms like "in core" may be fading.</p>

<h2 id="_36_bit_machines_and_the_persistence_of_octal">36-bit machines and the persistence of octal</h2>
<div>
<p>There’s a power-of-two size hierarchy in memory units that we now
think of as normal - 8 bit bytes, 16 or 32 or 64-bit words.  But this
did not become effectively universal until after 1983. There was an
earlier tradition of designing computer architectures with 36-bit
words.</p>
<p>There was a time when 36-bit machines loomed large in hacker folklore and
some of the basics about them were ubiquitous common knowledge, though
cultural memory of this era began to fade in the early 1990s.  Two of
the best-known 36-bitters were the DEC PDP-10 and the Symbolics 3600
Lisp machine.  The cancellation of the PDP-10 in '83 proved to be
the death knell for this class of machine, though the 3600 fought
a rear-guard action for a decade afterwards.</p>
<p>Hexadecimal is a natural way to represent raw memory contents on
machines with the power-of-two size hierarchy. But octal (base-8)
representations of machine words were common on 36-bit machines,
related to the fact that a 36-bit word naturally divides into 12 3-bit
fields naturally represented as octal.  In fact, back then we
generally assumed you could tell which of the 32- or 36-bit phyla a
machine belonged in by whether you could see digits greater than 7 in
a memory dump.</p>
<p>Here are a few things every hacker used to know that related to
these machines:</p>
<div><ul>
<li>
<p>
36 bits was long enough to represent positive and negative integers
  to an accuracy of ten decimal digits, as was expected on mechanical
  calculators of the era. Standardization on 32 bits was
  unsuccessfully resisted by numerical analysts and people in
  scientific computing, who really missed that last 4 bits of accuracy.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A "character" might be 9 bits on these machines, with 4 packed to a
  word. Consequently, keyboards designed for them might have both a meta key
  to assert bit 8 and a now-extinct extra modifier key (usually but
  not always called "Super") that asserted bit 9.  Sometimes this
  selected a tier of non-ASCII characters including Greek letters
  and mathematical symbols.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Alternatively, 6-bit characters might be packed 6 to a word. There
  were many different 6-bit character encodings; not only did they
  differ across a single manufacturer’s machines, but some individual
  machines used multiple incompatible encodings.  This is why older
  non-Unix minicomputers like the PDP-10 had a six-character limit on
  filenames - this allowed an entire filename to be packed in a single
  36-bit word.  If you ever see the following acronyms it is a clue
  that you may have wandered into this swamp: SIXBIT, FIELDATA,
  RADIX-50, BCDIC.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<p>It used also to be generally known that 36-bit architectures explained
some unfortunate features of the C language. The original Unix
machine, the PDP-7, featured 18-bit words corresponding to half-words
on larger 36-bit computers.  These were more naturally represented as
six octal (3-bit) digits.</p>
<p>The immediate ancestor of C was an interpreted language written on the
PDP-7 and named B. In it, a numeric literal beginning with 0 was
interpreted as octal.</p>
<p>The PDP-7’s successor, and the first workhorse Unix machine was the
PDP-11 (first shipped in 1970). It had 16-bit words - but, due to some
unusual peculiarities of the instruction set, octal made more sense
for its machine code as well.  C, first implemented on the PDP-11,
thus inherited the B octal syntax.  And extended it: when an in-string
backslash has a following digit, that was expected to lead an octal
literal.</p>
<p>The Interdata 32, VAX, and other later Unix platforms didn’t have
those peculiarities; their opcodes expressed more naturally in hex.
But C was never adjusted to prefer hex, and the surprising
interpretation of leading 0 wasn’t removed.</p>
<p>Because many later languages (Java, Python, etc) copied C’s low-level
lexical rules for compatibility reasons, the relatively useless and
sometimes dangerous octal syntax besets computing platforms for which
three-bit opcode fields are wildly inappropriate, and may never be
entirely eradicated <span><br>[Python 3, Perl 6, and Rust have at least
gotten rid of the dangerous leading-0-for-octal syntax, but Go kept
it]<br></span>.</p>
<p>The PDP-11 was so successful that architectures strongly influenced by
it (notably, including Intel <span><br>[Early Intel microprocessors
weren’t much like the PDP-11, but the 80286 and later converged with it in
important ways.]<br></span> and ARM microprocessors) eventually took over the
world, killing off 36-bit machines.</p>
<p>The x86 instruction set actually kept the property that though
descriptions of its opcodes commonly use hex, large parts of the
instructiion set are best understood as three-bit fields and
thus best expressed in octal. This is perhaps clearest in the
encoding of the mov instruction.</p>

<div>
<h2 id="_rs232_and_its_discontents">RS232 and its discontents</h2>
<div>
<p>A TCP/IP link generally behaves like a clean stream of 8-bit bytes
(formally, octets). You get your data as fast as the network can run,
and error detection/correction is done somewhere down below the layer
you can see.</p>
<p>RS-232 was not like that. Two devices speaking it had to agree on a
common line speed - also on how the byte framing works (the latter is
why you’ll see references to "stop bits" in related documentation).
Finally, error detection and correction was done in-stream, sort of.
RS232 devices almost always spoke ASCII, and used the fact that ASCII
only filled 7 bits.  The top bit might be, but was not always, used as
a parity bit for error detection. If not used, the top bit could carry
data.</p>
<p>You had to set your equipment at both ends for a specific combination
of all of these.  After about 1984 anything other than "8N1" - eight
bits, no parity, one stop bit - became increasingly rare.  Before
that, all kinds of weird combinations were in use. Even parity ("E")
was more common than odd ("O") and 1 stop bit more common than 2
<span><br>[Except on teletypes, which used 7E2.]<br></span>, but
you could see anything come down a wire.  And if you weren’t properly
set up for it, all you got was "baud barf" - random 8-bit garbage
rather than the character data you were expecting.</p>
<p>This, in particular, is one reason the API for the POSIX/Unix
terminal interface, termios(3), has a lot of complicated options with
no obvious modern-day function. It had to be able to manipulate all
these settings, and more.</p>
<p>Another consequence was that passing binary data over an RS-232 link
wouldn’t work if parity was enabled - the high bits would get
clobbered. Other now-forgotten wide-area network protocols reacted
even worse, treating in-band characters with 0x80 on as control codes
with results ranging from amusing to dire.  We had a term, "8-bit
clean", for networks and software that didn’t clobber the 0x80 bit.
And we <strong>needed</strong> that term…</p>
<p>The fragility of the 0x80 bit back in those old days is the now
largely forgotten reason that the MIME encoding for email was invented
(and within it the well-known MIME64 encoding). Even the version of
SMTP current as I write (RFC 5321) is still essentially a 7-bit
protocol, though modern end points can now optionally negotiate
passing 8-bit data.</p>
<p>But before MIME there was uuencode/uudecode, a pair of filters for
rendering 8-bit data in 7 bits that is still occasionally used today
in Unixland. In this century uuencoding has largely been replaced by
MIME64, but there are places you can still trip over uuencoded binary
archives.</p>
<p>Even the RS-232 physical connector varied.  Standard RS-232 as defined in
1962 used a roughly D-shaped shell with 25 physical pins (DB-25), way
more than the physical protocol actually required (you can support a
minimal version with just three wires, and this was actually
common). Twenty years later, after the IBM PC-AT introduced it in
1984, most manufacturers switched to using a smaller DB-9 connector
(which is technically a DE-9 but almost nobody ever called it that).
If you look at a PC with a serial port it is most likely to be a DB-9;
confusingly, DB-25 came to be used for printer parallel ports (which
originally had a very different connector) before those too were
obsolesced by USB and Ethernet.</p>
<p>Anybody who worked with this stuff had to keep around a bunch of
specialized hardware - gender changers, DB-25-to-DB-9 adapters (and
the reverse), breakout boxes, null modems, and other gear I won’t
describe in detail because it’s left almost no traces in today’s tech.
Hackers of a certain age still tend to have these things cluttering
their toolboxes or gathering dust in a closet somewhere.</p>
<p>The main reason to still care about any of this (other than
understanding greybeard war stories) is that some kinds of sensor and
control equipment and IoT devices still speak RS-232, increasingly
often wrapped inside a USB emulation.  The most common devices that do
the latter are probably GPS sensors designed to talk to computers (as
opposed to handheld GPSes or car-navigation systems).</p>
<p>Because of devices like GPSes, you may still occasionally need to know
what an RS-232 "handshake line" is.  These were originally used to
communicate with modems; a terminal, for example, could change the
state of the DTR (Data Terminal Ready) line to indicate that it was
ready to receive, initiate, or continue a modem session.</p>
<p>Later, handshake lines were used for other equipment-specific kinds of
out-of-band signals.  The most commonly re-used lines were DCD (data
carrier detect) and RI (Ring Indicator).</p>
<p>Three-wire versions of RS-232 omitted these handshake lines
entirely. A chronic source of frustration was equipment at one end of
your link that failed to supply an out-of-band signal that the
equipment at the other end needed.  The modern version of this is
GPSes that fail to supply their 1PPS (a high-precision top-of-second
pulse) over one of the handshake lines.</p>
<p>Even when your hardware generated and received handshake signals, you
couldn’t necessarily trust cables to pass them. Cheap cables often
failed to actually connect all 25 (or 9) leads end-to-end.  Then there
were "crossover" or "null modem" cables, which for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_modem">reasons too painful to go
into here</a> crosswired the transmit and receive lines. Of course none
of these variants were reliably labeled, so debugging an RS232 link
with a random cable pulled out of a box often involved a lot of
profanity.</p>
<p>Another significant problem was that an RS-232 device not actually
sending data was undetectable without analog-level monitoring
equipment. You couldn’t tell a working but silent device from one that
had come unplugged or suffered a connection fault in its wiring.  This
caused no end of complications when troubleshooting and is a major
reason USB was able to displace RS-232 after 1994.</p>
<p>A trap for the unwary that opened up after about the year 2000 is that
peripheral connectors labeled RS232 could have one of two different
sets of voltage levels. If they’re pins or sockets in a DB9 or DB25
shell, the voltage swing between 1 and 0 bits can be as much as 50
volts, and is usually about 26.  Bare connectors on a circuit board,
or chip pins, increasingly came to use what’s called "TTL serial" -
same signalling with a swing of 3.3 or (less often) 5 volts. You can’t
wire standard RS232 to TTL serial directly; the link needs a device
called a "level shifter".  If you connect without one, components on
the TTL side will get fried.</p>
<p>RS-232 passed out of common knowledge in the mid- to late 1990s, but
didn’t finally disappear from general-purpose computers until around
2010.  Standard RS-232 is still widely used not just in the niche
applications previously mentioned, but also in point-of-sale systems
diagnostic consoles on commercial-grade routers, and debugging
consoles on embedded systems. The TTL serial variant is often used
in the latter context, especially on maker devices.</p>

<h2 id="_wan_time_gone_the_forgotten_pre_internets">WAN time gone: The forgotten pre-Internets</h2>
<div>
<p>Today, the TCP/IP Internet is very nearly the only WAN
(Wide-Area-Network) left standing. It was not always so.  From the
late '70s to the mid-1990s - but especially between 1981 and 1991 -
there were a profusion of WANs of widely varying capability.  You are
most likely to trip over references to these in email archives from
that time; one characteristic of it is that people sometimes
advertised multiple different network addresses in their signatures.</p>
<p>Every hacker over a certain age remembers either UUCP or the BBS
scene. Many participated in both. In those days access to the
"real" net (ARPANET, which became Internet) was difficult if you
weren’t affiliated with one of a select group of federal agencies,
military contractors, or university research labs. So we made do
with what we had, which was modems and the telephone network.</p>
<p>UUCP stands for Unix to Unix Copy Program.  Between its escape from
Bell Labs in 1979 and the mass-market Internet explosion of the
mid-1990s, it provided slow but very low-cost networking
among Unix sites using modems and the phone network.</p>
<p>UUCP was a store-and-forward system originally intended for
propagating software updates, but its major users rapidly became email
and a thing called USENET (launched 1981) that was the ur-ancestor of
Stack Overflow and other modern web fora.  It supported topic groups
for messages which, propagated from their point of origin through
UUCP, would eventually flood to the whole network.</p>
<p>In part, UUCP and USENET were a hack around the two-tier rate
structure that then existed for phone calls, with "local" being
flat-rate monthly and "long-distance" being expensively metered by the
minute. UUCP traffic could be relayed across long distances by local
hops.</p>
<p>A direct descendant of USENET still exists, as Google Groups
<span><br>[The old free-floating USENET still exists too, but Google
Groups is where you can find what has been preserved of the
historical USENET archives.]<br></span>, but was
much more central to the hacker culture before cheap Internet. Open
source as we now know it germinated in USENET groups dedicated to
sharing source code.  Several conventions still in use today, like
having project metadata files named README and NEWS and INSTALL,
became established there in the early 1980s - though at least README
was older, having been seen in the wild back on the PDP-10.</p>
<p>Two key dates in USENET history were universally known.  One was the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Renaming">Great Renaming</a> in 1987,
when the name hierarchy of USENET topic groups was reorganized. The
other was the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September">"September that never
ended"</a> in 1993, when the AOL commercial timesharing services gave its
users access to USENET.  The resulting vast flood of newbies proved
difficult to acculturate.</p>
<p>UUCP explains a quirk you may run across in old mailing-list archives:
the bang-path address.  UUCP links were point-to-point and you had to
actually specify the route of your mail through the UUCP network; this
led to people publishing addresses of the form
"…!bigsite!foovax!barbox!user", presuming that people who wanted to
reach them would know how to reach bigsite. As Internet access became
more common in the early 1990s, addresses of the form <a href="mailto:user@hostname">user@hostname</a>
displaced bang paths. During this transition period there were some
odd hybrid mail addresses that used a "%" to weld bang-path routing
to Internet routing.</p>
<p>UUCP was notoriously difficult to configure, enough so that people
who knew how often put that skill on their CVs in the justified
expectation that it could land them a job.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the microcomputer world, a different kind of
store-and-forward evolved - the BBS (Bulletin-Board System).  This was
software running on a computer (after 1991 usually an MS-DOS machine)
with one (or, rarely, more) attached modems that could accept incoming
phone calls.  Users (typically, just one user at a time!) would access
the BBS using a their own modem and a terminal program; the BBS
software would allow them to leave messages for each other, upload and
download files, and sometimes play games.</p>
<p>The first BBS, patterned after the community notice-board in a
supermarket, was fielded in Chicago in 1978. Over the next eighteen
years over a hundred thousand BBSes flashed in and out of existence,
typically run out of the sysop’s bedroom or garage with a
spare computer.</p>
<p>From 1984 the BBS culture evolved a primitive form of internetworking
called "FidoNet" that supported cross-site email and a forum system
broadly resembling USENET. There were also a few ports of UUCP to DOS
personal computers, but none gained any real traction. Thus the UUCP
and BBS cultures remained separate until both were ploughed under
by the Internet.</p>
<p>During a very brief period after 1990, just before mass-market
Internet, software with BBS-like capabilities but supporting multiple
simultaneous modem users (and often offering USENET access) got written
for low-cost Unix systems.  The end-stage BBSes, when they survived,
moved to the Web and dropped modem access.  The
<a href="https://cellar.org/faq.php?s=cf9b960cb5e732446d4d5ec5b9b4eb29&amp;faq=what_it_is#faq_cellar_history">history
of cellar.org</a> chronicles this period.</p>
<p>A handful of BBSes are still run by nostalgicists, and some artifacts
from the culture are still <a href="http://textfiles.com/">preserved</a>. But, like
the UUCP network, the BBS culture as a whole collapsed when
inexpensive Internet became widely available.</p>
<p>Almost the only cultural memory of BBSes left is around a family of
file-transfer protocols - XMODEM, YMODEM, and ZMODEM - developed
shortly before BBSes and primarily used on them. For hackers of that
day who did not cut their teeth on minicomputers with native TCP/IP,
these were a first introduction to concepts like packetization, error
detection, and retransmission. To this day (2018), hardware from at least one
commercial router vendor (Cisco) accepts software patches by XMODEM
upload through a serial port.</p>
<p>Also roughly contemporaneous with USENET and the BBS culture, and also
destroyed or absorbed by cheap Internet, were some commercial
timesharing services supporting dialup access by modem, of which the
best known were AOL (America Online) CompuServe, and GEnie; others
included The Source and Prodigy. These provided BBS-like
facilities. Every hacker knew of these, though few used them. They
have left no traces at all in today’s hacker culture.</p>
<p>One last tier of pre-Internets, operating from about 1981 to about
1991 with isolated survivals into the 2000s, was various academic
wide-area networks using leased-line telephone links: CSNET, BITNET,
EARN, VIDYANET, and others. These generally supported email and
file-transfer services that would be recognizable to Internet users,
though with different addressing schemes and some odd quirks (such as
not being 8-bit clean). They <em>have</em> left some traces today. Notably,
the term "listserv" for an electronic mailing list, still occasionally
used today, derives from an email reflector used on BITNET.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_ftp_gopher_and_the_forgotten_pre_web">FTP, Gopher, and the forgotten pre-Web</h2>
<div>
<p>The World Wide Web went from nowhere to ubiquity during a few short
years in the early 1990s. Before that, from 1971 onwards, file
transfer between Internet sites was normally done with a tool named
ftp, for the File Transfer Protocol it used.  Every hacker once knew
how to use this tool.</p>
<p>Eventually ftp was mostly subsumed by web browsers speaking the FTP protocol
themselves. This is why you may occasionally still see URLs with an
"ftp:" service prefix; this informs the browser that it should expect
to speak to an FTP server rather than an HTTP/HTTPS server.</p>
<p>There was another.  The same year (1991) that Tim Berners-Lee was
inventing the World Wide Web, a group of hackers at the University of
Minnesota devised "Gopher", a hypertext protocol that was menu-centric
rather than link-centric.  For a few years Gopher competed vigorously
with the early Web, and many hackers used both.  Adoption was stalled
when the University decided to charge a license fee for its
implementation in early 1993.  Then, early Web browsers added the
ability to speak Gopher protocol and display Gopher documents. By 2000
Gopher was effectively dead, although a few Gopher servers are still
operated in a spirit of nostalgia and irony.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_terminal_confusion">Terminal confusion</h2>
<div>
<p>The software terminal emulators on modern Unix systems are the
near-end - and probably final - manifestations of a long and rather
confused history.  It began with early displays sometimes called
"glass TTYs" because they emulated teletypes - but less expensively,
because they didn’t require consumables like paper.  The phrase "dumb
terminal" is equivalent. The first of these was shipped in 1969.
The best-remembered of them is probably still the ADM-3 from 1975.</p>
<p>The very earliest VDTs, like the ASR-33 before them, could form only
upper-case letters. An interesting hangover from these devices was
that, even though most VDTs made after 1975 could form lower-case
letters, Unix (and Linux as late as 2018) responded to a login
beginning with an upper-case letter by switching to a mode which
upcased all input.  If you create an account with this sort of
login name and a mixed-case password, hilarity ensues.  If the
password is upper-case the hilarity is less desperate but still
confusing for the user.</p>
<p>The classic "smart terminal" VDT designs that have left a mark on
later computing appeared during a relatively short period beginning in
1975.  Devices like the Lear-Siegler ADM-3A (1976) and the DEC VT-100
(1978) inherited the 80-character line width of punched cards (longer
than the 72-character line length of teletypes) and supported as many
lines as could fit on an approximately 4:3 screen (and in 2K bytes of
display memory); they are the reason your software terminal emulator
has a 24x80 or 25x80 default size.</p>
<p>These terminals were called "smart" because they could interpret
control codes to do things like addressing the cursor to any point on
the screen in order to produce truly 2-dimensional displays
<span><br>[Confusingly, the ADM-3A (which could address any screen cell)
was described in marketing copy as a "dumb" terminal, not a "smart"
one. This is because there was a rival definition of "smart" as
capable of doing local editing of the screen without involving the
remote computer, like an IBM 3270. But since minicomputers never used
that capability this definition was never live in the Unix world, and
has mostly faded out of use.]<br></span>. The ability to do bold, underline or
reverse-video highlighting also rapidly became common.  Colored text
and backgrounds, however, only became available a few years before
VDTs were obsolesced; before that displays were monochromatic.  Some
had crude, low-resolution dot graphics; a few types supported
black-and-white vector graphics.</p>
<p>Early VDTs used a crazy variety of control codes.  One of the
principal relics of this era is the Unix terminfo database, which
tracked these codes so terminal-using applications could do abstracted
operations like "move the cursor" without being restricted to working
with just one terminal type.  The curses(3) library still used with
software terminal emulators was originally intended to make this sort
of thing easier.</p>
<p>After 1979 there was an ANSI standard for terminal control codes,
based on the DEC VT-100 (being supported in the IBM PC’s original
screen driver gave it a boost) <span><br>[It was not commonly known
that the VT100 was designed to fit a 1976 standard called ECMA-48;
ANSI simply adopted it.]<br></span>. By the early 1990s ANSI conformance was
close to universal in VDTs, which is why that’s what your software
terminal emulator does.</p>
<p>This whole technology category was rapidly wiped out in
general-purpose computing, like dinosaurs after the Alvarez strike,
when bit-mapped color displays on personal computers that could match
the dot pitch of a monochrome VDT became relatively inexpensive,
around 1992. The legacy VDT hardware lingered longest in dedicated
point-of-sale systems, remaining not uncommon until as late as 2010 or
so.</p>
<p>It’s not true, as is sometimes suggested, that heritage from the VDT
era explains the Unix command line - that actually predated VDTs,
going back to the last generation of printing terminals in the late
1960s and early 1970s.  Every hacker once knew that this is why we
often speak of "printing" output when we mean sending it to
standard output that is normally connected to a terminal emulator.</p>
<p>What the VDT era <strong>does</strong> explain is some of our heritage games (see
next section) and a few surviving utility programs like vi(1), top(1)
and mutt(1).  These are what advanced visual interfaces looked like in
the VDT era, before bitmapped displays and GUIs.  This is why program
interfaces that are two-dimensional but use characters only are now
called TUI ("terminal user interface"), but the term is an
anachronism; it was coined after "GUI" became common.</p>
<p>It also explains "screensavers". Every hacker once knew that these are
so called because cathode-ray tubes were subject to a phenomenon
called "phosphor burn-in" that could permanently damage the screen’s
ability to display information. Software to randomly vary the image(s)
on your display was originally written to prevent burn-in.
Flatscreens don’t have this problem; the secondary purpose of doing
something visually interesting with that blank space took over.</p>

<div>
<h2 id="_the_early_awful_days_of_bitmapped_displays">The early, awful days of bitmapped displays</h2>
<div>
<p>Terminals - which could usually only display a fixed alphabet of
formed characters - were eventually replaced by the "bitmapped" style
of display we’re used to today, with individual screen pixels
manipulable.  Every hacker once knew that though there were earlier
precedents done as research, the first production system with a
bitmapped display was the Alto, built at the Xerox Palo Alto Research
Center in 1973. (The laser printer and Ethernet were also invented
there.)</p>
<p>It was <strong>not</strong> generally known that the Alto had a display only 608 pixels
wide and 808 high - folk memory confused it with later displays in the
1024x1024 range. Its 1981 successor the Dandelion achieved 1024×809;
an attempt to commercialize it as the "Xerox Star" failed. But in 1982
the newly-born Sun Microsystems shipped the Sun-1 with 1024×800
pixels; descendants of this machine (and very similar designs by other
vendors) became enormously successful - until they were wiped out by
descendants of the IBM PC in the late 1990s. Before that, most hackers
dreamed of owning a Sun-class workstation, and the bitmapped display
was a significant part of that allure.</p>
<p>Alas, these machines were too expensive for individuals. But from 1975
onwards primitive bitmapped-display began to appear on personal
color computers such as the Apple II, often through consumer-grade television
sets.  These had one feature the workstation displays of the time lacked -
color - but their pixel resolutions were laughable by comparison. The
Apple II in "Hi-res" mode could only manage 280×192, an area you could
easily cover with the palm of your hand on the displays of 2017.</p>
<p>People who remember these early consumer-grade color displays show a
tendency to both think they arrived sooner than they did and filter
their memories through a nostalgic haze.  In reality they remained
astoundingly bad compared to even a Sun-1 for a long time after the
Apple II; you couldn’t get even near the crispness of an 80×24 display
of text on a VDT with them.  Using a consumer-grade TV also meant
coping with eyestrain-inducing artifacts around the limited amount of
text it could display, due to NTSC chroma-luminance crossover.</p>
<p>Because hackers <strong>needed</strong> good text display for programming - and
because many knew what workstation graphics in the 1024×1024 range
looked like - many of us dismissed these displays (and the computers
they were attached to) as near-useless toys.  We sought workstation
graphics when we could get it and used VDTs when we couldn’t.</p>
<p>In 1984, the original Macintosh was the first consumer-grade machine
with a dedicated bit-mapped display that come within even distant hail
of workstation-class graphics - 512×342 black and white. It was shortly
followed by the IBM EGA adapter and its numerous cheap clones with
640x350 at a whopping 16 colors, accompanied by flicker and other
artifacts. In the following years, 256 colors gradually crept in,
starting with a resolution of - wait for it - 320x200.</p>
<p>For another five years or so consumer hardware was still split between
low-resolution b&amp;w displays and <em>abysmally</em> low-resolution,
hard-to-use color displays. If we had to use a consumer-grade computer
at all, most of us tended to prefer the many b&amp;w displays that were
relatively inexpensive, surprisingly nice on the eyes and better for
our life’s work - code.</p>
<p>There was, however, a cohort of hackers (especially among the younger
and newer ones of the mid-1980s) who worked hard to get as much
performance as they could from the pathetic color displays and TVs, as
well as from the earliest attempts at computer sound hardware. The
resulting chunky graphics with pixelated "sprites" moving across the
screen, accompanied by a chirpy/buzzy style of music and sound effects
is still used in some 21st-century games for pure nostalgic value.
If you hear a reference to "8-bit" graphics or sound, that’s what
it means in these latter days.</p>
<p>Monitors capable of 1024×1024 <em>color</em> display did not reach even the
high end of the consumer market until about 1990 and did not become
generally available until about 1992. Not by coincidence, this was
when PC manufacturers began to put serious pressure on workstation
vendors. But for some years after that the quality of these displays
remained relatively poor, with coarse dot pitches and fringing effects
due to the expense and difficulty of manufacturing decent color masks
for cathode-ray tubes.  These problems weren’t fully solved until CRTs
were on the verge of being obsolesced by flatscreens.</p>
<p>Once we were able to take color displays at 1024x1024 and up for
granted, a lot of this history faded from memory. Even people who
lived through it have a tendency to forget what conditions were like
before flatscreens, and are often surprised to be reminded how low the
pixel resolutions were on older hardware.</p>

<h2 id="_games_before_guis">Games before GUIs</h2>
<div>
<p>Before bit-mapped color displays became common and made
graphics-intensive games the norm, there was a vigorous tradition of
games that required only textual interfaces or the character-cell
graphics on a VDT.</p>
<p>These VDT games often found their way to early microcomputers as well.
In part this was because some of those early micros themselves had
weak or nonexistent graphical capabilities, and in part because
textual games were relatively easy to port and featured as type-in
projects in magazines and books.</p>
<p>The oldest group of games that were once common knowledge are the
<a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/super-star-trek/">Trek</a> family, a clade of
games going back to 1971 in which the player flew the starship
Enterprise through the Federation fighting Klingons and Romulans and
other enemies. Every hacker over a certain age remembers spending
hours playing these.</p>
<p>The history of the Trek clade is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_(text_game)">too complex to
summarize here</a>.  The thing to notice about them is that the extremely
crude interface (designed not even for VDTs but for teletypes!) hid
what was actually a relatively sophisticated wargame in which
initiative, tactical surprise, and logistics all played significant
roles.</p>
<p>Every hacker once knew what the phrase "You are in a maze of twisty
little passages, all alike" meant, and often used variants about
confusing situations in real life (For example, "You are in a maze of
twisty little technical standards, all different").  It was from the
<em>very first</em> dungeon-crawling adventure game, <em>Colossal Cave
Adventure</em> (1977). People who knew this game from its beginnings often
thought of it as ADVENT, after its 6-character filename on the PDP-10
where it first ran <span><br>[There is a <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/open-adventure/">port of ADVENT in modern C</a>.]<br></span>.</p>
<p>When the original author of ADVENT wasn’t inventing an entire genre of
computer games, he was
<a href="http://www.filfre.net/2011/05/will-crowthers-adventure-part-1/">writing
the low-level firmware for some of the earliest ARPANET routers</a>. This
was not generally known at the time, but illustrates how intimate the
connection between these early games and the cutting edge of serious
programming was. "Game designer" was not yet a separate thing, then.</p>
<p>You might occasionally encounter "xyzzy" as a nonce variable name.
Every hacker used to know that xyzzy was a magic word in ADVENT.</p>
<p>ADVENT had a direct successor that was even more popular - Zork, first
released in 1979 by hackers at MIT on a PDP-10 (initially under the name
"Dungeon") and later successfully commercialized. This game is why
every hacker once knew that a zorkmid was the currency of the Great
Underground Empire, and that if you wander around in dark places
without your lantern lit you might be eaten by a grue.</p>
<p>There was another family of games that took a different, more visual
approach to dungeon-crawling. They are generally called "roguelikes",
after the earliest widely-distributed games in this group, <em>Rogue</em>
from 1980.  They featured top-down, maplike views of dungeon levels
through which the player would wander battling monsters and seeking
treasure.</p>
<p>The most widely played games in this group were Hack (1982) and
Nethack (1987).  Nethack is notable for having been one of the
earliest programs in which the development group was consciously
organized as a distributed collaboration over the Internet;
at the time, this was a sufficiently novel idea to be advertised
in the project’s name.</p>
<p>Rogue’s descendants were the most popular and successful TUI games
ever.  Though they gradually passed out of universal common knowledge
after the mid-1990s, they retain devoted minority followings even
today.  Their fans accurately point out that the primitive state of
interface design encouraged concentration on plot and story values,
leading to a surprisingly rich imaginative experience.</p>

<h2 id="_ascii">ASCII</h2>
<div>
<p>ASCII, the American Standard Code for Information Interchange, evolved
in the early 1960s out of a family of character codes used on
teletypes.</p>
<p>ASCII, unlike a lot of other early character encodings, is likely to
live forever - because by design the low 127 code points of Unicode
<strong>are</strong> ASCII.  If you know what UTF-8 is (and you should) every ASCII
file is correct UTF-8 as well.</p>

</div>
<p>Using the second table, it’s easier to understand a couple of things:</p>
<div><ul>
<li>
<p>
The Control modifier on your keyboard basically clears the top three
  bits of whatever character you type, leaving the bottom five and
  mapping it to the 0..31 range.  So, for example, Ctrl-SPACE, Ctrl-@,
  and Ctrl-` all mean the same thing: NUL.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Very old keyboards used to do Shift just by toggling the 32 or 16
  bit, depending on the key; this is why the relationship between
  small and capital letters in ASCII is so regular, and the
  relationship between numbers and symbols, and some pairs of symbols,
  is sort of regular if you squint at it. The ASR-33, which was an
  all-uppercase terminal, even let you generate some punctuation characters
  it didn’t have keys for by shifting the 16 bit; thus, for example,
  Shift-K (0x4B) became a [ (0x5B)
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<p>It used to be common knowledge that the original 1963 ASCII had been
slightly different. It lacked tilde and vertical bar; 5E was an
up-arrow rather than a caret, and 5F was a left arrow rather than
underscore. Some early adopters (notably DEC) held to the 1963 version.</p>
<p>If you learned your chops after 1990 or so, the mysterious part of
this is likely the control characters, code points 0-31.  You probably
know that C uses NUL as a string terminator.  Others, notably LF =
Line Feed and HT = Horizontal Tab, show up in plain text.  But what
about the rest?</p>
<p>Many of these are remnants from teletype protocols that have either
been dead for a very long time or, if still live, are completely
unknown in computing circles. A few had conventional meanings that
were half-forgotten even before Internet times.  A <strong>very</strong> few are
still used in binary data protocols today.</p>
<p>Here’s a tour of the meanings these had in older computing, or retain
today. If you feel an urge to send me more, remember that the emphasis
here is on what was <em>common knowledge</em> back in the day.  If I don’t
know it now, we probably didn’t generally know it then.</p>
<div><dl>
<dt>
NUL (Null) = Ctrl-@
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   Survives as the string terminator in C.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
SOH (Start of Heading) = Ctrl-A
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   Rarely used (as Ctrl-A) as a section divider in otherwise textual
   formats. Some versions of Unix mailbox format used it as a
   message divider. One very old version-control system (SCCS)
   did something similar.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
STX (Start of Text), ETX (End of Text) = Ctrl-B, Ctrl-C
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   Very rarely used as packet or control-sequence delimiters.  You
   will probably never see this, and the only place I’ve ever seen
   it was on a non-Unix OS in the early 1980s.  ETX is Ctrl-C,
   which is a SIGINT interrupt character on Unix systems, but that has
   nothing to do with its ASCII meaning per se and probably derives from
   abbreviating the word "Cancel".
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
EOT (End of Transmission) = Ctrl-D
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   As Ctrl-D, the way you type "End of file" to a Unix terminal.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
ENQ (Enquiry) = Ctrl-E
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   In the days of hardware serial terminals, there was a convention
   that if a computer sent ENQ to a terminal, it should answer back with
   terminal type identification. While this was not universal, it at
   least gave computers a fighting chance of autoconfiguring what
   capabilities it could assume the terminal to have.  Further back,
   on teletypes, the answerback had been a station ID rather than a
   device type; as late as the 1970s it was still generally remembered
   that ENQ’s earliest name in ASCII had been WRU ("Who are you?").
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
ACK (Acknowledge) = Ctrl-F
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   It used to be common for wire protocols written in ASCII to use
   ENQ/ACK as a handshake, sometimes with NAK as a failure indication
   (the XMODEM/YMODEM/ZMODEM protocol did this <span><br>[In fact, the
   inventor reports: "I invented Xmodem based upon an ASCII pocket
   reference card.  ACK, NAK, SOH, EOT, sounded like good <em>words</em> to
   use to make a protocol."]<br></span>).  Hackers used to use ACK in speech as
   "I hear you" and were a bit put out when this convention was
   disrupted in the 1980s by Bill The Cat’s "Ack! Thppt!"
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
BEL (Bell) = Ctrl-G
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   Make the bell ring on the teletype - an attention signal.  This
   often worked on VDTs as well, but is no longer reliably the
   default on software terminal emulators.  Some map it to a
   visual indication like flashing the title bar.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
BS (Backspace) = Ctrl-H
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   Still does what it says on the tin, though there has been some
   historical confusion over whether the backspace key on a keyboard
   should behave like BS (nondestructive cursor move) or DEL
   (backspace and delete).  Never used in textual data protocols.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
HT (Horizontal tab) = Ctrl-I
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   Still does what it says on the tin. Sometimes used as a field
   separator in Unix textual file formats, but this is now
   old-fashioned and declining in usage.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
LF (Line Feed) = Ctrl-J
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   The Unix textual end-of-line.  Printing terminals interpreted it as
   "scroll down one line"; the Unix tty driver would normally wedge in
   a CR right before it on output (or in early versions, right after).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
VT (Vertical Tab) = Ctrl-K
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   In the days of printing terminals this often caused them to scroll
   down a configurable number of lines.  VDTs had any number of
   possible behaviors; at least some pre-ANSI ones interpreted VT as
   "scroll <strong>up</strong> one line". The only reason anybody remembers this one
   at all is that it persisted in Unix definitions of what a
   whitespace character is, even though it’s now extinct in the wild.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
FF (Form Feed) = Ctrl-L
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Eject the current page from your printing
   terminal.  Many VDTs interpreted this as a "clear screen"
   instruction.  Software terminal emulators sometimes still do. Often
   interpreted as a "screen refresh" request in textual-input Unix
   programs that bind other control characters (shells, editors,
   more/less, etc)
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
CR (Carriage Return) = Ctrl-M
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   It is now possible that the reader has never seen a typewriter, so
   this needs explanation: "carriage return" is the operation of
   moving your print head or cursor to the left margin. Windows, other
   non-Unix operating systems, and some Internet protocols (such as
   SMTP) tend to use CR-LF as a line terminator, rather than bare LF.
   The reason it was CR-LF rather than LF-CR goes back to Teletypes: a
   Teletype printed ten characters per second, but the print-head
   carriage took longer than a tenth of a second to return to the left
   side of the paper.  So if you ended a line with line-feed, then
   carriage-return, you would usually see the first character of the
   next line smeared across the middle of the paper, having been
   struck while the carriage was still zipping to the left.  Pre-Unix
   MacOS used a bare CR.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
SO (Shift Out), SI (Shift In) = Ctrl-N, Ctrl-O
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   Escapes to and from an alternate character set. Unix software used
   to emit them to drive pre-ANSI VDTs that interpreted them that way,
   but native Unix usage is rare to nonexistent.  On teletypes with a
   two-color ink ribbon (the second color usually being red) SO was a
   command to shift to the alternate color, SI to shift back.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
DLE (Data Link Escape) = Ctrl-P
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   Sometimes used as a packet-framing character in binary protocols.
   That is, a packet starts with a DLE, ends with a DLE, and if one
   of the interior data bytes matches DLE it is doubled.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
DC[1234] (Device Control [1234]) = Ctrl-[QRST]
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   Four device control codes used by the once-ubiquitous ASR-33
   teletype to turn on and off its paper-tape reader and punch, which
   were used to read and write machine-readable data.  On serial
   terminals, there was a common software flow-control protocol - used
   over ASCII but separate from it - in which XOFF (DC3) was used as a
   request to pause transmission and XON (DC1) was used as a request
   to resume transmission.  As Ctrl-S and Ctrl-Q these were
   implemented in the Unix terminal driver and long outlived their
   origin in the Model 33 Teletype. And not just Unix; this was
   implemented in CP/M and DOS, too.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
NAK (Negative Acknowledge) = Ctrl-U
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   See the discussion of ACK above.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
SYN (Synchronous Idle) = Ctrl-V
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   Never to my knowledge used specially after teletypes, except in
   synchronous serial protocols never used on micros or minis.  Be careful
   not to confuse this with the SYN (synchronization) packet used
   in TCP/IP’s SYN SYN-ACK initialization sequence.  In an unrelated
   usage, many Unix tty drivers use this (as Ctrl-V) for the
   literal-next character that lets you quote following control
   characters such as Ctrl-C.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
ETB (End of Transmission Block) = Ctrl-W
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   Nowadays this is usually "kill window" on a web browser, but it
   used to mean "delete previous word" in some contexts and sometimes
   still does.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
CAN (Cancel), EM (End of Medium) = Ctrl-X, Ctrl-Y
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   Never to my knowledge used specially after teletypes.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
SUB (Substitute) = Ctrl-Z
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   DOS and Windows use Ctrl-Z (SUB) as an end-of-file character; this
   is unrelated to its ASCII meaning. It was common knowledge then
   that this use of ^Z had been inherited from a now largely forgotten
   earlier OS called CP/M (1974), and into CP/M from earlier DEC
   minicomputer OSes such as RSX-11 (1972).  Unix uses Ctrl-Z as the
   "suspend process" command keystroke.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
ESC (Escape)
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   Still commonly used as a control-sequence introducer.  This usage
   is especially associated with the control sequences recognized
   by VT100 and ANSI-standard VDTs, and today by essentially all
   software terminal emulators
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
[FGRU]S ({Field|Group|Record|Unit} Separator)
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   There are some uses of these in ATM and bank protocols (these
   have never been common knowledge, but I’m adding this note to forestall
   yet more repetitions from area specialists who will apparently
   otherwise keep telling me about it until the end of time). FS, as
   Ctrl-\, sends SIGQUIT under some Unixes, but this has nothing
   to do with ASCII. Ctrl-] (GS) is the exit character from telnet,
   but this also has nothing to do with its ASCII meaning.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
DEL (Delete)
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
   Usually an input character meaning "backspace and delete".
   Under older Unix variants, sometimes a SIGINT interrupt character.
</p>
</dd>
</dl></div>
<p>The "Break" key on a teletype mimicked the current-loop line
   condition of a broken wire.  A quiet teletype machine would start
   cycling but doing nothing when the line was disconnected, so it was
   possible to know that this had occurred.  (It was effectively
   receiving a series of NULL characters.)</p>
<p>Not all of these were so well known that any hacker could instantly
map from mnemonic to binary, or vice-versa.  The well-known set was
roughly NUL, BEL, BS, HT, LF, FF, CR, ESC, and DEL.</p>
<p>There are a few other bits of ASCII lore worth keeping in mind…</p>
<div><ul>
<li>
<p>
A Meta or Alt key on a VDT added 128 to the ASCII keycode for
  whatever it’s modifying (probably - on a few machines with peculiar
  word lengths they did different things).  Software terminal
  emulators have more variable behavior; many of them now simply
  insert an ESC before the modified key, which Emacs treats as
  equivalent to adding 128.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
An item of once-common knowledge that was half-forgotten fairly
  early (like, soon after VDTs replaced teletypes) is that the
  binary value of DEL (0x7F, 0b01111111) descends from its use on
  paper tape. Seven punches could overwrite any character in ASCII,
  and tape readers skipped DEL (and NUL - no punches).  This is why
  DEL was anciently called the "Rubout" character and is an island at
  the other end of the ASCII table from the other control characters.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
VDT keyboards often had a "Break" key inherited from the ASR-33
  (there’s a vestigial remnant of this even on the IBM PC keyboard).
  On the AS-33 this had mimicked the current-loop line condition of a
  broken wire, which was detectable. On a VDT this didn’t send a
  well-formed ASCII character; rather, it caused an out-of-band
  condition that would be seen as a NUL with a framing error at the
  other end. This was used as an attention or interrupt signal
  <span><br>[The Break key has a cognate in "Break!" used as a similar
  attention signal or interrupt in voice radio procedure. Both derive
  from 19th-century telegraphic practice.]<br></span>.

<h2 id="_the_slow_birth_of_distributed_collaboration">The slow birth of distributed collaboration</h2>
<div>
<p>Nowadays we take for granted a public infrastructure of distributed
version control and a lot of practices for distributed teamwork that
go with it - including development teams that never physically have to
meet. But these tools, and awareness of how to use them, were a long
time developing.  They replace whole layers of earlier practices that
were once general but are now half- or entirely forgotten.</p>
<p>The earliest practice I can identify that was directly ancestral was
the DECUS tapes.  DECUS was the Digital Equipment Corporation Users'
Group, chartered in 1961. One of its principal activities was
circulating magnetic tapes of public-domain software shared by DEC
users. The early history of these tapes is not well-documented, but
the habit was well in place by 1976.</p>
<p>One trace of the DECUS tapes seems to be the README convention. While
it entered the Unix world through USENET in the early 1980s, it seems
to have spread there from DECUS tapes.  The DECUS tapes begat the
USENET source-code groups, which were the incubator of the practices
that later became "open source". Unix hackers used to watch for
interesting new stuff on comp.sources.unix as automatically as they
drank their morning coffee.</p>
<p>The DECUS tapes and the USENET sources groups were more of a
publishing channel than a collaboration medium, though. Three pieces
were missing to fully support that: version control, patching, and
forges.</p>
<p>Version control was born in 1972, though SCCS (Source Code Control
System) didn’t escape Bell Labs until 1977. The proprietary licensing
of SCCS slowed its uptake; one response was the freely reusable RCS
(Revision Control System) in 1982.</p>
<p>The first real step towards across-network collaboration was the
patch(1) utility in 1984.  The concept seems so obvious now that
even hackers who predate patch(1) have trouble remembering what it
was like when we only knew how to pass around source-code changes
as entire altered files. But that’s how it was.</p>
<p>Even with SCCS/RCS/patch the friction costs of distributed development
over the Internet were still so high that some years passed before
anyone thought to try it seriously.  I have looked for, but not found,
definite examples earlier than nethack. This was a roguelike game
launched in 1987.  Nethack developers passed around whole files - and
later patches - by email, sometimes using SCCS or RCS to manage local
copies. <span><br>[I was an early nethack devteam member.  I did not at
the time understand how groundbreaking what we were doing actually
was.]<br></span>.</p>
<p>Distributed development could not really get going until the third
major step in version control.  That was CVS (Concurrent Version
System) in 1990, the oldest VCS still in wide use at time of writing
in 2017.  Though obsolete and now half-forgotten, CVS was the first
version-control system to become so ubiquitous that every hacker once
knew it. CVS, however, had significant design flaws <span><br>[In
particular, CVS tends to behave very badly around file renames and
deletions.]<br></span>; it fell out of use rapidly when better alternatives
became available.</p>
<p>Between around 1989 and the breakout of mass-market Internet in
1993-1994, fast Internet became available enough to hackers that
distributed development in the modern style began to become thinkable.
The next major steps were not technical changes but cultural ones.</p>
<p>In 1991 Linus Torvalds announced Linux as a distributed collaborative
effort.  It is now easy to forget that early Linux development used
the same patch-by-email method as nethack - there were no public Linux
repositories yet.  The idea that there <strong>ought</strong> to be public
repositories as a normal practice for major projects (in addition to
shipping source tarballs) wouldn’t really take hold until after I
published "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" in 1997. While CatB was
influential in promoting distributed development via shared public
repositories, the technical weaknesses of CVS were in hindsight
probably an equally important reason this practice did not become
established sooner and faster.</p>
<p>The first dedicated software forge was not spun up until 1999.  That
was SourceForge, still extant today (2018).  At first it supported
only CVS, but it sped up the adoption of the (greatly superior)
Subversion, launched in 2000 by a group of former CVS developers.</p>
<p>Between 2000 and 2005 Subversion became ubiquitous common knowledge.
But in 2005 Linus Torvalds invented git, which would fairly rapidly
obsolesce all previous version-control systems and is a thing every
hacker <strong>now</strong> knows <span><br>[I’m deliberately not covering distributed
VCSes other than git here; while some of them were historically and
technically interesting, none ever became common knowledge.]<br></span>.</p>

   MS/DOS will, however, have been largely cloned from CP/M; this

  is invented.  The patch(1) utility is invented.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
1985
</dt>

  Major manufacturers cease production of cathode-ray tubes in favor

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Open Source Summit</span> Steam OS is the Arch-based distro for a handheld Linux games console, and Valve is aggressively pushing Linux's usability and Windows interoperability for the device.</p>
<p>Two unusual companies, Valve Software and Igalia, are working together to improve the Linux-based OS of the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/07/16/steam_deck_portable_gaming_pc/">Steam Deck handheld games console</a>. The device runs a Linux distro called Steam OS 3.0, but this is a totally different distro from the original <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2013/09/23/valve_gets_the_linux_feeling_with_steamos_for_gamers/">Steam OS it announced a decade ago</a>. Steam OS 1 and 2 were <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamos/buildyourown" rel="nofollow">based</a> on Debian, but Steam OS 3 is based on Arch Linux, as Igalia developer <a href="https://www.igalia.com/team/berto" rel="nofollow">Alberto García</a> described in a talk entitled <a href="https://osseu2023.sched.com/event/1Qv8y/how-steamos-is-contributing-to-the-linux-ecosystem-alberto-garcia-igalia" rel="nofollow"><em>How SteamOS is contributing to the Linux ecosystem</em></a>.</p>
<p>He explained that although Steam OS is built from some fairly standard components – the normal filesystem hierarchy, GNU user space, <code>systemd</code> and <code>dbus</code> – Steam OS has quite a few unique features. It has two distinct user interfaces: by default, it starts with the Steam games launcher, but users can also choose an option called <em>Switch to Desktop</em>, which results in a regular KDE Plasma desktop, with the ability to install anything: a web browser, normal Linux tools, and non-Steam games.</p>

    

<p>Obviously, though, Steam OS's <em>raison d'être</em> is to run Steam games, and most of those are Windows games which will never get native Linux versions. Valve's solution is <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton" rel="nofollow">Proton</a>, an open-source tool to run Windows games on Linux. It's formed from a collection of different FOSS packages, notably:</p>
<ul>
<li>

<p><a href="https://www.winehq.org/" rel="nofollow">Wine</a>, the compatibility layer for Windows APIs.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk" rel="nofollow">DXVK</a>, which translates DirectX version 9 to 11 calls into <a href="https://www.vulkan.org/" rel="nofollow">Vulkan</a> calls.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton" rel="nofollow">VKD3D-Proton</a>, which translates DirectX 12 calls to Vulkan.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>And also the <a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/" rel="nofollow">GStreamer</a> open source multimedia framework and other libraries.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The result is a remarkable degree of compatibility for some of the most demanding Windows apps around – Proton's compatibility database, <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="nofollow">ProtonDB</a>, offers these impressive stats:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Deck Verified Games</strong></p>

<p>▸ verified: 3,886</p>

<p>▸ verified or playable: 11,503</p>

<p><strong>Games on ProtonDB</strong></p>

<p>▸ recommended by three or more: 8,106</p>

<p>▸ recommended by two or more: 11,275</p>

<p>▸ recommended by at least one: 18,760</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proton was released by Valve in 2018 and is still in very active development. It's also actively involved in Wine development now, working alongside Codeweavers, whose efforts <em>The Reg</em> <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2000/12/15/corel_linux_selloff_nearly/">first reported on in 2000</a>.</p>
<p>Wherever possible, Wine converts Windows API calls to Linux ones, but sometimes, there is no matching Linux API. If there isn't, García said, <em>"Wine needs to implement the missing parts. This can result in overhead, and it's not always easily solvable in userspace. Solution: new Linux features to fill in the missing gaps."</em></p>

        


        

<p>One recent example is the new <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/futex2.html" rel="nofollow"><code>futex_waitv()</code></a> call in kernel 5.16, which brings a new API to Linux that's like Win32's <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/synchapi/nf-synchapi-waitformultipleobjects" rel="nofollow"><code>WaitForMultipleObjects()</code></a> call, as this Collabora <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/blog/2023/02/17/the-futex-waitv-syscall-gaming-on-linux/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> explains in depth. Another <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/20190719000322.106163-3-drosen@google.com/" rel="nofollow">patch</a> brings <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/784041/" rel="nofollow"><em>optional</em> case-insensitivity</a> to the F2FS, the <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/f2fs.html" rel="nofollow">Flash-friendly file system</a>. As another example, Valve and its partners are also working on more <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/931789/" rel="nofollow">reliable user-space spinlocks</a>.</p>
<p>A significant way that Steam OS differs from its Arch parent distro is that, like Chrome OS, it uses dual root partitions with failover: the active instance of the OS updates the <em>other</em> instance, so that if the update fails for some reason, it can automatically fail-over back to the original, unmodified instance. The snag is that Steam OS 3 uses Btrfs: Btrfs identifies filesystems by their UUID, and it <em>really</em> doesn't like it if it finds two partitions with the same UUID. Igalia engineer Guilherme Piccoli wrote a <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-btrfs/20230504170708.787361-1-gpiccoli@igalia.com/" rel="nofollow">patch</a> to make Btrfs able to handle this, as well as another to improve the performance of <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/911219/" rel="nofollow">split lock detector handling</a>.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/26/linux_kernel_report_2023/">Long-term support for Linux kernels is about to get a lot shorter</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/20/gnu_turns_40/">GNU turns 40: Stallman's baby still not ready for prime time, but hey, there's cake</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/14/pc_xt_with_hdmi/">These days you can teach old tech a bunch of new tricks</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/24/no_wifi7_on_win10/">Intel seems to think Wi-Fi 7 is too cool for old-school Windows 10</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Some of this illustrates the general thrust of the development being done: taking features that do already work, and making them work much faster to improve games performance on a relatively modestly specified device. The Steam Deck is based on an AMD Zen2-based <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-van-gogh-apu-for-steam-pictured-up-close" rel="nofollow">"Van Gogh"</a> SoC, codenamed <em>Aerith</em> after a <a href="https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Aerith_Gainsborough" rel="nofollow">character</a> from <em>Final Fantasy 7</em>. This uses a custom AMD GPU driver called <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/radv.html" rel="nofollow">RADV</a>, as well as a custom shader compiler, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/221410/announcements/detail/1602634609636894200" rel="nofollow">ACO</a>. Igalia engineer Melissa Wen is <a href="https://melissawen.github.io/blog/2023/08/21/amd-steamdeck-colors" rel="nofollow">working</a> with Valve and AMD to improve the Linux <a href="https://bootlin.com/pub/conferences/2017/kr/ripard-drm/ripard-drm.pdf" rel="nofollow">Direct Rendering Manager</a> [PDF] and its handling of high dynamic range (HDR) displays.</p>
<p>Steam OS is also an immutable distro, like <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/05/12/fedora_36_released/">Fedora Silverblue</a> and <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/12/endless_os_5/">Endless OS</a>. So, both its root partitions are normally read-only, and apps can only be installed via Flatpak. As former Elementary OS developer Cassidy Blaede, now with Endless, <a href="https://mastodon.blaede.family/@cassidy/111031129234702967" rel="nofollow">points out</a>, in this way, the very end-user focused Steam Deck is acting as a Trojan horse, persuading desktop users to adopt Flatpak. That too is driving improvements: for instance, while it uses <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_Desktop_Portal" rel="nofollow">XDG portals</a> to associate Flatpaks with file types, this is complicated by having two UIs, the Steam one and KDE. The result is additional <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal/issues/906" rel="nofollow">improvements</a> in portal handling. It's good that people are <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/thinking-with-portals" rel="nofollow">thinking</a> about this stuff.</p>

        

<p>There is much too much work going on to fit into a 40 minute session, and García talks quite fast as it is. His 49-page <a href="https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/osseu2023/83/steamos-and-linux-oss-eu-2023.pdf" rel="nofollow">presentation</a> [PDF] is dense and full of links. He skimmed over improvements to removable drive formatting, KDE's apps, icons, and drives handling, <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/" rel="nofollow">SDL</a>, the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/05/24/new_audio_server_pipewire_coming/">Pipewire audio server</a>, and more.</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L98v4epQmrg&amp;t=15124s" data-media="x-videoplayer">Youtube Video</a>
</p>
<p>Valve is a highly atypical company; its uniquely flat <a href="https://blog.inf.ed.ac.uk/sapm/2014/03/14/management-at-valve-an-analysis-of-management-practices-at-valve-software/" rel="nofollow">management structure</a> is even the subject of <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3884844" rel="nofollow">academic study</a>. Igalia, too, is a flat, worker-owned <a href="https://www.igalia.com/about/values" rel="nofollow">cooperative</a>. Although <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2012/12/10/valve_chief_confirms_steam_pc/">Valve's original plan</a> for the Steam Box wasn't a big hit, the Steam Deck is proving far more popular, and is literally putting Linux in the hands of one of the most Windows-centric audiences: what's sometimes called the <a href="https://www.arm.com/glossary/aaa-games" rel="nofollow">AAA games</a> marketplace. Although its firmly aimed at gamers, this is important work. Most of the commercial R&amp;D effort in Linux goes into server-focused work, neglecting the desktop.</p>

        

<p>This vulture maintains that <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/18/linux_desktop_debate/">ChromeOS is a Linux distro</a>. They've been <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2013/07/11/chromebooks_fastest_growing_pc_market/">selling strongly for a decade</a>. When Linux laptops <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/23/chromebook-mac-google-pc-sales" rel="nofollow">outsold Macs</a> in 2016, that meant that was the first Year of Linux on the desktop.</p>
<p>But although <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/04/22/chromeos_update/">it's getting there</a>, ChromeOS is admittedly not a general-purpose distro. Even though it has a similarly narrow primary focus, Steam OS definitely can be, and Valve is working hard to ensure that all the improvements and refinements it makes are pushed back upstream, so that any distro on any hardware can make use of them – and the performance and functionality improvements from Steam OS helps all Linux users. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since starting PostHog in 2020, we’ve learned a bunch about what does and doesn’t work when it comes to <a href="https://posthog.com/blog/dev-marketing-for-startups">marketing to engineers</a>. Paid ads is a slightly scary area because it is <em>very</em> easy to waste a bunch of money doing stuff that doesn't work. And a lot of it doesn't work. </p><p>This article shares specific, actionable advice for early-stage startups building dev tools in particular. I'm assuming that you've already decided that running paid ads is something that makes sense for your company. </p><p>I've split this into two sections – general misconceptions and then what we've learned, channel-by-channel. </p><h2 id="clearing-up-some-misconceptions"><span></span>Clearing up some misconceptions</h2><h3 id="paid-ads--marketing"><span></span>Paid ads =/= marketing</h3><p>Paid ads are a <em>subset</em> of marketing. Every time you talk about your product in <em>any</em> kind of context, you are doing marketing. This includes your website, turning up to events, writing content, posting on Twitter, chatting in an external Discord group, creating a YouTube tutorial, etc.</p><p>This means taking paid ads seriously (because of the $$$), but don't spend all your time here. At PostHog, paid ads take up ~10% of our marketing team's time in an average week. We spend 80%+ on writing. </p><h3 id="all-paid-ads-are-basically-the-same"><span></span>All paid ads are basically the same</h3><p>Very crudely, your ads will have one of two objectives – <em>conversion</em> or <em>awareness</em>. </p><p>Conversion means that you want people to click on your ad and then do something like sign up for your product. You can define conversion how you like – this is just a typical example. Conversion is easy to measure, which is why marketers like it. However, you are generally only <em>capturing</em> demand from people already aware of your product. </p><p>Awareness means you want people to see your ad. Maybe they won't click on it – that's ok. Your objective is to just get the word out so that someone is exposed to your product enough times that at some point they Google 'super cool product' and come sign up. Awareness-based ads are a small part of <em>creating</em> demand. This takes more effort to measure, but is totally possible - see below.  </p><p>We split our budget 50-50 between the two. This is not a 'rule' – just don't spend it all on conversion. </p><h3 id="paid-ads-dont-work-on-developers"><span></span>Paid ads don't work on developers</h3><p>Everyone who works at a tech company basically thinks they are immune to ads because they are super good at internetting, and have never seen an ad for a new product, clicked on it, and then signed up. Your <em>quantitative</em> attribution data in PostHog, or whatever analytics tool you are using, will seem to back this up. </p><p>This is why we ask all users where they heard about PostHog whenever they sign up or book a demo – it's a simple (optional) free text field. Enough of our users say 'ad on Google' or similar that we know paid ads do actually reach a large chunk of them. Especially ones with money to spend on behalf of their company. However, you need to take the time to collect and digest this <em>qualitative</em> attribution data in the first place. </p><h3 id="an-agency-will-solve-all-your-problems"><span></span>An agency will solve all your problems</h3><p>I'm a big fan of hiring an agency if you're a startup – paying $5-10k/mo for a small, outsourced team is way more efficient at this stage than hiring one paid ads specialist. Look in Europe – US agencies can be 2-3x more expensive. We use <a target="" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.heydigital.co/">Hey</a> and like them. </p><p><em>However,</em> I really recommend you get personally familiar with each of the main channels I've listed below first. Working with an agency isn't just set and forget – you need to constantly give feedback, ask questions, and suggest new ideas if you want to get the most out of them. </p><p>I personally like <a target="" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.demandcurve.com/growth-program">the Demand Curve course</a>, which will give you a great grounding in all the major paid ad channels – it helped get us off the ground and means we're much better equipped to give our agency feedback. Outsource the legwork, not your critical thinking. </p><h2 id="channel-by-channel-tips"><span></span>Channel-by-channel tips</h2><p>This is not a comprehensive guide on how to set up each channel (use Demand Curve or similar for this) - these are just some non-obvious things we wish we'd known at the start. </p><h3 id="google-search"><span></span>Google Search</h3><ul><li>Good for conversion, bad for awareness.</li><li>Do not let Google enable any of their bullshit AI-type suggested/dynamic/whatever keyword generator tools – they always result in weirdly worded ads that were clearly not written by a human. Use your <em>own</em> research about what keywords your target user is likely to search for, not what Google suggests.</li><li>If you have an SEO article that ranks well (top 3) make sure you aren't bidding on the same keywords – it's wasted money.</li><li>Bidding on your own brand may feel like a waste of money, but it's super cheap and defends you against competitor ads. </li></ul><h3 id="google-display"><span></span>Google Display</h3><ul><li>Good if you a) want to attract bots and irrelevant 'conversions', and b) you want zero control over where Google actually shows them (hello spammy healthcare Android apps!).</li><li>Do not be seduced by the incredible cheap cost per acquisition (CPA).</li><li>Avoid. </li></ul><h3 id="twitter"><span></span>Twitter</h3><ul><li>Good for awareness, bad for conversion.</li><li>We prefer promoting our own organic tweets over creating specific ads - promote an individual (e.g. founder) over the company account for better engagement. </li><li>Good paid channel for reaching devs generally.</li><li>Cheap but the targeting is quite basic (Twitter make you think it's much more sophisticated than it is).</li><li>Turn off replies to ads (or have thick skin!)</li></ul><h3 id="linkedin"><span></span>LinkedIn</h3><ul><li>Good for awareness, bad for conversion.</li><li>It is very easy to do ads that stand out here because 90% are so boring and corporate.</li><li>Good paid channel for reaching founder-type devs – and people who are more self-promotery, basically.</li><li>Expensive but hands-down the best targeting of any platform. </li></ul><h3 id="reddit"><span></span>Reddit</h3><ul><li>Very cheap but poor for awareness or conversion. Very rudimentary ad tools.</li><li>Instead, invest the time in being an active member of relevant subreddits where you contribute actual value to those people. This takes a lot more work.</li><li>Redditors hate ads nearly as much as HN readers do. Nearly. </li></ul><h3 id="quora"><span></span>Quora</h3><ul><li>Dark horse – good for conversion and awareness.</li><li>Quite cheap, good targeting.</li><li>Seriously, I don't know why more people don't use Quora. </li></ul><h3 id="product-hunt"><span></span>Product Hunt</h3><ul><li>Good for awareness and conversion <em>if</em> you have a cheap (&lt;$10/mo) product.</li><li>Full of indiehackers/entrepreneurs/wannapreneurs, most of whom do not want to spend any money.</li><li>Kinda ok targeting but the majority of the audience is non-technical - tread carefully. </li></ul><h3 id="carbon-ads"><span></span>Carbon Ads</h3><ul><li>Expensive. Lots of people rave about them. We don't.</li><li>We got neither awareness nor conversion when we ran campaigns there.</li></ul><h3 id="bing"><span></span>Bing</h3><ul><li>Fun fact – this is the only route to advertise on DuckDuckGo!</li><li>Unfun fact – you can only advertise on the Bing ads network, and they decide where the ads go. You can't say 'serve ads on DuckDuckGo only'.</li><li>Quite cheap. Good only if you want to target users at large enterprises where they are forced to use Bing. </li></ul><p>Not 'paid ads' in the traditional sense, but I wanted to share a few creators who write genuinely good content and we've had success working with. You're looking at $1,000-$10,000 per issue depending on reach.

We think G2 will be useful for reaching larger companies who are running more formal processes to replace their tools by trying several options first. Stack Overflow we have heard is (anecdotally) good for general awareness-building, but not conversion. Both are quite expensive but very focused options to consider for dev tools. I'll update this article with our findings!</p><h2 id="how-to-get-started-with-paid-ads"><span></span>How to get started with paid ads</h2><p>Experiment, experiment, experiment. Start by running 2-3 small experiments at a time across multiple channels. Each experiment will need ~$500 and 2 weeks to run to get meaningful data. </p><p>Which channels to start with depend slightly on the type of product you have. If you're completely unsure, I'd go:</p><ul><li>Google Search – brand keywords (ie. your product's name)</li><li>Google Search – relevant keywords to your product</li><li>Twitter/Quora – cheap awareness campaigns</li></ul><p>Then you can branch out into other channels. For reference, at PostHog we got Google, Twitter, and LinkedIn going in the first couple of months, and then focused on getting good results from them. After that, we added new channels slowly - every 3 months or so - to make sure we were still doing a good job on existing channels. </p><h2 id="moar-reading"><span></span>Moar reading</h2><ul><li>Make sure you're covering <a href="https://posthog.com/blog/dev-marketing-for-startups">all your marketing bases</a>.</li><li>Read about <a href="https://posthog.com/blog/posthog-marketing">how our marketing team uses PostHog</a>.</li><li>Check out <a href="https://posthog.com/handbook/growth/marketing">PostHog’s Marketing Handbook</a> – and copy it if you want to!</li></ul></div></div>]]></description>

Our models extend Llama-2's capabilities into German through continued pretraining on a large corpus of high-quality German and mostly locality-specific text.
Thanks to a compute grant at <a href="https://hessian.ai/">HessianAI</a>'s new supercomputer <strong>42</strong>, we release two foundation models trained with 8k context length,
<a href="https://huggingface.co/LeoLM/leo-hessianai-7b"><code>LeoLM/leo-hessianai-7b</code></a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/LeoLM/leo-hessianai-13b"><code>LeoLM/leo-hessianai-13b</code></a> (70b also coming soon! 👀) under the <a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/license/">Llama-2 community license</a>. In addition, we construct evaluation set for benchmarking capabilities of german language models to standardize model comparison, similar to widely adopted english based evals, as provided for instance by <a href="https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness">lm-harness-eval</a> or <a href="https://github.com/mosaicml/llm-foundry">LLM-Foundry</a>.
With this release, LAION and Hessian.AI are poised to significantly enhance German open-source and commercial LLM research, fostering new opportunities and expediting widespread adoption.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Since the release of the original Llama Foundation Models <sup>1</sup> in January of 2023, the open-source and academic research community
has experienced a rapid acceleration in the development of increasingly capable language models. The advances
of the past weeks have brought the strongest Llama-2 <sup>2</sup>  based models closer to competing with OpenAI's ChatGPT based on GPT-3.5 or even the stronger GPT4 in some cases.
Nevertheless, a noteworthy constraint persists: the majority of these groundbreaking advancements remain confined to the realm of the English language.
This limitation stems mainly from large open-source models having been trained on predominantly mono-lingual English data. While there has been some
research into second-language or multilingual finetuning, most resulting models are limited in their capabilities and suffer from the US-centric bias inherent to English data.</p>
<p>We seek to alleviate these issues in the case study of the German language by applying many of today's state-of-the-art techniques to develop a truly capable,
localized, and bilingual LLM.
To this end, we present LeoLM (<strong>L</strong>inguistically <strong>E</strong>nhanced <strong>O</strong>pen <strong>L</strong>anguage <strong>M</strong>odel), a suite of Llama-2-based German foundation
models, and an assortment of accompanying finetunes.
Further, we present GermanBench, a collection of the most relevant English Benchmarks translated into German, allowing us to evaluate LeoLM's capabilities thoroughly.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971">Touvron et al. 2023a</a>
<sup>2</sup> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288">Touvron et al. 2023b</a></p>
<h2>Stage-2 Pretraining</h2>
<p>Llama-2 models are pretrained on 2 trillion tokens of predominantly English text. To enhance their proficiency in the German language, we employ a Stage 2 pretraining methodology.
We initialize LeoLMs using Llama-2 weights and continue training the model on a large German text corpus of 65 billion tokens of deliberately filtered and deduplicated web text built from the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/oscar-corpus/OSCAR-2301">OSCAR-2301 corpus</a>.
A significant aspect of this approach is mitigating the forgetting or loss of previously learned knowledge or capabilities. We follow the findings by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04014">Gupta et al. (2023)</a> in our choice of hyperparameters to minimize the risk of forgetting.
Additionally, we follow work by <a href="https://huggingface.co/togethercomputer/LLaMA-2-7B-32K">Together</a> in employing <a href="https://kaiokendev.github.io/til#extending-context-to-8k">linear RoPE scaling</a> and <a href="https://tridao.me/publications/flash2/flash2.pdf">Flash Attention 2</a> to improve training efficiency and double context length to 8k tokens.
See Figure 1 for an overview of all training hyperparameters.</p>
<p><img src="https://laion.ai/images/blog/training_params.png" alt="training_parameters" title="Training Hyperparameters"></p>
<h2>Finetuning Datasets</h2>
<p>There is much debate on what a good chat/instruction tuning dataset must offer, sparking the development of a plethora of different, successful approaches. We take inspiration from this diversity and, to bring similar capabilities to German, translate an assortment of high-quality instruction datasets to German using OpenAI's <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code> API. Using <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code> ensures that the context between prompts and responses remains intact and that complex instructions, potentially containing code, equations, or formatted data, are accurately translated.
Building on community findings, we select a variety of datasets to translate and use to train our chat model.
The translated datasets are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/garage-bAInd/Open-Platypus">OpenPlatypus</a> -&gt; <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/LeoLM/OpenSchnabeltier">OpenSchnabeltier</a></li>
<li><a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenAssistant/oasst_top1_2023-08-25">OpenAssistant OASST1</a> -&gt; <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenAssistant/OASST-DE">OpenAssistant-DE</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, we use <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/FreedomIntelligence/evol-instruct-deutsch"><code>FreedomIntelligence/evol-instruct-deutsch</code></a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/FreedomIntelligence/alpaca-gpt4-deutsch"><code>FreedomIntelligence/alpaca-gpt4-deutsch</code></a> from the <a href="https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/MultilingualSIFT">MultilingualSIFT</a> project. Thanks to the authors for sharing their data!
To facilitate bilingual use, we also train models on a combination of these translated datasets and their original, English counterparts.</p>
<p>Finally, to make up for weaknesses in creative writing and rhyming identified during early tests, we curate two more datasets:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/LeoLM/German_Poems">GPT4 Poems</a>: A set of German poems about different topics written by GPT4</li>
<li><a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/LeoLM/German_Songs">GPT4 Songs</a>: A collection of German songs and following analyses written by GPT4.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Evaluation and Results</h2>
<p>Evaluating the capabilities of LLMs, especially chat models, is complex, and the best methods are still up for debate. Benchmarks based on multiple choice that are evaluated via the model's log-probabilities (as in the <a href="">Open LLM Leaderboard</a>) are one currently popular method. Another method automatically evaluates responses using GPT4, as in AlpacaEval or MT-Bench. This approach is more geared toward chat models, as it considers the quality of model responses in real-life tasks. To be as comparable as possible, we directly translate a set of English benchmarks to German. We release these datasets in our <a href="https://huggingface.co/LeoLM">HF Organization</a> and with more detailed documentation <a href="https://github.com/bjoernpl/GermanBenchmark">on GitHub</a>, and you can find the corresponding <code>lm-evaluation-harness</code> fork <a href="https://github.com/bjoernpl/lm-evaluation-harness-de/tree/mmlu_de">here</a> and the <code>FastEval</code> fork <a href="https://github.com/bjoernpl/FastEval">here</a>.</p>
<p>In Figure 3, you can see a comparison of LeoLM versus the base Llama-2 models on a selection of Benchmarks with both the English version (blue) and our translated version (green). Our training improves benchmark scores on the German tasks while slightly reducing scores on English tasks. Notably, the mean increase in German benchmark scores significantly outweighs the mean decrease in performance on English benchmarks, showing that our approach enables learning a new language without forgetting what was previously learned. Why the scores remain lower in German than English is an open question but may be partially attributed to quality degradation during translation.</p>
<p><img src="https://laion.ai/images/blog/benchmarks.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The following table shows the results on our translated version of MT-Bench. MT-Bench is a benchmark that evaluates multi-turn performance on a curated set of 80 questions from multiple categories using GPT-4 as a judge. In this, GPT-4 evaluates the prompts on a scale from 1-10 with regard to perceived helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, depth, creativity, and level of detail of the response. The monolingual <code>leo-hessianai-13b-chat</code> model performs best overall, even coming close to GPT-3.5 in the "humanities" topic. It scores noticeably poorly in math and coding, which is somewhat to be expected given that the Llama-2 models inherently fall short on this without very explicit finetuning. The bilingual models score slightly below their monolingual counterparts in some categories such math and reasoning while exceeding in coding and extraction.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Our research has several key contributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>We release a suite of German Foundation Language Models with a permissive license.</li>
<li>We transfer a thorough and multi-faceted evaluation approach for base and chat models into German.</li>
<li>We demonstrate that large-scale continued pretraining is possible even for data-saturated models such as Llama-2 without significant forgetting or loss of previous capabilities.</li>
<li>We present a diverse suite of instruction/chat-tuning datasets translated from English to German to serve as a basis for Germany's open-source LLM research community.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the LeoLM model suite is a proof-of-concept of language acquisition for pretrained models. Moreover, it presents itself as the first openly available German Foundation Model that meets today's standards. We at LAION hope to kickstart the German open-source research community to reduce dependence on closed-source commercial sources such as OpenAI. Have fun with LeoLM!</p>

Speaking on the company's quarterly earnings call, Galanti said the bars are in hot demand and don't last long when in stock.</p><p>"I've gotten a couple of calls that people have seen online that we've been selling 1 ounce gold bars," he said. "Yes, but when we load them on the site, they're typically gone within a few hours, and we limit two per member."</p></div><div id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-107307293" data-test="InlineImage"><p>Costco is selling 1 ounce gold bars.</p><p>Costco</p></div><div><p>A couple of important points from that thought: The bars indeed are only available online, and only if you're a Costco member, which costs either $120 or $60 a year, depending on which program you pick. The retailer also is limiting the purchases to two to a customer, meaning it would be pretty hard to build a position that would lead to financial security.</p><p>At the very least, though, it's an effective promotion and one that could appeal to a certain sector of Costco's shopping clientele, said Jonathan Rose, co-founder of Genesis Gold Group.</p><p>Rose noted that the company seems to have accelerated its offerings of dried foods and other survivalist goods at a time when worries about the future are running high. For example, the company markets <a href="https://www.costco.com/readywise-150-serving-emergency-food-bucket-150-total-servings.product.100837131.html" target="_blank">a 150-serving emergency food preparedness kit</a> that could come in handy, you know, just in case. Gold meshes with that type of product.</p><p>"They've done their market research. I think it's a very clever way to get their name in the news and have some great publicity," he said. "There is definitely a crossover of people living off the land, being self-sufficient, believing in your own currency. That's the appeal to gold as a safe haven as people lose faith in the U.S. dollar."</p></div><div><div role="button" tabindex="0"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="256" height="256" viewBox="0 0 256 256" aria-labelledby="title desc" role="img" focusable="false" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin"><title>Stock Chart Icon</title><desc>Stock chart icon</desc><g transform="translate(1.4065934065934016 1.4065934065934016) scale(2.81 2.81)"><path d="M 87.994 0 H 69.342 c -1.787 0 -2.682 2.16 -1.418 3.424 l 5.795 5.795 l -33.82 33.82 L 28.056 31.196 l -3.174 -3.174 c -1.074 -1.074 -2.815 -1.074 -3.889 0 L 0.805 48.209 c -1.074 1.074 -1.074 2.815 0 3.889 l 3.174 3.174 c 1.074 1.074 2.815 1.074 3.889 0 l 15.069 -15.069 l 14.994 14.994 c 1.074 1.074 2.815 1.074 3.889 0 l 1.614 -1.614 c 0.083 -0.066 0.17 -0.125 0.247 -0.202 l 37.1 -37.1 l 5.795 5.795 C 87.84 23.34 90 22.445 90 20.658 V 2.006 C 90 0.898 89.102 0 87.994 0 z" transform=" matrix(1 0 0 1 0 0) " stroke-linecap="round"></path><path d="M 65.626 37.8 v 49.45 c 0 1.519 1.231 2.75 2.75 2.75 h 8.782 c 1.519 0 2.75 -1.231 2.75 -2.75 V 23.518 L 65.626 37.8 z" transform=" matrix(1 0 0 1 0 0) " stroke-linecap="round"></path><path d="M 47.115 56.312 V 87.25 c 0 1.519 1.231 2.75 2.75 2.75 h 8.782 c 1.519 0 2.75 -1.231 2.75 -2.75 V 42.03 L 47.115 56.312 z" transform=" matrix(1 0 0 1 0 0) " stroke-linecap="round"></path><path d="M 39.876 60.503 c -1.937 0 -3.757 -0.754 -5.127 -2.124 l -6.146 -6.145 V 87.25 c 0 1.519 1.231 2.75 2.75 2.75 h 8.782 c 1.519 0 2.75 -1.231 2.75 -2.75 V 59.844 C 41.952 60.271 40.933 60.503 39.876 60.503 z" transform=" matrix(1 0 0 1 0 0) " stroke-linecap="round"></path><path d="M 22.937 46.567 L 11.051 58.453 c -0.298 0.298 -0.621 0.562 -0.959 0.8 V 87.25 c 0 1.519 1.231 2.75 2.75 2.75 h 8.782 c 1.519 0 2.75 -1.231 2.75 -2.75 V 48.004 L 22.937 46.567 z" transform=" matrix(1 0 0 1 0 0) " stroke-linecap="round"></path></g></svg><p><img src="https://static-redesign.cnbcfm.com/dist/a54b41835a8b60db28c2.svg" alt="hide content"></p></div><p>Gold futures, last 5 years</p></div><div><p>Precious metals have been on a run over the past several years.

<blockquote><p>“Raids do not presuppose the existence of a breach of the law,” France’s competition authority said in a statement on its website, “which only a full investigation into the merits of the case could establish, if appropriate.”</p>
<p>via Bloomberg</p></blockquote>
<p>WSJ further adds that the French authorities showed concern about NVIDIA's dominance within the tech sector which could exclude smaller businesses and startups. The company is now a subject of inquiry.</p>
<p>There's currently limited information regarding what actually happened and the suspected anti-competitive practices might be nothing more than just a false alarm. NVIDIA has recently gained lots of traction in the GPU segment, and more importantly the AI ecosystem. The green team is rolling in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ceo-jensen-huang-visits-dennys-the-beginning-of-nvidia-trillion-dollar-journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trillions</a> and demand for their GPUs is at an all-time high which has prompted the competition such as<a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-ceo-a-non-believer-in-ai-moat-says-next-10-years-to-be-very-different-from-last-10-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> AMD &amp; Intel</a> to fill up the space that NVIDIA can't fulfill due to its<a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ai-gpu-shortage-could-last-till-2025-due-to-supply-constraints-says-tsmc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> inability to meet the huge AI chip orders</a>.</p>
<p>AI sure has propelled NVIDIA into the big leagues but there are now more eyes watching the green team as it moves forward. This might be the start of several such cases that we might see in the future or just one such instance that blows away in thin air.</p>

<p><strong>JAX is NumPy on the CPU, GPU, and TPU, with great automatic differentiation for high-performance machine learning research.</strong></p>
<p>With its updated version of <a href="https://github.com/hips/autograd">Autograd</a>, JAX
can automatically differentiate native Python and NumPy code. It can
differentiate through a large subset of Python’s features, including loops, ifs,
recursion, and closures, and it can even take derivatives of derivatives of
derivatives. It supports reverse-mode as well as forward-mode differentiation, and the two can be composed arbitrarily
to any order.</p>
<p>What’s new is that JAX uses
<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/xla">XLA</a>
to compile and run your NumPy code on accelerators, like GPUs and TPUs.
Compilation happens under the hood by default, with library calls getting
just-in-time compiled and executed. But JAX even lets you just-in-time compile
your own Python functions into XLA-optimized kernels using a one-function API.
Compilation and automatic differentiation can be composed arbitrarily, so you
can express sophisticated algorithms and get maximal performance without having
to leave Python.</p>

</div>
<p>We added that <code><span>block_until_ready</span></code> because JAX uses asynchronous execution by default (see <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/async_dispatch.html#async-dispatch"><span>Asynchronous dispatch</span></a>).</p>

</div>
<p>That’s slower because it has to transfer data to the GPU every time. You can ensure that an NDArray is backed by device memory using <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.device_put.html#jax.device_put" title="jax.device_put"><code><span>device_put()</span></code></a>.</p>

<p>The output of <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.device_put.html#jax.device_put" title="jax.device_put"><code><span>device_put()</span></code></a> still acts like an NDArray, but it only copies values back to the CPU when they’re needed for printing, plotting, saving to disk, branching, etc. The behavior of <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.device_put.html#jax.device_put" title="jax.device_put"><code><span>device_put()</span></code></a> is equivalent to the function <code><span>jit(lambda</span> <span>x:</span> <span>x)</span></code>, but it’s faster.</p>
<p>If you have a GPU (or TPU!) these calls run on the accelerator and have the potential to be much faster than on CPU.
See <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#faq-jax-vs-numpy"><span>Is JAX faster than NumPy?</span></a> for more comparison of performance characteristics of NumPy and JAX</p>
<p>JAX is much more than just a GPU-backed NumPy. It also comes with a few program transformations that are useful when writing numerical code. For now, there are three main ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.jit.html#jax.jit" title="jax.jit"><code><span>jit()</span></code></a>, for speeding up your code</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.grad.html#jax.grad" title="jax.grad"><code><span>grad()</span></code></a>, for taking derivatives</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.vmap.html#jax.vmap" title="jax.vmap"><code><span>vmap()</span></code></a>, for automatic vectorization or batching.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s go over these, one-by-one. We’ll also end up composing these in interesting ways.</p>
</section>
<section id="using-jit-to-speed-up-functions">
<h2>Using <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.jit.html#jax.jit" title="jax.jit"><code><span>jit()</span></code></a> to speed up functions<a href="#using-jit-to-speed-up-functions" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>JAX runs transparently on the GPU or TPU (falling back to CPU if you don’t have one). However, in the above example, JAX is dispatching kernels to the GPU one operation at a time. If we have a sequence of operations, we can use the <code><span>@jit</span></code> decorator to compile multiple operations together using <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/xla">XLA</a>. Let’s try that.</p>

<p>Taking derivatives is as easy as calling <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.grad.html#jax.grad" title="jax.grad"><code><span>grad()</span></code></a>. <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.grad.html#jax.grad" title="jax.grad"><code><span>grad()</span></code></a> and <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.jit.html#jax.jit" title="jax.jit"><code><span>jit()</span></code></a> compose and can be mixed arbitrarily. In the above example we jitted <code><span>sum_logistic</span></code> and then took its derivative. We can go further:</p>

<p>JAX has one more transformation in its API that you might find useful: <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.vmap.html#jax.vmap" title="jax.vmap"><code><span>vmap()</span></code></a>, the vectorizing map. It has the familiar semantics of mapping a function along array axes, but instead of keeping the loop on the outside, it pushes the loop down into a function’s primitive operations for better performance.

<p>We’re going to work with a simple example, and promote matrix-vector products into matrix-matrix products using <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.vmap.html#jax.vmap" title="jax.vmap"><code><span>vmap()</span></code></a>.

<p>Of course, <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.vmap.html#jax.vmap" title="jax.vmap"><code><span>vmap()</span></code></a> can be arbitrarily composed with <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.jit.html#jax.jit" title="jax.jit"><code><span>jit()</span></code></a>, <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.grad.html#jax.grad" title="jax.grad"><code><span>grad()</span></code></a>, and any other JAX transformation.</p>
<p>This is just a taste of what JAX can do. We’re really excited to see what you do with it!</p>
