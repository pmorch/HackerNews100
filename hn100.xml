I'd say no," he adds.<!-- --></p><p>GumGum, which has worked with the BBC on ad campaigns before, relies on something called contextual advertising, which uses other data points to target adverts to online users, such as keywords on the website they are on - rather than their personal data.<!-- --></p><p>Mr Wallace says allowing fingerprinting represents a shift in the industry.<!-- --></p><p>"Fingerprinting feels like it's taking a much more business-centric approach to the use of consumer data rather than a consumer-centric approach," he says.<!-- --></p><p>"This sort of flip-flopping is, in my opinion, detrimental to that route that the industry seemed to be taking towards this idea of really putting consumer privacy at the forefront."<!-- --></p><p>He adds that he hopes ad tech companies conclude "that it isn't the appropriate way to use consumer data," but expects them to look at fingerprinting as an option in order to better target adverts.<!-- --></p><p>Advertising is the lifeblood of the internet business model, and allow many websites to be freely available to users without them having to directly pay to access them. <!-- --></p><p>But in return, users often have to give up private information about themselves so that advertisers can show them relevant adverts.<!-- --></p><p>The UK's data watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), says "fingerprinting is not a fair means of tracking users online because it is likely to reduce people's choice and control over how their information is collected."<!-- --></p><p>In a <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2024/12/our-response-to-google-s-policy-change-on-fingerprinting/">blog post<!-- --></a> in December, the ICO's Executive Director of Regulatory Risk Stephen Almond wrote: "We think this change is irresponsible."<!-- --></p><p>He added that advertisers and businesses which decide to use this technology will have to demonstrate how they are staying within data and privacy laws in the UK. <!-- --></p><p>"Based on our understanding of how fingerprinting techniques are currently used for advertising this is a high bar to meet," he wrote.<!-- --></p><p>Google said in a statement: "We look forward to further discussions with the ICO about this policy change. <!-- --></p><p>"We know that data signals like IP addresses are already commonly used by others in the industry today, and Google has been using IP responsibly to fight fraud for years."<!-- --></p><p>A spokesperson added: "We continue to give users choice whether to receive personalised ads, and will work across the industry to encourage responsible data use." <!-- --></p></div></div>]]></description>

They’ve been in the news lately because both vehicles used in the </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-01-02/can-rental-app-turo-defends-security-standards-after-new-years-attacks" rel="">New Year’s Day Attacks this year were rented from Turo</a><span>. In a statement responding to the incidents, the company had this to say: </span></p><p>“We do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat,” Turo said in a statement Wednesday. “We are actively partnering with law enforcement authorities as they investigate both incidents.”</p><p>This weekend, we needed to rent a car to pick up our son, Senna, from Boston who’d been staying with my Mother-in-law the last three weeks after the fires. </p><p>As mentioned before, we evacuated the day of the Palisades Fire, stayed in Palm Springs, then San Diego, then Escondido, at which point my Wife, Natashia, flew to Boston with Senna and I went home to pack up the house. </p><p>Our shipment arrived Wednesday, Natashia came to set up the apartment with me, and, FINALLY, I was going to see my son after 3 weeks on Friday.</p><p>Since I have two assault charges on my record from the age of 17 and 19 - when you are supposed to have assault charges if you’re going to have them - Natashia usually has to rent the car. </p><p>Our first choice is always Enterprise Rent-A-Car but all of their branches were closed this weekend. We tried Hertz and they didn’t have vehicles, so, we turned to Turo. The car Natashia rented was an Audi Q8 set to arrive at 11am so that we could avoid rush hour traffic heading into Boston.</p><p>Every thing seemed fine, but about 30 minutes before the car was to be delivered we got a frantic call from the Host saying that a tire on the car popped as he was driving to deliver it and that the car was no longer available, BUT he would deliver another car of equal or greater value at the promised time. He said that he had a huge fleet of cars and would take care of us.</p><p>Being reasonable people, we figured he’d be at least 30 minutes late so we went to get bagels at H&amp;H. </p><p>An hour later around 12pm, we called the Host and he didn’t pick up. At that point, we figured it was a wash and tried to cancel the reservation, but the app would not allow us to cancel the reservation nor would it allow us to rent another car. It needed the Host to cancel so we were held hostage. </p><p>She called Turo Support which advised her to give the Host another 15 minutes to either deliver the car or cancel. We gave the Host 30 minutes and then called Turo Support again, which told us to give him even more time. That’s when she put them on speaker so that I could recount every thing in detail and ask for a supervisor in what could only be described as agitated business casual. </p><p>Turo revealed that they could not cancel the trip. The Host would either have to cancel the trip OR we could wait til the trip ended and they would offer a refund. Neither option made sense and we HAD to get my son from Boston, so, I tried my luck signing up for Turo since the current sitting President is also a criminal.</p><p>My assault charges as a teen were in Florida so I submitted my newly minted California license and wah-lah. I was accepted. So much for Turo’s security measures… </p><p>We ordered a Volvo XC60 for 1pm. Of course, it did not arrive at 1pm. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

She may have sold you a ticket, she may even be backstage, but very rarely does she actually perform. If your manager doesn’t call you on a Saturday Afternoon in Rhode Island, call Phil Sun.</p><p>I was about 7 minutes into my call with Phil when I heard sirens. </p><p>I looked in my rear view, turned my left turn signal on, moved to the left lane and the State-y followed me. That’s when you know it’s you. So, I quickly moved to the far right shoulder, hung up, and let Phil know that I sincerely appreciated his call, but that I was being pulled over. </p><p>The State-y rolled up to the passenger side window and asked for my license and registration. For a moment, I thought maybe I had been speeding and didn’t notice since I was so excited my manager called, but when I reached into the passenger compartment for the registration and pulled out a receipt from a car wash, he said, “You don’t have registration because it’s suspended.” </p><p>I informed him that I had rented the car from Turo, showed him my reservation, and he noticed our child in the back seat. We told him the whole story and he went back to his vehicle. About 15 minutes later, he came back and told us that he should tow the car, but he didn’t want to do it to us with the kid in the car. </p><p>It was probably the best interaction I’ve ever had with an officer and I really appreciated this guy. Rhode Island. What a State!!!</p><p>He told us to inform Turo immediately because this car should be towed and we would’ve have been assed out in Rhode Island with our son in the snow. </p><p>I was really fucking upset, but also just thankful that I’d be able to drive back to the city and get Senna to his new home after the worst month of our lives. Every thing has been insane since January 7th.</p><p>All of it really started to hit me and I called Turo. </p><p>I told them every thing that happened and they asked if I had taken a “PHOTO” of the State Trooper. They asked for “documentation” of the traffic stop, at which point I had to inform them that it was an insane ask. What was I supposed to do get a selfie with the State-y? If you’ve ever been stopped, you don’t get documentation. The police have it on their side, but as the civilian you’re just happy to not go to jail and proceed to the next destination. </p><p>I asked them to run the registration they had on file for the vehicle and they instead asked me for it so I made another appeal to logic and reminded them that the registration was suspended. They asked me if it was in the passenger compartment and I reminded them that the only documentation was a receipt from a car wash. </p><p>Ultimately, I took a photo of the registration sticker on the front of the vehicle so that they could run it. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76e0ad19-185b-49a2-ad19-1a785ce437db_4032x3024.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76e0ad19-185b-49a2-ad19-1a785ce437db_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76e0ad19-185b-49a2-ad19-1a785ce437db_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76e0ad19-185b-49a2-ad19-1a785ce437db_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76e0ad19-185b-49a2-ad19-1a785ce437db_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76e0ad19-185b-49a2-ad19-1a785ce437db_4032x3024.jpeg" width="1456" height="1941" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/76e0ad19-185b-49a2-ad19-1a785ce437db_4032x3024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1941,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2083736,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76e0ad19-185b-49a2-ad19-1a785ce437db_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76e0ad19-185b-49a2-ad19-1a785ce437db_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76e0ad19-185b-49a2-ad19-1a785ce437db_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76e0ad19-185b-49a2-ad19-1a785ce437db_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The Turo representative took about 25 minutes to run the registration and returned saying that according to his research, the registration was valid until 8/31/25. I almost blew a gasket because anyone with one eye and the ability to count to 25 could have told you that the registration was valid until 8/31/25 as it says on its face. The ISSUE is not that the registration expired; the issue is that it was SUSPENDED. </p><p>When I clarified this for the Turo Rep, they acknowledged the folly and said, “Sorry the language confuse me.” I took it easy and felt for the guy because he was probably in a call center in the Philippines reading out of a manual.</p><p>He took another 25 minutes and was able to confirm that the registration was in fact suspended. He offered a full refund if I returned the car to the Host, but I didn’t want to be in that position. </p><p>Turo was going to notify the Host that their registration is suspended and therefore illegal to rent out, but then send me in to physically return it to them? In my head, I looked into the future and saw the potential for another assault charge. If someone is willing and stupid enough to rent out a car with a suspended license, how would they respond if they knew I reported their vehicle? </p><p>I didn’t want to put myself in that position. </p><p>I asked if a Turo representative could take possession of the vehicle since it was a legal matter. I asked if there was a Turo Office or lot like Enterprise has and he said that there were no Turo representatives that could help me. I would simply have to return the car to the Host, if I wanted the refund. </p><p>I asked what would happen if I didn’t want the refund, left the car at a specified location, and had Turo get in touch with the Host? The representative responded that they would then charge me for an improper return…</p><p>An “improper return” OF A VEHICLE YOU RENTED ME WITH SUSPENDED REGISTRATION AND HAD MY FAMILY PULLED OVER BY RHODE ISLAND STATE TROOPERS FOR.</p><p>The Representative had no other response. Either I returned the car and got a full refund, or, I would be charged for an improper return. </p><p>I brought my family home, emptied the car of Senna’s things from LA, got our dog Mr. Chow, and went to return the car.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f17e486-ba37-4f05-9a48-2f73ddbc857f_5712x4284.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f17e486-ba37-4f05-9a48-2f73ddbc857f_5712x4284.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f17e486-ba37-4f05-9a48-2f73ddbc857f_5712x4284.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f17e486-ba37-4f05-9a48-2f73ddbc857f_5712x4284.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f17e486-ba37-4f05-9a48-2f73ddbc857f_5712x4284.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f17e486-ba37-4f05-9a48-2f73ddbc857f_5712x4284.jpeg" width="1456" height="1941" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7f17e486-ba37-4f05-9a48-2f73ddbc857f_5712x4284.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1941,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:5741520,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f17e486-ba37-4f05-9a48-2f73ddbc857f_5712x4284.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f17e486-ba37-4f05-9a48-2f73ddbc857f_5712x4284.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f17e486-ba37-4f05-9a48-2f73ddbc857f_5712x4284.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f17e486-ba37-4f05-9a48-2f73ddbc857f_5712x4284.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>If anyone was going to catch a case today, it would be Mr. Chow. </p><p>JK.</p><p>The Host was of course 45 minutes late picking up the car and we waited in the snow.

To me, the issue is that our lives have been upended by the sharing economy. </p><p>All these tech companies promised disruption and it’s here. </p><p>Nothing works anymore because the sharing economy turned all the cooks into chefs. The “HOST” is anyone with a vehicle, but that doesn’t mean every HOST is taking on the responsibility of a business owner. They like the idea of being a business owner, they like making money like a business owner, but not every one is capable and responsible enough to run a business. </p><p>Big Tech has sold people on the dream of becoming their own business knowing that most people are incapable. That’s why we’re left to fend for ourselves when there are disputes. My gripe is simply renting a car with a suspended license and then being falsely accused of smoking in the vehicle and going over the mileage limit. I also almost got towed and left on the side of the road in a snow storm with my 16 month old son.</p><p><span>But for others, it’s significantly worse. In 2022, there was a </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62158976" rel="">law suit representing FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY WOMEN</a><span> who were sexually assaulted by Uber Drivers and another 150 cases being investigated.</span></p><p><span>From the BBC, “The lawsuit alleged that as early as 2014 Uber became aware that its drivers were sexually assaulting and raping female passengers. But the filing claims that the company prioritised "growth over customer safety".</span><strong>”</strong></p><p>The sharing economy empowers individuals without the proper credentials and values to operate like businesses. Anyone procuring the services of Uber, Air Bnb, or Turo have the expectation that the service will be professional. But no one is holding these individual “businesses” accountable.</p><p>If you drive an Uber, rent an Air Bnb, or loan a car on Turo, you are a business. You have responsibilities and there are rules, but no one is actually there to ensure performance. Just because there are rules listed on an app or website doesn’t mean they will be enforced. </p><p>Try asking a Turo Representative about the 14th Amendment and the equal protection it should offer in these scenarios. </p><p>Every thing is failing because there is tremendous pressure to grow, bring on more drivers, homes, sneaker resellers, without the proper time and care to grow the infrastructure with it. The Representatives at call centers can barely comprehend the facts of the case much less adjudicate it or deal with the unique situations that arise when humans do business amongst each other. </p><p>In theory, the sharing economy works if every one is a Good Samaritan, follows the rules, and tells the truth, but what in human nature makes you think that would ever happen? This entire ordeal was bound to fail because you cannot trust individuals to do the right thing especially not in business.</p><p>THAT’S WHY YOU NEED GOVERNMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE. </p><p>As much as people hate the government or hate agencies like the Better Business Bureau or Tort Law, you need it because people are going to let you down. These tech companies used lobbies to destroy the enterprise structure of our civilization from taxi cab medallions to hotels to brick-and-mortar businesses. They gutted every industry of jobs held by individuals, they robbed us of our protections, and left us to fend for ourselves. </p><p>When people and corporations told us that they would disrupt industry, did any of us ask what would happen after that disruption? Would anyone actually take possession and be held responsible? </p><p>No, because every one was making or saving money. That’s how they reeled us in: speed, efficiency, and lower costs. On its face, technology delivered those things, but what it disrupted were the values and ethics of business. </p><p>Enterprise Rent-A-Car is a fabulous business that has never let me down. I informed them of my past, they acquired the proper documentation, and rented me cars. I never got pulled over for driving their car without registration. They never reserved me a car with a popped tire. I once even returned a car to an Enterprise and listened as police asked the employees to track down a car they were looking for a weapon in and they found it! </p><p>WITHIN 15 MINUTES!</p><p>Imagine trying to do that with Turo…</p><p>When people lose faith in the economy and can’t trust the people they purchase services from, the entire financial system crumbles. All of this disruption by technology has left the economy and our society in shambles because not every cook has the values and work ethic to be a chef. </p><p>The saddest part is that the last thing left to disrupt is the government and it’s happening. </p><p>Elon Musk and DOGE are now doing the same thing to the 3 main branches of government that was done to travel, banking, transportation, vintage reselling, and every other business you know. </p><p>Not that the DMV or USPS was ever efficient, but the DMV never took fake photos of ash in the back of a car and tried to charge me for it. While rules, government agencies, and bureaucracy slow things down and can seem like helicopter parents, they are necessary in a world run by humans.

					Every<br>
					<span>site on</span><br>
					HTTPS
				</p>
				<h2 id="every-site-https">
					<b>By default, </b>Caddy <b>automatically obtains</b> and <b>renews</b> TLS certificates for <b>all your sites.</b>
				</h2>

				<div>
					<div>
						<h3>HTTPS/TLS for custom domains</h3>
						<p>
							The secret sauce of almost every white-label SaaS is Caddy's original On-Demand TLS feature. Grow your SaaS business by orders of magnitude with ease!
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>Dynamically provision certificates</h3>
						<p>
							With On-Demand TLS, only Caddy obtains, renews, and maintains certificates on-the-fly during TLS handshakes. Perfect for customer-owned domains.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>Massively scale your TLS</h3>
						<p>
							Other web servers and scripted certificate tools fall over with hundreds of thousands of sites or thousands of instances. Caddy is designed to manage certificates reliably at this scale.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

						<h2 id="most-advanced">The <b>most advanced</b> HTTPS server <b>in the world</b></h2>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					
					<div>
						<div>
							<h3>All you need for TLS and PKI 🔐</h3>
							<p>
								Caddy securely serves all sites with TLS by default. It can also manage your internal PKI for you across a fleet of servers and clients.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>On-line config API ⚡️</h3>
							<p>
								Caddy's native configuration is a JSON document that you can export and manipulate with a RESTful config API.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>PCI, HIPAA, and NIST compliant ✅</h3>
							<p>
								Caddy's TLS defaults are secure and pass PCI, HIPAA, and NIST compliance requirements. Yes, defaults: no hassle required.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>HTTPS for localhost 🏠</h3>
							<p>
								We mean it when we say Caddy serves every site on HTTPS. Even localhost and internal IPs are served with TLS using the intermediate of a fully-automated, self-managed CA that is automatically installed into most local trust stores.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>Cluster coordination 🌐</h3>
							<p>
								Simply configure multiple Caddy instances with the same storage, and they will automatically coordinate certificate management as a fleet and share resources such as keys and OCSP staples!
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>Fewer moving parts ⚙️</h3>
							<p>
								Simplify your infrastructure! Caddy saves money, increases developer productivity, and reduces problems in production. 
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h2 id="on-demand-demo" lang="de">Experience it</h2>
						<p>
							<b>Discover Caddy's automagic HTTPS features with our hosted demo.</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							Point DNS records for any subdomain named <b><code>caddydemo</code></b> to either:
						</p>
						<p>
							<code>
								<span>CNAME</span>
								<span>demo.caddyserver.com</span>
							</code>
						</p>
						<p>
							or:
						</p>
						<p>
							<code>
								<span>A</span>
								<span>138.68.4.62</span>
							</code>
							<code>
								<span>AAAA</span>
								<span>2604:a880:2:d0::9dd:9001</span>
							</code>
						</p>
						<p>
							Then <b>visit it</b> in your browser.
						</p>
						<p>
							You'll notice how Caddy <b>provisions a certificate</b> for your domain <b>automatically.</b>
						</p>
						<div>
							<p>
								<b>Not working?</b> Make sure to use a direct subdomain of a registered domain, not a "sub-subdomain."
								Verify you have created the public DNS records shown above with the correct values.
								You may have to allow time for propagation. Consult your DNS provider's documentation or support for assistance.
								Your browser/client must set the TLS ServerName indication (most do).
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Example subdomains that could work:</b> <code>caddydemo.example.net</code>, <code>caddydemo.example.com.au</code>
							</p>
							<p>
								Caddy is capable of serving TLS for any domains and IPs. This demo is intentionally restricted.

					<h2 id="your-own-pki">Deploy your own PKI with Caddy</h2>
					<p>
						Not only is Caddy the industry leader in certificate automation, it also sports a fully-featured PKI suite for your own fully-automated internal PKI and private CAs.
					</p>
					<!-- <p>
						Caddy will serve your localhost and internal sites over HTTPS using its own CA. And you can create your own CA to issue certs across your infrastructure. It has a built-in ACME server, powered by Smallstep, to automate your private PKI reliably at scale.
					</p> -->
					<p>
						Powered by open source <a href="https://smallstep.com/certificates/">Smallstep libraries</a>, Caddy becomes a self-managing certificate authority.
					</p>
					

					<div>
						<div>
<pre><code><span><span><span>localhost</span> <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>	<span>respond</span> <span>"Hello from HTTPS!"</span>

</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>192.168.1.10</span> <span>{</span>

</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div>
						<div>
							<h3>Internal and localhost certificates</h3>
							<p>
								If you configure sites with local or internal addresses, Caddy will serve them over HTTPS using a locally-trusted certificate authority with short-lived, auto-renewing certificates. It even offers to install your unique root into your local trust stores for you.
							</p>
							<p><a href="https://smallstep.com/" title="Powered by Smallstep"><img src="https://caddyserver.com/resources/images/sponsors/smallstep.svg" alt="Smallstep"></a>
						</p></div>
					</div>

					<div>
						<div>
							<h3>Make and use your own CAs</h3>
							<p>
								Caddy lets you define as many CAs as you need. Root and intermediate keys are generated automatically, and intermediates are renewed before they expire.
							</p>
							<p>
								Deploy an instance to act as an ACME server. Then other Caddy instances can use it for their certificates.

							<h3>Keep certificates renewed</h3>
							<p>
								Caddy is more than just a web server. For example, this config is all it takes to obtain and renew certificates for a set of domain names.
							</p>
							<p>
								Additional config can be written to wire up certificate maintenance events, which can then be used to integrate with external scripts and tooling.
							</p>
							<!-- <p>
								Caddy 2 is a <a href="/docs/extending-caddy">highly extensible</a>, self-hosted platform on which you can build, configure, and deploy long-running services ("apps").
							</p>
							<p>
								Caddy ships with apps for an <a href="/docs/modules/http">HTTPS server</a> (static files, reverse proxying, load balancing, etc.), <a href="/docs/modules/tls">TLS certificate manager</a>, and <a href="/docs/modules/pki">fully-managed internal PKI</a>. Caddy apps collaborate to make complex infrastructure just work with fewer moving parts.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>For example, the config shown here keeps your TLS certificates renewed for other programs to use;</b> no external tools or HTTP daemon required!
							</p>
							<p>
								Providing a unified configuration, on-line <a href="/docs/api">config API</a>, and <a href="/docs/json/">automatic documentation</a> for all apps, Caddy is nearly infinitely extensible. Thanks to its unique <a href="/docs/architecture">modular architecture</a>, we can offer unlimited features without bloating the code base.

						Configure your server your way. Caddy's native configuration format is JSON, and with Caddy's config adapters, you can use any config format you prefer. All configuration is posted through a RESTful admin API, and Caddy's CLI helps you work with config files easily.

							</p><p>
								Make dynamic config changes through an <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/api">intuitive, programmable REST API</a> that offers ACID guarantees. It is also <b>safely scoped</b>, meaning that the URI path restricts changes, making it impossible to accidentally alter other parts of your config.
							</p>
							<!-- <ul>
								<li><b>Atomic:</b> Multiple changes in a single request are treated as a single unit; any failed change aborts all the other changes.</li>
								<li><b>Consistent:</b> No invalid configurations can be loaded; your server will never break if a problem is detected at config load.</li>
								<li><b>Isolated:</b> No config changes rely on another. (It helps that HTTP is a stateless protocol!)</li>
								<li><b>Durable:</b> Caddy automatically persists the current, valid configuration to disk and can safely resume it after a power cycle if the <code>--resume</code> flag is used.</li>

			<div>
					<h2 id="extensibility">Unparalleled extensibility</h2>
					<p>
						Caddy is the only server in the world with its novel, modular architecture. At its core, Caddy is a configuration manager that runs apps like an HTTP server, internal certificate authority, TLS certificate manager, process supervisor, and more.
					</p>
					<p>
						And because of its unique design, we can offer unlimited features without bloating the code base. Only compile in what you need.
					</p>
					<div>
						<div>
							<h3><a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/xUA7ba9aksCuKR9dgA/giphy.webp" target="_blank" title="Important visualization">Unlimited power</a></h3>
							<p>
								Nearly every part of the config that "does something" is pluggable. Caddy offers unlimited capabilities in such a lean package.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>Native CPU performance</h3>
							<p>
								No RPC calls or flimsy dependency management. Plugins are compiled into the static binary, making successful deployments certain and runtimes blazing fast.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>Easy to develop</h3>
							<p>
								Writing Caddy plugins is as easy as writing a Go package. It's a comfortable and familiar process for any Go programmer.
							</p>
						</div>

			<div>
					<div>
						<div>
								<h2 id="extensibility">4x faster PHP apps</h2>
								<p>
									With <a href="https://frankenphp.dev/">FrankenPHP</a>, Caddy acts as a PHP application server that delivers PHP pages about <a href="https://blog.laravel.com/octane-frankenphp">4x faster</a> than Swoole or RoadRunner: no need for php-fpm (FastCGI).
								</p>
								<p>
									Deploy your PHP application as a single static binary without needing to install PHP and php-fpm separately. Caddy with FrankenPHP is all you need for high-performing PHP apps!
								</p>
								<p><a href="https://frankenphp.dev/" title="FrankenPHP"><img src="https://caddyserver.com/resources/images/frankenphp-logo.svg" alt="FrankenPHP - Modern PHP app server"></a></p><p>
									Benchmarks compare total response times using worker mode with Octane. FrankenPHP runs in-process with the server, so it's generally faster than FPM/mod_php in most cases. PHP execution is not accelerated.
								</p>
							</div>
						<p><img src="https://caddyserver.com/resources/images/frankenphp-dab.svg">

								Serving your PHP app is as simple as this Caddyfile. The PHP interpreter is completely embedded within the Caddy binary and your application files will be served from the current working directory. No need for php-fpm or separate PHP installs!

					</div>
				</div>


			<div>
					<h2 id="gold-standard">The <span>gold standard</span> web server</h2>
					<p>
						Caddy has the most robust TLS stack on the market. With stronger memory safety guarantees than OpenSSL (Apache &amp; NGINX) and more advanced certificate automation logic than any other server or utility, Caddy keeps your sites online through problems when other servers... won't.
					</p>
					<p>
						Caddy was the first server to fully automate public certificate management—so we've been doing this longer than anyone. With more than 50 million certificates under management, Caddy has set the gold standard for other servers to live up to.
					</p>
					<div>
						<div>
							<h3>OCSP stapling saves the day</h3>
							<p>
								Caddy automatically staples OCSP responses and caches them to weather outages. In 2018, many popular sites went down for users of mainstream browsers because crucial OCSP infrastructure had an extended outage. Only Caddy staples and caches OCSP responses by default, so all Caddy sites were unaffected.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>On guard against revocation</h3>
							<p>
								In 2020, a mass certificate revocation event left many sysadmins scrambling to renew their certificates ahead of schedule. Caddy automatically renews certificates that get revoked, and all Caddy sites were unaffected. (This was before ARI existed.)
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>Stands tall during audits</h3>
							<p>
								Companies have deployed Caddy in front of their site just hours before important audits—potentially saving their compliance status—because of Caddy's safe defaults and "batteries included" approach.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

			<div>
					<h2>Take everyone's word for it</h2>
					<p>
						We're biased. But Caddy is widely relied upon and praised by a diverse global user base because of its ease of use, secure defaults, powerful feature set, and business-changing cost reductions.
					</p>

      #<a href="https://techlog.jenslink.net/tags/ipv6/">IPv6</a>&nbsp;
      
    </span>
  
  


  

  <div>
        <p>Yesterday I read this <a href="https://chaos.social/@goetz/114001310396231712">toot (German)</a> over on mastodon
which starts with “IPv6 is hard.”</p>
<p><strong>No it’s not. It’s different.</strong></p>
<p>I ran across this multiple times: There is an A and an AAAA-record for a FQDN, but the
web server is only reachable via IPv4. You can easily test this with <a href="https://curl.se/">curl</a></p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell">$ curl -4  https://github.com -o /dev/null
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
<span>100</span>  273k    <span>0</span>  273k    <span>0</span>     <span>0</span>  3417k      <span>0</span> --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 3553k
$ curl -6  https://github.com -o /dev/null
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
  <span>0</span>     <span>0</span>    <span>0</span>     <span>0</span>    <span>0</span>     <span>0</span>      <span>0</span>      <span>0</span> --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--     <span>0</span>
curl: <span>(</span>7<span>)</span> Couldn<span>'</span>t connect to server
</code></pre></div><p>When using IPv4 273k are “saved” to /dev/null, using IPv6 we get an error message “Couldn’t connect to server”</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that I’m using GitHub here because it is a well known example for not
offering IPv6 as a time of writing, and it probably will have not IPv6 soon.</p>
<p>So in the case of the toot mentioned above there is an AAAA for the FQDN. But the connection doesn’t work. But the end user
doesn’t notice. Because there is a browser feature called <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8305">Happy Eyeballs (HE)</a>.
Basically: A browser tries both protocols and uses the
faster on. In case of non-working IPv6 IPv4 is always faster.</p>
<p>HE can have some funny side effects. In a project a connection to a development web server sometimes worked and sometimes
didn’t. The solution was quite simple. The customer used a split VPN tunnel. IPv4 was routed via the VPN tunnel and those
IPv4 addresses were allowed in the web servers access list. IPv6 was routed via the normal Internet connection and those
addresses weren’t allowed.</p>
<p>But back to the original problem: In another toot we learn that a support ticket
was opened four weeks ago and that traceroute
was prohibited. But there is always the option to use the <em>-T</em> option for traceroute or <em>tcptraceroute</em>. This use tcp instead
of UDP (standard traceroute) or ICMP (Windows tracert).</p>
<p>When you run traceroute -T for both IPv4 and IPv6 you’ll see that in this case IPv6 ends one hop earlier than IPv4. Or
in this case the last hop loops back to itself.</p>
<p>This could mean that there is a missing firewall rule allowing traffic to the server or there is a routing issue on the
firewall.</p>
<p>But we can learn much more from this:</p>
<ul>
<li>If browser wouldn’t do happy eyeballs, the support hotline would have been exploded</li>
<li>There is no external monitoring, at least not for IPv6</li>
<li>There is no automation or at least no complete automation</li>
</ul>
<p>So please: If you do IPv6 take it seriously. If you don’t take it seriously,
don’t do IPv6. That leaves to people thinking that
IPv6 is hard and can not be done.</p>
<p>Some notes: I’ll cover traceroute and co. in a future blog post and regarding
GitHub check out this
<a href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/151477">link</a>.</p>

<p>Why is Rust now being used to replace parts of the JavaScript web ecosystem like minification (Terser), transpilation (Babel), formatting (Prettier), bundling (webpack), linting (ESLint), and more?</p>
<h2>What is Rust?</h2>
<p>Rust helps developers write fast software that's memory-efficient. It's a modern replacement for languages like C++ or C with a focus on code safety and concise syntax.</p>
<p>Rust is quite different than JavaScript. JavaScript tries to find variables or objects not in use and automatically clears them from memory. This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Garbage Collection</a>. The language abstracts the developer from thinking about manual memory management.</p>
<p>With Rust, developers have more control over memory allocation, without it being as painful as C++.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rust uses a relatively unique memory management approach that incorporates the idea of memory “ownership”. Basically, Rust keeps track of who can read and write to memory. It knows when the program is using memory and immediately frees the memory once it is no longer needed. It enforces memory rules at compile time, making it virtually impossible to have runtime memory bugs. You do not need to manually keep track of memory. The compiler takes care of it. – <a href="https://blog.discord.com/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust-a190bbca2b1f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Adoption</h2>
<p>On top of the companies mentioned above, Rust is also being used for popular open-source libraries like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firecracker</a> (AWS)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bottlerocket</a> (AWS)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quiche</a> (Cloudflare)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/neqo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neqo</a> (Mozilla)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Rust has been a force multiplier for our team, and betting on Rust was one of the best decisions we made. More than performance, its ergonomics and focus on correctness has helped us tame sync's complexity. We can encode complex invariants about our system in the type system and have the compiler check them for us. – <a href="https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/rewriting-the-heart-of-our-sync-engine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dropbox</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>From JavaScript to Rust</h2>
<p>JavaScript is the most widely used programming language, operating on every device with a web browser. Over the past ten years, a massive ecosystem has been built around JavaScript:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Webpack:</strong> bundle multiple JavaScript files into one.</li>
<li><strong>Babel:</strong> write modern JavaScript while supporting older browsers.</li>
<li><strong>Terser:</strong> generate the smallest possible file sizes.</li>
<li><strong>Prettier:</strong> format code in an opinionated way.</li>
<li><strong>ESLint:</strong> find issues with their code before deploying.</li>
</ul>
<p>Millions of lines of code have been written and even more bugs have been fixed to create the bedrock for shipping web applications of today. All of these tools are written with JavaScript or TypeScript. This has worked well, but we've reached peak optimization with JS. This has inspired a new class of tools, designed to drastically improve the performance of building for the web.</p>
<h3>SWC</h3>
<p><a href="http://swc.rs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SWC</a>, created in 2017, is an extensible Rust-based platform for the next generation of fast developer tools. It's used by tools like Next.js, Parcel, and Deno, as well as companies like Vercel, ByteDance, Tencent, Shopify, and more.</p>
<p>SWC can be used for compilation, minification, bundling, and more – and is designed to be extended. It's something you can call to perform code transformations (either built-in or custom). Running those transformations happens through higher-level tools like Next.js.</p>
<h3>Deno</h3>
<p><a href="https://deno.land/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deno</a>, created in 2018, is a simple, modern, and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses <a href="https://v8.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">V8</a> and is built with Rust. It's an attempt to replace Node.js, written by the original creators of Node.js. While it was created in 2018, it didn't hit <a href="https://deno.com/blog/v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">v1.0 until May 2020</a>.</p>
<p>Deno's linter, code formatter, and docs generator are <a href="https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1369033422002389000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built using SWC</a>.</p>
<h3>esbuild</h3>
<p><a href="https://esbuild.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">esbuild</a>, created in January 2020, is a JavaScript bundler and minifier 10-100x faster than existing tools, written in Go.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm trying to create a build tool that A) works well for a given sweet spot of use cases (bundling JavaScript, TypeScript, and maybe CSS) and B) <strong>resets the expectations of the community for what it means for a JavaScript build tool to be fast</strong>. Our current tools are way too slow in my opinion. – Evan, Creator of esbuild (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22336334" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Building JavaScript tooling with systems programming languages, like Go and Rust, was fairly niche until esbuild was released. In my opinion, esbuild sparked a wider interest in trying to make developer tools faster. Evan chose to use Go:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Rust version probably could be made to work at an equivalent speed with enough effort. But at a high level, Go was much more enjoyable to work with. This is a side project and it has to be fun for me to work on it. – Evan, Creator of esbuild (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22336284" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some argue Rust could perform better, but both could achieve Evan's original goal of influencing the community:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even with just basic optimization, Rust was able to outperform the hyper hand-tuned Go version. This is a huge testament to how easy it is to write efficient programs with Rust compared to the deep dive we had to do with Go. – <a href="https://blog.discord.com/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust-a190bbca2b1f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Rome</h3>
<p><a href="https://rome.tools/blog/2020/08/08/introducing-rome" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rome</a>, created in August 2020,&nbsp;is a linter, compiler, bundler, test runner, and more, for JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, JSON, Markdown, and CSS. They aim to replace and unify the entire frontend development toolchain. It's created by <a href="https://twitter.com/sebmck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sebastian</a>, who also created Babel.</p>
<p>Why rewrite everything, then?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Making the necessary modifications to Babel to allow for it to be a reliable base for other tools would have required changes to absolutely everything. The architecture is bound to the initial design choices I made in 2014 when I was learning about parsers, ASTs, and compilers. - Sebastian (<a href="https://rome.tools/blog/2020/08/08/introducing-rome" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rome is currently written in TypeScript and runs on Node.js. But they're now working on <a href="https://rome.tools/blog/2021/09/21/rome-will-be-rewritten-in-rust" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rewriting in Rust</a> using RSLint parser and their own visitor system for AST traversal.</p>
<h3>NAPI</h3>
<p>Rust's integration with Node.js is better than other low-level languages.</p>
<p><a href="https://napi.rs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">napi-rs</a> allows you to build pre-compiled Node.js add-ons with Rust. It provides an out-of-the-box solution for cross-compilation and publishing native binaries to NPM, without needing <code><span><span>node</span><span>-</span><span>gyp</span></span></code> or <code><span><span>postinstall</span></span></code> scripts.</p>
<p>You can build a Rust module that can be called directly from Node.js, without needing to create a child process like esbuild.</p>
<h2>Rust + WebAssembly</h2>
<p><a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/use-cases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAssembly</a>&nbsp;(WASM) is a portable low-level language that Rust can compile to. It runs in the browser, is interoperable with JavaScript, and is supported in all major modern browsers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WASM is definitely a lot faster than JS, but not quite native speed. In our tests, Parcel runs 10-20x slower when compiled to WASM than with native binaries. – <a href="https://twitter.com/devongovett" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Devon Govett</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While WASM isn't the perfect solution yet, it <em>can</em> help developers create extremely fast web experiences. The Rust team is <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/what/wasm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">committed</a> to a high-quality and cutting-edge WASM implementation. For developers, this means you could have the performance advantages of Rust (vs. Go) while still compiling for the web (using WASM).</p>
<p>Some early libraries and frameworks in this space:</p>

<p>These Rust-based web frameworks that compile to WASM aren't trying to replace JavaScript, but work alongside it. While we aren't there yet, it's interesting to see Rust coming after the web on both sides: <strong>making existing JavaScript tooling faster</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>future-forward ideas for <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/introduction.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">compiling to WASM</a></strong>.</p>
<p>It's Rust all the way down.</p>
<h2>Why Not Rust?</h2>
<p>Rust has a steep learning curve. It's a lower level of abstraction than what most web developers are used to.</p>
<p>Once you're on native code (through Rust, Go, Zig, or other low-level languages),
the algorithms and data structures are <a href="https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1457945506332692482" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more important</a> than the language choice. It's not a silver bullet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rust makes you think about dimensions of your code that matter tremendously for systems programming. It makes you think about how memory is shared or copied. It makes you think about real but unlikely corner cases and make sure that they're handled. It helps you write code that's incredibly efficient in every possible way. – Tom MacWright (<a href="https://macwright.com/2021/01/15/rust.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further, Rust's usage in the web community is still niche. It hasn't reached critical adoption. Even though learning Rust for JavaScript tooling will be a barrier to entry, interestingly developers would rather have a <a href="https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1261379312898306048" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">faster tool that's harder to contribute to</a>. <a href="https://craigmod.com/essays/fast_software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast software wins</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, it's hard to find a Rust library or framework for your favorite services (things like working with authentication, databases, payments, and more). I do think that once Rust and WASM reach critical adoption, this will resolve itself. But not yet. <strong>We need existing JavaScript tools to help us bridge the gap and incrementally adopt performance improvements</strong>.</p>
<h2>The Future of JavaScript Tooling</h2>
<p>I believe Rust is the future of JavaScript tooling. <a href="http://nextjs.org/12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next.js 12</a> started our transition to fully replace Babel (transpilation) and Terser (minification) with SWC and Rust. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Extensibility:</strong> SWC can be used as a Crate inside Next.js, without having to fork the library or workaround design constraints.</li>
<li><strong>Performance:</strong> We were able to achieve ~3x faster Fast Refresh and ~5x faster builds in Next.js by switching to SWC, with more room for optimization still in progress.</li>
<li><strong>WebAssembly:</strong> Rust's support for WASM is essential for supporting all possible platforms and taking Next.js development everywhere.</li>
<li><strong>Community:</strong> The Rust community and ecosystem are amazing and only growing.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's not just Next.js adopting SWC, either:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://deno.land/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deno's</a> linter, code formatter, and docs generator are <a href="https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1369033422002389000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built using SWC</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/devongovett/dprint-node" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dprint</a>, built on SWC, is a <a href="https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1400138335721455617" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">30x faster</a> code formatting replacement for Prettier.</li>
<li><a href="https://parceljs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parcel</a> improved overall build performance by <a href="https://v2.parceljs.org/blog/beta3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">up to 10x</a> with SWC.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Parcel uses SWC like a library. Before we used Babel's parser and custom transforms written in JS. Now, we use SWC's parser and <a href="https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/tree/v2/packages/transformers/js/core/src" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom transforms in Rust</a>. This includes a full scope hoisting implementation, dependency collection, and more. It's similar in scope to how Deno built on top of SWC. – <a href="https://twitter.com/devongovett" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Devon Govett</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's early days for Rust – a few important pieces are still being figured out:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plugins:</strong> Writing plugins in Rust isn't as approachable for many JavaScript developers. At the same time, exposing a plugin system in JavaScript could negate performance gains. A definitive solution hasn't emerged yet. Ideally, the future combines both JavaScript and Rust. If you want to write a plugin with JavaScript, it's possible with a tradeoff for speed. Need more performance? Use the Rust plugin API.</li>
<li><strong>Bundling:</strong> One interesting area of development is <code><span><span>swcpack</span></span></code>, which is SWC's replacement for Webpack. It's still under development but could be very promising.</li>
<li><strong>WebAssembly:</strong> As mentioned above, the prospect of writing Rust and compiling to WASM is enticing, but there's still work to be done.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless, I'm confident Rust will continue to have a major impact on the JavaScript ecosystem for the next 1-2 years and into the future. Imagine a world where all of the build tools used in Next.js are written in Rust, giving you optimal performance. Then, Next.js could be distributed as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_build" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">static binary</a> you'd download from NPM.</p>
<p>That's the world I want to live (and develop) in.</p>
<h2>Update: 2023</h2>
<p>Since this post was written in 2021, there's been even more investment into new Rust tooling in the JavaScript ecosystem. A few notable Rust projects include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://biomejs.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Biome</a></strong>: Rome, previously mentioned in this post, has became Biome</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.rspack.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rspack</a></strong>: New bundler with webpack compat</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/pnpm/pacquet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pacquet (pnpm)</a></strong>: Experimental package manager for Node.js</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/youyuxi/status/1709943106215530867" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolldown</a></strong>: New bundler for Vite (replacing esbuild and rollup)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oxc</a></strong>: Similar to Biome: parser, linter, formatter, transpiler, minifier, etc</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://lightningcss.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lightning CSS</a></strong>: New CSS parser, transformer, bunder, and minifier.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, <a href="https://bun.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bun 1.0</a> was released, putting Zig on the map and working to speed up the entire JavaScript ecosystem.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>This made me think. In times when Instagram and other apps give us likes, hearts, and views on things we post, how much does big tech influence our behavior?</p>
<p>Aren’t they the same as the researcher, feeding us with dopamine to tell us to do what they want? Are they doing the same as the researcher who feeds the rats or pigeons?</p>
<p>This question, and recent improvements and tinkering with my flow as I started working for myself, made me ask how we can control the addiction and the influence and find a better way to slow living.</p>

<p>Johann continues that people who don’t follow the above dopamine flow are artists and painters.</p>
<p>Instead of sharing or selling them immediately and getting rewarded, they draw the next one. The drawing, the way to the end, is the reward, not the likes or selling the art. After hundreds of interviews, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</a> said all artists mentioned something like a Flow State. <strong>It’s magical</strong> that they just tried to be there.</p>
<p>This is also what I find most rewarding and experienced as an author: writing in the flow state, as I’m writing these words right now when I am merely in control, but the words flow out of my fingers. I guide them, but I do not write or choose the words.</p>
<p>This flow and the outcome of what the article looks like after are just magical.</p>
<h2 id="environments-matter">Environments Matter</h2>
<p>I have rediscovered the effects of the environment lately when working for myself when I had to find productivity in my everyday work without a boss telling me what to do. At home, I wasn’t always focused enough. I had all the distractions. Going to the library usually produces my best work.  Focused without distractions. But always going there, sometimes it’s open late, or closed. Another great way to write and be creative is to use coffee shops, specifically <strong>moving to the next every 1.5 to 2.5 hours</strong>. It’s the sweet spot for me between being creative and getting distracted. And interestingly enough, the same for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/cgpgrey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">CGP Grey</a> in his <a href="https://share.snipd.com/episode/6d03cf6a-1744-412d-a158-57aef1097f5b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Redundant Office</a> podcast, he said the same.</p>
<p>Music, especially non-vocal music on repeat or dedicated <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/music-that-keeps-you-focused/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Music that keeps you focused</a>, helps you stay in the flow longer. It’s another way of signaling an environment to the brain, like “Now is work time”. I also use a dedicated browser; for example, I use Zen browser for work and Brave for everything else. Zen, the work browser, has no extensions. No password manager to automatically log in and no history to quickly choose the latest website distraction. These little obstacles make it harder to distract, whereas my Brave has all the convenience at one tab away.</p>
<p>Another huge benefit of my writing work is that all my files are offline in my <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/obsidian" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Obsidian</a> Vault. No need to go online or log in to a web app to get going. It’s just there to start writing, brainstorming, and getting into the flow. Another way to stay in the flow is to use Markdown files and <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/vim-language-and-motions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Vim motions</a>. The Markdown files are simple text files that can be easily accessed and moved around. The key here is that the text’s formatting allows me to move and restructure entire chapters or ideas without friction. Adding the vim motions, I can do everything in the comfort of my keyboard. As I use them daily, they are muscle memory, and I can write at the speed of thought.</p>

        <p><i></i>Second Brain<i></i></p>
        <div>
            <p><a href="https://brain.ssp.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">My second brain</a>, offline notes in my Obsidian vault, allows me to create connections, observe the graph, and see connected or relevant notes that could influence my thinking on the topic I am writing. A note on a book I wrote 10 years ago, with some insight that didn’t touch much back then, but connected to the current thought, with more knowledge, can make all the difference.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
<h2 id="breaks">Breaks</h2>
<p>One crucial ingredient that is mostly overlooked is breaks. Small drinking breaks and walking around as observed with the 1.5-2.5h sweet spot. But much more, long periods off, vacations where you don’t think of work or related. Your brain has time to wander. Good sleep to a certain extent is also a form of break. The more we learn about sleep (see <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/55587034-why-we-sleep-unlocking-the-power-of-sleep-and-dreams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker</a>), the more prevalent it is how important it is. I also notice to myself. If I sleep, the chances of being productive in the morning, achieving my goals early, and getting a sense of calm throughout the rest of my day are much higher. As we process primarily during sleep, especially with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">REM (Rapid Eye Movement)</a> sleep that we usually get only after sleeping for 7-8 hours, is where the brain is cleansing itself, and making it ready for the next day.</p>
<p>I am on vacation writing this article, and I haven’t written for a couple of days. I am enjoying time on vacation, nature, and with family, letting my brain drift and follow its thoughts. These ideas, connections, and words basically flow themselves, as my brain is super relaxed. While being offline and taking a break, the brain makes sense of things in the subconscious.</p>
<div>
        <p><i></i>There Are Different Kinds of Rest<i></i></p>
        <div><p>To unblock, you can unblock or rest in different types of rest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical Rest</li>
<li>Mental Rest</li>
<li>Creative Rest</li>
<li>Emotional Rest</li>
<li>Social Rest</li>
<li>Spiritual rest</li>
<li>Sensory Rest</li>
</ul>

    </div>
<h3 id="mini-retirements">Mini Retirements</h3>
<p>Another way of taking breaks is small <strong>mini-retirements</strong>. I explored these in my <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/pathless-path/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Pathless Path</a>. These are like Sabbaticals. I did many of these early in my life, and they heavily influenced who I am today and how my life unfolded. But more on this in <a href="https://ssp.sh/blog/finding-my-pathless-path/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Finding My Pathless Path</a>.</p>
<h2 id="slowing-down-slow-living">Slowing down, Slow Living</h2>
<p>Slowing down, and just <strong>slow living</strong>, is another essential concept. Slowing down, being more present. As Cal Newport says in his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/197773418-slow-productivity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Slow Productivity</a>, his main points are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do fewer things.</li>
<li>Work at a natural pace.</li>
<li>Obsess over quality."</li>
</ol>
<p>If we apply this to life, we get a <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/deep-life" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Deeper Life</a>. One that is more fulfilled and present. It is about finding the balance between the important and the urgent.</p>
<p>Turning off the phone, without the pressure or the urge to check if someone has messaged you, if you got a like on social media, your brain starts wondering. You start getting ideas and thoughts to ponder. But these don’t start immediately. If you have been distracted, living a fast life, are constantly on the go, and have no time to think about anything, without defined <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/principles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">principles</a> to work towards, without <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/clarity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">clarity</a>, your brain can’t just switch, and be <strong>deeply focused</strong>. But practicing it, like meditation or yoga, is undoubtedly worth it.</p>
<div>
        <p><i></i>Digital Minimalism<i></i></p>
        <div>
            <p>Another book by Cal Newport is Digital Minimalism, which goes in the same direction—trying to use fewer digital mediums, less social media, and less distraction. I thoroughly recommend it, too.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
<div>
        <p><i></i>The basics: Food, Sleep, and Smartphones<i></i></p>
        <div>
            <p>The basis on top of these, is also a good sleep, nutritious food. And the phone needs to be away on do not disturb mode, or best in another room.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
<h3 id="shallow-vs-deep-happiness">Shallow vs. Deep Happiness</h3>
<p>These can also be summarized into what I call shallow happiness versus deep happiness. Buying something new, eating fast food, having another coffee, or watching a YouTube video all give us pleasure, but only in the <strong>short term</strong>. Writing an article or learning something hard, like coding or vim motions, is initially hard. But the reward is long-term. We get <strong>deep satisfaction</strong> from being in the flow and perfecting something we have learned and perfected over a long time.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s the secret of a <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/deep-life" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Deep Life</a>? Not reading news, journaling, praying, meditating, or following a Stoic practice. Reading books is a similar thing; it’s hard to listen to or read an entire book, but when we do, especially if we learn something new, without distractions, in a format the author spent a year or more to curate and put into its format, is so calming and almost peaceful. In fact,  <strong>reading a book</strong> is known to be the biggest and most common version of flow.</p>
<p>There’s much more to dig into, which I might in another article about “Why we are here on earth?”. This article has been cooking over many months and years already. It will go much deeper and more philosophical about why we even do what we do. It will be connected and even strengthen the flow more if we have clear principles, a clear path, and a passion for why we do something.</p>
<p>But now, instead, I want to focus on how to get into a flow state or how to unblock us when we feel stressed and not in the mood to do the <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/deep-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Deep Work</a>. If we easily get distracted.</p>
<p>These are all based on personal experience and books I read. They don’t always work, but one variation usually does the trick by iterating on them.</p>

<h2 id="getting-back-to-focus">Getting Back to Focus</h2>
<p>These are more pointers related to this article’s topic, thoughts, or steps I followed, some of which are already on my <a href="https://brain.ssp.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Second Brain</a>.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-get-focused">How to Get Focused</h3>
<p>Walk every day; nature is tiding our thoughts, just like naps and sleep. Walking, or going outside, is suitable for mental, spiritual, and physical health. When I start walking, the ideas flow, my brain calms down, and I slowly begin to think and process anything I am pondering. It’s best when done in <strong>nature</strong>. Nature in itself is a remedy for calming down. It has helped all the big thinkers before our time and will help many after ours.</p>
<p>Like our inner monkeys or daemons, they don’t want us to go out of bed or get fresh air. Walking frees us from them—the opposite of what social media or smartphones do.</p>
<div>
        <p><i></i>Pro Tip<i></i></p>
        <div>
            <p>Sometimes, bring a paper notebook or camera to capture ideas or thoughts. But other times, go deliberately without.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
<h3 id="strategies-to-unblock">Strategies to Unblock</h3>
<p>Try to change the medium. If writing on a computer does not work, try pen or paper. Or try talking. As Jonny Miller said:</p>
<blockquote>There is no talking block, only writer's block.</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, if we change the medium, we can unblock it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a walk in nature.</li>
<li>Change environment, physically as well as digitally:
<ul>
<li><strong>Physical</strong>: Go to another room, a coffee shop, or what works best for me, Libraries.</li>
<li><strong>Digital</strong>: Also, changing your computer environment, e.g., changing from dark to light mode or changing the theme, can give you a sense of change and fresh energy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Listen to the same playlist repeatedly, and use <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/music-that-keeps-you-focused/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Music that keeps you focused</a>.</li>
<li>Timebox yourself, also called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Pomodoro Technique</a>. It has the same effect and works in the train with only the battery. The urge to finish before you run out of battery will give you focus and added clarity.</li>
<li>Change between Text and Visual: I use a lot of MindMap on paper, but <a href="https://obsidian.md/canvas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Obsidian Canvas</a>, Draw with ExaliDraw, and others work as well.</li>
<li>Go forth and back the pendulum with <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/creativity-vs-productivity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Creativity vs Productivity</a>.</li>
<li>Try to get into the same habit when working (same place, same music, etc.). Your brain will know it needs to write before you even start.
<ul>
<li>Check <a href="https://youtu.be/snAhsXyO3Ck?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Spaceship You</a> by CGP Grey, showcasing how designated space helped during the pandemic, but also for clarity.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/pregame-routine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Pre–Game Routine</a> by James Clear can help as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/journaling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Journaling</a> for a while.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-i-get-into-deep-work--flow">How I get into Deep Work — Flow</h3>
<p>The above strategies to unblock are also related to <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/deep-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Deep Work</a> and how I get into deep work:</p>
<ol>
<li>Journal before bed what 1-2 tasks you must/want to achieve tomorrow.</li>
<li>Go to bed early (you usually don’t achieve much at night).</li>
<li>Have a good sleep.</li>
<li>Get up before the kids :) (don’t turn on the phone).</li>
<li>Make your bed.</li>
<li>Later, take a walk in nature.</li>
<li>Change environment/room if stuck.</li>
</ol>
<p>Others:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear some time in your calendar.</li>
<li>Get rid of distractions: Turn off notifications, close Slack, and put your phone out of reach.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Clear your space and your mind. Put on concentration music, and get rid of any clutter around.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Get to work on a specific task, taking periodic short breaks.</li>
<li>Deeper: Acknowledge your fears, write from authenticity and a place of <strong>truth</strong>.
<ul>
<li><strong>Truth</strong> is stored in our body (not in our mind)</li>
<li><strong>Emotions</strong> are like a GPS, help us to find truth and navigate around</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/two-minutes-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Two Minutes Rules</a> to do it for at least two minutes</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/routines-such-as-sports-or-meditation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Meditation</a> or doing nothing for 5 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, like <em>creative block</em>, add boundaries and constraints like no internet, use another browser for searching the web, and suddenly ideas flow. Unlimited freedom is super-blocking, especially for creativity. Great read on the topic: <a href="https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/if-you-have-writers-block-maybe-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">If You Have Writer’s Block, Maybe You Should Stop Lying</a>.</p>
<div>
        <p><i></i>I Do Nothing<i></i></p>
        <div>
            <p>When I don’t have inspiration or I have a block, I do nothing. <strong>I live</strong>. And it’s absolutely because of the deeper inspiration that I’m blessed to feel. I feel it’s been cultivated. I’m connected to it, and I know it’s real, and it doesn’t have to greet me every day. I know it’s there.—<strong>Jon Batiste</strong></p>
        </div>
    </div>
<h3 id="turn-off-shut-down-and-re-energize-for-a-happy-life">Turn Off, Shut Down, and Re-Energize for a Happy Life</h3>
<p>Something that is easy to say but hard to do. I enjoy <strong>walks in nature</strong> or a long bicycle ride. It does not matter what you do, but that you do something without distraction. I was listening to books on the walks for a long time, but this always felt like more work. Sure, if you have a great book, listening can be fun too, but I did my best to calm down when going without any decision—just me and nature.</p>
<p>From the book “The Well-Lived Life: A 102-Year-Old Doctor’s Six Secrets to Health and Happiness at Every Age”, a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62918481-the-well-lived-life" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">comment</a> by Liong on Goodreads says the six secrets may help us live a <strong>long, happy, and healthy life</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Let go of the past (Forget the past regrets and anger).</li>
<li>Live in the present moment. (Live now; don’t stay in your history and worry about your future).</li>
<li>Connect with nature. (Read and find out yourself).</li>
<li>Eat a healthy diet. (Choose and be aware of what you eat daily).</li>
<li>Get regular exercise. (Try exercise every day).</li>
<li>Find your purpose. (Having a purpose is vital to living longer).</li>
</ol>
<p>Be grateful now. Help others. Have fun—also, more on my note on <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/what-makes-a-happy-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">What Makes a Happy Life</a>.</p>
<h3 id="nature-how-it-flourishes-creativity">Nature: How It Flourishes Creativity</h3>
<p>Take inspiration from nature. Nature is so powerful.</p>
<p>For example, watching a tree through the four seasons: In summer, it is green with many leaves; in autumn, it loses them all; in winter, it looks dead. But instead, it builds and prepares its strength for the spring. Where the colorful flowers sprout, it’s calming and inspiring.</p>
<p>Take gardening; it takes so much patience to grow those three. It puts time into different perspectives. Threes <strong>outlive</strong> houses and plants are harvested over many years. If you sell a home, things might have been there long before the house.</p>
<p>I like to get inspiration from nature. I think of my <strong>creative process as gardening</strong>. Things inside us build up <strong>slowly</strong>, but great things will come out with constant nurturing: Art, a thought, an idea, anything. It doesn’t matter which day. It’s seasonal, similar to creativity; we can’t be creative all year.</p>
<p>I hope any of these helped you; more so, it helped me to clarify focus in connection with the ever-growing (primarily digital) distractions to find a better life worth living—A slower and deeper life could be possible.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>





<p>I’ve been seriously traveling for more than 50 years, and I’ve learned a lot.</p>



<p>I’ve traveled solo, and I’ve led a tour group of 40 friends. I’ve slept in dormitories and I’ve stayed in presidential suites with a butler. I’ve hitchhiked penniless for months, and I’ve flown by private jet. I’ve traveled months with siblings, and with total strangers. I’ve gone by slow boat and I’ve ridden my bicycle across America, twice. I’ve been to the largest gathering of humans on the planet, and trekked into remotest areas on the planet on my own. I’ve paid for luxury tours, and I’ve done my own self-guided tours. I regularly travel for business, and once I went to Hawaii on a door-prize award. I’ve circumnavigated the globe in only 48 hours, and I traveled uninterrupted for 9 months. I’ve gone first class and third class, sometimes on the same trip. So far I’ve visited half the world’s countries, and usually manage to get far from the capital city when I do. Here is what I know about how to travel.</p>



<p>There are two modes of travel; retreat or engage. People often travel to escape the routines of work, to recharge, relax, reinvigorate, and replenish themselves— R&amp;R. In this mode you travel to remove yourself from your routines, or to get the pampering and attention you don’t ordinarily get, and ideally to do fun things instead of work things. So you travel to where it is easy. This is called a vacation, or R&amp;R.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other mode is engagement and experience, or E&amp;E. In this mode you travel to discover new things, to have new experiences, to lean into an adventure whose outcome is not certain, to meet otherness. You move to find yourself by encountering pleasures and challenges you don’t encounter at home. This kind of travel is a type of learning, and of the two modes, it is the one I favor in these tips.</p>



<p>***********</p>



<p>Organize your travel around passions instead of destinations. An itinerary based on obscure cheeses, or naval history, or dinosaur digs, or jazz joints will lead to far more adventures, and memorable times than a grand tour of famous places. It doesn’t even have to be your passions; it could be a friend’s, family member’s, or even one you’ve read about. The point is to get away from the expected into the unexpected.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>If you hire a driver, or use a taxi, offer to pay the driver to take you to visit their mother. They will ordinarily jump at the chance. They fulfill their filial duty and you will get easy entry into a local’s home, and a very high chance to taste some home cooking. Mother, driver, and you leave happy. This trick rarely fails.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>Make no assumptions about whether something will be open. There are other norms at work. If possible check at the last minute, if not, have a plan B.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>Crash a wedding. You are not a nuisance; you are the celebrity guest! The easiest way to do this is to find the local wedding hall where weddings happen on schedule and approach a wedding party with a request to attend. They will usually feel honored. You can offer the newlyweds a small token gift of cash if you want. You will be obliged to dance. Take photos of them; they will take photos of you. It will make your day and theirs. (I’ve crashed a wedding in most of the countries I have visited.)</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>Don’t balk at the spendy price of admission for a museum or performance. It will be a tiny fraction of your trip’s total cost and you invested too much and have come too far to let those relative minor fees stop you from seeing what you came to see.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>Google maps will give you very detailed and reliable directions for taking public transit, including where to make transfers in most cities.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>When visiting a foreign city for the first time, take a street food tour. Depending on the region, the tour will include food carts, food trucks, food courts, or smaller eateries. It will last a few hours, and the cost will include the food. You’ll get some of the best food available, and usually the host will also deliver a great introduction to the culture. Google “street food tour for city X.”</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>The most significant criteria to use when selecting travel companions is: do they complain or not, even when complaints are justified? No complaining! Complaints are for the debriefing afterwards when travel is over.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>As in any art, constraints breed creativity. Give your travel creative constraints: Try traveling by bicycle, or with only a day bag for luggage, or below the minimum budget, or sleep only on overnight trains. Mix it up. Even vagabonding can become a rut.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>Renting a car is easier than ever today, even in developing countries, and oftentimes the best bet for getting around if you are headed for many places outside of cities. It is an option worth considering, especially if you are 2 to 3 people traveling. On the other hand, there are still plenty of places where you don’t want to drive because of chaotic roads, lawless attitudes, and unfavorable liabilities. In those places hiring a driver plus car for a multi-day trip is often a surprisingly appealing bargain—especially if you have 2 to 3 people to split the costs. The total could be less than taking trains and taxis, and you get door to door service, and often a built-in guide who knows the local roads and also local festivities and best places to eat. They will be at least 2x the cost of renting a car, but for some kinds of travel 2x as good. If you are a spontaneous traveler, a hired driver is by far the best option allowing you to change your itinerary immediately as mood, weather, or lucky timing dictate. I usually find drivers by searching travel forums for recommendations. I score candidates primarily by their communication skills.</p>

<p>If you are fortunate, a fantastic way to share your fortune is to gift a friend the cost of travel with you. You both will have a great time.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>Go to a cemetery. Look for sacred places. People live authentically there. Don’t just visit the markets, but also go to small workshops, hardware stores and pharmacies –&nbsp; places with easy access to local practices. See how it’s different and the same all at once.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p><a href="https://www.flightaware.com/">FlightAware</a> is the best free phone app for the status of your flight. It will often tell you about delays hours before the airline will. Tip: use FlightAware to check whether your plane has even arrived at your departure airport.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>Sketchy travel plans and travel to sketchy places are ok. Take a chance. If things fall apart, your vacation has just turned into an adventure. Perfection is for watches. Trips should be imperfect. There are no stories if nothing goes amiss.&nbsp;</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>Your enjoyment of a trip will be inversely related to the weight of your luggage. Counterintuitively, the longer your trip, the less stuff you should haul. Travelers still happy on a 6-week trip will only have carry-on luggage. That maximizes your flexibility, enabling you to lug luggage up stairs when there is no elevator, or to share a tuk-tuk, to pack and unpack efficiently, and to not lose stuff. Furthermore, when you go light you intentionally reduce what you take in order to increase your experience of living. And the reality of today is that you can almost certainly buy whatever you are missing on the road.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>Getting an inside tour is the ultimate travel treat. How about a factory tour, a visit to an Amish home, or backstage at an opera? When I travel for business I will sometimes ask for inside access to an uncommon place in lieu of a speaking fee. You are aiming for experiences that simple money can’t buy. Good ones will take planning ahead.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>It is always colder at night than you think it should be, especially in the tropics. Pack a layer no matter what.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>Planning your itinerary: You want to see it all and you are likely to never return, so the temptation is to pile it on, maximize your visit. Since we are in X, and Y and Z&nbsp; are so close, we might as well see Y and Z….. Paradoxically when you are traveling you should minimize the amount of time you spend in transit—once you arrive. The hard-to-accept truth is that it is far better to spend more time in a few places than a little time in a bunch of places.&nbsp;</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>To book a train anywhere in the world outside your home country, your first stop should be <a href="https://www.seat61.com/">The Man in Seat 61</a>, a sprawling website which will conveniently help you book the train you want.&nbsp;</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>In 53 years of travelling with all kinds of people, I’ve seen absolutely no correlation between where you eat and whether you have intestinal problems, so to maximize the enjoyment of local foods, my rule of thumb is to eat wherever healthy-looking locals eat.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>The list of most coveted cities to visit have one striking thing in common—they are pedestrian centric. They reward walking.<strong> </strong>Better online hotel sites like<a href="http://booking.com/"> Booking.com</a> have map interfaces which allow you to select hotels by their location. Whenever possible I book my hotel near to where it is best to walk, so I can stroll out the door and begin to wander.&nbsp;</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>For a truly memorable trip, go without reservations, just winging it along the way. If you like somewhere, stay a day longer, or if you don’t, split a day earlier. If the train is full, take a bus. That freedom can be liberating.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>The <a href="https://apps.apple.com/tr/app/google-translate/id414706506">Google Translate app</a> for your phone is seriously good, and free. It will translate voice, text, or script to and from 250 languages. Use for deciphering menus, signs, talking with clerks, etc. It is often a lifesaver.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>Large-scale luxury cruises have no appeal to me, yet a small boat cruise is an entirely different species and a valid option worth considering. The advantage of a cruise is that your hotel travels with you, so you unpack only once. It is especially useful for small groups because it eliminates the eternal negotiation of deciding where to eat. (You always eat on the boat.) The advantages of a small boat cruise over a huge boat are several: you disembark very quickly, very often, at smaller more intimate places than large boats can do. And the options for activities are more active than just shopping: such as snorkeling, kayaking, bicycling, hiking, visiting local families and communities. Overall you spend far more time doing things off the boat than on. I define a small boat as 40 passengers or fewer. The per day cost is high, but almost every minute of it is quality time, unlike a series of bus rides. Examples of places I’ve loved a small boat cruise; The Galapagos, Alaska inland passageway, Mekong River, Coast of Turkey, and Kerala, India.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>The rate you go is not determined by how fast you walk, bike or drive, but by how long your breaks are. Slow down. Take lots of breaks. The most memorable moments—conversations with amazing strangers, an invite inside, a hidden artwork—will usually happen when you are not moving.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>I generally find “professional” tour guides uninteresting, and too scripted. They are mostly repeating what can be found in guide books. So I rarely hire them. I much prefer to have a friend or local acquaintance show me what interests them in an ad hoc way, with no script. Let friends know you are coming to their area.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>A few <a href="https://amzn.to/4gKbKAV">laundry detergent sheets</a> in a tiny ziplock bag weigh nothing and won’t spill and are perfect for emergency laundry washing in the sink or shower.&nbsp;</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>These days it is mandatory that you are connected. You need cell coverage as well as wifi. You’ll want robust mobile coverage for navigation, translation apps, ride shares and a digital wallet for payments. Best option is to use a carrier with “free” international plans (such as T-Mobile or <a href="https://fi.google.com/about/">Google Fi</a>) so you need to do nothing. Second best is to get either a sim card or e-sim for your phone for your visiting country. E-sim apps (such <a href="https://www.airalo.com/">Airalo</a>) can be loaded by yourself virtually. Sims and e-sims are also sold at most international airports when you exit. Most are reputable. One tip, turn off your photo and video cloud backup while on the sim to reduce data usage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>People in other places are not saints. You might get cheated, swindled, or taken advantage of. Paradoxically, the best way to avoid that is to give strangers your trust and treat them well. Being good to them brings out their good. If you are on your best behavior, they will be on their best behavior. And vice versa. To stay safe, smile. Be humble and minimize your ego. I don’t know why that works everywhere in the world—even places with “bad” reputations—but it does.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>You can get an inexpensive and authentic meal near a famous tourist spot simply by walking at least five blocks away from the epicenter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>Digital wallets on your phone are displacing local currencies in many places. For instance I did not use any cash on my last trips to the UK and China. And in places where it has not completely eliminated cash you can reduce your cash needs by half with mobile payments. Set up your Apple pay, Google Pay or Alipay before you leave. There is no need to exchange money anywhere, especially at airports. Get any cash you need at local ATMs, which are now everywhere. Use a card that does not charge, or reimburses, a foreign fee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>If you detect slightly more people moving in one direction over another, follow them. If you keep following this “gradient” of human movement, you will eventually land on something interesting—a market, a parade, a birthday party, an outdoor dance, a festival.&nbsp;</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>Splurge in getting the most recent version of a guidebook to your destination. It is worth the price of a lunch to get the latest, most helpful, reliable information. I supplement the latest guidebook research with recommendations suggested in travel forums online. Guidebooks have depth and breadth, while forums offer speed—results from a week ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>If you are starting out and have seen little of the world, you can double the time you spend traveling by heading to the places it is cheapest to travel. If you stay at the budget end, you can travel twice as long for half price. Check out <a href="https://www.cheapestdestinationsblog.com/">The Cheapest Destination Blog</a>. In my experience, these off-beat destinations are usually worth visiting.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>In many parts of the world today motorcycles play the role of cars. That means you can hire a moto-taxi to take you on the back seat, or to summon a moto-taxi with an uber-like app, or to take a motorcycle tour with a guide doing the driving. In areas where motorcycles dominate they will be ten times more efficient than slowly going by car.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>Put inexpensive <a href="https://amzn.to/4hxt9y4">Apple AirTags</a> into your bags, so you can track them when they are out of your sight. More and more airlines are integrating AirTags into their system to help find wayward bags. The tags work for luggage left in hotel storage, or stashed beneath the bus, or pieces you need to forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>For the best travel experiences you need either a lot of money, or a lot of time. Of the two modes, it is far better to have more time than money. Although it tries, money cannot buy what time delivers. You have enough time to attend the rare festival, to learn some new words, to understand what the real prices are, to wait out the weather, or to get to that place that takes a week in a jeep. Time is the one resource you can give yourself, so take advantage of this if you are young without money.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>Being beautiful, or well crafted, or cheap is not enough for a souvenir. It should have some meaning from the trip. A good question you may want to ask yourself when buying a souvenir is where will this live when I get home?</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>The best souvenirs from a trip are your memories of the trip so find a way to memorialize them; keep a journal, send updates to a friend, take a sketchbook, post some observations, make a photo book.&nbsp;</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>When asking someone for a restaurant recommendation, don’t ask them where is a good place you should eat; ask them where they eat. Where did they eat the last time they ate out?</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>Here in brief is the method I’ve honed to optimize a two-week vacation: When you arrive in a new country, immediately proceed to the farthest, most remote, most distant place you intend to reach during the trip. If there is a small village, remote spa, a friend’s farm, or a wild place you plan on seeing on the trip, go there immediately. Do not stop near the airport. Do not rest overnight in the arrival city. Do not pause to acclimate. If at all possible proceed by plane, bus, jeep, car directly to the furthest point without interruption. Make it an overnight journey if you have to. Then once you reach your furthest point, unpack, explore, and work your way slowly back to the big city, wherever your international departure airport is.</p>



<p>In other words you make a laser-straight rush for the end, and then meander back. Laser out, meander back. This method is somewhat contrary to many people’s first instincts, which are to immediately get acclimated to the culture in the landing city before proceeding to the hinterlands. The thinking is: get a sense of what’s going on, stock up, size up the joint. Then slowly work up to the more challenging, more remote areas. That’s reasonable, but not optimal because most big cities around the world are more similar than different. All big cities these days feel same-same on first arrival. In Laser-Back travel what happens is that you are immediately thrown into Very Different Otherness, the maximum difference that you will get on this trip. You go from your home to extreme differences so fast it is almost like the dissolve effect in a slide show. Bam! Your eyes are wide open. You are on your toes. All ears. And there at the end of the road (but your beginning), your inevitable mistakes are usually cheaper, easier to recover from, and more fun. You take it slower, no matter what country you are in. Then you use the allotted time to head back to the airport city, at whatever pace is your pace. But, when you arrive in the city after a week or so traveling in this strangeness, and maybe without many of the luxuries you are used to, you suddenly see the city the same way the other folks around you do. After eight days in less fancy digs, the bright lights, and smooth shopping streets, and late-night eateries dazzle you, and you embrace the city with warmth and eagerness. It all seems so … civilized and ingenious. It’s brilliant! The hustle and bustle are less annoying and almost welcomed. And the attractions you notice are the small details that natives appreciate. You see the city more like a native and less like a jaded tourist in a look-alike urban mall. You leave having enjoyed both the remote and the adjacent, the old and new, the slow and the fast, the small and the big. </p>



<p>We’ve also learned that this intensity works best if we aim for 12 days away from home. That means 10 days for in-country experience, plus a travel day (or two) on each end. We’ve found from doing this many times, with many travelers of all ages and interests, 14 days on the ground is two days too many. There seems to be a natural lull at about 10 days of intense kinetic travel. People start to tune out a bit. So we cut it there and use the other days to come and go and soften the transitions. On the other hand 8 days feels like the momentum is cut short. So 10 days of intensity, and 12 days in a country is what we aim for. Laser-back travel is not foolproof, nor always possible, but on average it tends to work better than the other ways I’ve tried.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://simplyfabulicious.wordpress.com/2016/09/09/dinner-at-a-north-korean-restaurant-in-shanghai/">https://simplyfabulicious.wordpress.com/2016/09/09/dinner-at-a-north-korean-restaurant-in-shanghai/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43065586">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			<p>Shrouded in secrecy and isolated from the world, North Korea exudes an air of mystery. Hardly anything is known about the country except media stories about their dear leader, Kim Jong Un – his unrivalled cult-style of&nbsp;governance that has bred a nation of adoring people&nbsp;who hang on to his every command. &nbsp;And yet, amidst the uphoria of living in utopia, stories have emerged about defectors who have risked it all&nbsp;to leave everything and everyone behind – to start anew. Most recent are defection reports about&nbsp;<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2016/04/11/asia/north-korea-official-defects/">a senior North Korean official in London</a> and <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-36366009">13 restaurant staff in Ningbo, China</a>.</p>
<p>Apparently there are 130 state-owned North Korean restaurants in&nbsp;12 countries. Most are in China, but they can also be found in Russia, Dubai, Malaysia, Cambodia, Mongolia and Vietnam.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;Shanghai over the weekend and curious about the hype, I decided to visit one of these elusive&nbsp;North Korean state-owned restaurants and here’s what I discovered:</p>
<figure data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_3095" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3095"><a href="https://simplyfabulicious.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_2263.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="3095" data-permalink="https://simplyfabulicious.wordpress.com/2016/09/09/dinner-at-a-north-korean-restaurant-in-shanghai/img_2263/" data-orig-file="https://simplyfabulicious.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_2263.jpg" data-orig-size="500,667" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.2&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;iPhone 6s Plus&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1473020193&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;4.15&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.25&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://simplyfabulicious.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_2263.jpg?w=225" data-large-file="https://simplyfabulicious.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_2263.jpg?w=500" src="https://simplyfabulicious.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_2263.jpg?w=760" srcset="https://simplyfabulicious.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_2263.jpg 500w, https://simplyfabulicious.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_2263.jpg?w=112&amp;h=150 112w, https://simplyfabulicious.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_2263.jpg?w=225&amp;h=300 225w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3095">The Pyongyang Koryo is located on the 2nd floor of Shanghai’s Tong Mao Hotel.</figcaption></figure>
<h3>Not One But Three Such Restaurants In Shanghai!</h3>
<p>There are apparently <a href="http://travel.cnn.com/shanghai/eat/odd-reality-behind-shanghais-pyongyang-restaurants-592649/">three North Korean restaurants in Shanghai</a>&nbsp;(Pudong, Changning and Xuhui). The one I went to was called Pyongyang Koryo and this was the one located at the <a href="http://www.tongmaohotelshanghai.cn/">Tong Mao Hotel in Shanghai</a>. You won’t find this listed on Shanghai’s Trip Advisor &nbsp;nor will you find a link to the restaurant’s website. Our visit to the place felt like a very covert trip to discover something revered or forbidden which probably added to my overall fascination.</p>
<figure data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_3096" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3096"><a href="https://simplyfabulicious.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_2264.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="3096" data-permalink="https://simplyfabulicious.wordpress.com/2016/09/09/dinner-at-a-north-korean-restaurant-in-shanghai/img_2264/" data-orig-file="https://simplyfabulicious.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_2264.jpg" data-orig-size="500,667" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.2&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;iPhone 6s Plus&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1473020209&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;4.15&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.125&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://simplyfabulicious.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_2264.jpg?w=225" data-large-file="https://simplyfabulicious.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_2264.jpg?w=500" src="https://simplyfabulicious.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_2264.jpg?w=760" srcset="https://simplyfabulicious.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_2264.jpg 500w, https://simplyfabulicious.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_2264.jpg?w=112&amp;h=150 112w, https://simplyfabulicious.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_2264.jpg?w=225&amp;h=300 225w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3096">The Tong Mao Hotel in Pudong houses the North Korean restaurant that we visited.</figcaption></figure>
<h3>Off The Beaten Track</h3>
<p>There are only a handful of articles about the restaurant which I have tagged links to above. Otherwise, it is not an easy find as you can’t simply google it as there is no website. The staff at the restaurant according to this <a href="http://travel.cnn.com/shanghai/eat/odd-reality-behind-shanghais-pyongyang-restaurants-592649/">CNN article</a> are not even aware that other similar restaurants exist or even if they are, they are unable to give you details and locations. There are also no facebook pages, trip advisor mentions and even the Hotel that it is located at does not even list it on it’s official website.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.tongmaohotelshanghai.cn/">Tong Mao Hotel </a>is a four star typical Chinese-style hotel, located in Pudong, slightly off the beaten track and oddly surrounded by austere office buildings. The Hotel website only recommends their Chinese and Western restaurant and not their North Korean tenants – strange, because the first thing that you see after passing through the Hotel’s revolving doors – is the more casual Pyongyang Cafe on the left. Climb up the stairs and at a discreet corner, is the main Pyongyang Koryo restaurant.</p>

<h3>Stuck In Time</h3>
<p>Just walking into the restaurant is a step back into a time warp spiralling back (not even to the 80s which would have been acceptable) but more like going all the way back to the 50s. My parents would probably recognise that era, as none of us reading this would have even been born then.</p>

<p>Strangely, it is not the ambience or the dated decor that is the giveaway. It is the fact that every staff member that you encounter there looks like one of the actresses in&nbsp;the old video tapes of the weepy Chinese TV serials from the 70s that your parents refuse to throw away. Except that the look is even more dated than that – from the&nbsp;hairstyles of the serving staff who wear their hair tied back into a single braided ponytail (even when dressed in Western attire on stage) to their style of makeup (heavy foundation, fair two-way caked faces themed with bright red lipstick against jet black hair), their choice of glittery hair accessories and the very unflattering 1980s office girl white pumps with heels.</p>
<p>Stepping into the restaurant, you almost get this feeling that you’re the real outsider – &nbsp;completely out of place and dressed strangely with your highlighted wavy tresses, boho sling bag, frayed denim jeans with rips in the knees, off shoulder Summer blouse, strappy sandals and the latest iPhone in hand.</p>
<p>Don’t mistake my comments – the girls are stunning. Way above average. These are not your short, stubby Aunties serving you. Almost every waitress was young (definitely in their early 20s), tall, slim and willowy. All educated, well mannered and soft-spoken, graceful and able to speak fluent conversational Mandarin.</p>
<h3>Small Talk But No Photos</h3>
<p>We found out that the girls are all from elite North Korean families. The one that served us shared politely that she has worked at this restaurant for one and the half years and all of them are University graduates who consider this their duty and only opportunity to work and serve their country by sharing their culture and food.</p>
<p>I complimented her on her mandarin which was probably better than mine and she replied graciously and coyly that she had to take the initiative to study it on her own before coming over and after she came over to China she had lessons. She brushed up her understanding and accent picking it up along the way from speaking daily to customers. She added humbly and with a gracious smile, “顾客足是我们的老师”！- “the customers are our teachers”.</p>

<p>As the orders were taken and the food started arriving, another crew of girls came out from the kitchen entrance and behind stage to set it up. I took out my mobile phone to snap a few pictures. Our waitress quickly placed her hand at the back of my phone camera and firmly said, “no photos!” bringing our attention to the&nbsp;sign board above us that read – NO PHOTOS.</p>
<p>Of course, a meal at this restaurant would not be complete without a few stolen shots so when she disappeared to get our orders, I quickly snapped a few, just in time, before she hurried back. Throughout the rest of the meal and performance, the same girl stood politely about 2 metres behind me, at a discreet corner of the restaurant, keeping a watchful eye on my phone.</p>
<h3>An All-Girl Crew</h3>
<p>Strangely we saw very few men in the restaurant. No male Manager just a slightly older ‘host’ who must have been only in her 40s, standing mostly at the door and making the announcements on stage later.</p>
<p>Perhaps the men were sitting amidst the crowd, posing as customers but were actually&nbsp;minders watching out for rowdy and possibly drunk customers but their presence was not obvious. At most there may have been a male cook inside the kitchen but otherwise, this was strictly an all-girl crew. The performers who took to the stage also took on male roles when required, which was even stranger.</p>
<p>We heard that the girls stay in the Hotel (yes, upstairs) and they are seldom allowed out and that they do not get paid or if they do, the amount is for pocket money as everything from food and lodging to basic necessities are provided by the State. Free time is allowed but limited and strictly monitored. The waitress I spoke to shared that she expects that most restaurant postings would be for a minimum of 2 to 4 years before they return to their homelands.</p>
<h3>Korean Food But Just Not The Way You Are Used To Eating It</h3>
<p>The food – hmm – let’s just say that you should not expect your South Korean BBQ. You don’t DIY at these North Korean restaurants.</p>

<p>The food (even BBQ items) is all cooked in the kitchen and served to you. So forget the little plates of garlic, kimchi, seasoned nuts that arrive when you are at the South Korean eateries. Also forget the delicious pork ribs dripping with melted cheese, and the lovely egg dip that swims around the side of the hot plate as you barbecue your meat.</p>
<p>In terms of fashionable food and cooking style – North Korean restaurants are strictly traditional. Probably a menu of what you would have expected to eat in South Korea in the 60s. &nbsp;There are though, some interesting specialties that we tried that you might want to order if you venture there.</p>
<p>This is a <em>Black Rice</em> rolled up and sliced like sausages. Very good. It tasted like glutinous rice with a hint of chestnut and perhaps some pork.</p>

<p><em>Barbecued prawns</em> – these were pretty much like the usual barbecued fare but I liked the fact that there were big and meaty and well seasoned.</p>

<p>Not quite bulgogi but this <em>marinated beef dish</em> was pretty tasty and cooked in the kitchen and then brought out with a side plate of veggies that you have to order to wrap them in.</p>

<p>The <em>tuna sashimi</em> was chilled and very fresh but not quite my thing although very colourful and appetising with that little orchid embellishment on the left corner.</p>

<h3>KTV North Korean Style</h3>
<p>The entertainment is perhaps what sets aside a North Korean restaurant from its neighbour in the South. &nbsp;Dinner comes with a show which starts about 730pm for the first seating. You are requested to arrive and be seated at 645pm if you are booked for the first set. Yes there are two seatings to presumably maximise profits. The North Korean restaurants largely operate not as a form of cultural exchange but more as a &nbsp;means to bring foreign currency back into their economies.</p>

<p>I am stumped just trying to describe the show. The show starts with a ‘cool rocker-chick’ (pictured above) getting on stage and picking up her electric guitar.</p>
<p>Ms ‘DPRK rocker chick’ (lets call her that for now) is fully made up and has hair braided behind her head into a tidy ponytail with glittery rhinestone style clips at the side. She is wearing a black tight dress that even Joan Jett would cringe at as its made of a lace top half with three-quarter sleeves and a princess cut bust line in front. The look is complete and resplendant with panty-hosed legs and white pumps with heels.</p>
<p>She picks up her electric guitar (Hard Rock Cafe – NOT!) and we are off to a rousing start (K-pop NOT!). I have to confess I have never heard Korean folk songs played on an electric guitar and after a few chords she is joined by an accordian player and someone &nbsp;on the electric keyboard and another girl on drums. It was like attending a rock concert on another planet. Behind the two musicians, off stage is a large screen TV playing silent footage of montages and homeland scenes of North Korea.</p>
<p>An emcee of sorts appears in a flowery gown on stage. I actually liked their beautifully embroidered and brightly coloured native costumes and truth be told, if they had stuck to that, the whole experience would have been less bizarre!</p>
<p>An emcee comes onstage and introduces the performance and welcomes everyone in high pitched mandarin.&nbsp;The show is about an hour long. From Korean folk songs, the repertoire expands into a few popular Chinese songs (again songs from the 70s all about wholesome friendships and young love) and then the floral bouquets make their debut.</p>

<p>Plastic flowers wrapped in tulle and cellophane in large bouquets that look like they have been around for some time are given to the female members of the audience. I got a bouquet which they took back afterwards as it was a prop and just ‘part of the show’.</p>
<p>The children are given smaller bouquets and encouraged to go up on stage to award &nbsp;them to the singers after each performance amidst the rowdy clapping. The music gets louder and louder and then it breaks into dancing.</p>
<p>You realise that there are more performers on stage and some of them were serving food earlier on the floor but have now got into fancy costumes. 3 such girls get on stage to do a tap dance followed by 3 more who come up to stage performing a folk dance with pots that they skilfully balance on their heads and then proceed to whirl around with on stage at dizzying speeds.</p>
<p>After this, people celebrating engagements or birthdays get invited on to stage to pose under a flower canopy held up by the performers. They get serenaded to with a mix of Korean and Chinese love songs that I don’t quite recognise.</p>

<p>The show ends with a carousing song and dance. Head bands with rosettes and leis are handed out to members of the audience. Everyone joins in from Ms ‘Rock-Chick (see above left in picture) to waitresses.</p>
<p>Expect to join in or get dragged onto stage, yes kids, adults and all – no exclusions. Definitely not for spoil sports or the faint hearted. &nbsp;Think ‘Ring Around The Roses’ done on stage – yes, in a circle!</p>
<p>At the end of dinner and the show, the bill is presented and the same waitress hastens towards us to ask us if we enjoyed ourselves and to get some feedback on the food. I have to say that the training and the service is close to excellent here. Probably way beyond what you would get at any other restaurant in China.</p>
<p>A senior waitress or lady host says goodbye at the door and we hurry out .. back into the black night .. a little stupified at what we had just experienced .. amazed that for that two hours, we were given a tiny glimpse and taste into the secret world of North Korea.</p>
<p>Interested to try the experience for yourselves? You might want to before <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/dozens-of-north-korean-restaurants-abroad-closed-or-suspended-south-korea">they all close down</a>.</p>
<p>The closest North Korean restaurant to Singapore is in <a href="http://www.koryo.my/">Malaysia&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;and for readers in Hong Kong, there are several North Korean restaurants in China,&nbsp;mainly in Shanghai and Beijing.</p>
