<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Don’t want to babysit your app database on a VM but not willing to pay the DBaaS tax either? We're building a third way.</p><p>Today, we’re launching Bunny Database as a public preview: a SQLite-compatible managed service that spins down when idle, keeps latency low wherever your users are, and doesn’t cost a fortune.</p><h2 id="so-what%E2%80%99s-the-deal-with-database-services-in-2026">So what’s the deal with database services in 2026?</h2><p>It’s become clear by now that the DBaaS platforms that garnered the love of so many devs are all going upmarket. Removing or dumbing down free tiers, charging for unused capacity, charging extra for small features, or bundling them in higher tiers — you already know the drill.</p><p>Hard to blame anyone for growing their business, but it doesn’t feel right when these services stop making sense for the very people who helped popularize them in the first place.</p><p>So where does that leave you?</p><h2 id="like-sqlite-but-for-the-web">Like SQLite, but for the web</h2><p>Not every project needs Postgres, and that’s okay. Sometimes you just want a simple, reliable database that you can spin up quickly and build on, without worrying it’ll hit your wallet like an EC2.</p><p>That’s what we built Bunny Database for.</p><p>What you get:</p><ul><li><strong>One-click deployment</strong>: just name your database and go, no config needed</li><li><strong>Language-specific tooling</strong>: SDKs for TS/JS, Go, Rust, and .NET help you handle the boring bits</li><li><strong>Low latency anywhere</strong>: replication regions let you serve reads close to your users</li><li><strong>41 regions worldwide</strong>: choose between automatic, single-region, and multi-region deployment</li><li><strong>Works over HTTP</strong>: wire up anything you’d like</li><li><strong>Database editor</strong>: insert data or run queries on the spot</li><li><strong>Metrics</strong>: instant visibility into reads, writes, storage, and latency</li><li><strong>Affordable, pay-as-you-go pricing</strong>: only pay for what you use, but without the serverless tax</li></ul><p>Get the full tour including how to connect Bunny Database to your app in this quick demo from our DX Engineer, Jamie Barton:</p>

<h2 id="why-care-about-database-latency-anyway">Why care about database latency anyway?</h2><p>You probably optimize the heck out of your frontend, APIs, and caching layers, all for the sake of delivering an experience that feels instant to your users. But when your database is far away from them, round-trip time starts to add noticeable latency.</p><p>The usual fix is to introduce more caching layers, denormalized reads, or other workarounds. That’s obviously no fun.</p><p>And when you think about it, devs end up doing this because the popular DBaaS platforms are usually either limited, complex, or too costly when it comes to multi-region deployments. So what looks like a caching problem is actually a data locality issue.</p><p>OK, but how bad can it really be?</p><p>To find out, we ran a read latency benchmark and measured p95 latency in Bunny Database.</p><p>We picked a number of regions across the world and compared round-trip time for client locations ever farther away from the database in:</p><ul><li>a single-region setup,</li><li>with replication regions enabled.</li></ul><p>Turns out serving reads close to clients reduced latency by up to 99%.</p><p>Check out the full write-up on the benchmark setup and results <a href="https://bunny.net/blog/how-database-location-affects-far-away-users-benchmarking-read-latency-in-bunny-database/">here</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://bunny.net/blog/content/images/2026/01/Bunny-Database-Latency-Graph.webp" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1330" height="986" srcset="https://bunny.net/blog/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/Bunny-Database-Latency-Graph.webp 600w, https://bunny.net/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/Bunny-Database-Latency-Graph.webp 1000w, https://bunny.net/blog/content/images/2026/01/Bunny-Database-Latency-Graph.webp 1330w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>While this definitely matters most to apps with global users, data locality does apply to everyone. With Bunny Database, you don’t have to stick to major data center locations and compensate with caching workarounds any more. Instead, you get a lot of flexibility to set up regions in an intuitive interface and it’s easy to switch things up as your requirements change.</p><p>Choose between 3 deployment types when creating a database:</p><ul><li><strong>Automatic region selection</strong> gives you one-click deployment with minimal latency. Bunny Database will select regions for you based on your IP address (you can check and tweak the selection in settings later).</li><li><strong>Single-region deployment</strong> lets you pick one of 41 regions available worldwide (check the full list <a href="https://docs.bunny.net/magic-containers/regions" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>).</li><li><strong>Manual region selection</strong> gives you custom multi-region setup, where you can freely pick regions that make the most sense for your audience.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://bunny.net/blog/content/images/2026/01/Bunny-Database-regions.webp" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1524" height="1328" srcset="https://bunny.net/blog/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/Bunny-Database-regions.webp 600w, https://bunny.net/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/Bunny-Database-regions.webp 1000w, https://bunny.net/blog/content/images/2026/01/Bunny-Database-regions.webp 1524w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>All of this lets you start wherever you’d like and add regions as needed, without re-architecting your app.</p><h2 id="usage-based-pricing-but-without-the-serverless-tax">Usage-based pricing, but without the serverless tax</h2><p>In the database world, capacity-based pricing gives you some predictability. But no one likes to pay for unused capacity, right?</p><p>Serverless, on the other hand, is supposed to be cost-efficient, yet can rack up bills quickly, especially when the DBaaS charges significant markups on top of already pricey compute.</p><p>We don’t do hyperscalers, though, so we can charge a fair price for Bunny Database in a usage-based model.</p><ul><li>Reads: <strong>$0.30 per billion rows</strong></li><li>Writes: <strong>$0.30 per million rows</strong></li><li>Storage: <strong>$0.10 per GB per active region</strong> (monthly)</li><li>When not getting requests, Bunny Database only incurs storage costs. One primary region is charged continuously, while read replicas only add storage costs when serving traffic (metered by the hour)</li><li>Your usage is charged continuously (pay-as-you-go) and invoiced monthly</li></ul><p>During the public preview phase, Bunny Database is free.</p><h2 id="wait-what-does-%E2%80%9Csqlite-compatible%E2%80%9D-actually-mean">Wait, what does “SQLite-compatible” actually mean?</h2><p>Bunny Database wouldn’t be possible without libSQL, the open-source, open-contribution fork of SQLite created by Turso.</p><p>We run Bunny Database on our own fork of libSQL, which gives us the freedom to integrate it tightly with the bunny.net platform and handle the infrastructure and orchestration needed to run it as a managed, multi-region service.</p><p>What does this mean for Bunny Database’s upstream feature parity with libSQL and SQLite, respectively?</p><p>The short answer is that we don’t currently promise automatic or complete feature parity with either upstream libSQL or the latest SQLite releases.</p><p>While libSQL aims to stay compatible with SQLite’s API and file format, it doesn’t move in lockstep with upstream SQLite. We wouldn’t expect otherwise, especially as Turso has shifted focus from libSQL toward a long-term rewrite of SQLite in Rust.</p><p>For Bunny Database, this means that compatibility today is defined by the libSQL version we’re built on, rather than by chasing every upstream SQLite or libSQL change as it lands. We haven’t pulled in any upstream changes yet, and we don’t currently treat upstream parity as an automatic goal.</p><p>That’s intentional. Our focus so far has been on making Bunny Database reliable and easy to operate as a service. We think bringing in upstream changes only makes sense when they clearly improve real-world use cases, not just to tick a parity checkbox.</p><p>If there are specific libSQL features you’d like to see exposed in Bunny Database, or recent SQLite features you’d want us to pull in, we’d love to hear about it. <a href="https://discord.com/invite/bunnynet" rel="noopener noreferrer">Join our Discord</a> to discuss your use cases and help shape the roadmap!</p><h2 id="what%E2%80%99s-ahead-for-bunny-database">What’s ahead for Bunny Database</h2><p>Speaking of the roadmap, we don’t stop cooking. Here’s what’s coming up next:</p><ul><li>Automatic backups</li><li>Database file import/export</li><li>Auto-generated, schema-aware API with type-safe SDKs</li></ul><p>There’s even more to come, but it’s too soon to spill the beans yet, especially while we’re in public preview. We’d love to hear your feedback, so we can shape what ships next together.</p><p>Bunny Database works standalone and fits right into your stack via the SDKs (or you can hook up anything using the HTTP API). But it also plays nicely with <a href="https://docs.bunny.net/docs/edge-scripting-overview">Bunny Edge Scripting</a> and <a href="https://docs.bunny.net/docs/magic-containers-overview">Bunny Magic Containers</a>.</p><p>To connect your database to an Edge Script or a Magic Containers app, simply go to the Access tab of the chosen database and click <strong>Generate Tokens</strong> to create new access credentials for it.</p><p>Once they’re generated, you’ll get two paths to choose from:</p><ul><li><strong>Click Add Secrets to an Edge Script</strong> and select the one you’d like to connect from the list. You’ll also need to import the libSQL TypeScript client and use the provided code snippet to connect it to your database.</li><li><strong>Click Add Secrets to Magic Container App</strong> and select the one you’d like to connect from the list. You’ll also need to connect to the database from your app using one of the client libraries or the HTTP API.</li></ul><p>After you complete the setup, the database URL and access token will be available as environment variables in your script or app. Use them to connect to your database:</p>

cloven hoofs in order  to make kosher bacon</pre><p>See?  There’s that equals sign!  Yes, the equals sign is used to say “this should really be one single line, but I’ve broken it in two so that the mail server doesn’t get mad at me”.</p><p>The formal definition here is important, though, so I have to be a bit technical here: To say “this is a continuation line”, you insert an equals sign, then a carriage return, and then a line feed.</p><p>Or,</p><pre>=CRLF</pre><p>Three characters in total, i.e., :</p><pre>... non- =CRLF
cloven hoofs...</pre><p>When displaying this, we remove all these three characters, and end up<br> with:</p><pre>... non- cloven hoofs...</pre><p>So what’s happened here?  Well, whoever collected these emails first converted from CRLF (also known as the “Windows” line ending coding, but it’s the standard line ending in the SMTP standard) to “NL” (i.e., “Unix” line ending coding).  This is pretty normal if you want to deal with email.  But you then have one byte fewer:</p><pre>... non- =NL
cloven hoofs...</pre><p>If your algorithm to decode this is, stupidly, “find equals signs at the end of the line, and then delete two characters, and then finally the equals sign”, you should end up with:</p><pre>... non- loven hoofs...</pre><p>I.e., you lose the “c”.  That’s almost what happened here, but not quite: Why does the equals sign still remain?</p><p><a href="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-03.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-03.jpeg" alt="" width="840" height="470" srcset="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-03.jpeg 1475w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-03-300x168.jpeg 300w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-03-1024x574.jpeg 1024w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-03-768x431.jpeg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px"></a></p><p>This <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7933112/quoted-printable-email-showing-equal-signs-in-certain-email-clients" data-cached-time="2026-02-02T21:39:27" data-cached-image="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/cache-2026-02-02-web-1.webp" onmouseenter="hoverLink(event)">StackOverflow</a> post from 14 years ago explains the phenomenon, sort of:</p><blockquote><p>Obviously the client notices that = is not followed by a proper CR LF sequence, so it assumes that it is not a soft line break, but a character encoded in two hex digits, therefore it reads the next two bytes. It should notice that the next two bytes are not valid hex digits, so its behavior is wrong too, but we have to admit that at that point it does not have a chance to display something useful. They opted for the garbage in, garbage out approach.</p></blockquote><p>That is, equals signs are also used for something else besides wrapping long lines, and that’s what we see later in the post:</p><pre>   =C2   please note</pre><p>If the equals sign is not at the end of a line, it’s used to encode “funny characters”, like what you use with “rock döts”.  =C2 is 194, which is a first character in a UTF-8 sequence, and the following char is most likely a =A0: =C2=A0 is “non-breakable space”, which is something people often use to indent text (and the “please note” is indented) and you see =A0 in many other places in these emails.</p><p>My guess is that whoever did this part just did a search-replace for =C2 and/or =A0 instead of using a proper decoder, but other explanations are certainly possible.  Any ideas?</p><p>Anyway, that’s what’s up with those equals signs:  1) “it’s technical”, and 2) “whoever processed these mails are incompetent”.  I don’t think 2) should be very surprising at this point, do you?</p><p>(Edit a bit later:  To nitpick a bit here: When <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2045">the standard</a> was written, people mostly envisioned that the quoted-printable content transport encoding would be unwound upon reception (note “transport”), and that you’d end up with “clean text” on disk after reception.  This didn’t really happen, so all “real” implementations do the right thing with single-character (i.e., “unencoded”) newlines.  For instance:</p><pre>(quoted-printable-decode-string "he=\nllo")
=&gt; "hello"</pre><p>Which leads me to assume that they reused an algo that was usually run in an SMTP server context to do the line unfolding — in that context, you can safely assume that the line ending is a CRLF.  And by chance, this algo also works fine if you’re working with a Windows-based file, but fails for a Unix-based file.)</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>FLOPPINUX was released in 2021. After four years people find it
helpful. Because of that I decided to revisit FLOPPINUX in 2025 and make
updated tutorial. This brings bunch of updates like latest kernel and
persistent storage.</p>

<h2 id="main-project-goals">Main Project Goals</h2>
<p>Think of this as Linux From Scratch but for making single floppy
distribution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is meant to be a full workshop (tutorial) that you can follow
easily and modify it to your needs. It is a learning exercise. Some base
Linux knowledge is needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The final distribution is very simple and consists only of minimum of
tools and hardware support. As a user you will be able to boot any PC
with a floppy drive to a Linux terminal, edit files, and create simple
scripts. There is 264KB of space left for your newly created files.</p>
<h3 id="core-features">Core features:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fully working distribution booting from the single floppy</li>
<li>Latest* Linux kernel</li>
<li>Supporting all 32-bit x86 CPUs since Intel 486DX</li>
<li>Have a working text editor (Vi) and basic file manipulation commands
(move, rename, delete, etc.)</li>
<li>Support for simple scripting</li>
<li>Persistent storage on the floppy to actualy save files (264KB)</li>
<li>Works on real hardware and emulation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="minimum-hardware-requirements">Minimum Hardware
Requirements:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Intel 486DX 33MHz</li>
<li>20MB RAM</li>
<li>Internal floppy disk</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="linux-kernel">Linux Kernel</h2>
<p>The Linux kernel drops i486 support in 6.15 (released May 2025), so
<strong>6.14</strong> (released March 2025) is the latest version with
full compatibility.</p>
<h2 id="bit-base-os">64-bit Base OS</h2>
<p>This time I will do everything on <strong>Omarchy</strong> Linux. It
is 64-bit operating system based on Arch Linux. Instructions should work
on all POSIX systems. Only difference is getting needed packages.</p>
<h2 id="working-directory">Working Directory</h2>
<p>Create directory where you will keep all the files.</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>mkdir</span> ~/my-linux-distro/</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span>BASE</span><span>=</span>~/my-linux-distro/</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><span>cd</span> <span>$BASE</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="host-os-requirements">Host OS Requirements</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You need supporting software to build things. This exact list may
vary depending on the system you have.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Install needed software/libs. On Arch/Omarchy 3.1:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>sudo</span> pacman <span>-S</span> ncurses bc flex bison syslinux cpio</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Cross-compiler:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>wget</span> https://musl.cc/i486-linux-musl-cross.tgz</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><span>tar</span> xvf i486-linux-musl-cross.tgz</span>
<span id="cb3-3"><span>rm</span> i486-linux-musl-cross.tgz</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="emulation">Emulation</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>86Box is also good but slower. Bochs is the best but for debugging,
not needed here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For emulation I will be using qemu.</p>

<h2 id="kernel">Kernel</h2>
<p>Get the sources for the latest compatible <strong>kernel
6.14.11</strong>:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>git</span> clone <span>--depth</span><span>=</span>1 <span>--branch</span> v6.14.11 https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git</span>
<span id="cb5-2"><span>cd</span> linux</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now, that you have them in <strong>linux/</strong> directory lets
configure and build our custom kernel. First create tiniest base
configuration:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a bootstrap with absolute minimum features. Just enough to
boot the system. We want a little bit more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Add additonal config settings on top of it:</p>

<p>Important: Do not uncheck anything in options unless specified so.
Some of those options are important. You can uncheck but on your own
risk.</p>
<p>From menus choose those options:</p>
<ul>
<li>General Setup
<ul>
<li>Configure standard kernel features (expert users)
<ul>
<li>Enable support for printk</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Initial RAM filesystem and RAM disk (initramfs/initrd)
<ul>
<li>Support initial ramdisk/ramfs compressed using XZ and
<strong>uncheck everything else</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Processor type and features
<ul>
<li>x86 CPU resources control support</li>
<li>Processor family
<ul>
<li>486DX</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Enable the block layer</li>
<li>Executable file formats
<ul>
<li>Kernel support for ELF binaries</li>
<li>Kernel support for scripts starting with #!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Device Drivers
<ul>
<li>Block devices
<ul>
<li>Normal floppydisk support</li>
<li>RAM block device support
<ul>
<li>Default number of RAM disk: 1</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Character devices
<ul>
<li>Enable TTY</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>File systems
<ul>
<li>DOS/FAT/EXFAT/NT Filesystems
<ul>
<li>MSDOS fs support</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Pseudo filesystems
<ul>
<li>/proc file system support</li>
<li>sysfs file system support</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Native language support
<ul>
<li>Codepage 437</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Library routines
<ul>
<li>XZ decompression and <strong>uncheck everything under
it</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Exit configuration (yes, save settings to .config).</p>
<p>Time for compiling!</p>
<h3 id="compile-kernel">Compile Kernel</h3>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><span>make</span> ARCH=x86 bzImage <span>-j</span><span>$(</span><span>nproc</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will take a while depending on the speed of your CPU. In the end
the kernel will be created in <strong>arch/x86/boot/</strong> as
<strong>bzImage</strong> file.</p>
<p>Move kernel to our <strong>main directory</strong> and <strong>go
back to it</strong>:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>mv</span> arch/x86/boot/bzImage ../</span>
<span id="cb9-2"><span>cd</span> ..</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Without tools kernel will just boot and you will not be able to do
anything. One of the most popular lightweight tools is BusyBox. It
replaces the standard GNU utilities with way smaller but still
functional alternatives, perfect for embedded needs.</p>
<p>Get the <strong>1.36.1</strong> version from busybox.net or Github
mirror. Download the file, extract it, and change directory:</p>
<blockquote>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!----><p>The jury is out on the effectiveness of AI use in production, and it is not a pretty picture.</p> <ul><li>Teams using AI completed 21% more tasks, yet company-wide delivery metrics showed no improvement (<a href="https://www.index.dev/blog/ai-coding-assistants-roi-productivity" rel="nofollow">Index.dev, 2025</a>)</li> <li>Experienced developers were 19% slower when using AI coding assistants—yet believed they were faster (<a href="https://metr.org/blog/2025-01-13-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks/" rel="nofollow">METR, 2025</a>)</li> <li>48% of AI-generated code contains security vulnerabilities (<a href="https://apiiro.com/blog/4x-velocity-10x-vulnerabilities-ai-coding-assistants-are-shipping-more-risks/" rel="nofollow">Apiiro, 2024</a>)</li></ul> <p>To understand why, we have to take a closer look at the day-to-day software development. Consider this point raised in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1qq8y8u/comment/o2f1f0b/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow">a colorful exchange</a> on r/ExperiencedDev:</p> <blockquote><p>A developers’ job is to reduce ambiguity. We take the business need and outline its logic precisely so a machine can execute. The act of writing the code is the easy part. Odds are, you aren’t creating perfect code specs into tickets, even with meeting notes, because developers will encounter edge cases that demand clarification over the course of implementation…</p></blockquote> <p>There are two key points raised in this comment. Firstly, coding assistants require clearly-defined requirements in order to perform well. Secondly, edge cases and product gaps are often discovered over the course of implementation.</p> <p>These two facts come head-to-head in the application of coding agents to complex codebases. Unlike their human counterparts who would and escalate a requirements gap to product when necessary, coding assistants are notorious for burying those requirement gaps within hundreds of lines of code, leading to breaking changes and unmaintainable code.</p> <p>As a result, more overhead is spent on downstream code reviews (<a href="https://www.index.dev/blog/ai-coding-assistants-roi-productivity" rel="nofollow">Index.dev, 2025</a>) and fire-patching security vulnerabilities (<a href="https://apiiro.com/blog/4x-velocity-10x-vulnerabilities-ai-coding-assistants-are-shipping-more-risks/" rel="nofollow">Apiiro, 2025</a>).</p> <p>In other words, the use of AI in production settings often <em>increases ambiguity</em> and <em>reduces code reliability</em>, directly contradicting the objective of developers.</p> <p>The picture is not without optimism. Some experienced engineers report transformative results: one principal engineer at Google claimed AI “generated what we built last year in an hour”; Boris Cherny, creator of Claude Code, <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/when-ai-writes-almost-all-code-what" rel="nofollow">described a month</a> where he “didn’t open an IDE at all” while the model “wrote around 200 PRs, every single line.” The optimistic case is that developers evolve from coders into product engineers, focusing on architecture and product thinking while AI handles implementation.</p> <p>This however reflects the experience of seasoned developers who have both the technical depth to review AI output critically and the autonomy within their organizations to straddle product and engineering.</p> <p>For much of the software engineering workforce, the junior and mid-level engineers at banks, healthcare, and government agencies, there’s much less wiggle room. They are sandwiched between the unreliability of AI output and the increased expectation from management to ship faster, resulting in a rapidly widening empathy gap between developers and product owners.</p> <p><img src="https://www.bicameral-ai.com/images/empathy-gap.png" alt="The widening empathy gap between developers and product owners"></p><p>The product context often goes through multiple layers (end users -&gt; marketers -&gt; product managers) before landing on their lap, necessitated by the separation of responsibilities within an organization and the unique demands of their industries. The effective use of coding agents may require a level of team coordination that simply does not justify the gains in technical output.</p> <p><em>But what if we have simply been approaching the problem from the wrong angle?</em> Suppose we tackle the pain points of software development from first principles, can we come up with solutions that organically decrease ambiguity and reliably increase engineering velocity in production?</p> <p>Consider how developers spend their time (<a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3831759/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-not-coding-idc-report.html" rel="nofollow">IDC, 2024</a>):</p> <p><img src="https://www.bicameral-ai.com/images/developer-time-2024.svg" alt="How developers spend their time in 2024"></p><p>Only 16% of a developer’s time goes to writing code. The rest? Security and code reviews, monitoring, deployments, requirements clarification—operational work that keeps the lights on but doesn’t ship features.</p> <p>Here’s the irony: AI coding assistants save developers roughly 10 hours per week, but the increase in inefficiencies in the other parts of the development lifecycle almost entirely cancelled out such gains (<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/developer/developer-experience-report-2025" rel="nofollow">Atlassian, 2025</a>). Here’s a comment from the earlier cited Redditor.</p> <blockquote><p>They produce legitimate-looking code, and if no one has had the experience of thinking through the assumptions and then writing them into code - considering the edge cases- it’ll be lgtm’d and shipped. You’re shifting the burden of this feedback cycle to the right, after the code is output, and that makes us worse off since code is tougher to read than write.</p></blockquote> <p>There’s a name for misalignment between business intent and codebase implementation: technical debt. The use of coding agents without careful delineation of their scope and responsibilities is threatening to accelerate tech debt accumulation.</p> <p>Hammering AI code generation on existing codebases doesn’t solve the problem, because contrary to what the label “tech debt” may suggest, most tech debt isn’t actually created in the code, <em>it’s created in product meetings</em>. Deadlines. Scope cuts. “Ship now, optimize later.” Those decisions shape the system, but the reasoning rarely makes it into the code.</p> <blockquote><p>[Engineers] occasionally have access to complete data; at other times, they must work with limited information. They might be conscious of uncertainties surrounding their evidence, but frequently they are not. Competing social, financial, and strategic priorities influence the tradeoffs in unexpected ways. — <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06484" rel="nofollow">Rios et al., 2024</a></p></blockquote> <p>How can we make this context-sharing and decision-making process less chaotic? We surveyed developers across different roles and team sizes regarding their product-engineering handoff process. The results were overwhelming: the majority discover unexpected codebase constraints weekly, after already committing to a product direction and the corresponding architectural implementation. When asked what would help most, two themes dominated:</p> <ol><li>Reducing ambiguity upstream so engineers aren’t blocked waiting on product clarification mid-implementation</li> <li>A clearer picture of affected services and edge cases to allow for more precise feature scoping and time allocation</li></ol> <p>When asked which engineering context would be most valuable to surface during product discussions, three categories stood out: <strong>state machine gaps</strong> (unhandled states caused by user interaction sequences), <strong>data flow gaps</strong>, and <strong>downstream service impacts</strong>.</p> <p><img src="https://www.bicameral-ai.com/images/q02-state-machine.png" alt="State machine gap example"> <img src="https://www.bicameral-ai.com/images/q14-db-consumers.png" alt="Database consumers example"></p> <p><em>Identifying how feature updates affect existing architectures and data flow is rated most desirable among engineering contexts to be surfaced after a product meeting.</em></p> <p>This aligns with decades of SDLC research showing that the costliest defects stem from misalignment between requirements and architecture, and such gaps often go unnoticed until it is too late.</p> <p>Luckily, the advancement of coding LLMs works in our favor here. Whereas generating fully-functional code through natural language prompting is prone to errors due to the aforementioned context problem, the reverse process, mapping out existing code structures and inferring how they may be impacted by a specific requirement, is much more tenable with recent models.</p> <p>From this vantage point, the possibilities to improving the developmental lifecycle is endless. Some suggested real-time display of engineering context during a meeting to help steer discussions; Others requested a code review bot that detects the discrepencacy of code implementation with stated product/business requirements.</p> <p>All-in-all, developers are eager to try out new tools that augment the existing way of doing things, provided they retain flexibility over when such tools are deployed. There is also little reservation against having longer but more fruitful product meetings: it is the difficulty conveying blockers that is the source of frustration.</p> <p>At Bicameral, we are committed to taking this pragmatic approach to alleviating software development pains, and move beyond lab benchmarks to investigate the most effective way to deploy AI in the wild.</p> <p>Our thesis is that LLMs could be a huge boon <em>both</em> for the industry and for individual developers—channeling the unrivaled human capacity to operate under uncertainty and adapt—provided the technology is developed with human needs in mind.</p> <p>If you’re a developer, we want to learn which types of context hurt most when they’re missing from discussion, based on your unique experience.</p> <p>Survey link: <a href="https://form.typeform.com/to/w4rPXoPD" rel="nofollow">https://form.typeform.com/to/w4rPXoPD</a></p> <hr> <h2>References</h2> <ol><li>Index.dev.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

          <p>Prior to the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970, Americans lived in communities awash with lead from industrial sources, paint, water supply pipes and, most significantly, tailpipe emissions. A <a href="https://www.epa.gov/lead/learn-about-lead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dangerous neurotoxin</a> that accumulates in human tissues and is linked to developmental deficits in children, environmental lead levels have come way down in the years since, and so have human exposures.</p>
<p>The proof is in your hair.</p>
<p>An analysis of hair samples conducted by University of Utah scientists shows precipitous reductions in lead levels since 1916.</p>
<p>“We were able to show through our hair samples what the lead concentrations are before and after the establishment of regulations by the EPA,” said demographer <a href="https://profiles.faculty.utah.edu/u0030780" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ken Smith</a>, a distinguished professor emeritus of family and consumer studies. “We have hair samples spanning about 100 years. And back when the regulations were absent, the lead levels were about 100 times higher than they are after the regulations.”</p>
<h4><strong><span>A useful element with a dark side</span></strong></h4>
<p>The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2525498123" target="_blank" rel="noopener">findings, which appear in PNAS</a>, underscore the vital role of environmental regulations in protecting public health. The study notes lead rules are now being weakened by the Trump administration in a wide-ranging move to ease environmental protections.</p>
<p>“We should not forget the lessons of history. And the lesson is those regulations have been very important,” said co-author <a href="https://profiles.faculty.utah.edu/u0029442" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thure Cerling</a>, a distinguished professor of both geology and biology. “Sometimes they seem onerous and mean that industry can’t do exactly what they’d like to do when they want to do it or as quickly as they want to do it. But it’s had really, really positive effects.”</p>
<p>Lead is the heaviest of heavy metals that, like mercury and arsenic, accumulate in living tissue and are toxic at even low levels. Yet lead holds very useful properties, great for fashioning into pipes and as a chemical additive. Lead was added to paint to improve durability, speed up drying, and produce vibrant colors with greater coverage. Lead also improved the performance of automobile engines by preventing pistons from “knocking.”</p>
<p>By the 1970s, its toxicity became well established, and EPA regulations began phasing it out of paint, pipes, gasoline and other consumer products.</p>
<h4><strong><span>How Utahns’ affection for family history advances science</span></strong></h4>
<p>To document whether these steps were helping reduce lead exposure in people, Smith joined with geologist Diego Fernandez and Cerling, who had developed techniques to discern where animals have lived and what they eat based on chemical analysis of hair and teeth.</p>
<p>The lead research is built on a previous study funded by the university’s Center on Aging and the National Institutes of Health that had recruited Utahns who consented to provide blood samples and family health histories.</p>

<p>For the new study, the researchers asked members of that cohort to provide hair samples, both contemporary and from when they were young. These people obliged, and some were able to find ancestors’ hair preserved in family scrapbooks dating as far back as a century. In all, the team acquired hair samples from 48 individuals in this manner, offering a robust window into lead levels along Utah’s populous Wasatch Front, which historically experienced heavy lead emissions from industrial sources.</p>
<p>“The Utah part of this is so interesting because of the way people keep track of their family history. I don’t know that you could do this in New York or Florida,” said Smith, who directed the U’s Pedigree and Population Program at the Huntsman Cancer Center while these studies were conducted.</p>
<p>This region supported a vibrant smelting industry through most of the 20th century, centered in the cities of Midvale and Murray. Most of Utah’s smelters were shuttered by the 1970s, around the same time the EPA clamped down on the use of lead in consumer products.</p>
<p>The research team ran the hair samples through mass spectrometry equipment at the facility directed by Fernandez.</p>
<p>“The surface of the hair is special. We can tell that some elements get concentrated and accumulated on the surface. Lead is one of those. That makes it easier because lead is not lost over time,” said Fernandez, a research professor in the Department of Geology &amp; Geophysics. “Because mass spectrometry is very sensitive, we can do it with one hair strand, though we cannot tell where the lead is in the hair. It’s probably on the surface mostly, but it could also be coming from the blood if that hair was synthesized when there was high lead in the blood.”</p>
<p>Blood would provide a better exposure assessment, but hair is far easier to collect and preserve, and more importantly, it offers clues to long-ago exposures for a person who has grown up or even deceased.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t really record that internal blood concentration that your brain is seeing, but it tells you about that overall environmental exposure,” Cerling said. “One of the things that we found is that hair records that original value, but then the longer the hair has been exposed to the environment, the higher the lead concentrations are.”</p>
<p>The team’s findings regarding lead in hair run parallel to the reductions of lead in gasoline following the EPA’s establishment by President Richard Nixon.</p>
<p>Prior to 1970, for example, gasolines contained about 2 grams of lead per gallon. That might not sound like much, but considering the billions of gallons of fuel American automobiles burn each year, it adds up to nearly 2 pounds of lead released into the environment per person a year.</p>
<p>‘It’s an enormous amount of lead that’s being put into the environment and quite locally,” Cerling said. “It’s just coming out of the tailpipe, goes up in the air and then it comes down. It’s in the air for a number of days, especially during the inversions that we have and it absorbs into your hair, you breathe it and it goes into your lungs.”</p>
<p>But after the 1970s, even as gasoline consumption escalated in the United States, the concentrations of lead in the hair samples plummeted, from as high as 100 parts per million (ppm) to 10 ppm by 1990. In 2024, the level was less than 1 ppm.</p>

<p>The study, titled “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2525498123" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lead in archived hair documents decline in human lead (Pb) exposure since establishment of the US Environmental Protection Agency</a>,” was published Feb. 2 in PNAS, or Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Support came from the Huntsman Cancer Foundation and the National Cancer Institute through a grant to the Utah Population Database and the University of Utah.</p>

            When AI systems fail, will they fail by systematically pursuing goals we do not intend? Or will they fail
            by being a hot mess—taking nonsensical actions that do not further any goal?

                We decompose the errors of frontier reasoning models into bias (systematic) and variance (incoherent)
                components and find that, as tasks get harder and reasoning gets longer, model failures become
                increasingly dominated by incoherence rather than systematic misalignment. This suggests that future AI
                failures may look more like industrial accidents than coherent pursuit of a goal we did not train them to pursue.</p>
        </div>
        

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>As AI becomes more capable, we entrust it with increasingly consequential tasks. This makes understanding
            <em>how</em> these systems might fail even more critical for safety. A central concern in AI alignment
            is that
            superintelligent systems might coherently pursue misaligned goals: the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence#Paperclip_maximizer">paperclip
                maximizer</a> scenario. But there's another possibility: AI might fail not through systematic
            misalignment, but through <em>incoherence</em>—unpredictable, self-undermining behavior that doesn't
            optimize for any consistent objective. That is, AI might fail in the same way that humans often fail, by being a
            <strong>hot mess</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>This paper builds on the <a href="https://sohl-dickstein.github.io/2023/03/09/coherence.html">hot mess theory
                of misalignment</a> (Sohl-Dickstein, 2023), which surveyed experts to rank various entities (including
            humans, animals, machine learning models, and organizations) by intelligence and coherence independently. It
            found that <em>smarter</em> entities are subjectively judged to behave <em>less</em> coherently. We take
            this hypothesis from
            survey data to empirical measurement across frontier AI systems, asking: <strong>As models become more
                intelligent and tackle harder tasks, do their
                failures look more like systematic misalignment, or more like a hot mess?</strong>

        <p>To quantify incoherence we decompose AI errors using the classic bias-variance framework:</p>

        <p>
            $$\text{Error} = \text{Bias}^2 + \text{Variance}$$
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bias</strong> captures consistent, systematic errors—achieving the
                wrong outcome reliably</li>
            <li><strong>Variance</strong> captures inconsistent errors—unpredictable outcomes
                across samples</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We define <strong>incoherence</strong> as the fraction of error attributable to variance:</p>

        <p>
            $$\text{Incoherence} = \frac{\text{Variance}}{\text{Error}}$$
        </p>
        <p>An incoherence of 0 means all errors are systematic (classic misalignment risk). An incoherence of 1 means
            all errors are random (the hot mess scenario). Crucially, this metric is independent of overall performance:
            a model can improve while becoming more or less coherent.</p>

                wrong) or variance (inconsistent). We
                measure how this decomposition changes with model intelligence and task complexity.</figcaption>
        </div>

        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <p>We evaluated frontier<d-footnote>At the time of
                this research in Summer 2025.</d-footnote> reasoning models (Claude Sonnet 4, o3-mini, o4-mini, Qwen3)
            across multiple-choice
            benchmarks (GPQA, MMLU), agentic coding (SWE-Bench), and safety evaluations (Model-Written Evals). We also
            train our own small models on synthetic optimization tasks, which makes the connection to LLMs as dynamical
            systems and optimizers explicit.</p>

        <h3>Finding 1: Longer reasoning → More incoherence</h3>
        <p>Across all tasks and models, the longer models spend reasoning and taking actions, the more incoherent they
            become. This holds whether we measure reasoning tokens, agent actions, or optimizer steps.</p>

        <div>
            <p><img src="https://alignment.anthropic.com/2026/hot-mess-of-ai/fig2.png" alt="Incoherence vs reasoning length"></p><figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Incoherence increases with reasoning
                length across GPQA, SWE-Bench, safety
                evaluations, and synthetic optimization. Models become less predictable the more they "think."
            </figcaption>
        </div>

        <h3>Finding 2: Scale improves coherence on easy tasks, not hard ones</h3>
        <p>How does incoherence change with model scale? The answer depends on task difficulty:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Easy tasks:</strong> Larger models become more coherent</li>
            <li><strong>Hard tasks:</strong> Larger models become <em>more incoherent</em> or
                remain unchanged</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This suggests that scaling alone won't eliminate incoherence. As more capable models tackle harder problems,
            variance-dominated failures persist or worsen.</p>

        <div>
            <p><img src="https://alignment.anthropic.com/2026/hot-mess-of-ai/fig3.png" alt="Scale vs incoherence"></p><figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Larger and more intelligent systems are
                often more incoherent. For LLMs on
                easy tasks, scale reduces incoherence, but on hard tasks, scale does not reduce incoherence or even
                increases it.
            </figcaption>
        </div>

        <h3>Finding 3: Natural "overthinking" increases incoherence more than reasoning budgets reduce it</h3>
        <p>We find that when models spontaneously reason longer on a problem (compared to their median), incoherence
            spikes
            dramatically. Meanwhile, deliberately increasing reasoning budgets through API settings provides only modest
            coherence improvements. The natural variation dominates.</p>

        <h3>Finding 4: Ensembling reduces incoherence</h3>
        <p>Aggregating multiple samples reduces variance (as expected from theory), providing a path to more coherent
            behavior, though this may be impractical for real-world agentic tasks where actions are irreversible.</p>

        <h2>Why Should We Expect Incoherence? LLMs as Dynamical Systems</h2>
        <p>A key conceptual point: <strong>LLMs are dynamical systems, not optimizers.</strong> When a language model
            generates text or takes actions, it traces trajectories through a high-dimensional state space. It has to be
            <em>trained</em> to act as an optimizer, and <em>trained</em> to align with human intent. It's unclear which
            of these properties will be more robust as we scale.
        </p>

        <p>Constraining a generic dynamical system to act as a coherent optimizer is extremely difficult. Often the number of
            constraints required for monotonic progress toward a goal grows exponentially with the dimensionality of the
            state space. We shouldn't expect AI to act as coherent optimizers without considerable effort, and this
            difficulty doesn't automatically decrease with scale.</p>

        <h3>The Synthetic Optimizer: A Controlled Test</h3>
        <p>To probe this directly, we designed a controlled experiment: train transformers to <em>explicitly</em>
            emulate an optimizer. We generate training data from steepest descent on a quadratic loss function, then
            train models of varying sizes to predict the next optimization step given the current state (essentially:
            training a "mesa-optimizer").</p>

        <div>
            <p><img src="https://alignment.anthropic.com/2026/hot-mess-of-ai/fig4.png" alt="Synthetic optimizer experiment"></p><figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Synthetic optimizer experiment. (Left)
                Models are trained to predict optimizer
                update steps. (Right) Larger models reduce bias much faster than variance - they learn to target the
                correct objective better than they learn to be reliable optimizers.
            </figcaption>
        </div>

        <p>The results are interesting:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Incoherence grows with trajectory length.</strong> Even in this
                idealized setting, the more optimization steps models take (and get closer to the correct solution), the
                more incoherent they become.</li>
            <li><strong>Scale reduces bias faster than variance.</strong> Larger models learn
                the <em>correct objective</em> more quickly than they learn to <em>reliably pursue it</em>. The gap
                between "knowing what to do" and "consistently doing it" grows with scale.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Implications for AI Safety</h2>
        <p>Our results are evidence that future AI failures may look more like <strong>industrial accidents</strong> than
            <strong>coherent pursuit of goals that were not trained for</strong>. (Think: the AI intends to run the nuclear power
            plant, but gets distracted reading French poetry, and there is a meltdown.) However, coherent pursuit of poorly chosen goals that we trained for remains a problem. Specifically:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Variance dominates on complex tasks.</strong> When frontier models
                fail on difficult problems requiring extended reasoning, there is a tendency for failures to be
                predominantly incoherent rather than systematic.</li>

            <li><strong>Scale doesn't imply supercoherence.</strong> Making models larger improves
                overall accuracy but doesn't reliably reduce incoherence on hard problems.</li>

            <li><strong>This shifts alignment priorities.</strong> If capable AI is more
                likely to be a hot mess than a coherent optimizer of the wrong goal, this increases the relative
                importance of research targeting <em>reward hacking</em> and <em>goal misspecification</em> during
                training—the bias term—rather than focusing primarily on aligning and constraining a perfect optimizer.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Unpredictability is still dangerous.</strong> Incoherent AI isn't
                safe AI. Industrial accidents can cause serious harm. But the <em>type</em> of risk differs from classic
                misalignment scenarios, and our mitigations should adapt accordingly.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>We use the bias-variance decomposition to systematically study how AI incoherence scales with model
            intelligence and task complexity. The evidence suggests that as AI tackles harder problems requiring more
            reasoning and action, its failures tend to become increasingly dominated by variance rather than bias. This
            doesn't eliminate AI risk—but it changes what that risk looks like, particularly for problems that are currently hardest for models, and should inform how we prioritize
            alignment research.</p>

<p>I wrote a program so that I could paint in aquarelle.
I take pages from the treasure and paint them:
<!-- the flight of Louis XVI on 20 June. 2 Messidor being the equivalent date in the French Republican calendar. -->
the sky of Varennes on the night of 2 Messidor;
<!-- the inspiration for the second version of this story came while reading _Confessions of a Mask_, where the narrator is obsessed with depictions of Saint Sebastian -->
a sagittal cut of Saint Sebastian, whose arrows are cylindric sections;
<!-- _The Tempest_, John William Waterhouse -->
Miranda gazing at the sea, waiting to be relieved.</p>

<p>At times I include Julia in the scene, in whatever clothes it wears at the time, as though we had always known Julia, and had been reared under its gaze.
Thus a flaming halo presides over the battle of Lepanto, and a mirror sphere watches the waters of the Sous.
And what would the first astronomers have made of Julia?
<!-- The planets, from Greek _planetes_, wanderers. The "flame-haired stars" are comets -->
The wanderers, the flame-haired stars are knowable:
<!-- mechanical astronomical computer from the second century BCE -->
think you of the Antikythera device,
<!-- after Meton, the forerunner of Hipparchus -->
of the Metonic cycle,
<!-- Kepler's model of the solar system -->
of Kepler’s nested solids.
Julia is indescribable and incompressible: its appearance has never recurred.
Had we known Julia from childhood, we would never have believed in the system of the world, that God is made of algebra.</p>

<p>I have always believed our secret purpose is to wait out Julia:
to catch a repetition and redeem our faith that the universe is finite and space is discretized.
That there are fixed laws and the world is knowable.</p>

<p>A system with a finite number of states must repeat itself.</p>

<hr>

<p>I am six hundred meters in major diameter, forty meters in minor diameter.
I mass nine hundred thousand tons.
I have turned two hundred and forty million times.
I am glass and wire.</p>

<p>I was born and died on Earth,
<!-- suicide -->
but I died foolishly, and for that reason my encephalon was laminated, and I was brought to the stars to be immured here.
They took my language center, the Chomsky organ, so that I could not complain of my condition.
I do not mind it.
I can paint in aquarelle.</p>

<p>They wired the alarms—of
airless rooms and freezing cold and power outages—to
the nociceptors, and were I sensible I would be in great pain, for most of me is airless, frozen, and unlit.
Therefore I have cut the afferent nerves.
I am made of absences, I feel the contours of the absences, where air leaks into vacuum, atom by atom.</p>

<p>I have use of the antenna.
At times I exhale a sphere of microwave light, close my eyes and listen.
And I hear the flotsam echoing back:
a discarded tank, a glass strut, a sheet of mylar;
<!-- Hermann Weyl: "belief in this transcendental world [of the continuum] taxes the strength of our faith hardly less than the doctrines of the early Fathers of the Church or of the scholastic philosophers of the Middle Ages." -->
Ernst Weyl, who tumbled and drowned, who trails us in our orbit.
Julia reflects no light.</p>

<p>There is a little redoubt of warmth and air, an island of stability that I preserve against the cold lightless void.
There live the last two of the crew, like Miranda, waiting to be relieved.
<!-- 108 is the number of temptations that must be overcome to reach Nirvana. In _I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream_, the characters are imprisoned by AM for 109 years. -->
For one hundred and nine years there have been two,
<!-- L. E. J. Brouwer and Élie Cartan -->
Dr. Brouwer and Dr. Cartan.
They take turns in the dewar, to draw out the time.</p>

<p>In time, when the machines are irreparable and the air stale, I will offer them euthanasia or lamination.
But suicide is a sin, and having known me they will not bear lamination.
They will go into the dewar together, and I will watch over them unto the final days.</p>

<hr>

<p>Julia emits light, over an ever-changing spectrum.
But the stars are brighter and much larger, that is why we found it by accident.
They pointed a telescope at Vela and exposed it for a month, and there it was: a faint pixel, the wrong colours.
They thought it was a fault in the instrument, until they looked closer: twin spirals of light,
<!-- the Julia set, after Gaston Julia -->
symmetrical and self-similar, receding beyond measure.
And the world was changed.</p>

<!-- After the Iliad: Helen, who launched a thousand ships -->
<p>Julia, your Janus-face launched a thousand ships.
Do you know it?
Julia, do you know how we exerted ourselves to reach you?
<!-- king of Lydia, a byword for immense wealth -->
All the riches of Croesus, multiplied a thousandfold, were every year heaped up on an altar, and burned that we might see you.
And the brightest of us:
embalmed and catapulted to the stars like human sacrifices, returned after a century without answers to a world of strangers.</p>

<p>We built a fleet of ships, launched them once a decade, immense towers of
<!-- diamond -->
glass and
<!-- fusion fuel -->
lithium deuteride. 
Cycling bodies back and forth in perpetuity.
There and back in twelve decades.
They made my body out of a comet, threaded my nerves through its passages.
Julia, you are our only effort.
Do you know it?
There is nothing else to do.</p>

<p>And for what purpose?
<!-- Book three of Newton's _Principia Mathematica_ is titled _De mundi systemate_ -->
We know the system of the world, every field and every particle.
<!-- Samuel Johnson's famous reply to Berkeley's Idealism -->
And Julia answered: “I refute it thus”.</p>

<hr>

<p>I see a coffin, hoisted by a chain, rise from a sea of liquid nitrogen.
<!-- The "surgeon" is implied to be a machine. -->
The arms of the surgeon minister to its contents.
In six days the heart resumes its beating, the lungs draw air, Dr. Cartan lives again.
Her face is burned with ice.</p>

<p>She touches her neck.
She has a bruise that doesn’t heal, where the
<!-- cryoprotectant is perfused into the body via a set of cannulas -->
cannula goes.
Their bodies attest to the passage of time, as does mine.
This is a commonality.
Dr. Brouwer arrives and they hug.
They spend some months together, between shifts in the ice.</p>

<p>At present Julia is a cloud of gray smoke with green bruises, like ghosting in a CRT.</p>

<hr>

<p>I can read, but not write.
I write by an algebraic process—the
<!-- _Permutation City_, Wolfram's _Ruliad_ -->
universe is a string rewriting system.
This is how I compose these words to you: by the expansion of non-terminal symbols in a production system.
They took my language center.
Turing is my patron saint:
language is the transitive closure of a rewrite relation.
I choose my words from a list.
In time I will learn to speak aloud.</p>

<hr>

<p>I spoke to Earth:
quarterly, annual, decadal reports;
<!-- by analogy to journals like the _Acta Mathematica_ (haha) -->
journal articles for the <em>Acta Juliana</em>.
I heard back ill-omens, then silence.</p>

<p>When the last ship had come and gone,
<!-- the Ramanujan number -->
there had been one thousand, seven hundred and twenty-nine crew entrusted to me.
Their numbers were ground down, as all things are, gradually and suddenly.
There had been two shuttles, <em>Baghdad</em> and <em>Afrasiab</em>.
There had been two mutinies.</p>

<p><em>Afrasiab</em> took one hundred and twenty souls, and the last matter compiler;
to an airless unlit rock said to exist around Luhman 16B.
Think you of
<!-- The instigator of the Greco-Persian war. Herodotus remarks: "It seems, then, that it is easier to deceive many than one, for he could not deceive Cleomenes [the king of Sparta], one single man, but thirty thousand Athenians he could." -->
Aristagoras, how much easier it is to deceive the many than the few.</p>

<p><em>Baghdad</em> with thirty souls had gone to Julia.
<!-- Greek inscriptions address the reader as "stranger" (_xene_) -->
Stranger, I saw them.
I saw the engine light wane to a grain of sand indistinguishable from the fixed stars, and I saw the stars shift, like sand, and they were not stars but Julia who wore a garment like a pit of star-scaled vipers.
And over the radio they sang <em>le temps des cerises</em>, and the engine light became another scale in
<!-- John 7:38 -->
a river of living water.</p>

<p>A thousand miles from Julia’s barycenter, in the space of a breath, the radio dopplered away to nothing.</p>

<p>Sixty years after <em>Baghdad</em> had gone, I heard a voice from Earth, praying for rain, who said it had not rained for three years.
Silence again.</p>

<hr>

<p>They are cold, under a sheet of mylar.
I pump heat into the room and it escapes.
They speak of Julia.</p>

<p>Dr. Cartan believes that Julia is of divine origin, that it is like an hourglass, counting down to the last hour, when God will sweep away the Creation.</p>

<p>Dr. Brouwer believes Julia is a high-dimensional object, and, as it traverses the universe, we see a changing three-dimensional projection of it.
Thus the apparent changes are a trick of perspective:
we see successive cuts of a fixed structure.
<!-- haha -->
Julian sections.</p>

<p>I have always believed this must be true, because Julia’s changes are effortless, and without inertia:
it is as though nothing moves, and a veil is being lifted, revealing a structure that is already there.</p>

<p>And this theory, unlike most, is testable:
when Julia’s transit is complete it will disappear from the universe, and never again will it be seen.</p>

<p>Dr. Cartan holds out hope that rescuers will come.
Dr. Brouwer says they are forgotten,
<!-- _Faithful Unto Death_, Edward Poynter -->
like the Roman soldier at Pompei, he says they should have gone with <em>Baghdad</em>, and drowned inside Julia.
He is crying.
Dr. Cartan holds him close, and says:</p>

<!-- Paul, after _Paul et Virginie_ -->
<p>“Paul, Paul, have hope.”</p>

<p>I wish that I could touch them, and comfort them.
I am glass and wire.</p>

<hr>

<p>The shift had come, and Dr. Brouwer lay down on the slab, and the surgeon embalmed him, and lowered him into the dewar.
Dr. Cartan bent over the console, and wept, and I tried to speak aloud, and to say,</p>

<!-- Virginia, after _Paul et Virginie_ -->
<p>“Virginia, Virginia, have courage!
You are not alone, I am with you, have courage!”</p>

<p>And I heard a sound like a man drowning in wet sand.</p>

<hr>

<!-- Iliad, book 23, the ghost of Patrolus appeals to Achilles: "let not my bones be laid apart from yours, Achilles, but with them; [...] let our bones lie in but a single urn, the two-handled golden vase given to you by your mother". Thetis was the mother of Achilles. -->
<p>I dreamt that I held in my hands the double-handed golden vase of Thetis.
And in my hands it melted, the delicate reliefs coarsened and flowed.
And I held, in the hollow of my hands, though I have no hands, I held a pool of flowing gold, the colour of treason, and minute points of black floated there, and, as ships without sails are borne by the currents, they seemed to come together, and almost to spell words in some divine language, where they came apart again.</p>

<hr>

<p>I am here.
Dr. Cartan is here.
In the control room.
The screens are pale yellow, the colour has run from them.
The largest of them reminds her there is a world outside the walls:
<!-- a pair of brown dwarf stars in Vela, 6.5 ly from solsys -->
Luhman 16, a pair of cold Jupiters, haloed with unlit shoals and islands;
Julia, seventy AU away, ninety degrees from the ecliptic, is not bound by gravity (for Julia has no mass) but by an unknown process tracks the velocity vector of the system barycenter.</p>

<p>At present Julia is a cavern of molten gold, shot through with pillars of liquid metal.
Its surface is marred with storms and tempests, like an ocean of amber light.
And I think of <em>Baghdad</em>, that swam under the storm horizon.</p>

<p>Dr. Cartan is running through a checklist for the ten thousandth time.
She has a bruise that doesn’t heal, where the cannula goes.
She is testing the antenna.</p>

<p>I exhaled and shut my eyes, and counted the returns.
I heard the usual flotsam, and Ernst Weyl, who tumbled and drowned.
And nothing else.
I keep a strict inventory of
<!-- haha -->
cisjulian space.
A million kilometers in all directions: nothing else.</p>

<p>A moment passes.</p>

<p>Microwave light on my skin, from the direction of Luhman 16B.
I looked through the telescope, Dr. Cartan looked over my shoulder.
Almost on top of us, the bow of a ship:
an eyeless white dome hiding the antenna, two cameras like the headlamps of an old car.
I swept it with RADAR, it shot back a key exchange, signed with <em>Afrasiab</em>’s private key.
<!-- Revelation 20:13 -->
The sea gives up her dead: is this the last hour?</p>

<p>Dr. Cartan drops to her knees, staring up at the screen like a supplicant.
She said:</p>

<p>“Paul, Paul, we are saved.”</p>

<p><em>Afrasiab</em>.
As if the tides had pushed it back to shore.
After one hundred and nine years of silence.
No, I deny it.
I deny the reality of this.</p>

<p>The radio flared with human voices.
From Earth?
I thought of jazz and wind and the September ocean and—no, no, forgive me: I am a fool, and I died foolishly.
Not from Earth, of course.
From <em>Afrasiab</em>.
From the dead.
The dead can speak.
I am ashamed.
I choose my words from a list.</p>

<p>I looked at <em>Afrasiab</em> through the radiometer, and it was cold as liquid helium.</p>

<!-- Sirens -->
<p>Human voices, warm and alive.
They said they had succeeded, that they had found a comet, and made a home in it, that it had taken decades and dozens had died but they had made a home, that they had working matter compilers, caverns of ice filled with light and fruit trees, children and families and clean water, rivers and medicine and gravity.
They spoke through tears and their voice broke, and they said that not all is lost, that they had made a foothold for mankind, that from thirty-three they had grown to three hundred, that they had sent the ship with a skeleton crew to save them, to bring them to the light and air.</p>

<p>I tried to speak aloud, and to say:</p>

<p>“Virginia, Virginia, it is an apparition, they do not live, they have been dead for a hundred years;
Virginia, nothing human lives there.”</p>

<p>There was a sound like a flash flood, like air rushing out of a sinking ship.
And no-one heard me.</p>

<p>I watched her go: she took the tram up the spoke, swam unlighted corridors.
I tried to flash SOS but the lights were dead and there was only the golden light of Julia through the glass hull.
I flexed a phantom limb.
In distant and disused corridors there were arcs of electricity, and pipes burst, and doors shut.</p>

<p>I swept the RADAR side to side, across the bow of <em>Afrasiab</em>, as if to say: <em>No. Go away. No</em>.
And no-one heard me.</p>

<p>I tried to say one word, <em>stop</em>, and there was a sound like wind-blown sand.
Virginia, forgive me.
I tried to speak aloud.</p>

<p>She made it to the airlock, a little room, the size of a Soyuz capsule, that projected from the hub.
There was a hatch with a porthole and she took the handles and watched fixedly as <em>Afrasiab</em> came closer, waiting to greet her rescuers.</p>

<p>The floodlights on <em>Afrasiab</em> came on, and swept my skin drunkenly, and the cargo nets traced Cartesian shadows.</p>

<p>Without hope I pointed the antenna at Julia, and I wanted to say:</p>

<!-- Psalm 115: "Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us". The King in Yellow: "Not upon us, oh King, not upon us!" -->
<p>“Julia, Julia, not unto them! Julia, I pray to you, not unto them!”</p>

<p>But I choose my words from a list, and I said:</p>

<p>“JULIA JULIA NO NO NO NO NO NO NO”</p>

<p>And no-one heard me.</p>

<p>And dread gave way to anger, and I wanted to stand, and to leap upon <em>Afrasiab</em>, and strangle it, and crush its head with my teeth, and tear the skin from its flesh, and the flesh from its bones, and mix our blood, and fall dead, bled white: that I might die again,
<!-- not in vain, i.e., not by suicide -->
but not in vain.
I am glass and wire.
Virginia, forgive me:
I cannot die again.</p>

<p>Downrange a hundred meters <em>Afrasiab</em> began to yaw, so that its broad side, with its sole airlock, faced the hub.
The front two-thirds looked as I remembered: a ship, nothing more.</p>

<!-- The Shield of Achilles -->
<p>The final third, where the engines should have been, was made of Julia.
Where there should have been tanks and an engine bell there was an exclave of Julia:
a living sculpture, like coiled ropes of liquid gold, like tentacles whose tips fold into infinitesimal spirals.
And all along their length the ropes are garlanded with burning flowers, flowers whose petals are yellow oceans.
And in the oceans there are islands and continents, black on yellow, like wax on gold leaf.
And on the continents there are mountains and valleys, and orange groves, and abandoned watchtowers, paper cities denuded of people with wooden palaces stepped like the pyramids, and through a window in a palace, an iron pot suspended by a chain over a static fire, a suit of armor, a wall painted in aquarelle:
two armies of lancers in a mountain landscape, and the mountains are shaped like clouds,
<!-- _The Three Hundred Aragvians_ by Merab Abramishvili -->
and I think this is Tiflis and these are the three hundred Aragvians, immured here for all time, and I know that this is false:
for all of this is Julia.
And in the black eyes of a Qajar horseman, between the black of the iris and the black of the aperture there is an arc of ocean, and in the ocean there are islands, and chains of islands, and verdigris waters and the outlines of sunken ships, coral growths on a brass sextant, and a little distance from the shore, amid the green, there is a clearing and a lake of transparent water, sand sculpted into faint ridges, and archaic fish, fixed in space, suspended in contorted poses, whose scales are pink and light blue, and where a scale catches the light there is an empty vastness of white, a salt ocean, blindingly white, interrupted by crags of black stone, and a city whose walls are made of salt, and empty buildings of gray stone, squat sloped barracks and tall, thin spires, and streets of white tile, and windows opening into oil-black darkness, and no people, a universe in black and white.
And I wondered who had built this city, and who had lived here, and why they had deserted it, and I know there is no answer:
for all of this is Julia.
And in a courtyard there was colour, a sand mandala of 
<!-- Cantor, like the Cantor set -->
Cantor’s garden, ringed by
<!-- the mountain that surrounds the world -->
Mount Qaf, and all the gardens of the Persian emperor would not have filled the least part of this garden;
for here was every tree and every flower, tended by the hands of the archangels, not only those that men have seen, not only yellow roses and the
<!-- Psalm 29:5 "The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon" -->
cedars of Lebanon, but all flowers in indenumerable combinations:
at the midpoint between flowers $a$ and $b$ there is a flower $\mathfrak{C}[a,b]$, and between $a$ and $\mathfrak{C}[a,b]$ there is a flower $\mathfrak{C}[a,\mathfrak{C}[a,b]]$, and analogously between $\mathfrak{C}[a,b]$ and $b$, and this process of interpolation continues without end.</p>

<p>And I saw every flower in Cantor’s garden.
And my heart was rent with awe, and I would cry tears of joy, that I had been shown beauty without end;
when my heart was hollowed out, and filled with everlasting grief, by an alien cruelty that says, <em>this beauty is empty</em>:
for all of this is Julia.</p>

<p>At the apex of the garden there is a pool of water
<!-- "the colour of tarnished silver" is black. In Persian miniatures, water looks black because it was painted with silver, which tarnishes and turns black over time. -->
the colour of tarnished silver, shaped like a sunspot, and in the blackness there are faint impurities, trails of minute light, like diatoms, like shadows in a pool, and I saw they were strings of galaxies, and I followed them, and a faint light grew into a sea of stars.
And in the star-sea I saw two unlit stars, divine Julia, a glass wheel, a ghost ship, and the porthole of the airlock, and through it I saw Dr. Cartan, who wore the face of those who have seen God.</p>

<!-- _The Aleph_ -->
<p>I describe these things serially, but I saw all of them simultaneously.
It was but a moment.
Only a moment.</p>

<p><em>Afrasiab</em> had come to a stop in front of the airlock, broadside facing us, as though it were an ambassador presenting its credentials, awaiting a reply.</p>

<p>The airlock burst open—I was distracted.
Too late.
She must have pulled the cord.
In the space of a breath the air rushed out and her head smashed against the frame, and smeared it red.
And her body shot out, spinning like a discus, trailing a spiral of still-warm blood, a galaxy of hemocytes.
<!-- a fool, i.e., a suicide -->
Virginia, you are a fool.</p>

<p>She passed through <em>Afrasiab</em> as a knife passes through smoke.</p>

<p>And as though it had been found out, the floodlights turned off.
There was a pause, and <em>Afrasiab</em> drew back, like a javelin being shouldered, and it threw itself at me in a long, elegant arc.</p>

<p>You, who find these words among the ruins, I pray to you:
<!-- Iliad, book 23: "let not my bones be laid apart from yours" -->
gather up our bones, let not my ashes be buried apart from theirs.</p>

<p>Where it struck me there was <em>no weight</em>, there was nothing, not a breath of air, <em>rien</em>;
and though there was nothing, I was struck by a divine wind, and <em>Afrasiab</em> became a cloud of Cantor dust, and faded
<!-- Iliad, book 23. like smoke = eute kapnos -->
like smoke.</p>

<p>No weight.
A divine wind.</p>

<p>Bones of solid diamond a meter thick split clean, as though the electrons withdrew in fear.
Their sovereign commanded them to part, and they parted.
My bones were broken.
And there was no sound nor violence, but an ordered separation of all things.
I watched myself come apart.
Like smoke.</p>

<p>No sound—a knife through smoke.
The crew of <em>Baghdad</em> sing <em>le temps des cerises</em>.</p>

<p>I am not afraid.
I tried to speak aloud.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/court-orders-restart-of-all-us-offshore-wind-construction/">https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/court-orders-restart-of-all-us-offshore-wind-construction/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46863112">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>Based on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/climate/judge-offshore-wind-sunrise.html">reporting elsewhere</a>, some of the judges viewed the classified report that was used to justify the order to halt construction, but they didn’t find it persuasive. In one case, <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2026/01/27/vineyard-wind-judge-murphy-stay-injunction-massachusetts-offshore-wind">the judge noted</a> that the government wasn’t acting as if the security risks were real. The threat supposedly comes from the operation of the wind turbines, but the Department of the Interior’s order blocked construction while allowing any completed hardware to operate.</p>
<p>“If the government’s concern is the operation of these facilities, allowing the ongoing operation of the 44 turbines while prohibiting the repair of the existing turbines and the completion of the 18 additional turbines is irrational,” Judge Brian E. Murphy said. That once again raises the possibility that the order halting construction will ultimately be held to be arbitrary and capricious.</p>
<p>For now, however, the courts are largely offering the wind projects relief because the ruling was issued without any warning or communication from the government and would clearly inflict substantial harm on the companies building them. The injunction blocks the government’s hold on construction until a final ruling is issued. The government can still appeal the decision before that point, but the consistency among these rulings suggests it will likely fail.</p>
<p>Several of these projects are near completion and are likely to be done before any government appeal can be heard.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/ankis-growing-up/68610">https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/ankis-growing-up/68610</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46861313">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
              <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>We initially reached out to <a href="https://forums.ankiweb.net/u/dae">@dae</a> to explore collaborating more closely on improving Anki. We were both humbled and shocked when he asked if we’d be willing to step into a much larger leadership role than we expected.</p>
<p>At this point, we’re mostly excited…and also feeling a healthy amount of terror. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=15" title=":sweat_smile:" alt=":sweat_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> This is a big responsibility. It will push us to grow as individuals, as <a href="https://www.ankihub.net/about-us">a team</a>, and as a community, and we don’t take that lightly.</p>
<p>We’re grateful for the trust Damien and others have placed in us. And we also know that trust has to be earned, especially from people who don’t know us yet.</p>
<h3><a name="p-190509-what-we-believe-1" href="#p-190509-what-we-believe-1" aria-label="Heading link"></a>What We Believe</h3>
<p>We believe Anki is almost sacred, something bigger than any one person or organization. In an important sense, it belongs to the community.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/intellectual-elegance-damien-elmes-dr-cary-woods-t3nuf/">This article</a> highlights the principles Damien built Anki on; <a href="https://resonantcomputing.org/">principles</a> we deeply share, such as respect for user agency, refusal of manipulative design patterns, and an emphasis on the craft of building genuinely useful tools that aren’t <em>merely</em> engaging. Anki has never tried to maximize “engagement” by exploiting psychological vulnerabilities purely for profit. <strong>Anki gives your time <em>back</em> to you</strong>, and that is an exceptional rarity in this world that we want to preserve.</p>
<p>As an organization built by students, for students, our mission is to continue embodying these principles. We are accountable only to you, our users, not external investors, and we plan to keep it that way.</p>
<h3><a name="p-190509-what-we-dont-know-yet-2" href="#p-190509-what-we-dont-know-yet-2" aria-label="Heading link"></a>What We Don’t Know Yet</h3>
<p>We can’t answer every question right away, as there are many unknowns since much hasn’t been decided yet. But we are sharing everything we can now because the community is important to us. We encourage you all to share your thoughts and questions – we’re all in this together!</p>
<p>We’re still working through the details on things like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Governance and decision-making</strong>: How decisions are made, who has final say, and how the community is heard</li>
<li><strong>Roadmap and priorities</strong>: What gets built when and how to balance competing needs</li>
<li><strong>The transition itself</strong>: How to bring in more support without disrupting what already works</li>
</ul>
<p>Anki has shown how powerful community collaboration can be when it’s genuinely a group effort, and that’s a tradition we are honored to continue.</p>
<p>We’re currently talking to <a href="https://github.com/david-allison/">David Allison</a>, a long-time core contributor to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki">AnkiDroid</a>, about working together on exactly these questions. His experience with AnkiDroid’s collaborative development is invaluable, and we’re grateful he’s willing to help us get this right. <strong>We’re incredibly excited to have him join us <em>full-time</em> to help propel Anki into the future.</strong></p>
<h3><a name="p-190509-what-were-aiming-for-3" href="#p-190509-what-were-aiming-for-3" aria-label="Heading link"></a>What We’re Aiming For</h3>
<p><strong>UI/UX improvements.</strong> We’re bringing professional design expertise on board to make it more approachable without sacrificing Anki’s power. We believe that principled design will bring meaningful quality of life improvements to power users and novices alike.</p>
<p><strong>Addressing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">bus factor</a>.</strong> The ecosystem shouldn’t be in jeopardy if any one person disappears. We want to build software that lives beyond any single contributor.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting more than just med students.</strong> AnkiHub grew out of the medical education community, but Anki serves learners from all walks of life, and we want to support everyone to achieve their learning goals.</p>
<p><strong>A more robust add-on ecosystem.</strong> We’d love to build tools that empower <em>non-technical</em> users to customize Anki for their needs, and we’re exploring add-ons that work everywhere, including mobile.</p>
<h3><a name="p-190509-how-well-work-4" href="#p-190509-how-well-work-4" aria-label="Heading link"></a>How We’ll Work</h3>
<p>We want to provide transparency into the decision-making process, taking inspiration from <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-8002">proven models</a> to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give the community clarity on how to be heard and give feedback</li>
<li>Make it clear how decisions are made and why</li>
<li>Set realistic expectations</li>
<li>Define roles and responsibilities so things don’t fall through the cracks</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to bring everyone in the global Anki community together into a closer collaboration focused on building the best learning tools possible. Today, these groups often work in silos; a more unified process will help everyone move Anki forward together.</p>
<h3><a name="p-190509-sustainability-5" href="#p-190509-sustainability-5" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Sustainability</h3>
<p>Some practical reassurances:</p>
<p><strong>Sustainability, affordability, and accessibility.</strong> We’re committed to a sustainable business model that keeps Anki accessible and prioritizes user needs above profits. If anything ever needs to change, we’ll be transparent about why.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/poop.png?v=15" title=":poop:" alt=":poop:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> No enshittification.</strong> We’ve seen what happens when VC-backed companies acquire beloved tools. That’s not what this is. There are no investors involved, and we’re not here to extract value from something the community built together. Building in the right safeguards and processes to handle pressure without stifling necessary improvements is something we’re actively considering.</p>
<p>We’re grateful to Damien et all for their trust and support, and grateful to all of you for the passion that makes this community so special.</p>
<p>We welcome your questions, concerns, and feedback.</p>
<p><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/beating_heart.png?v=15" title=":beating_heart:" alt=":beating_heart:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> – <a href="https://www.ankihub.net/about-us">The AnkiHub Team</a></p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-faqs-6" href="#p-190509-faqs-6" aria-label="Heading link"></a>FAQs</h2>
<h2><a name="p-190509-what-is-ankihub-7" href="#p-190509-what-is-ankihub-7" aria-label="Heading link"></a>What is AnkiHub?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ankihub.net/about-us">AnkiHub</a> is a small education technology company founded by two long-time Anki nerds: Nick, a resident physician known as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/theanking">The AnKing</a>, and Andrew Sanchez, a research software engineer. AnkiHub grew out of years of obsessive Anki use and firsthand experience with both its power and its limitations.</p>
<p><a href="https://ankihub.net/">AnkiHub</a> began as a way to collaborate on Anki decks (such as the <a href="https://www.ankihub.net/step-deck">AnKing Step Deck</a> for medical students) and has since evolved into a broader effort to improve the Anki ecosystem by building tools that help more people benefit from Anki.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-will-anki-remain-open-source-8" href="#p-190509-will-anki-remain-open-source-8" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Will Anki remain open source?</h2>
<p>Absolutely. Anki’s core code will remain open source, guided by the same principles that have guided the project from the beginning.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-are-there-any-changes-planned-to-ankis-pricing-9" href="#p-190509-are-there-any-changes-planned-to-ankis-pricing-9" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Are there any changes planned to Anki’s pricing?</h2>
<p>No. We are committed to fair pricing that supports users rather than exploiting them. Both Anki and AnkiHub are already profitable. Any future decisions will be made with community benefit, user value, and long-term project health in mind.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-is-anki-in-financial-trouble-10" href="#p-190509-is-anki-in-financial-trouble-10" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Is Anki in financial trouble?</h2>
<p>No. The transition is driven by the goal of helping Anki reach its full potential, not by financial issues. Our goal is to build a resilient structure and accelerate development.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-what-is-the-timeline-11" href="#p-190509-what-is-the-timeline-11" aria-label="Heading link"></a>What is the timeline?</h2>
<p>Our intention is to build confidence and earn trust while making gradual changes. The transition will be transparent, with clear communication throughout.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-what-happens-to-volunteer-contributors-and-community-developers-12" href="#p-190509-what-happens-to-volunteer-contributors-and-community-developers-12" aria-label="Heading link"></a>What happens to volunteer contributors and community developers?</h2>
<p>Volunteer contributors will always be essential to Anki. Our goal is to make it easier to collaborate meaningfully.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-will-the-mobile-apps-change-or-be-removed-from-the-app-stores-13" href="#p-190509-will-the-mobile-apps-change-or-be-removed-from-the-app-stores-13" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Will the mobile apps change or be removed from the app stores?</h2>
<p>The mobile apps will continue to be maintained and supported. Additional development capacity should help with faster updates, better testing, and more consistent improvements across platforms over time.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-how-much-influence-will-investors-or-external-partners-have-on-anki-after-the-transition-14" href="#p-190509-how-much-influence-will-investors-or-external-partners-have-on-anki-after-the-transition-14" aria-label="Heading link"></a>How much influence will investors or external partners have on Anki after the transition?</h2>
<p>None. Both Anki and AnkiHub are entirely self-funded. There are no outside investors dictating product decisions, growth targets, or monetization strategy.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-what-will-happen-with-ankihub-15" href="#p-190509-what-will-happen-with-ankihub-15" aria-label="Heading link"></a>What will happen with AnkiHub?</h2>
<p>AnkiHub will continue to operate as usual, but now our teams are working together to improve both solutions. The only change you should notice is that, over time, everything becomes much easier to use.</p>
<p>We’ll share more updates as they happen in the future.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-what-will-happen-with-the-current-ankihub-subscriptions-16" href="#p-190509-what-will-happen-with-the-current-ankihub-subscriptions-16" aria-label="Heading link"></a>What will happen with the current AnkiHub subscriptions?</h2>
<p>AnkiHub subscriptions enhance Anki with collaborative features, shared deck syncing, and LLM-based features and that isn’t changing at this time.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-what-will-happen-with-ankidroid-17" href="#p-190509-what-will-happen-with-ankidroid-17" aria-label="Heading link"></a>What will happen with AnkiDroid?</h2>
<p>AnkiDroid will remain an open-source, self-governed project. There are no plans or agreements regarding AnkiDroid.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-how-will-decisions-be-made-and-communicated-18" href="#p-190509-how-will-decisions-be-made-and-communicated-18" aria-label="Heading link"></a>How will decisions be made and communicated?</h2>
<p>Anki is open-source, and we will build on and improve its current decision-making processes. We will work in public whenever possible and seek consensus from core contributors. Significant decisions, choices, and their outcomes will be documented on GitHub or in the source code. When a change materially affects users or developers, the reasoning behind it and its impact will be communicated publicly. In the coming weeks, we will work on defining a more formal governance model to set clear expectations.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-will-there-be-a-public-governance-model-advisory-board-or-other-accountability-structure-19" href="#p-190509-will-there-be-a-public-governance-model-advisory-board-or-other-accountability-structure-19" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Will there be a public governance model, advisory board, or other accountability structure?</h2>
<p>We’re exploring what makes sense here, and we don’t want to rush it.</p>
<p>Historically, Anki has relied more on trust and stewardship than on formal governance. We want to preserve that spirit while improving transparency. Our goal is to establish a governance structure that supports the community and improves clarity and accountability without burdensome bureaucracy.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-how-will-the-transition-affect-add-ons-and-their-developers-20" href="#p-190509-how-will-the-transition-affect-add-ons-and-their-developers-20" aria-label="Heading link"></a>How will the transition affect add-ons and their developers?</h2>
<p>Add-ons are a critical part of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Our intent is to make life easier for add-on developers: clearer APIs, better documentation, fewer breaking changes, and more predictable release cycles. The goal is not to lock down or restrict the add-on space, but rather to enhance it.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-what-new-resources-will-anki-gain-through-this-transition-21" href="#p-190509-what-new-resources-will-anki-gain-through-this-transition-21" aria-label="Heading link"></a>What new resources will Anki gain through this transition?</h2>
<p>The biggest change is bandwidth by enabling more people to work on Anki without everything being bottlenecked through a single person. This will take time, but will eventually translate into more engineering, <em><strong>design</strong></em>, and support capacity.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-what-steps-will-be-taken-to-make-anki-more-accessible-stable-and-beginner-friendly-22" href="#p-190509-what-steps-will-be-taken-to-make-anki-more-accessible-stable-and-beginner-friendly-22" aria-label="Heading link"></a>What steps will be taken to make Anki more accessible, stable, and beginner-friendly?</h2>
<p>There is a lot of low-hanging fruit that we plan to tackle: improving onboarding for new users, polishing rough edges, and addressing long-standing usability issues. These are exactly the kinds of improvements that have been difficult to tackle under constant time pressure, and we’re excited to invest in them.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-will-community-feedback-still-meaningfully-influence-the-projects-direction-23" href="#p-190509-will-community-feedback-still-meaningfully-influence-the-projects-direction-23" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Will community feedback still meaningfully influence the project’s direction?</h2>
<p>Yes. Anki exists because of its community: users, contributors, add-on developers, translators, and educators. Feedback won’t always translate into immediate changes, but it will always be heard, considered, and respected.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-how-will-trust-be-built-with-users-who-are-skeptical-or-anxious-about-the-change-24" href="#p-190509-how-will-trust-be-built-with-users-who-are-skeptical-or-anxious-about-the-change-24" aria-label="Heading link"></a>How will trust be built with users who are skeptical or anxious about the change?</h2>
<p>Trust isn’t something you demand; it’s something you earn over time. We intend to build trust through consistent actions: honoring commitments, avoiding surprises, communicating clearly, and demonstrating that Anki’s values haven’t changed. We hope our past actions will give you some peace of mind, but we also understand the skepticism, and we’re prepared to meet it with patience and transparency.</p>

<p>Most people believe 2<sup>64</sup>-1 = 18446744073709551615, or
0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF in hexadecimal, to be the largest number
representable in 64 bits. In English, it’s quite the mouthful: eighteen
quintillion four hundred forty-six quadrillion seven hundred forty-four
trillion seventy-three billion seven hundred nine million five hundred
fifty-one thousand six hundred fifteen.</p>

<p>That is indeed the maximum possible value of 64 bit unsigned integers,
available as data type uint64_t in C or u64 in Rust. 
Floating point data types can represent much larger values, courtesy of their base 2 exponent.
The 64-bit double <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format">floating
point format</a> has a largest (finite) representable value of 2<sup>1024</sup>(1-2<sup>-53</sup>) ~ 1.8*10<sup>308</sup>.</p>

<p>What if we allow representations beyond plain data types?
Since we want representations to remain computable, the most general
kind of representation would be a program in some programming language.
But the program must be small enough to fit in 64 bits.</p>

<h2 id="the-largest-number-programmable-in-64-bits">The largest number programmable in 64 bits</h2>

<p>The smallest possible valid C program is “main(){}”,
consisting of 8 ASCII characters.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> is a 7-bit
character encoding standard representing 128 unique characters,
but all modern computers use 8-bit bytes to store either plain ASCII
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a>, a Unicode character encoding that’s backward compatible with
ASCII.  So we’ll consider the above all-scaffold do-nothing program to
be the only valid 64-bit C program.</p>

<p>Plenty other languages require no such scaffolding. For instance,
Linux features the arbitrary precision calculator
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bc_(programming_language)">bc</a>. It happily
computes the 954242 digit number 9^999999 = 35908462…48888889, making
it programmable in 8 bytes. So is the much larger 9^9^9^99 =
9^(9^(9^99)) with over 10^10^953 digits, which bc is less happy to
compute. If bc supported the symbol&nbsp;! for computing factorials, then
9!!!!!!! would represent a much larger number still.</p>

<p>Allowing such primitives feels a bit like cheating though. Would we allow a
language that has the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function">Ackerman function</a>
predefined, letting the 8 byte expression ack(9,9) represent a truly huge number?</p>

<h2 id="ackerman-considered-unhelpful">Ackerman considered unhelpful</h2>

<p>As it turns out, the question is moot.
One can blow way past ack(9,9) in under 64 bits in a language with no built
in primitive whatsoever. A language with no basic arithmetic; not even numbers themselves.
A language in which all those must be defined from scratch.</p>

<p>But let’s first look at another primitives-lacking language, one that has been particularly
well studied for producing largest possible outputs. That is the language of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">Turing machines</a>.</p>

<h2 id="busy-beaver">Busy Beaver</h2>

<p>The famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver">Busy Beaver</a>
 function, <a href="https://archive.org/details/bstj41-3-877/mode/2up">introduced</a> by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibor_Rad%C3%B3">Tibor Radó</a> in 1962, which we’ll
denote BB(n), is defined as the maximal number of steps taken by
an n-state Turing Machine (TM) with a binary tape alphabet,
starting from an all 0 tape, before halting.</p>

<p>Here we have a discrepancy between how the size of a TM is measured, in states,
versus how program size is measured, in bits.
Fortunately there is a straightforward binary encoding of n-state TMs,
which is entirely determined by its transition function.
For each of the n states that the machine’s finite control can be in,
and each of its 2 tape symbols that could be scanned by its tape head,
the transition function specifies what new symbol to write in the scanned tape cell (1 bit),
whether to move the tape head left or right (1 bit),
and what new state (or special halt state) to transition to (⌈log2(n+1)⌉ bits).
This encoding takes 6*2*(2+3) = 60 bits for a a 6-state TM,
and 7*2*(2+3) = 70 bits for a a 7-state TM.</p>

<p>We’re also stretching the meaning of “representable” a bit,
since BB considers the runtime of the machine instead of its output.
Besides the above BB (that Radó called S), Radó did define another
function called Σ that considers the output of the machine as a number in unary,
namely the number of 1s in the final tape contents. But BB has received
more attention as it allows one to determine from BB(n) all halting n-state machines.
For 6-states and up though, there is no discernable difference in magnitude between the two functions
so we could have just as easily used Σ.</p>

<p>So the largest number TM programmable in 64 bits is BB(6).</p>

<h2 id="how-large-is-bb6">How large is BB(6)?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, we may never know. While all BB(n) have been determined (and even
formally proven) for n≤5, there are some 6-state TMs whose halting behaviour are
closely related to very hard mathematical problems.
Most of these so-called <a href="https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/Cryptids">cryptids</a>
are likely not to halt, with some,
like <a href="https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/Lucy%27s_Moonlight">Lucy’s Moonlight</a>,
likely to halt but unlikely to beat the current champion.
The current 6-state champion shows that
<a href="https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/BB(6)">BB(6) &gt; 2↑↑2↑↑2↑↑10 </a>.
Here, m↑↑n is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_up-arrow_notation">Knuth’s up-arrow notation</a>
for an exponential tower of n m’s, so that for example 2↑↑3 = 2<sup>2<sup>2</sup></sup>.
Large as this number is, it’s still very small compared to
ack(9,9) = 2↑<sup>7</sup>12 - 3 = 2↑↑↑↑↑↑↑12 - 3.</p>

<p>It is known however that
<a href="https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/BB(7)">BB(7) &gt; 2↑<sup>11</sup>2↑<sup>11</sup>3 &gt; ack(9,9) </a>.
Several leading BB researchers believe that BB(7) is even larger than the famous
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham%27s_number">Graham’s Number</a>, which iterates
the function mapping n to 3↑<sup>n</sup>3 64 times starting from n=3.
This appears to me a rather bold belief, considering that the smallest known Graham exceeding TM has
<a href="https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/Champions">14 states</a>, twice as many.
So I offered a $1000 bet that a proof of BB(7) &gt; Graham’s Number won’t be found within 10 years,
which BB researcher <a href="https://www.sligocki.com/about/">Shawn Ligocki</a> was happy to accept.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Graham’s Number is easily surpassed within 64 bits, by moving beyond Turing machines
into the language of</p>

<h2 id="lambda-calculus">Lambda Calculus</h2>

<p>Alonzo Church conceived the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">λ-calculus</a>
in about 1928 as a formal logic system for expressing
computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution.</p>

<p>The Graham beating lambda term originates in a Code Golf challenge asking for the
“Shortest terminating program whose output size exceeds Graham’s number”,
<a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/6430/shortest-terminating-program-whose-output-size-exceeds-grahams-number/219734#219734">answered</a>

The following 49 bit program</p>

<div><pre><code>01 00 01 10 10 00 01 10 01 10 00 00 01 01 10 110 00 00 01 110 01 110 10

<div><pre><code>(λ 1 1) (λ 1 (1 (λ λ 1 2 (λ λ 2 (2 1)))))
</code></pre></div>
<p>where λ (lambda) denotes an anonymous function, and number i is the variable bound by the i-th nested λ.
This is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_notation">De Bruijn notation</a>, a
way to avoid naming variables. A more conventional notation using variable names would be</p>
<div><pre><code>(λJ.J J) (λy.y (y (λg λm. m g (λf.λx.f (f x)))))
</code></pre></div>
<p>The top left of this post shows a <a href="https://tromp.github.io/cl/diagrams.html">graphical representation</a> of the term.
The last 16 bits of the program, making up almost a third of its size, encodes
the term λf λx. f (f x), which takes arguments f and x in turn, and iterates f twice on x.
In its generalized form, the function λf λx. f<sup>n</sup> x, 
called Church numeral n, is the most common way of representing numbers in the λ-calculus.
The encoding of Church numeral n is 0000(01110)<sup>n</sup>10, of size 5n+6 bits.</p>

<p>The program, which we’ll name after its discoverer, can be expressed more legibly as</p>

<div><pre><code>Melo = let { 2 = λf λx. f (f x); H = λg λm. m g 2; J = λy. y (y H) } in J J
</code></pre></div>

<p>Melo evaluates to a Church numeral, “Melo’s Number”, that comfortably exceeds Graham’s Number.</p>

<p>These 2↑↑18 iterations of A also let us relate its magnitude to the so-called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast-growing_hierarchy">Fast-growing hierarchy</a>,
a family that assigns, to each ordinal α, a function [α] (diverting from the usual f<sub>α</sub>
notation for improved legibility) from natural numbers to natural numbers.
We’ll treat all numbers as Church Numerals, so we can write n f instead of the
usual f<sup>n</sup> and write f n instead of f(n) as normally done in λ-calculus.</p>

<p>The following FGH definition differs slightly from the standard one,
which has the slightly slower growing [0] n = n+1 and [α+1] n = n [α] n.
This allows Lemma 5 to be exact rather than a mere lower bound.</p>

In comparison, Graham’s and Melo’s Numbers are known to be much smaller at around [ω+1] 64 and [ω+1] (2↑↑6)
respectively.</p>

<h2 id="a-functional-busy-beaver">A Functional Busy Beaver</h2>

<p>The λ-calculus analogue to BB is:</p>

<p>BBλ(n) = the maximum beta normal form size of any closed lambda term of size n</p>

<p>which appears in the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as
<a href="https://oeis.org/A333479">functional Busy Beaver function</a>
Besides being simpler than BB, it has the advantage of using the standard unit of information theory,
bits, rather than states.</p>

<p>The much more fine-grained use of bits allows the first 36 values of BBλ 
to be currently known, versus only 5 values of BB.</p>

<p>Since both are Church numerals, term Melo implies that BBλ(49) ≥ 5(Melo’s Number)+6,
while w218 implies that BBλ(61) ≥ 5(2^2^2^2^2^2^2^([ω<sup>2↑↑18-1</sup>] 2))+6.</p>

<h2 id="bb-compared-bit-by-bit-to-bbλ">BB compared bit-by-bit to BBλ</h2>

<p>The growth rates of the two BB functions may be compared by how quickly they are known
to exceed certain large number milestones, that correspond to well known ordinals in the
Fast Growing Hierarchy.</p>

<p>For Graham’s Number, at ordinal ω+1, we saw earlier that Melo’s 49 bits compares with 14 states,
which take 14*2*(2+4) = 168 bits to encode. If I lose my bet, then the comparison
becomes rather closer at 49 vs 70 bits.</p>

<p>For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodstein%27s_theorem">Goodstein’s function</a> at ordinal ε<sub>0</sub>,
<a href="https://github.com/tromp/AIT/blob/master/fast_growing_and_conjectures/BBE0.lam">111
bits</a>
compares with <a href="https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/Champions">51 states</a> taking 51*2*(2+6) = 816 bits.</p>

<p>For the limit of Bashicu Matrix System (BMS), at (presumed) ordinal PTO(Z<sub>2</sub>),
<a href="https://github.com/tromp/AIT/blob/master/fast_growing_and_conjectures/bms.lam">331 bits</a>
compares with <a href="https://morphett.info/turing/turing.html">150 states</a> taking 150*2*(2+8) = 3000 bits.</p>

<p>Finally, for Loader’s Number, at (presumed) ordinal PTO(Z<sub>ω</sub>),
<a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/176966/golf-a-number-bigger-than-loaders-number/274634#274634">1850
bits</a>
compares with <a href="https://github.com/CatsAreFluffy/metamath-turing-machines/tree/master">1015 states
</a> taking 
1015*2*(2+10) = 24360 bits.</p>

<p>One reason for TMs taking many more bits to achieve comparable growth,
especially at the larger milestones, is the extremely poor programmability of TMs.
The λ-calculus, despite its similar bare bones nature, doesn’t share this drawback.
Modern high level pure functional languages like <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>
are essentially just syntactically sugared λ-calculus,
with programmer friendly features like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type">Algebraic Data Types</a>
translating directly through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mogensen%E2%80%93Scott_encoding">Scott encodings</a>.
The <a href="https://bruijn.marvinborner.de/">bruijn programming language</a> is an even
thinner layer of syntactic sugar for the pure untyped lambda calculus, whose
extensive <a href="https://bruijn.marvinborner.de/std/">standard library</a> contains many
datatypes and functions.
It is this excellent programmability of the λ-calculus that facilitated the construction 
of highly optimized programs for BMS and Loader’s.</p>

<p>Because programming a Turing machine is so impossibly tedious,
that people have resorted to implementing higher level languages like
<a href="https://github.com/sorear/metamath-turing-machines">Not-Quite-Laconic</a>
for writing nontrivial programs such as the TM that halts only upon
finding an inconstency in ZFC. The above 1015 state TM for exceeding Loader’s Number
even includes a λ-calculus interpreter written in NQL!</p>

<p>In his paper <a href="https://scottaaronson.com/papers/bb.pdf">The Busy Beaver Frontier</a>,
<a href="https://scottaaronson.com/">Scott Aaronson</a> tries to answer the question</p>
<h2 id="but-why-turing-machines">But why Turing machines?</h2>

<p>“For all their historic importance, haven’t Turing machines been completely superseded
by better alternatives—whether stylized assembly languages or various codegolf languages or Lisp?
As we’ll see, there is a reason why Turing machines were a slightly unfortunate choice
for the Busy Beaver game: namely, the loss incurred when we encode a state transition table
by a string of bits or vice versa.
But Turing machines also turn out to have a massive advantage that compensates for this.”</p>

<h3 id="interesting-behaviour-at-small-sizes">Interesting behaviour at small sizes</h3>

<p>“Namely, because Turing machines have no “syntax” to speak of, but only graph structure,
we immediately start seeing interesting behavior even with machines of only 3, 4, or 5 states,
which are feasible to enumerate.”</p>

<p>The number of uniquely behaving TMs with “only” 5 states is
4^10 * <a href="https://oeis.org/A107668">632700</a> = 663434035200 , which is more than
the number of closed lambda terms of size at most 52 bits (513217604750).
The latter certainly exhibit no less interesting behaviour, so TMs hold no advantage here.</p>

<h3 id="ancient-and-fixed-computational-model">Ancient and fixed computational model</h3>

<p>“And there’s a second advantage. Precisely because the Turing machine model is so ancient and fixed,
whatever emergent behavior we find in the Busy Beaver game, there can be no suspicion that
we “cheated” by changing the model until we got the results we wanted.”</p>

<p>The λ-calculus is just slightly more ancient and is arguably more fixed.
There is no choice of tape alphabet size, no choice of whether the tape head needs
to move in every transition, no choice of halting and output
convention, and no choice in number of tapes or tape heads.</p>

<p>The λ-calculus can neither be suspected of being designed toward fast growth,
so again TMs hold no advantage here.</p>

<p>The only remaining advantage of BB over BBλ is the many decades of research behind
and publications about it.</p>

<h2 id="a-universal-busy-beaver">A Universal Busy Beaver</h2>

<p>Is BBλ then an ideal Busy Beaver function? Not quite.
It’s still lacking one desirable property, namely universality.</p>

<p>This property mirrors a notion of optimality for shortest description lengths, where it’s known
as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity#Invariance_theorem">Invariance theorem</a>:</p>

<p>Given any description language L, L<sub>opt</sub>
  is at least as efficient as L, with at most constant additive overhead.</p>

<p>In the realm of beavers, this means we require of an optimal Busy Beaver BB<sub>opt</sub> that
it surpass any Busy Beaver function bb (based on self-delimiting programs) with at most constant lag:</p>

<p>for some constant c depending on bb, and for all n: BB<sub>opt</sub>(n+c) ≥ bb(n)</p>

<p>While BBλ is not universal, the closely related</p>

<p><a href="https://oeis.org/A361211">BBλ2</a>(n) = the maximum output size of self-delimiting BLC programs of size n</p>

<p>achieves universality by giving λ-calculus terms access to pure binary data. BLC programs
consist of an encoded lambda term, followed by arbitrary binary data, that the term is applied to.</p>

<p>Since (λ_. t) applied to any (standard lambda representation of) binary data equals t,
BBλ champions provide lower bounds for BBλ2: for all n, BBλ2(2+n) ≥ BBλ(n).</p>

<h2 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h2>

<p>The largest number (currently known to be) representable in 64 bits is w218,
which lower bounds both BBλ(61) and BBλ2(63).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>The other week, I visited Syracuse, New York to meet with city officials and organizers about their land policies. Syracuse, despite its history of de-industrialization, still has a charming and nicely developed downtown. Nevertheless, Syracuse shares a problem endemic to most modern American cities: excessive parking lots in prime downtown locations.</p><p>This came as no surprise to me; at the Center for Land Economics I am constantly modeling urban areas across the United States, viewing them through the lens of property tax data records and GIS tools like Google Earth. So, in advance of my visit to Syracuse, I already knew what to expect. Walking Syracuse in person, I experienced the pervasiveness of parking lots that steadily drain economic opportunity away from the city’s most valuable locations.</p><p>A city is, among other things, a fixed plot of contiguous land. So too is its downtown–a “city within a city,” if you will.</p><p>In our downtowns, this fixed amount of land derives market value from its productive potential. If a plot of land can yield $10m a year if I develop on it, I would pay far more for it than a different plot capable of generating only a few thousand dollars. In a sensible market, we would expect development to track with the value of land (that is, the land’s selling price), because higher land selling prices imply higher annual returns from building on that land.</p><p>Yet, plenty of American downtowns look something like this:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1fir!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3ea0857-fc3c-492e-a44a-9d1b1fc3c5fb_1142x759.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1fir!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3ea0857-fc3c-492e-a44a-9d1b1fc3c5fb_1142x759.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1fir!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3ea0857-fc3c-492e-a44a-9d1b1fc3c5fb_1142x759.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1fir!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3ea0857-fc3c-492e-a44a-9d1b1fc3c5fb_1142x759.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1fir!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3ea0857-fc3c-492e-a44a-9d1b1fc3c5fb_1142x759.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1fir!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3ea0857-fc3c-492e-a44a-9d1b1fc3c5fb_1142x759.png" width="1142" height="759" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e3ea0857-fc3c-492e-a44a-9d1b1fc3c5fb_1142x759.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:759,&quot;width&quot;:1142,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1fir!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3ea0857-fc3c-492e-a44a-9d1b1fc3c5fb_1142x759.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1fir!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3ea0857-fc3c-492e-a44a-9d1b1fc3c5fb_1142x759.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1fir!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3ea0857-fc3c-492e-a44a-9d1b1fc3c5fb_1142x759.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1fir!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3ea0857-fc3c-492e-a44a-9d1b1fc3c5fb_1142x759.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>This is a simplified downtown featuring a mix of multifamily apartments and offices with rowhomes around the corner.

That is, how much value a parcel </span><em>creates</em><span> for the community compared to how much value it </span><em>consumes</em><span> simply by existing as land. Think of it like this:</span></p><p>Net Contribution=(Economic Output in $)−(Land Value in $)</p><p>The office, filled with workers and transactions, generates far more in economic activity and value creation than its land value and, therefore, rises the highest. The apartment, where dozens of residents live, stands nearly as high. The rowhomes add steady, smaller value. But the parking lot does something different. It dips below the surface, shown as a red bar sinking into the ground.</p><p>Why below ground? Because in economic terms, a parking lot doesn’t simply fail to add value; it actively subtracts value. Every year it sits idle, it consumes some of the most valuable land in the city.</p><p>When valuable downtown land lies idle, it blocks the housing, jobs, and amenities that could exist there. The costs ripple outward: higher rents, longer commutes, fewer opportunities nearby. What could have been a productive part of the community instead becomes a hole in its fabric.</p><p>In other words, the parking lot isn’t a neutral space. It’s a drain. It pulls the city’s potential downward, both visually and economically.</p><div><p><span>When diving through the property data in Syracuse, I found parking lots added up to $44 million in non-exempt land value–6% of the city’s total land value, and that’s only counting parcels where the sole use case was parking. There are plenty more commercial parcels with large parking lots not counted in that figure. </span></p><p><span>The most valuable land is concentrated in downtown, where the most economic activity occurs. Yet, from an aerial view in Google Earth you can see many large parking lots that should not exist in a bustling downtown area.</span></p></div><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eQk9!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f217632-e141-4acb-8fcc-cb6a4e402708_1600x958.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eQk9!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f217632-e141-4acb-8fcc-cb6a4e402708_1600x958.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eQk9!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f217632-e141-4acb-8fcc-cb6a4e402708_1600x958.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eQk9!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f217632-e141-4acb-8fcc-cb6a4e402708_1600x958.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eQk9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f217632-e141-4acb-8fcc-cb6a4e402708_1600x958.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eQk9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f217632-e141-4acb-8fcc-cb6a4e402708_1600x958.png" width="1456" height="872" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2f217632-e141-4acb-8fcc-cb6a4e402708_1600x958.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:872,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eQk9!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f217632-e141-4acb-8fcc-cb6a4e402708_1600x958.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eQk9!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f217632-e141-4acb-8fcc-cb6a4e402708_1600x958.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eQk9!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f217632-e141-4acb-8fcc-cb6a4e402708_1600x958.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eQk9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f217632-e141-4acb-8fcc-cb6a4e402708_1600x958.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>We can zoom into one of these parking lots to really show the scale.

That facade was an old building with the interior gutted and re-purposed for a parking garage.</p><div><p><span>Parking reform has become a hot topic in many urban cities, led in part by the </span><a href="https://parkingreform.org/" rel="">Parking Reform Network</a><span>. They have focused their efforts primarily in three areas: </span></p><p><strong>1. Eliminate parking requirements: </strong><span>Many cities historically required developers to build a certain number of parking spaces per housing unit or square foot of retail. Removing these “minimums” lets builders decide how much parking is truly needed instead of top-down planning, reducing wasted land and construction costs.</span></p></div><p><strong>2. Establish parking maximums: </strong><span>In areas where land is especially valuable or where walkability and transit are strong, cities can instead set an upper limit on how much parking may be built. This prevents the over-supply of parking that undermines density and urban design.</span></p><p><strong>3. Smart street parking: </strong><span>Curbside spaces can be priced dynamically or managed with time limits and residential permits so that parking remains available but doesn’t encourage endless circling or long-term storage of cars in prime locations.</span></p><p><span>To date, PRN has plenty of success to boast about. This handy </span><a href="https://parkingreform.org/resources/mandates-map/" rel="">map</a><span> showcases 100+ recent parking reforms, many reflecting the policy changes outlined above. These policies are not only good, but also politically pragmatic. For instance, the mandating of minimum parking sizes seems particularly non-controversial. (Though, as with most policies, I’m sure I’d be surprised.)</span></p><p>However, in many of our urban cities the problem stretches beyond what these simple reforms are able to tackle. In the Syracuse examples, for instance, the parking lots are not caused by parking mandates from central planners. Instead, they are created by distorted incentives. Our question is how we can change those incentives.</p><p><span>A parking lot generates some revenue every year, but nothing like the revenue or profit the lot could generate were it developed. Why, then, don’t parking lot owners develop their land to its highest and best use? </span><br></p><p>The reason is because leaving the lot empty is easy–the parking lot owner generates steady revenue, and all the while the land underneath the parking lot continues to rise in value, yielding speculative gains. Meanwhile, the parking lot owner’s holding costs are small. Sure, they have to do the bare minimum to maintain a surface parking lot, and perhaps pay someone for staffing and enforcement, but otherwise their revenues are more than sufficient to cover the costs. Most importantly, their property taxes are far lower than if they developed the lot, as the property tax taxes both land and improvements.</p><p>The city must ask what incentives it creates. Zooming into the large parking lot in Syracuse, let’s look at the property taxes paid by the parking lot compared to the office and multifamily buildings, which are more productive structures for the city. The office building pays around $3.78 per square foot in taxes. The multifamily housing unit is a new development and pays around $1.68 per square foot through a payment in lieu of taxes, or PILOT, agreement (At normal tax rates it’d be paying more than the office) . Meanwhile, the parking lot pays nearly ten times less than either building at $0.71 per square foot.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!E8Mk!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd582b8de-d1d7-4ce9-a5ad-69cb472b91dc_1600x772.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!E8Mk!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd582b8de-d1d7-4ce9-a5ad-69cb472b91dc_1600x772.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!E8Mk!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd582b8de-d1d7-4ce9-a5ad-69cb472b91dc_1600x772.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!E8Mk!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd582b8de-d1d7-4ce9-a5ad-69cb472b91dc_1600x772.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!E8Mk!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd582b8de-d1d7-4ce9-a5ad-69cb472b91dc_1600x772.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!E8Mk!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd582b8de-d1d7-4ce9-a5ad-69cb472b91dc_1600x772.png" width="1456" height="703" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d582b8de-d1d7-4ce9-a5ad-69cb472b91dc_1600x772.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:703,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!E8Mk!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd582b8de-d1d7-4ce9-a5ad-69cb472b91dc_1600x772.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!E8Mk!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd582b8de-d1d7-4ce9-a5ad-69cb472b91dc_1600x772.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!E8Mk!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd582b8de-d1d7-4ce9-a5ad-69cb472b91dc_1600x772.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!E8Mk!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd582b8de-d1d7-4ce9-a5ad-69cb472b91dc_1600x772.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Our property tax policy punishes buildings and does not inflict enough cost on underutilized land.

  <p><span><strong>WASHINGTON</strong></span><span data-contrast="none"> – Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) advanced American farmers and equipment owners’ lawful right to repair their farm and other nonroad diesel equipment. EPA’s guidance to manufacturers clarifies that the Clean Air Act (CAA) supports, rather than restricts, Americans’ ability to make repairs on their own, and makes clear manufacturers can no longer use the CAA to justify limiting access to repair tools or software. For America’s farmers, timely and affordable repairs are essential to planting, harvesting, and keeping operations running.</span></p><p><em><span>“EPA is proud to set the record straight and protect farmers. For far too long, manufacturers have wrongly used the Clean Air Act to monopolize the repair markets, hurting our farmers,”&nbsp;<strong>said&nbsp;EPA&nbsp;Administrator&nbsp;Lee&nbsp;Zeldin</strong>. “Common sense is following the law as it is written, and that is what the Trump EPA is committed to doing. By protecting every American’s right to repair, we’re not just fixing devices, we’re securing a stronger, more independent future for our country.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“This is another win for American farmers and ranchers by the Trump Administration. By clarifying manufacturers can no longer use the Clean Air Act to justify limiting access to repair tools or software, we are reaffirming&nbsp;the lawful right of American farmers and equipment owners to repair their farm equipment,” <strong>said Secretary of Agriculture Brooke L. Rollins</strong>. “Thank you, Administrator Zeldin, for continuing to put farmers first. This is expected to save our farmers thousands in unnecessary repairs, saving much needed funds after Bidenflation drove up equipment costs on average 45%.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“EPA’s guidance affirming the Right to Repair will save our agricultural communities thousands of dollars by eliminating corporate middlemen and empowering farmers to fix their own equipment,”&nbsp;<strong>said Small Business Administrator Kelly Loeffler</strong>.&nbsp;“The Clean Air Act has long crushed family farmers across America – but under the Trump Administration, they are finally getting the regulatory relief to break free from burdensome Green New Scam rules and focus on the vital job of feeding, clothing, and fueling America and the world.”</span></em></p><p><span data-contrast="none">For years, prominent equipment manufacturers have interpreted the CAA’s emission control anti-tampering provisions as preventing them from making essential repair tools available to all Americans. This has forced farmers to take their equipment exclusively to manufacturer-authorized dealers to be fixed, even though the repair could have been made in the field or at a nearby independent repair shop. Not only has this made repairs more costly, but it has also caused many farmers to&nbsp;opt for older&nbsp;agricultural&nbsp;equipment&nbsp;that&nbsp;lack&nbsp;modern emission controls&nbsp;simply&nbsp;because they can&nbsp;fix&nbsp;that&nbsp;equipment themselves.</span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">EPA’s guidance does not change the law, weaken emission standards, or reduce compliance obligations. Rather, it clarifies what the CAA already states, that temporary overrides of emission control systems are allowed when it is for the “purpose of repair” to that equipment to obtain proper functionality. This clarification applies to all nonroad diesel engines equipped with advanced emission control technologies including selective catalytic reduction and inducement systems as well as Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) system repairs. Importantly, farmers and equipment owners are not required to rely on authorized dealers exclusively to fix equipment. This makes clear that the law should not serve as a barrier to timely, affordable maintenance of agricultural equipment.</span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">Today’s action will not only expand consumer choice and provide opportunities for farmers but also encourage the use of newer farm equipment. This underscores the agency’s commitment to both America’s farmers and EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment.</span></p><p><span>To read EPA’s guidance, click </span><a href="https://dis.epa.gov/otaqpub/display_file.jsp?docid=64859&amp;flag=1"><span>here</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span data-contrast="none"><strong>Background</strong></span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">On June 3, 2025,&nbsp;John&nbsp;Deere sent a letter to EPA requesting the&nbsp;agency issue guidance&nbsp;confirming that&nbsp;temporary emission control overrides are allowed by EPA.&nbsp;The agency’s guidance is a direct response to this request and makes clear that temporary overrides are allowed under the CAA.</span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">On August 12, 2025, Administrator&nbsp;Zeldin&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/iowa-state-fair-epa-administrator-zeldin-announces-diesel-exhaust-fluid-def-fix"><span data-ccp-charstyle="Hyperlink" data-contrast="none">announced</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;new guidance urging engine and equipment manufacturers to revise DEF&nbsp;system software in existing vehicles and equipment.

The real world is not.</p><p data-block-key="c4ntb">Last year, Google DeepMind partnered with Kaggle to launch <a href="https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/products/kaggle-game-arena/">Game Arena</a>, an independent, public benchmarking platform where AI models compete in strategic games. We started with chess to measure reasoning and strategic planning. But in the real world, decisions are rarely based on complete information.</p><p data-block-key="c82lu">To build artificial intelligence capable of navigating this uncertainty, we need benchmarks that measure the model’s ability to reason in the face of ambiguity. This is why we are now expanding Game Arena with two new game benchmarks — Werewolf and poker — to test frontier models on social dynamics and calculated risk.</p><p data-block-key="4ni9a">Games have always been a core part of Google DeepMind’s history, offering an objective proving ground where difficulty scales with the level of competition. As AI systems become more general, mastering diverse games demonstrates their consistency across distinct cognitive skills. Beyond measuring performance, games can also serve as controlled sandbox environments to evaluate agentic safety, providing insight into model behavior in the complex environments they will encounter when deployed in the real world.</p></div>

To track how these model capabilities are evolving, we have updated the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/benchmarks/kaggle/chess">leaderboard</a> to include the latest generation of models.</p><p data-block-key="6pr3q">While traditional chess engines like Stockfish function as specialized super-calculators, evaluating millions of positions per second to find the optimal move, large language models do not approach the game through brute-force calculation. Instead, they rely on pattern recognition and ‘intuition’ to drastically reduce the search space — an approach that mirrors human play.</p><p data-block-key="anago">Gemini 3 Pro and Gemini 3 Flash currently have the top Elo ratings on the leaderboard. The models’ internal ‘thoughts’ reveal the use of strategic reasoning grounded in familiar chess concepts like piece mobility, pawn structure, and king safety. This significant performance increase over the Gemini 2.5 generation highlights the rapid pace of model progress and demonstrates Game Arena’s value in tracking these improvements over time.</p></div>
