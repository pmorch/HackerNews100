<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gla.ac.uk/media/Media_1086641_smxx.jpg" alt="Antikythera mechanism in National Archaeological Museum, Athens, Greece." title="" width="650" height="433"></p><p>&nbsp;The mechanism was discovered in 1901 by divers exploring a sunken shipwreck near the Aegean island of Antikythera. Although the shoebox-sized mechanism had broken into fragments and eroded, it quickly became clear that it contained a complex series of gears which were unusually intricately-tooled. </p><p>&nbsp;Decades of subsequent research and analysis have established that the mechanism dates from the second century BCE and functioned as a kind of hand-operated mechanical computer. Exterior dials connected to the internal gears allowed users to predict eclipses and calculate the astronomical positions of planets on any given date with an accuracy unparalleled by any other known contemporary device.</p><p>&nbsp;In 2020, new X-ray images of one of the mechanism’s rings, known as the calendar ring, revealed fresh details of regularly spaced holes that sit beneath the ring. Since the ring was broken and incomplete, however, it wasn’t clear how just how many holes were there originally. Initial analysis by Antikythera researcher Chris Budiselic and colleagues suggested it was likely somewhere between 347 and 367.</p><p>&nbsp;Now, in a new paper published today in the <em>Horological Journal</em>, the Glasgow researchers describe how they used two statistical analysis techniques to reveal new details about the calendar ring. They show that the ring is vastly more likely to have had 354 holes, corresponding to the lunar calendar, than 365 holes, which would have followed the Egyptian calendar. The analysis also shows that 354 holes is hundreds of times more probable than a 360-hole ring, which previous research had suggested as a possible count. </p><p>&nbsp;Professor Graham Woan, of the University of Glasgow’s School of Physics &amp; Astronomy, is one of the authors of the paper. He said: “Towards the end of last year, a colleague pointed to me to data acquired by YouTuber Chris Budiselic, who was looking to make a replica of the calendar ring and was investigating ways to determine just how many holes it contained. </p><p>&nbsp;“It struck me as an interesting problem, and one that I thought I might be able to solve in a different way during the Christmas holidays, so I set about using some statistical techniques to answer the question.”</p><p>&nbsp;Professor Woan used a technique called Bayesian analysis, which uses probability to quantify uncertainty based on incomplete data, to calculate the likely number of holes in the mechanism using the positions of the surviving holes and the placement of the ring’s surviving six fragments. His results showed strong evidence that the mechanism’s calendar ring contained either 354 or 355 holes.</p><p>&nbsp;At the same time, one of Professor Woan’s colleagues at the University’s Institute for Gravitational Research, Dr Joseph Bayley, had also heard about the problem. He adapted techniques used by their research group to analyse the signals picked up by the LIGO gravitational wave detectors, which measure the tiny ripples in spacetime, caused by massive astronomical events like the collision of black holes, as they pass through the Earth, to scrutinise the calendar ring.</p><p>&nbsp;The Markov Chain Monte Carlo and nested sampling methods Woan and Bayley used provided a comprehensive probabilistic set of results, again suggested that the ring most likely contained 354 or 355 holes in a circle of radius 77.1mm, with an uncertainty of about 1/3 mm. It also reveals that the holes were precisely positioned with extraordinary accuracy, with an average radial variation of just 0.028mm between each hole.</p><p>&nbsp;Bayley, a co-author of the paper, is a research associate at the School of Physics &amp; Astronomy. He said: “Previous studies had suggested that the calendar ring was likely to have tracked the lunar calendar, but the dual techniques we’ve applied in this piece of work greatly increase the likelihood that this was the case. </p><p>&nbsp;“It’s given me a new appreciation for the Antikythera mechanism and the work and care that Greek craftspeople put into making it – the precision of the holes’ positioning would have required highly accurate measurement techniques and an incredibly steady hand to punch them.</p><p>&nbsp;Professor Woan added: “It’s a neat symmetry that we’ve adapted techniques we use to study the universe today to understand more about a mechanism that helped people keep track of the heavens nearly two millennia ago. </p><p>&nbsp;“We hope that our findings about the Antikythera mechanism, although less supernaturally spectacular than those made by Indiana Jones, will help deepen our understanding of how this remarkable device was made and used by the Greeks.”</p><p>&nbsp;The paper, titled ‘<a href="https://bhi.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/07-HJJuly24-AOTM-2.pdf">An Improved Calendar Ring Hole-Count for the Antikythera Mechanism: A Fresh Analysis</a>’, is published in <em>Horological Journal.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I know, I know, at this point you want "Just Ship It" to be an actual person so you could punch it in the face. As an Indie Maker, that sentence can be super frustrating because it's tired, it's cliche, and your response is always "HEY! You don't understand... it's not that easy".  </p>&nbsp;<p>I agree, it's not easy, but it's always the right thing to do. </p>&nbsp;<p>Here's why.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I started building an app on 01.01.2018. It was New Year's Eve and we just had the crappiest night ever. Yes, imagine a night <em>so bad</em> that at midnight you decide "you know what, fuck it, I'm gonna work on WEB DEVELOPMENT".<br>That bad.  </p>&nbsp;<p>The MVP was ready in a few days. I'm not that good of a coder, it's just a simple app. The 0.0.1 alpha version was more than ready. I could've released it, share it with a couple of people, and call it a day. I could've done that with every single version that I made, at any point from 2018 until now. I just wanted to add one more thing. One more feature. Just this one more thing and people will like it. One more screen and everything is gonna make sense. I swear, just this one last thing and it's ready.  </p>&nbsp;<p>BAM, last moment decision from the world's biggest dumbass:
"People wouldn't use this if it doesn't have a proper native mobile app for it. Time to learn React Native and spend a few months on that 🤦️"   </p>&nbsp;<p>God, if time machines were real, past-Kitze would be shoved in a toilet so hard right now. </p>&nbsp;<p>After 2 years of development, juggling between the fucking horror that's the web platform, React Native, Expo, GraphQL, bitching about how there's no ideal tech stack, the good old jQuery and Filezilla days, switching to other projects, releasing <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://sizzy.co/">other apps</a>, losing passion, finding passion, coming back to the app, etc. etc. etc...  </p>&nbsp;<p>I just dropped it.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I was still using it but I stopped developing it and just dropped the idea of releasing the app, ever.</p>&nbsp;<p>After a while, I was using it, but I realized that I'm missing a lot of features, so I'd either have to go back to developing it, or I'd have to find an alternative.   </p>&nbsp;<p>And boy did I find one.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I was scrolling their landing page and I was happy and furious at the same time. Someone solved the problem that I was solving. It was like someone literally read my mind and started coding. WHAT.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I have previously sent a video of my app to a couple of people (closest I came to shipping it) so I started getting suspicious if someone actually shared the video of my app with these people because they were solving literally the same problem, and they most of the features that I had.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I started getting this overwhelming happy, sad, and panicky feeling. I literally cannot explain how I felt while scrolling their page.</p>&nbsp;<p>One moment I am scrolling their list of features giggling like a little kid with a 48$ bill in a candy store (yea I know 48$ bills don't make sense, but JavaScript doesn't make sense and you're still using it), one moment I want to find these people and THROW THEM IN A PIT OF LIONS.   </p>&nbsp;<p>FUCK.    </p>&nbsp;<p>It's not their fault. I was just slow. I didn't ship on time. I'm gonna go ahead and tattoo "JUST SHIP IT" on my forehead. Nah I wouldn't be able to see it there. On my arm maybe. Nvm, let me go back to scrolling their landing page.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Fuck. They have solved everything that I wanted to solve, and WAY more. Hey, maybe I should be happy? I don't have to code anymore. Yay!? No more web platform? BLISS. Oh crap... the world is never gonna see my app though. But at least I don't have to see React Native anymore. NICE! Wait... BUT I WASTED SO MUCH TIME ON IT. FUCK.  A bunch of mixed feelings.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Here comes the saddest part, so grab a pack of tissues.   </p>&nbsp;<p>After a little bit of hesitation, I made an account. I watched the videos in their help center. Every time I caught myself smiling about a clever way they implemented something I slapped myself. NO. Bad Kitze. You shouldn't like this. THEY'RE COMPETITORS. <em>sigh</em> Sure buddy, whatever you tell yourself. Competitors to a shitty codebase sitting on your hard drive.  </p>&nbsp;<p>For 2 frickin' years, I thought it's too early to release my app because it's clunky, buggy, it's missing features, blah, blah, blah. No one would ever use it, right? I was so wrong.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I started using their app.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Even though they were working on it for the past few years it's still slow, buggy, and super unpolished, it doesn't matter, because they shipped.   </p>&nbsp;<p>Their mobile app is terrible and it needs 10 seconds to sync. It doesn't matter, they shipped. And I'm looking forward to every single update they release.</p>&nbsp;<p>Their backlog of things to do is huge, but it doesn't matter, they ship every single week, and the app is growing along with the community.  </p>&nbsp;<p>"But Kitze, even though tHeY sHiPpEd no one would pay for something unpolished and broken, right?"  </p>&nbsp;<p>Oh, Indie Hackers. So clever, yet so naive.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Today my 30-day trial has expired. A tear rolled down my cheek for every single digit of my credit card that I entered in their app. I am officially not only a subscriber, but also a fan. Every time I'll get a payment notification it's gonna feel like stepping on a lego ... glued to a knife. My bank might as well change the notification from "You have paid 5$ to ThatCompany" to "You never shipped, loser".   </p>&nbsp;<p>My app is officially dead.  </p>&nbsp;<p>99% of you are in the same boat right now, but hopefully just a few weeks into your project. Don't be a dumbass like me. Take a breath, roll your eyes at the cliche saying, but please...  </p>&nbsp;<p>Just Ship It.  </p>&nbsp;<p>P.S I would totally release and show you my app but ... it's not ready yet.  </p>&nbsp;<hr><p>Thanks for reading this! I wrote another article about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener " href="https://kitze.io/posts/github-stars-wont-pay-your-rent">my successful shipping story</a>, so I'd appreciate if you give it a read!</p>&nbsp;</div></div>]]></description>

My background was in film production and I firmly believe this is the best current way to watch films at home , as long as you don’t mind doing so alone.</p><p>The only better experience visually is a laser projector with active shutter glasses. I literally exclaimed out loud when I saw some of my shots on here for the first time. Depth for stereo movies adds so much, but you lose so much vibrancy and light with passive glasses. This solves both issues. I get why James Cameron said it was a religious experience. For fellow film makers, this is the highest quality way that I’ve experienced my own work.</p><p>It also is probably the only place at home to experience these movies at that quality. Nobody else has 4k 3D HDR with HFR. Nobody.</p><p>So as a previous film buff, it’s worth it alone for me for that.</p><p>However I also use it for work regularly. I join industry meetings with it, I multitask regularly.

                  <p>I’m still using Vision Pro for about 10-15 hours each week, but the bulk of that is spent mirroring my Mac or having focused writing time using the Obsidian iPad app—there really aren’t apps that take full advantage of the platform yet (and I don’t watch a lot of movies). Still, it’s been the best way to stay productive away from my desk. The launch was a bit rocky with bugs and missing features, but the recent updates to mirroring and keyboard/mouse support are starting to hint that Apple is focusing in on productivity as a first-class use case. I’m okay paying the premium knowing that this platform has the potential to keep heading in this direction. It feels like the hardware has a decent amount of headroom.</p>

                  <p>Yes, but in a fairly specific niche. I've found that the primary use case is for travel. It is really quite compact if you disconnect the straps. Being able to have the functional equivalent to desktop monitors is really quite handy for doing work on the road. It does struggles when not using a laptop with it despite having tried to make that work a couple times.</p>

                  <p>I hope Apple makes a comparison product to Meta Ray Bans which i use daily.  Though today using my Ray Bans today and asking it questions got tedious and annoying as the reliability of "Hey Meta," working is 60 to 65 percent of the time.  I did wish for a disply to get the info instead of having to ask questions and intently listen.</p>
