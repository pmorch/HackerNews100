<p>how are you doing, fellow unemployeds? enjoying riding your bikes midday past the three-piece suits?</p>
<p><a href="https://mattsta.b-cdn.net/panic/software-jobs.png"><img src="https://mattsta.b-cdn.net/panic/software-jobs.png" width="100%"></a></p>
<h3 id="_interest-rates">Interest Rates</h3>
<p>so, uh, what’s going on?</p>
<p><a href="https://mattsta.b-cdn.net/panic/interest-rates.png"><img src="https://mattsta.b-cdn.net/panic/interest-rates.png" width="100%"></a></p>
<p>Basically, all the “free money” went away when the gubbment mandated interest rates go from years of declining-or-near-zero percent to now over 5% (curiously, a 5% increase in the fed rate also caused all credit cards rates to go from 9% to 30% over the same timeframe. what world).</p>
<p>Why would interest rates cause jobs to go away? Remember an interest rate is essentially “the price of money” — a higher interest rate means money is more expensive itself. Also with higher interest rates, organizations with millions and billions of cash sitting idle can park their money in safe government-backed interest accounts<a href="#_fn2" id="_fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> to grow their balances risk-free instead of taking on risk assets seeking outsized returns.</p>
<p>What counts as risk assets avoided during high interest rate periods? Well, funding companies with uncertain futures is a pretty risky asset. So, at times of high interest rates, the weaker companies collapse, strong companies use high interest rates as an excuse to “clean house” every 10 years, then a couple hundred thousand previously high compensation workers discover there are no jobs for anybody anymore over the next 2-4 years.</p>
<p>By the power of drawing two lines, we see <em>correlation is causation</em> and you can’t argue otherwise:</p>
<p><a href="https://mattsta.b-cdn.net/panic/job-rates.png"><img src="https://mattsta.b-cdn.net/panic/job-rates.png" width="100%"></a></p>
<p>interest rates go up, jobs go down. never a miscommunication. you can explain that.</p>
<h2 id="_company-structures">Company Structures</h2>
<p>Why do interest rate increases specifically destroy <em>tech jobs</em> while other sectors like minimum wage part time jobs or construction jobs have been increasing over rising interest rate periods?</p>
<p>Tech companies fall into one of four categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>nepo companies</strong> where your friends have unlimited money, so you get to live in a fantasy world of building unrealistic unmarketable dreams using family nepo money. You never have to really interface with reality to ever be proven wrong. See things like the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-the-trendiest-grilled-cheese-venture-got-burnt/">VC funded grilled cheese startup</a> or the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/05/juicero-yves-bhar/">VC funded baby food dispenser</a> or the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/theranos-and-silicon-valleys-fake-it-till-you-make-it-culture/">nextdoor neighbor VC funded medical fraud</a> or the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/18/weworks-neumann-wants-to-live-forever-and-be-the-first-trillionaire.html">VC funded megalomania “i will become king of Earth” desk renting company</a> or the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/why-silicon-valley-falls-for-frauds/">VC funded stanford drugs-and-sex crypto club</a> not to be confused with the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/17da5r9/peter_thiel_reflects_on_funding_miri_and_yud/">VC funded berkeley apocalypse</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUkHSPdudn4">cult</a>, etc.</li>
<li><strong>speculation companies</strong> where somebody has an idea, but no product yet and no customers, and also no idea if there’s a market for the product, but they get money to try and build an organization to find out if the idea will work anyway.</li>
<li><strong>initial growth companies</strong> where you had an idea, it starts to become popular, so you trade some ownership in exchange for cash/capital funding for growing your ideas into generating as much revenue as possible. This is also where things like the world famous YC incubator and 500 Cats and Techmoan come into play. Initial growth companies are the next step up from a speculation company after products begin experiencing actual customer demand.
<ul>
<li>fun fact: before the modern “tech accelerator” era, each big city, not named san franciso or boston, had something like a “startup boss” where you’d potentially pay hundreds to thousands of dollars to “present your idea” to the local “angel funding mafia” and then, if you passed, they would give you $50,000 in exchange for taking 80% of your company. This status quo lasted for decades until YC proved the system was essentially fools funding fools. The other fun part: after the “startup mafia” in your city legally owned 80% of your company, they would let you work as founder for about 6-18 months then just fire you and replace you with their own friends. At the first 3 companies I worked at, the CEOs were failed lawyer friends of VCs, installed by the VCs to replace the original founders, due to VC using exploitative legal trickery at every turn possible.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>stable era companies</strong> with a repeatable GTM capability with access to customers and recurring revenue cycles. Stable era companies are essentially what normal people think of as “a company” —&nbsp;a self-supporting corporate entity with growth and stability for all involved (usually).</li>
</ul>
<p>Each category of company has its own benefits and drawbacks.</p>
<p>Related to interest rates, the less successful a company, the more it relies on VC funding, and during high interest rate periods VC funding tends to slow down or vanish completely. Higher interest rates also means your <em>customers</em> have more restrictive spending conditions, so your customers will pull back, reduce, or leave too. Interest rate growth kills speculation companies and truncates or collapses initial growth companies into baseline sustenance mode until the economy opens up to take on more risk again.</p>
<h3 id="_company-level-to-compensation-scale">Company Level to Compensation Scale</h3>
<p>When companies have different sizes, funding, revenue, and war chest balances, it all impacts how much compensation lowly employee scum can receive.</p>
<p>For ease of brain math, we’re going to roughly normalize fully loaded compensation to a per-day rate instead of per-year because the numbers feel more meaningful on a daily scale (and just remember to divide all compensation numbers in half to account for employment taxes).</p>
<h4 id="_nepo-company-pay-scale">Nepo Company Pay Scale</h4>
<p>If you are a fancy imaginary nepo company, there’s no limit to what you can pay employees because your entire company is a weird in-group fictional entity. You can be paid $100 per day or $100,000 per day depending on your personal connection to the power structures. There’s no real conclusions to be drawn from imaginary companies paying their friends whatever they can.</p>
<p>Nepo companies are the most frustrating because they suck up all the media attention for being outsized celebrity driven fads (and they also set the tone for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2017/02/25/rip-livingsocial-the-fast-rise-and-slow-demise-of-a-daily-deals-company/">accelerating unsustainable fad-to-failure cycles</a>).</p>
<p>These companies leave you thinking “i could have made much better products with so much less wasted funding. too bad I wasn’t born rich/connected/bro-lyfe.” These companies, due to their imbalance of meta-funding-vs-tiny-impact, usually explode in a huge exposé about fraud and corruption leaving the founders no choice but to either <a href="https://a16z.com/podcast/disrupting-the-worlds-largest-asset-class-with-adam-neumann/">fail upward forever</a> or <a href="https://www.integrityline.com/expertise/blog/elizabeth-holmes-theranos/">do not pass go</a>.</p>
<h4 id="_speculation-company-pay-scale">Speculation Company Pay Scale</h4>
<p>The smallest form of companies (pre-revenue, pre-growth, pre-customer, barely with an idea) are speculation companies doing what they can to get by every day.</p>
<p>Speculation companies are places to work when you’re a crazy child and so ambitious for a juvenile. You won’t see Tim Apple going to work for two 21 year old code bros living in Peoria trying to disrupt Google.</p>
<p>Working at pre-revenue low-idea companies is a real <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office/">loser move</a> if you have any personal marketable experience at all.</p>
<p>These companies will have a pay scale somewhere around 50% to 80% of market rate yet expect 200% to 500% more work than any other professional setting. If you’re not living in a $600/month studio apartment, it’s not worth your time (unless you have some insider information about the organization being a secret tax avoidance or money laundering acquisition scam. sometimes zero-product zero-revenue companies go from no idea to being acquired for a couple billion dollars in a year or two —&nbsp;this is a common pattern for “academic researchers” to form a fake company, vest their shares, then get acquired on basically a huge tax-advantaged hiring bonus at some big tech).</p>
<h4 id="_initial-growth-company-pay-scale">Initial Growth Company Pay Scale</h4>
<p>Initial growth companies have been the ruin of many a poor boy.</p>
<p>Initial growth companies are the worst combination of high-risk, low-reward effort-vs-compensation tradeoffs. Sadly, getting trapped in underperforming initial growth companies is something I never realized was a lifetime risk until way too late to save myself. Now I’ve got <em>nothing</em> to show of my life of work, while other people who just picked a better company to work at 20 years ago and never left have been growing their wealth by a couple million dollars per year every year for almost their entire career, all working as just some rando middle manager at multi-trillion-dollar companies.</p>
<p>Initial growth companies are often unprofitable and just huffing VC fumes to stay alive waiting until some combination of “hopes and dreams” activates then the company “takes off” and everything just works out.</p>
<p>While you’re working at an underfunded, under-compensated, low-growth company just to get by, other people you know will be working at multi-trillion dollar companies making 5x to 50x your compensation for doing the same work or less.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of initial growth companies is only to “make the founders rich” and practically nothing else matters.</p>
<p>There are sub-categories of initial growth companies though:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>growth uptrend</strong>, which is <em>potentially</em> interesting if a company is <em>actually</em> working and will survive, because some initial growth companies do turn into real stable era companies (which is the gambler’s lie under-performing downtrend companies really hype to all employees: JOIN US WHILE WE ARE SMALL! WE WILL GROW FROM -$12 million income per year to $300 trillion income per year in six months!!! CATCH THE WAVE!).</li>
<li><strong>growth downtrend</strong>, which is <em>the worst for all involved</em> because you will end up in a decaying cycle of low compensation combined with serial company layoffs because the company is just failing, but refuses to outright cease to exist (working at these is called “wasting your life”).</li>
<li><strong>stable but zero-growth</strong>, which is interesting but not useful. There is no such thing as a zero-growth low-scale company. If there is no growth, you can’t hire or have compensation increases. Likely, if there is no growth, the entire corporate plan will be adjusted into either “coast forever” mode where all employees get reduced to a skeleton crew and 90% of others are laid off so the founders can just collective passive income forever (or sell the company off for parts in a break-even VC acquihire maneuver). Meanwhile, other people you know working in real companies will continue having exponential compensation growth due to their free passive yearly stock allocation on liquid markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess one rule of thumb is it doesn’t make sense to work for companies who aren’t listed on the US stock market. The best time to join Apple was 25 years ago. The next best time is today? Who knows. What is it like to join a company where all the co-workers your same age have made $10+ million over the past 4 years while you are joining with nothing?</p>
<h4 id="_stable-era-company-pay-scale">Stable Era Company Pay Scale</h4>
<p>Stable era companies are long-lived organization not subject to going bankrupt due to quarterly market trends or government economic policy changes.</p>
<p>Stable era companies also have sub-categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>stable stable</strong>, which is consistently growing, consistently profitable, and paying employees $5k to $10k per day at current full comp market rates. These are largely flying under the news radar. These companies aren’t Google or Apple, but rather some tractor company or heavy manufacturing company just churning out results for years without destabilizing the world. Stable stable companies do that thing where every quarter they “beat expectations” on their stock reports by a coincidental $0.01 just to prove they are always growing.</li>
<li><strong>stable unstable, stable-qua-ego</strong>, which is a combination of a popular company controlled by a popular “celebrity CEO” figure. These companies tend to be as manic/bipolar/depressed as their CEOs floating between mega growth phases to mega collapse phases then back to mega growth phases in cycles of 6-18 months each. The growth/collapse phases usually don’t impact your $10k to $20k per day compensation unless you get caught in a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/01/metas-year-of-efficiency-everything-wall-street-needed-to-hear.html">“Year of Efficiency”</a> as euphemism for laying off 50,000 employees while the CEO continues to spend $100 million per year buying private islands.</li>
<li><strong>stable neutronium</strong>, which is when a company controls one or more sectors of the global economy and just can’t be broken. They tend to have stable management, exponentially growing stock prices, and thus exponentially growing compensation for useful employees.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the modern tech landscape, stable “hyperscale ultra-growth” companies are paying experienced employees the equivalent of $10,000 to $50,000 <em>per day</em> if we include the value of their exponentially growing yearly stock grants. Meanwhile, back in the real world, other companies argue salaries shouldn’t increase for 10 years because “who needs money anyway” or “developers are too expensive” so you are stuck with 10 years of no practical salary growth<a href="#_fn3" id="_fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and no viable passive stock grants (if you can get a job at all).</p>
<p>Big companies are a gift and a curse because with great size comes great ability for outright economic capture manipulation. At a fundamental level, everybody kinda knows big companies aren’t the best places for “good” things because the default mindset is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NjudKKildo">big company bad</a> so we continue ignoring <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/2513389/vmware-licensing-and-pricing-hikes-what-options-do-you-have.html">corporate exploitative profit capture</a> is <a href="https://www.volico.com/vmware-10x-price-increase-leaves-companies-looking-for-alternatives/">the inevitable way</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/broadcom-execs-say-vmware-price-subscription-complaints-are-unwarranted/">the world</a>.</p>
<h2 id="_how-to-get-hired">How to Get Hired</h2>
<p>Tech jobs are paradoxical because everybody agrees on three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>the tech job requirements are completely broken</li>
<li>the tech job interview process is completely broken</li>
<li>yet, every company follows the same hiring process and posts the same job requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>I think the entire problem of modern tech hiring comes down to the midwit meme:</p>
<p><a href="https://mattsta.b-cdn.net/panic/midwit.png"><img src="https://mattsta.b-cdn.net/panic/midwit.png" width="80%"></a></p>
<p>Let’s ignore the “IQ” axis and just consider “capability points” or some metric for scaling experience and ability.</p>
<p>The key to midwit meme humor is always the “most advanced” people often use simple solutions indistinguishable from people who don’t know what they are doing. Average people are often in the “knows enough to be dangerous” category by over-thinking and over-working and over-processing everything out of lack of more complete experience to discover simpler and cleaner solutions. We find the midwit problem in job interviews all the time where interviewers think they are “elite special evaluators” needing to gatekeep the unwashed hoards of desperate candidates, but interviewers often can’t reliably judge or measure people who have better answers than they expect.</p>
<h3 id="_scaling-laws">Scaling Laws</h3>
<p>According to all the interviews I’ve failed over the years (I don’t think I’ve ever passed an actual “coding interview” anywhere?), the entire goal of tech hiring is just finding people in the 100 to 115 midwit block then outright rejecting everybody else as too much of an unknown risk.</p>
<p>If you fail the weird mandatory performance-on-demand interviews full of random tasks unrelated to the actual job role, interviewers immediately assume you are a 0 to 55, but they can’t actually tell if you are in the 120 to 200 range instead — especially in the case of, well, what if the interviewer has less experience or less knowledge or less ability than the candidate, so the interviewer <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?BlubParadox">just can’t detect high performing people</a>?</p>
<p>Personally, I’ve had interviews where the hiring manager seemingly doesn’t know how anything works but they are also in charge of the product architecture? You ask why their platform has a dozen broken features when you tried to use it (and it overcharged you by thousands of dollars a month for services not even provided), but you just get blank stares back because the 24 year old “lead senior engineering manager product architect” doesn’t actually know how systems, platforms, architecture, networking, dns, ssh, monitoring, usability, observability, reliability, or capacity planning works? Then, of course, you get rejected under some false pretense of “not having enough experience” when you’re trying to promote developing fixes to their seemingly decaying platform<a href="#_fn4" id="_fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Modern tech hiring, due to <a href="https://research.google/blog/hiring-the-lake-wobegon-strategy/">industry-wide persistent fear mongering</a> about not hiring “secretly incompetent people,” has become a game divorced from meaningfully judging individual experience and impact. Most tech interviews are as relevant to job performance as if hiring a baker required interviewing them about how electron orbitals bind worked gluten together then rejecting bakers who don’t immediately draw a valid orbital configuration.</p>
<p>I remember fully giving up on ever interviewing at Google after an interviewer just barked graph theory questions through a low quality speakerphone with their laptop right next to the microphone so all you could hear is loud typing and an angry man complaining you aren’t solving their irrelevant questions fast enough. The entire industry just kinda accepts candidates should have negative and personally degrading interview experiences where candidates are undermined by some vague sense of social superiority from the interviewers. Sure, it would be great to have big tech $30,000 per day comp packages, but they long ago decided to prefer <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1cd862u/the_men_who_killed_google_search/">hiring the wrong people</a> passing the right tests instead actually evaluating people around experience and capability and ambition.</p>
<h3 id="_the-great-attractor">The Great Attractor</h3>

</video>
<p>The weirdest part of watching the tech interview landscape change over the past 20 years is it keeps getting worse everywhere all in the same ways.</p>
<p>“big tech” created the concept of “the coding test” as the primary interview criteria. Why? Google was founded under the mindset of being a “Post-Grad-School Grad School” so they demand everybody pass a mini secondary GRE to walk amongst their austere big wrinkle brain ranks. Soon after Google became successful, the founders joked they wouldn’t be able to pass a Google interview test anymore. Yeah, real funny guys, making a system so selective for anti-ability where useful people can’t even get in the door anymore, great job everybody.</p>
<p>Now, every company from 3 person speculative startups to 50,000 person big tech firms all use <em>the same hiring practices</em> which seems between somewhat inefficient to outright overbearing. In what world should I put in the same effort to join a zero-growth, unprofitable company going out of business in 3 years compared to joining a multi-trillion-dollar company paying 30x the compensation of a startup?</p>
<p>Much like how every company copied the google “big tech big interview over 6-12 weeks” cycle, companies have added an additional interview step copied from Amazon: the “behavioral interview” curse (also see: “the bar raiser curse” as well).</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, the “behavioral interview” is essentially the same as a <a href="https://www.scientology.org/what-is-scientology/the-practice-of-scientology/the-auditing-session.html">Scientology intake</a> session except, you know, for capitalism instead. You have to answer the same 8 questions at every interview around “so what would <em>you</em> do if you had a conflict at work?” where the interviewer treats you like a 5 year old learning about people for the first time instead of acknowledging you as a professional with 0.5, 1, 2, 3 decades of experience.</p>
<p>The current “behavioral interview” weirdness is somewhat of an offshoot from the original idea about “hiring for culture fit,” but traditional “culture fit” evaluation was just personal interviewer <em>vibes</em> around how candidates acted during an interview. We’ve all seen candidates who are uncooperative or excessively negative with no recourse or just weird in an anti-socially draining way, so clearly pass on actively dangerous people, but attempting to codify “is a person a good person” into call-and-response questioning is a fundamentally broken concept.</p>
<p>The actual goal of any “behavioral interview” or “culture fit” estimation is simple, but nobody ever lays it out. The goal of culture checking is <em>only</em>: determine how a candidate handles the tradeoffs between progress vs.&nbsp;kindness.</p>
<p>A secondary goal of the “behavioral interview” is personality homogenization where companies want to enforce not hiring anybody “too different” from their current mean personality engram. Yet, the tech industry is historically full of weird divergent people doing great things for their own reasons (though, due to just basic population growth over the past 20 years, there are tens of millions more “normie computer people” now offsetting all the smaller pool of original “weird computer people”). When you start enforcing personality bubbles outside of <em>what</em> somebody can do, you’re just doing some sort of weird economic eugenics thing <em>(make programming weird again!)</em>.</p>
<p>The trick with “behavioral interview” is there are no true good answers. They want to watch you squirm. The answers depend on:</p>
<ul>
<li>in your hypothetical scenarios about “resolving disagreements,” what is the power dynamic?
<ul>
<li>Am I asking the CEO why we have 50 sales people but only have 3 developers and I’d like more developers?</li>
<li>Am I criticizing an intern for blowing up the site for the 3rd week in a row when they didn’t follow documented deployment guidelines like we’ve reprimanded them for twice before?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>in your hypothetical scenarios about “tell me a time you made a mistake and apologized” relevant to anything? I’m not here to interview about my past failures, so we either make up fake “humble brag” failures or tell you about actual failures which will give you more ammunition to think less of us and tank the entire interview process?
<ul>
<li>It’s the equivalent of bad bid-side negotiators starting with “tell me the lowest price you’ll accept” which isn’t how anything in the world works at all. Interviews are about showing your best side, not trying to micromanage a list of perceived historical faults to a point where you disqualify yourself via your own confessions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What level of asking candidates to expose their raw past failures and arguments and disagreements just too much information? You don’t have a right to view the total perspective vortex of every decision in my life as employment criteria. If you want to guarantee team cohesion, build good teams, position managers so they have awareness of everybody’s strengths and weaknesses, and have your managers be experts in conflict resolution.</li>
<li>I think another goal of “behavioral interviews” is to show how much you enjoy compromise. There are compromise tradeoffs though. Finding middle ground between a broken solution and a working solution doesn’t leave you with a working product. Compromise can happen around opinions, but not facts. I always get the feeling interviewers want you to talk about some time you were right then gave up being right for a worse solution just so the other person/department feels better. Are we here to create good products or not?</li>
</ul>
<p>sorry, I think I just failed your behavioral interview again. Good thing I can just interview at another company. Oh, wait, every company asks the same questions and demands the same answers from the same book on “how to do interview good” and if you deviate from the expected answers in the book, no income 4 u. good luck on your unemployment journey until the employment meta changes again.</p>
<p>Looping back to a point: is there some condition when having every company continue to add more interview steps unrelated to job tasks and experience and capability and ambition and insight will just collapse the entire industry? Sorry, you’re not qualified to be a professional software developer because you wore the wrong color shirt to the interview. You should know the color buleruplange is triggering to generation delta, so you clearly are not a culture fit for this job paying $120,000 per hour, and no, we will not be looking over your 25 years of professional experience at all.</p>
<p>Companies seem to forget they are also part of, you know, the <strong>economy</strong> and people need <strong>compensation</strong> to, you know, <strong>not die</strong>, right? If you aren’t acting as an economic engine for helping the most people thrive, what is your purpose as a company?</p>

<p>like, my dude, your single job requirements are actually 5 entire departments worth of work to be shared across a total of 20 people. yet, you see single-person job descriptions resembling this <em>all over the place</em>.</p>
<p>At some point, half the industry just gave up on the idea any technical person should specialize in anything. Just make it all up as you go along. It’s just typing, how hard can it be? You can’t just demand application developers also be part time amateur aws architects and expect good results. Experience in these roles is built over 5+ years at a time through focused work, but half the industry is now corrupted into “devops means DEVS DO OPS means OPS REQUIRES NO EXPERIENCE means NOTHING REQUIRES EXPERIENCE so FIRE OPS HIRE DEVS and just 15x ALL JOB RESPONSIBILITIES” (without any matching 15x increase in compensation, of course).</p>
<p>Such job descriptions also means: your job is physically impossible. You will always feel drained and incompetent because you can’t actually do everything everyday. You will always be behind because each of those bullet points can be multiple days of work per week just on their own (plus, how are you supposed to be productive in 35 different areas requiring months to years of experience if you actually want to be good at each task?). So, from day 1, you will already be about 4 months behind on your expected job responsibilities and you’ll never catch up. It turns into an endless game of managers and executives saying you are “underperforming” because you have 18 primary tasks, each primary task requires 4 to 20 hours of effort, and every manager wants their task done within 4 hours. You are setup to fail. What’s the point?</p>
<p>Maybe a point is some companies just shouldn’t exist if they can’t afford the fully staffed professional teams required to build and maintain their products? The worst secret in tech is amateur developers are happy to act like entry level workers across 20 arbitrary roles for years (in the absence of never having enough time to focus on building up long-term experience or best practices). You can’t get gud if you are always rushed from task to task without any chance of leveling up knowledge and capability through “deep work” as we would historically expect of professionals.</p>
<h3 id="_field-report-job-experience-notes">Field Report: Job Experience Notes</h3>
<p>Here’s some things I’ve seen in “the real world” over a couple jobs. Some minor details have been altered to protect the guilty.</p>
<p>These are just to highlight how often companies have completely broken internal practices and don’t even know it. The solutions are fairly basic, but you can only see the solutions if you have actual experience knowing how everything works in the first place (and know where experience comes from? 5, 10, 15+ years of <em>actually</em> doing focused work and <em>actually</em> building systems from the ground-up over and over and over again—it takes completely re-building something 3-5 times over anywhere from 3 months to 5 years before you actually start to be good at a task).</p>
<p>How do you document real life when real life is getting more like fiction each day?</p>
<ul>
<li>Company said their “site was slow” and they didn’t know why. I looked at their AWS metrics and the single database server running the entire company was one mysql database with 2 cores and 16 GB RAM they created 5 years ago and never touched again. Their database had grown to 3 TB on the slowest disks AWS offered plus their working set size had grown to about 50 GB. The database was at 99.99% CPU usage, and had been at 99.99% CPU consistently for the past two years based on the built-in AWS metrics. They never looked at metrics or performance because “We are a cloud native company so we don’t do low value non-product-related tasks like system administration.”
<ul>
<li>Solution: I upgraded the database instances to 64 GB ARM servers with reserved IOPS and their batch data transformation tools went from taking 16 hours to 20 minutes. Also the DB replicas went from having 4-6 weeks of replication lag (again, completely unmonitored for years) to real-time sub-second updates across regions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Company said “their site was slow” and they didn’t know why. Turns out they had two database clusters: one for production and one for research. The research cluster had 8 instances costing $5,000 per month total. The production cluster had 2 instances costing $500 per month total. The research cluster hadn’t been used in two years.
<ul>
<li>Solution: I swapped the sizes so the production cluster now owned all the resources and the unused dev/research cluster had almost no resources. I also switched all instances to ARM so they were cheaper too. The production site went from 7 seconds for an interactive user response to 200 ms for a user response due to the increased capacity. The non-technical company owners had just accepted their system was slow for the past couple years without ever looking into possible fixes because, once again, “the cloud means we never have to manage anything. only agile story point product features matter.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Company had a couple custom data processing tools. Their internal data processing API tools were installed on the same 2 EC2 2-core instances as their customer-facing web servers. The data processing tools were CPU heavy and teams complained it took 20 hours to run a full processing batch.
<ul>
<li>Solution: I moved the data processing tools to dedicated containers for auto-scaling via ECS-on-EC2 instances (using fastest EC2 instances available too instead of deprecated EC2 instances like their web servers) and it immediately auto-scaled up to <em>20 to 50 concurrent containers</em> for processing live data instead of being stuck on 2 previous outdated servers only. The data processing times went from 20 hours to 30 minutes. They had been running the previous “only deploy internal APIs on our two 2-core web servers” pattern for 7 years.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>More fun AWS architecture things at various companies like fixing subnet-vs-NAT-gateway deployments to save companies a thousand dollars a day just by altering network paths to avoid NAT gateway fees. Companies often don’t realize AWS isn’t hands off “zero-experience needed magic cloud;” AWS is actually “datacenter as a service” and if you don’t have experience managing datacenters and network architecture and disks and a dozen other system-level platform architectures then your AWS account is probably in a bad state.</li>
<li>Many common things across companies where they just did work 5 years ago and never updated their systems for <a href="https://matt.sh/python-project-structure-2024">modern practices</a>. If you see people using <code>requirements.txt</code> in the wild instead of a <code>poetry</code> lock file or you see people using the decades-long broken python built-in logging framework instead of <code>loguru</code> you can see there’s opportunities for improvement everywhere (amusingly (or sadly) every seven-figure-comp-AI-developer project I see from “big tech labs” are all using amateur python programming practices from 10+ years ago and they don’t even realize it or care to fix it. 🤷‍♂️).</li>
<li>Company said their tool for extracting production data from mysql into redshift went from taking 40 hours last year to taking 80 hours this year and it continues to slow down by the month.
<ul>
<li>Problem: I ran their extraction script and it just did nothing. I added more logging. It did nothing. I added even more logging. The script stalled on startup at trying to <code>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM &lt;table with 3 billion rows&gt;</code> —&nbsp;this step took <em>11 hours</em> alone because the “Senior Lead Data Scientist” who wrote this system (with 6 months of experience in charge of the entire department) didn’t know how databases or AWS or networking work at all (and wasn’t given permission from management to actually learn everything or focus on fixing problems over time when making the data transfer utility). Also, after the 11 hour <code>COUNT(*)</code> completed, they used the count result to <em>only determine the maximum value</em> to run a custom loop of <code>SELECT * FROM &lt;table&gt; LIMIT N OFFSET K</code> where they would write every result to the network EBS storage as a CSV in <code>N</code> batches, then load the CSV and re-save it as <code>.csv.gz</code> to EBS, then re-read the <code>.csv.gz</code> from EBS to upload it to S3. You can’t do this. It makes no sense if you have any experience building complex systems inside AWS (EBS is toxic for reads and writes like that, never create a system doing thousands of micro-writes and micro-reads to/from EBS) or even with mysql from 30 years ago. Also, this pattern of “count all, walk entire table with limit/offset” had made its way into a dozen other internal utilities at the company (copy/paste development ftw) so we had to track down <em>every</em> place it was used to do custom refactors for proper database cursor and streaming write logic everywhere.</li>
<li>Solution: I introduced them to the concept of “database cursors” so you don’t run an 11 hour <code>COUNT(*)</code> up front. Then you don’t have to abuse <code>LIMIT/OFFSET</code> queries. I introduced them to streaming S3 writes with in-line in-memory compression to avoid writing anything to EBS at all. The extraction process went from 80 hours to <strong>40 minutes</strong>. Yet, the company still said they “don’t need to hire people with experience because everything is cloud native so anybody can just figure things out.” — This company tolerated a year of 80 hour data imports because “cloud native” means “experience doesn’t matter” and they didn’t have anybody in the entire company to even detect the problem because “only product features matter, we don’t want to hire low value sysadmins.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Company has $10 million in funding and an initial boost of customers trying their products, then the customers start to go away. The solution to customers leaving, as mandated by the fail-upward VCs controlling the company: “hire more sales people.” So, over two years, the company expands their sales and marketing team to 50 people while keeping developer count fixed at 5 people. Eventually, the sales people haven’t closed a sale in 10 months (because the product is so weak nobody wants to buy it), so the solution is to continue the VC demands of hiring 3 more sales people per week plus start laying off developers because the VC mandate is “only sales matter, the product doesn’t matter, sales people can sell anything.”</li>
<li>Various variations on the above theme of “sales above all else” where companies double down on an idea that worked 2-5 years prior but is now just a dead idea in a dead company, but management refuses to expand or “pivot” their product to meet the market. These companies always fail due to executives just doubling down on their personal “executive genius” while developers are screaming “you aren’t letting us build products people actually want…”
<ul>
<li>Historical note: I’ve only worked at startups or initial idea attempted “scale-up” companies, so now my resume is now just a series of 5 completely dead companies nobody cares about, which looks great for applying to jobs. Dead companies doesn’t mean dead useless experience though, yah? Is it my fault I can’t get hired at good companies? I don’t know. It’s not my fault companies fail though. I try to help, but when VC brain disease runs all companies into the ground instead of prioritizing building good products on high performance platforms, there’s only so much you can do before leaving dying companies (then repeat at the next dying company forever?).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>On the same theme of corporate priority: rudderless companies often end up in a situation where they are so desperate for sales, they try to incentivize the sales people with outsized commission packages valued at 200% to 500% of what developers in the company make (meet your sales goals for a seven figure bonus! sorry, developers don’t have a bonus program because the company only cares about sales, but how about another 0.0003% in dead equity after our 3rd down round?). At this point, there’s no value in remaining at a company if sales people are making more than people creating the product(s).</li>
<li>I’ve rejected candidates during interviews too, so I’m not running around advocating <em>everybody</em> should be hired blindly. I’ve seen multiple candidates who refuse to turn on their camera even though it was listed as a remote job with such expectations. You start to think HR just let too many scammers through. One said “I am not allowed to turn my camera on because I have a pact with my husband I am not allowed to be seen on the Internet” (this person also sent a <em>30 page</em> resume which looked like “i do everything, so hire me” from a contractor remote job scam harvesting operation). Another no-cam person said they were “in transit” and refused to turn on a camera even though they were calling through the Zoom app. Sometimes you also have people who just apply too high and hope to get through. We had one person apply for a Senior Python Data Engineer role and they couldn’t name any version of python (they said “something like 2 or 3? i don’t know.”) — those details matter when huge language features and behaviors change once a year with every major point release! don’t be bringing your outdated Python 3.7 sand castle to my Python 3.12 cathedral.</li>
<li>Company founder/CTO who just gets bored on the weekends and starts personally modifying things, breaking live services, then demands developers immediately all go to the office Saturdays at 6pm to fix what he broke because “the company is down.”</li>
<li>Company with bespoke internal platforms for customers where each customer needs its own codebase. The company started by just copying the previous customer codebase into a new customer codebase the first time this happened. Then it happened again and again. Now, 7 years later, the company has 12 repositories all doing 95% the same thing with 5% custom code per customer type. Due to their process being “copy the most recent codebase into a new repo,” the 12 repos have 12 different package lock files and 36 different container deployment strategies ((dev, prod, testing) * 12) and use 5 different versions of Python and each codebase has fragments of bugs sometimes fixed and sometimes not across all the repos.
<ul>
<li>Solution: enough is enough, I gave everybody two days off and just ran through 20 hours of aggressively merging and validating everything into one repository with one package lock file under the most modern python version with 3 clean container deployment strategies covering all customers at once (plus getting type safety checks added everywhere, making common shared modules instead of copy/paste everywhere, centralizing metrics and reporting instead of ad-hoc hand-written output everywhere).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Company in California with a motto of “never hire Americans because 16 year old outsourced Croatian interns know everything already” asked me to review their architecture. It wasn’t great. Their entire platform was built on 7 year old ubuntu EC2 instances that hadn’t been rebooted in 5 years. They technically had logging, but they had no alerting and no metrics. They basically only looked into product problems if customers complained (but customer complaints had to go through the “account manager” to the “product team” to the “product manager” to the “project manager” before developers would be notified of problems).
<ul>
<li>Solution: I added a combination of EventBridge hooks triggering Lambda Functions to post live AWS service warnings directly into a chat channel. I added a log parser so they would also get real time application notices/warnings via chat when customers were seeing broken features. I added metrics to a dozen of their internal microservices and setup an “infinite scale” prometheus/victoriametrics cluster to collect and log and alert and graph trends over time. The company thought they had 10,000 users per day based on what their Croatian interns were telling the CEO based on a dozen of their front-end-only javascript/spyware analytics plugins, but my internal metrics showed only 300 users per day actually used the backend APIs. great job, everybody! The alerts also showed the company when the CEO’s brother would do things like delete all user data by mistake at 7am (remember to always give your family members full root admin access to all services so they can use generic desktop app database GUIs to edit user data directly, who cares if they delete users or corrupt data all the time?). The alerts also showed fun things like when the “Data Science Team” would write SQL queries over a small 64k row table yet mistakenly generate 12 billion rows of results due to how they wrote 5-level-nested JSON cross product column extraction queries (show me a love story more true than data science people adding nested JSON columns to relational databases).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The saddest part is when companies <em>have a good chance</em> at surviving a mild downtrend, but either remain so committed to the past or too committed to executive dysfunction where nobody can steer towards a more reality-based future-oriented product direction. I’ve seen companies making $5 million a month in revenue just evaporate over 3 years because their original idea falls out of popularity and the executives refuse to adapt to better ideas. I’ve seen companies go from a billion in funding to being sold for parts because the CEO is too busy buying horses to keep his wife happy instead of actually running the company. I’ve seen companies just give up and get acquired by some big tech because the CEO was offered a personal $100 million gift when he agrees to the acquisition, then 90% of the company is let go after the acquisition. Feels great to work forever on the zero-reward side of a winner-take-most-but-the-winner-aint-you professional economy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps the saddest thing is it looks like I am a full time architecture-only, no-product-value person, but it’s only because everybody else in these companies has no architecture experience and doesn’t care to learn. Sure, I have 20 years of experience is datacenter build-outs and system architecture and high performance platforms, so when all these modern “cloud native” companies insist on only hiring “app dev javascript” employees without any real platform building experience, we see why all these modern “cloud native” orgs end up with completely broken infrastructure (at least until somebody who has actually accomplished something shows up to fix everything for them—most of these places are stuck in a loop of “we don’t know what we don’t know” so they are unaware of even the right questions to ask or the right systems to build in the first place).</p>
<p>I don’t know about you, but I care about company structure, product issues, platform scalability and reliability, customer usability, developer usability, performance, legal compliance, security, corporate scalability, and team cohesion all at the same time. These are issues which don’t appear on your story point burndown boards because they are cross-functional improvements across multiple departments. Somehow constantly improving and fixing and making everything better in ways nobody else can seem to do isn’t enough to get through a company’s hiring cycle these days though.</p>
<p>Also amusing: I think people will have different reactions to the block of anecdotes above. People will either be “heck yeah fix all the things!” or people will side with “you are clearly incompetent because you didn’t use ‘We’ statements anywhere and you only talked about how you did all the work yourself.” Well, for one these are just highlights. and, for two, there’s only so much “We” you can bring into every task when your team is 4 people having 16 months of tickets backlog’d with management mandating daily story point accounting updates. When you can do individual optimization tasks 3x to 5x faster than sharing the work (no need for synchronizing meetings and knowledge and project setup duplicated across 5 people) sometimes just doing the work and moving on is the best use of resources. We don’t have time to stop the entire product roadmap for “everybody on technical staff fixes everything” because the company refuses to build out actual infrastructure and platform teams (thanks, <em>devops mind virus</em>), so we end up with “single capable person doing the work of what should be 20 people across 5 departments alone” patterns. Sometimes good is just good and you get the work done by <em>doing the f’ing work</em> by any means necessary.</p>

<p>What used to be as simple as “i good wit commputr. u giv jorb?” is now a synthetic convoluted social status driven hierarchy of mind games just to get an initial interview then you are treated as a blank slate having to prove you can even read and write and speak from first principles.</p>
<p>Most interview processes don’t even consider a person’s actual work and experience and capability. You must always open your brain live in front of people to dump out immediate answer to a series of pointless problems because if you can’t solve a pointless problem with no preparation you clearly can’t do anything of value for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Most of the interview tricks in use now are being repeated by people who learned “how to do interview” from books or 15 year old online interview guides. Modern interviewers don’t seem to always have the full picture of what they are even trying to accomplish from the interview. I was there when people made all these things up the first time in 2006-2009. You are trying to use trickery on me which we made up to stop people less capable than us, and now we are trapped having to constantly prove we aren’t scams when we <em>clearly aren’t scams</em> but nobody trust provable history anymore. Do not cite the Deep Magic to me, Witch — I was there when it was written.</p>

<p>Somehow the entire technical industry continues to coalesce around social/political status and power instead of actual experience and ability. You’ve created software used by millions of people? Your software has been resold by every “cloud” for the past 10 years? Sorry, we can’t hire you because you didn’t espouse sufficient emotional loyalty to our One True Founder Kier Eagan. Good luck with your sad little life creating things people use because we only pay for cult loyalists here and you don’t socially qualify.

<p>How do we try to exist when we need income, but almost all jobs have become impossible fantasy roles overloaded with divergent tasks trying to cram 5 departments worth of concurrent work into single people? Is it time to rip up our tech industry membership cards and just leave all the roles to overworked amateurs who only know the broken world since they haven’t ever seen a functioning company with professionals in single-purpose professional roles? I don’t know anymore.</p>
<h2 id="_conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Is the rambling complete? Has the stream of consciousness flow terminated?</p>
<p>Of course none of these are <em>unique to me</em> problems. As we started out on this article: the industry broke all the jobs because of too much tech speculation tied to speculative funding, so the funding went away, then the customers went away, now the jobs are gone. We have hundreds of thousands of developers not getting their “tech industry” level salaries anymore, so who am I to whine?</p>
<p>Well, I’m me and this is my site, so neener neener you can’t stop me. It’s a problem for all of us and we speak for all the worms.</p>
<p>The tech roles at most companies are completely busted it seems. I didn’t sign up to be a “software servant” to non-technical product teams who just define tasks and priorities for actually capable people to implement every day. Somewhere along the way the entire industry lost its heart and now most companies are more interested in “playing company” instead of actually carving out created creative contraptions? There is a thing called “Engineering-led management” where, imagine this, the people <em>doing the work</em> are also the ones <em>defining the product</em> and <em>talking to users</em> and <em>defining requirements</em> while <em>implementing features</em> all themselves. You can’t create good products if you have less capable “product idea people” controlling implementation capability. Office Space wasn’t supposed to be our destiny.</p>
<p>I’m probably actually fairly bad at being a single-purpose “SWE SDE SRE” or whatever weird made-up excessively narrow titles people have <a href="https://matt.sh/self-esteem-murder-post-is-out-2022">contrived now</a>. It’s about building products and growing companies, which is difficult to impact when you’re given the mushroom treatment at 90% of companies unable to impact actual organizational and product change (because “know your place, <em>low value menial developer</em>, you just do what the superior <em>project management</em> and <em>ceo vc family executives</em> tell you to do, you can’t actually make decisions or improve usability or have ideas to expand products and fix company problems yourself. you aren’t the right <a href="https://matt.sh/new-developer-shapes">shaped person</a> to make decisions here!”). where is the developer azor ahai to right the world and tip the balance of power back to a majority of productive developers making decisions?</p>
<p>At some point, a switch flipped in the tech job market and “programmer jobs” just turned into zero-agency task-by-task roles working on other people’s ideas under other people’s priorities to accomplish other people’s goals. I feel tech employment was originally more focused around being given problems to find solutions from a “whole business view” then you did everything to generate products and solutions using your best judgment towards a deadline goal without being micromanaged every step of the way (because nobody else knew what you were doing or how to do it to even <em>attempt</em> to micromanage you). When did developers stop being part of the actual product creation process and instead just become <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@durbinmalonster/video/7104742170426641710">“project management task workers?”</a> The nexus of tech industry employee agency destruction seems to be centered around post-2010 tech “elite value capture” where the weirdos who would normally aspire to work on wall street for “quick riches” instead decided they could get rich by just being “thought leaders” to exploit technology. It’s difficult to believe non-technical “idea people” have any relevant capacity to control technical project direction over a long term sustainability horizon. You create good products by creating <em>and</em> using products <em>at an implementation level</em> because products you use and products <em>you personally write</em> are products you have the largest insight into improving the best and the fastest.</p>
<p>How do we deal with professional income inequality where the same role and effort pays $400/day at one company but $20,000/day at another company? At what point is it worth not even working if your compensation doesn’t work out to being at least $10,000 per day anymore? Do we just sit here and die in our overpriced studio apartments where rent increases 7% every year while other ICs doing the same work at better companies are buying 5 vacation houses from doing the same work?</p>
<p>The worst feeling is comparison. Comparison is the death of happiness, as they say. I look at my own place in the world compared to people who just started at Apple or Microsoft 20 years ago then never left, and now they have made eight figures just over the past 4 years while my life path has lead me to… practically nothing. Then the tech inequality continues to compound. Imagine joining a company where the teenage interns have already made a couple million off their passive stock grants and other employees have been making $2MM to $6MM per year over the past 5 years there, while you’re starting over with nothing again for the 5th company in a row so what’s the point in even trying<a href="#_fn6" id="_fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>. Though, did you know paying rent on a credit card still qualifies for points? Made $60 this month paying rent with credit card point rebates<a href="#_fn7" id="_fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>. whoops.</p>
<p>What’s next? Who knows. Maybe aliens will blow up the sun to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_lithium_problem">strip mine all our solar lithium for their alien hive mind batteries</a> or something.</p>
<h3 id="_whats-worth-working-on">What’s Worth Working On</h3>
<p>Out of all the jobs available, it’s surprising how many of them aren’t the best thing to be doing. As we covered above, you usually want to work at a specific <em>type</em> of company (if you can) to get those $10k to $50k per day rates instead of being stuck at unprofitable companies only paying $400/day salary with no usable equity.</p>
<p>What’s actually worth working on though? Let’s do a rundown.</p>
<p>I have an interesting experiment in using <a href="https://matt.sh/transformer-stock-tracking-demos">non-tokenized inputs to transformer architectures</a> which can be expanded to essentially creating conscious AI robots using arbitrary sensor data from cameras and microphones and encoders, but it would take a couple million united states freedom bucks to build working prototypes.</p>
<p>It’s sad seeing so many broken products in the world while companies refuse to hire you. Here’s a sample of broken things one of those eight figure comp employees (or ten figure comp executives) should have fixed already just from looking at my immediate surroundings (which seems fairly one-sided):</p>
<ul>
<li>iTunes (Apple Music macOS App?) still has a broken UI. Current bugs include: when you “favorite” a song, it often just stops playing all music. When you tap the “back” button in album navigation, it doesn’t do anything the first click, but the second click sends you back two pages. You can’t go back one page at a time, you can only click once for no action then click again to go back two pages. Do the people creating these things not use them?</li>
<li>Still Apple Music App related: the whole information management design architecture around library organization is stuck in 2001. There are so many more useful and creative and impactful ways we could empower users to discover, remix, share, and experience their music libraries besides “one spreadsheet view with tiny icons in rows.” Did Apple run out of ideas and ambition and a drive for creating a better future?</li>
<li>Apple’s entire Feedback system didn’t get any better after they renamed it Feedback. Apple (market cap: $3.5 trillion currently) treats customers like unpaid interns expecting customers to just give them free troubleshooting work with no <em>cooperative internal feedback</em> on reported issues for months or years. Who is managing this? Why has the reporting process been bad for decades? We can fix these things.</li>
<li>Apple’s macOS Control Center app widget constantly uses 1% to 2% CPU (across <em>millions of machines</em>) because it redraws itself 1,000 times per second even though it is always off-screen and completely hidden from the user. This has been known and reported for about two years now, but nobody cares to fix it. Is this one of those things where the developers care, but project management doesn’t understand the problem, so it can never be “prioritized” as a fix?</li>
<li>Why did Apple go with such a weak Vision Pro launch of release-then-abandon? They could have made a dozen more first party world changing productivity experiences instead of expecting independent app developers to just show up and spend millions of dollars developing for a maximum risk minimum reward platform. Really curious how we ended up with “just give them a computer hat with no mind-blowing world-changing app advances” instead of the magic we usually expect from Apple launches? Though, the last iPhone update’s main selling point was basically “we converted a toggle switch to a button” so who even knows anymore? Here’s some free ideas:
<ul>
<li>Really show off the dynamic ability for space occupation for massive data exploration.
<ul>
<li>provide a default professional-level stock market application where people can create a 30 window view of 30 live symbols for real time decisions all positioned in living space</li>
<li>provide a default data exploration application to show off displaying 10 to 50 metrics series charts at once (server metrics, business metrics, anything with a chart; think “Keynote for Time-Series Data”)</li>
<li>spatial AI LLM visualizations capable of showing diverging language output trees for alternate completion paths all around you</li>
<li>spatial geometry understanding environments for beginner, intermediate, advanced stages — so much of math is just <em>figuring out what it looks like in your own head</em> (remember the joke about Windows ships with Minesweeper while Macs ship with Chess? or Macs have a Graphing Calculator by default? Continue bringing advanced educational tools back into the mac ecosystem by default).</li>
<li>spatial explorations of high-dimensional data with zooming in/out/up/down multiple dimensions of spaces to explore geometric surroundings for more data interpretation capabilities</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Wii-Fit-like environments for active mobility engagement</li>
<li>spatial theremin</li>
<li>spatial + AI cooking with ingredient identification and in-view instructions</li>
<li>headshare: just outright swap cameras with somebody else (or maybe as a spatial window showing other people’s live camera feed(s))</li>
<li>remember the face swap app? do live head swaps. fun for the whole family.</li>
<li>live streamed spatial concert experiences</li>
<li>live spatial animal species detector</li>
<li>spatial physics / cosmology simulations</li>
<li>spatial where’s waldo object detector (“where are my keys?” then using AI/machine vision it locates key-shaped objects for you)</li>
<li>spatial knowledge graph navigation (think: view wikipedia, but every link is exploded into a contextual spatial window for easy jumping between)</li>
<li>spatial Apple Intelligence®™¢£ assistant in 3d space where the agent model <em>also</em> draws the assistant’s puppet/creature visual state so it is, effectively, alive</li>
<li>and so much more!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It’s interesting how Mac Safari uses touch id to “protect” private browsing mode windows, but there’s still half a dozen bugs encountered through basic Safari usage. If I can hit so many bugs constantly, how is an entire company of people using the browser not finding and fixing these bugs every single day?</li>
<li>Apple’s iOS performance degradation. Typing on my iPhone 15 Pro Max is slower than typing on my iPhone 13 Pro Max. Why? I don’t know. The keyboard misses taps all the time where my previous 3-year-older phone feels about twice as responsive when typing. What did they break and why don’t they care?</li>
<li>Why does GitHub continue to make some features worse worse? They changed the home feed from useful details to less useful details and now instead of instantly loading, it shows you a 3-9 second loading spinner saying “One moment please…” — multi-second loading spinners on every page refresh is a really damaged user experience.</li>
<li>Another GitHub trick: look at a repo page logged in vs.&nbsp;logged out. They are using different page templates for logged in vs logged out users and it just looks like a mistake. GitHub has been fairly silent when it comes to addressing any user experience regressions over the past couple years.</li>
<li>Obviously there are dozens of high-impact, high-reward, low-timeline projects to be created or improved in modern AI Lab companies, but “AI Companies” seem to only want to hire 28 year olds with a PhD from Stanford who have worked at Google for 5 years. No real way to get a foot in the door unless you’re related to somebody there already from what I can tell. Sure, they say “you don’t have enough experience,” but what does “experience” mean when half the work they do is making completely new things nobody has ever made before anyway?</li>
<li>There’s tons of work to be explored in practical consumer robotics applications using cost-optimized hardware strategies. I’m pretty sure my plans for a sub-$3,000 human-sized-hexapod would create a few hundred billion dollars in value if we could build it out (add +$100 trillion in value if we attach the robot AI brain to it too).</li>
<li>Various social aspects but less product oriented. How do we stop the world from collapsing? How do we fix an economy where 400 million people who aren’t already in California all want to move to California and become buzzword-driven middle managers at Google? Gotta OKR that KPI so your LTV for the TAM doesn’t go into the red.</li>
<li>What is the balance between companies spending half a trillion dollars on stock buybacks when they also aren’t consistently hiring useful people into positions of authority to improve the world?</li>
<li>People talk about American politicians never retiring, but what about tech executives too? We’re ending up with a lot of executives with 20 to 40 years at these trillion dollar companies and they aren’t moving out to give more people opportunities for advancement.</li>
</ul>
<p>just remember, the opposite of war isn’t peace: it’s creation.</p>
<p>our goal is to make something out of nothing. we need to express, to communicate, to go against the grain —&nbsp;here’s to the crazy ones.</p>
<p>create good things. create good systems. grow products. grow economies. become like the stars.</p>
<p>raggedy man, goodnight,</p>

<li id="_fn2"><p>Oddly, this is the first time in modern history where government interest rate increases haven’t also increased the deposit interest rate for consumer checking accounts.

<li id="_fn3"><p>if you do the math using practical inflation and cost of living going up 7% to 13% per year, the minimum developer salary in 2024 should be around $450k to $550k. Almost nobody is paying such rates though and you’re lucky to even clear $250k (which was already <em>in range</em> from <em>10 years ago</em>).<a href="#_fnref3">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="_fn4"><p>There’s a continual disconnect where people with experience can see problems then construct easy and rapid to implement solutions, but people with less experience think every little bug fix is a “we don’t have time to stop the world for 6 months so we can never fix anything!” problem. We get excited to fix problems because we see <em>fixing problems is tractable</em> and <em>we can implement these fixes in days instead of months</em> as opposed to others don’t understand how everything works. It’s amazing how the simple practice of <strong>just doing the work</strong> solves many problems sooner than many people think is possible.<a href="#_fnref4">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="_fn5"><p>and what is the deal with interviewers combining vague “spatial 2d/3d abstract reasoning” ability into required interview questions? stop giving me grid world to navigate during interview processes because i’ll just spend 20 minutes making dumb off-by-1 errors which doesn’t prove anything about long term professional success in any product or infrastructure offering? we’re not applying to be game developers but half the interviews are “PROGRAM THIS GAME IN 20 MINUTES!!!” ugh go flip off a card already.<a href="#_fnref5">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="_fn6"><p>“oh wow you sound depressed! me, as an Internet Psychologist will recommend you WORK OUT and SLEEP MORE! that solves all things according to internet advice!” really? how much more should i <a href="https://mattsta.b-cdn.net/panic/somebody.jpg">work out</a>, anon? At worst, my problem is I need to eat more, but that cycles back to not wasting money as to not get evicted. As a famous therapist once said: most people don’t need therapy, they just need money to fix their circumstances.

<li id="_fn7"><p>I don’t know the magic of how it works, but my apartment billing portal only charges 0.75% as a credit card fee if you pay monthly rent with a card, so if your credit card also has a 1% or 1.5% point rebate, you can <em>make money</em> paying rent via card (as long as you can pay it off every month to avoid the 30% APR build-up…)<a href="#_fnref7">↩</a></p></li>

The suit seeks $1 billion in damages to help Puerto Rico defend itself against climate disasters.</p><p>In a <a href="https://climateintegrity.org/uploads/media/PR_complaint_filed_071524.pdf">complaint</a> filed in San Juan yesterday, Puerto Rico’s Department of Justice says that the companies violated trade law by promoting fossil fuels without adequately warning about the dangers. The defendants include ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, Shell, ConocoPhillips, and other energy companies.</p><p>It’s the latest in a <a href="https://grist.org/accountability/big-oil-climate-lawsuits-trials-attribution-science-exxon/">slew of lawsuits</a> attempting to hold fossil fuel companies accountable for the consequences of climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc">supercharging</a> storms and other extreme weather events while rising seas eat away at island shorelines. Fossil fuel companies knew for decades that their products would cause global warming and went about business as usual anyway, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23550834/exxonmobil-climate-change-predictions-shockingly-accurate">several studies</a> and <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/project/exxon-the-road-not-taken/">investigations</a> <a href="https://graphics.latimes.com/exxon-arctic/">have</a> <a href="https://graphics.latimes.com/exxon-research/">found</a>. </p><p>In the complaint, Puerto Rico says it expects to pay billions of dollars in the future to cope with catastrophes made worse by climate change — including storms like Hurricane Maria, which killed <a href="https://fxb.harvard.edu/2018/05/29/study-estimates-prolonged-increase-in-puerto-rican-death-rate-after-hurricane-maria/">thousands</a> of people in 2017 and triggered <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/features/23404252/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-electric-grid-solar-panels-prepa-luma-fema">monthslong power outages</a>. </p><p>The suit asks defendants to contribute to a fund that would be used to mitigate the consequences of climate change and pay for measures to strengthen Puerto Rico’s infrastructure against future climate-related calamities. </p><p>BP declined to comment on the suit. Other multinational energy companies named in the suit didn’t immediately respond to <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p><a href="https://climateintegrity.org/cases/municipalities-of-puerto-rico">Thirty-seven municipalities</a> in Puerto Rico and the <a href="https://climateintegrity.org/cases/san-juan-puerto-rico">capital city of San Juan</a>&nbsp;have previously filed suit against fossil fuel companies, seeking to hold them accountable for the devastation wrought by Hurricane Maria. </p><p>“It’s more important than ever for officials to stand up to the fossil fuel industry on behalf of their communities.

          <p dir="auto">I come here after knowing about this.</p>
<p dir="auto">I fear the fixes may not be enough.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are two issues with the current code:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><code>strerror</code> <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strerror.3.html" rel="nofollow">is not thread safe</a> which means it can be potentially exploited <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/900363/3311855" rel="nofollow">by having another thread manipulate</a> <code>strerror</code>'s internal buffer so that the null terminator is ignored when it's evaluated by <code>printf/safe_printf</code> (due to race conditions).
<ul dir="auto">
<li>I speculate this could be used to leak secrets. Since printf would continue printing beyond the original null terminator, until it encounters a 0x00 in the stream.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On certain systems it is known for <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strerror.3.html" rel="nofollow">strerror</a> to return nullptr on certain conditions; which may cause a crash.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Normally I wouldn't pay this much attention but given that this code was deliberately put by a hostile actor; I suggest the strerror be removed, or replaced by a thread-safe variant and check for nullptrs.</p>

Beyond those core “engineering math” courses, different majors include plenty of specialized courses that branch off in various ways.</p><p>There are so many courses that a student could not fit them all into a standard 4-year undergraduate course load even if they overloaded their schedule every year – however, the more of these courses a student is able to take, the more academic opportunities and career doors are open to them in the future.</p><p>(While it’s true that students don’t need to know much beyond algebra to get a job in fields like computer science, medicine, etc. – the people in such fields who do also know advanced math are extra valuable and in demand because they can work on projects that combine domain expertise and math.)</p><h2>Maximizing Reward: Learning A Lot of Advanced Math Ahead of Time</h2><p>When a student learns a lot of advanced math ahead of time, they unlock the opportunity to delve into a wide variety of specialized fields that are usually reserved for graduates with strong mathematical foundations.</p><p>This fast-tracks them towards discovering their passions, developing valuable skills in those domains, and making professional contributions early in their career, which ultimately leads to higher levels of career accomplishment.</p><p>I’m not exaggerating here – this is actually backed up by research. On average, the faster you accelerate your learning, the sooner you get your career started, and the more you accomplish over the course of your career.</p><p>For instance, in a 40-year longitudinal <a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.vanderbilt.edu/vu-my/wp-content/uploads/sites/826/2013/02/14084633/Park-Lubinski-Benbow-2013.pdf">study</a> of thousands of mathematically precocious students, researchers Park, Lubinski, &amp; Benbow (2013) concluded the following:</p><span size="3em"><ul><li><i> "The relationship between age at career onset and adult productivity, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, has been the focus of several researchers throughout the last century (Dennis, 1956; Lehman, 1946, 1953; Simonton, 1988, 1997; Zuckerman, 1977), and a consistent finding is that earlier career onset is related to greater productivity and accomplishments over the course of a career. All other things being equal, an earlier career start from [academic] acceleration will allow an individual to devote more time in early adulthood to creative production, and this will result in an increased level of accomplishment over the course of one's career. <br>...<br> [In this study] Mathematically precocious students who grade skipped were more likely to pursue advanced degrees and secure STEM accomplishments, reached these outcomes earlier, and accrued more citations and highly cited publications in STEM fields than their matched and retained intellectual peers." </i></li></ul></span><h2>Higher Math, Not Competition Math</h2><p>To be clear: in all this discussion about learning advanced math, I’m talking about higher-grade math, not grade-level competition problems.</p><p>When a middle or high school teacher has a bright math student, and the teacher directs them towards competition math, it’s usually not because that’s the best option for the student. Rather, it’s the best option for the teacher. It gives the student something to do while creating minimal additional work for the teacher.</p><p>Competition math problems generally don’t require students to learn new fields of math. Rather, the difficulty comes from students needing to find clever tricks and insights to arrive at solutions using the mathematical tools that they have already learned. A student can wrestle with a competition problem for long periods of time, and all the teacher needs to do is give a hint once in a while and check the student’s work once they claim to have solved the problem.</p><p>But if you look at the kinds of math that most quantitative professionals (like rocket scientists and AI developers) use on a daily basis, those competition math tricks show up rarely, if ever. What <i>does</i> show up everywhere is university-level math subjects like linear algebra, multivariable calculus, differential equations, and (calculus-based) probability and statistics.</p><p>Given that most students who enjoy math end up applying math in some other field (as opposed to becoming pure mathematicians), it would be more productive for them to get a broad view of math as early as possible so that they can sooner apply it to projects in their field(s) of interest.</p><p>Of course, the countering view is that “students should go ‘deep’ with the math that they’ve already learned – they’ll learn the other math subjects when they’re ready.”</p><p>But, in practice, the second part of that claim is not true. There are so many other math subjects that even most math majors only learn a tiny slice of all the math that’s out there.</p><p>Students generally can’t learn other math subjects “on the job” after graduation, either – if you’re trying to solve cutting-edge problems that nobody has solved before, then there is no “known path” that can tell you what additional math you need. And to even realize that a field of math can help you solve your problem, you generally need to have learned a substantial amount of that field in the first place.</p><p>In practice, the only way for students to “learn the other math subjects when they’re ready” is to learn as much math as possible during school.</p><h2>Developmental Appropriateness</h2><p>Many people think that learning math early is not appropriate for students’ social/emotional and cognitive/academic development.</p><p>But the reality is that educational acceleration does not lead to adverse psychological consequences in capable students.</p><p>I realize that if you’re skeptical about this, you’re probably looking for some empirical evidence to the contrary, not just a logic/reasoning-based argument. So let’s dive into the research.</p><p>According to a <a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.vanderbilt.edu/vu-my/wp-content/uploads/sites/826/2013/02/05122845/Article-JEP-Bernstein-2020-F.pdf">study</a> titled <i>Academic Acceleration in Gifted Youth and Fruitless Concerns Regarding Psychological Well-Being: A 35-Year Longitudinal Study</i> that followed thousands of accelerated students throughout their lives over the course of 35 years (Bernstein, Lubinski, &amp; Benbow, 2021):</p><span size="3em"><ul><li><i> "The amount of educational acceleration did not covary with psychological well-being. Further, the psychological well-being of participants in both studies was above the average of national probability samples. Concerns about long-term social/emotional effects of acceleration for high-potential students appear to be unwarranted, as has been demonstrated for short-term effects. <br>...<br> These findings are consistent with research on the effects of academic acceleration on psychological well-being. That is, there is little evidence that academic acceleration has negative consequences on the psychological well-being of intellectually talented youth (Assouline et al., 2015; Benbow &amp; Stanley, 1996; Colangelo et al., 2004; Gross, 2006; Robinson, 2004). <br>...<br> These findings do not support the frequently expressed concerns about the possible long-term social and emotional costs of acceleration by counselors, parents, and administrators. ... Those who were accelerated had few regrets for doing so. Indeed, if anything, they tended to wish that they had accelerated more." </i></li></ul><br> </span><p>Whether a student is ready for advanced mathematics depends solely on whether they have mastered the prerequisites. If a student has mastered prerequisites, then it is appropriate for them to continue learning advanced math early, and not appropriate to stunt their development by holding them back. As the study authors note:</p><span size="3em"><ul><li><i> "Many fear negative possibilities of moving a gifted child to a more advanced class. Yet it also is important to consider the negative possibilities of holding children back in classes aiming to teach subject matter that they have already mastered (Benbow &amp; Stanley, 1996; Gross, 2006; Stanley, 2000). Choosing not to accelerate is as much of a decision as choosing to do so ... <p> This is particularly important given the extensive empirical literature showing positive effects of acceleration on academic achievement (Kulik &amp; Kulik, 1984, 1992; Lubinski, 2016; Rogers, 2004; Steenbergen-Hu et al., 2016) and creativity (Park et al., 2013; Wai et al., 2010). ... Presenting students with an educational curriculum at the depth and pace with which they assimilate new knowledge is beneficial. Other studies have shown that academic acceleration tends to enhance professional and creative achievements before age 50 (Park et al., 2013; Wai et al., 2010)." </p></i></li></ul><br> </span><p>Numerous other studies on the long-term effects of educational acceleration have drawn similar conclusions. As Wai (2015) <a target="_blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jonathan-Wai/publication/277403890_Long-term_effects_of_educational_acceleration/links/556a024908aec22683035cd7/Long-term-effects-of-educational-acceleration.pdf">summarizes</a>:</p><span size="3em"><ul><li><i> "...[F]or many decades there has been a large body of empirical work supporting educational acceleration for talented youths (Colangelo &amp; Davis, 2003; Lubinski &amp; Benbow, 2000; VanTassel-Baska, 1998). Although neglecting this evidence seems increasingly harder to do (Ceci, 2000; Stanley, 2000), putting research into practice has been challenging due to social and political forces surrounding educational policy and implementation (Benbow &amp; Stanley, 1996; Gallagher, 2004; Stanley, 2000). <br>...<br> The educational implications of these studies are quite clear. They collectively show that the various forms of educational acceleration have a positive impact. The key is appropriate developmental placement (Lubinski &amp; Benbow, 2000) both academically and socially. ... Educational acceleration is essentially appropriate pacing and placement that ensures advanced students are engaged in learning for life. Every student deserves to learn something new each day (Stanley, 2000). The evidence clearly supports allowing students who desire to be accelerated to do so, and does not support holding them back. <br>...<br> [T]he long-term studies reviewed here show that adults who had been accelerated in school achieved greater educational and occupational success and were satisfied with their choices and the impact of those choices in other areas of their lives." </i></li></ul><br> </span><p>As researcher James Borland (1989, pp.185) <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/planningimplemen0000borl/page/n279/mode/2up">sums it up</a>:</p><span size="3em"><ul><li><i> "Acceleration is one of the most curious phenomena in the field of education. I can think of no other issue in which there is such a gulf between what research has revealed and what most practitioners believe. The research on acceleration is so uniformly positive, the benefits of appropriate acceleration so unequivocal, that it is difficult to see how an educator could oppose it." </i></li></ul></span><h2>But Why Does the Myth of Developmental Inappropriateness Persist?</h2><p>At this point, you might wonder why so many people think that academic acceleration is developmentally inappropriate given all the research to the contrary. What’s going on? Do they disagree with the research? Are they simply unaware?</p><p>It becomes pretty clear if you look at the incentives.</p><p>Acceleration requires extra work, but people typically don’t like to do extra work, so they will gladly rationalize that the extra work wouldn’t have really helped them anyway, even if their rationale is incorrect.</p><p>Now, you might ask, what about schools? Isn’t it in their job description to get their students to work? If accelerating their capable students will lead to beneficial outcomes, wouldn’t they be pushing it, or at least, not discouraging it?</p><p>The problem is that acceleration is also very inconvenient to schools.</p><p>In schools, each grade typically progresses through the math curriculum in lockstep, which means that accelerated students would need to be placed in above-grade courses. This can lead to major logistical challenges.</p><p>For instance, if above-grade course is not offered by the school (which would certainly be the case for accelerated 5th graders in elementary schools, 8th graders in middle schools, and 12th graders in high schools), then either</p><ul><li>the students would need to take the class at another school (which introduces transportation, scheduling, and administrative issues) or</li><li>the school would need to hire a teacher who is capable of teaching the higher-grade material (and it's hard enough for schools to hire teachers who are capable of teaching grade-level mathematics).</li></ul><p>And even if the above-grade course is offered by the school, there may be schedule conflicts with grade-level courses that mathematically accelerated students still need to take. (Course schedules are typically optimized to minimize conflicts within grade levels, but not across grade levels.)</p><p>Besides logistical issues, there are other factors that can disincentivize acceleration and lead the myth to be perpetuated out of convenience. As Steenbergen-Hu, Makel, &amp; Olszewski-Kubilius (2016) <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gdcaln.org/s/Full-Study-100-Years-of-Research-Grouping-and-Acceleration.pdf">describe</a>:</p><span size="3em"><ul><li><i> "[E]ducation administrators may have perverse incentives to avoid acceleration. For example, although acceleration can often actually save schools money because students spend fewer years in school, it can also 'cost' schools money. Because school funding is often allocated based on headcounts and accelerated students spend fewer years in school, schools receive fewer dollars overall, or in the case of dual enrollment, may have to spend some of those dollars outside the district. <p> Similarly, in states that offer open enrollment, students could leave a district for one where their needs are better met. Moreover, in the age of accountability via test score performance, keeping students who could be accelerated with their same-age peers can boost average test scores, regardless of whether the students are learning." </p></i></li></ul><br> </span><p>Even in schools that do offer acceleration, typically only a small portion of students per grade are accelerated. Given how many logistical challenges and other disincentivizing factors there are, how few students are typically accelerated, and how easy it is to imagine a young student struggling socially when they are placed in a class with older students away from age-level friends, it is not surprising that the myth persists.</p><h2>References</h2><p>Bernstein, B.

<blockquote>
<p>This document is for users who want to deploy the Google tag in first-party
mode. We recommend first-party mode for the most durable tag configuration.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="overview" data-text="Overview" tabindex="-1">Overview</h2>

<p>First-party mode lets you to deploy your Google tag using your own first-party
infrastructure, hosted on your website's domain (e.g., example.com). This
infrastructure sits between your website and Google's services, making your
first-party infrastructure the only technology to interact directly with your
website users. First-party mode adds a layer of data security and enables
additional data privacy controls—such as full IP obfuscation—without
compromising your measurement. The setup in this documentation will help you
recover X% more measurement signals on your website. You can set it up using
your existing Content Delivery Network (CDN), load balancer, or web server, to
enable first-party mode.</p>

<p>In standard Google tag setups, your web page requests a Google tag from a Google
domain (e.g., www.googletagmanager.com). When the tag fires, it sends
measurement requests directly to the Google product. In first-party mode, your
website loads the Google tag from your first-party domain (e.g., example.com).
When the tag fires, it sends measurement requests to your first-party domain,
where they are forwarded to the relevant Google product.</p>

<p>You will experience full measurement continuity when switching from a standard
Google tag setup to first-party mode configuration.</p>

<p>This diagram represents the information flow in first-party mode:</p>

<h2 id="before_you_begin" data-text="Before you begin" tabindex="-1">Before you begin</h2>

<p>This guide assumes that your website is already configured with:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/gtagjs">Google tag</a> or <a href="https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6102821">Tag
Manager container</a></li>
<li>A Content Delivery Network (CDN) or load balancer that can forward requests
to external endpoints</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="1_choose_the_tag_serving_path" data-text="1. Choose the tag serving path" tabindex="-1">1. Choose the tag serving path</h2>

<p>You must reserve a path on your website domain for serving the tag. Make sure
this path is not already in use on your domain.</p>

<p>Choose any path you want for setting up first-party mode. Examples of paths you
might want to use include: <code translate="no" dir="ltr">/metrics</code>, <code translate="no" dir="ltr">/securemetric</code>, <code translate="no" dir="ltr">/analytics</code>, or
preferably a random alphanumeric string that you don't use on your website
already.</p>

  <h2>Darwin Machines</h2>

<p>I'm writing this because I've been obsessed with the theory of a Darwin Machine for nearly a year now and I haven't met anyone else who has heard of it.</p>

<p>This is my attempt to summarize and share the theory that William Calvin laid out in "The Cerebral Code". If you haven't read it and are interested in how the brain works or AI/ML you should order a copy right now. I'm going to do the book no justice but hopefully, if you haven't already ordered the book, the rest of this post will convince you to read it.</p>

<p>If you, or anyone you know, is interested in these ideas or wants to build/is building a Darwin Machine, please reach out. My email is calepayson(at)mac.com. </p>

<h2>First a Little Background</h2>

<h3>On Evolution:</h3>

<p>Near the end of his career Schrodinger wrote a book, "On Life", that provides a great lens through which to view biology: Life is unnatural... If you're a physicist.</p>

<p>One of the defining pillars of physics is the second law of thermodynamics. Energy hates being concentrated. Yet here we are, squishy bags of water and energy suspended a few feet above the ground. It's a bit weird.</p>

<p>Schrodinger decided the only way that life was possible was if it led to more entropy throughout the system. Like a tornado, life is a pocket of order that sows disorder. It lives so long as it pays the entropy tax.</p>

<p>To anthropomorphize a bit, The Universe is trying to maximize entropy but it has a near infinite "problem space". One algorithm it has found to solve this problem is evolution. To butcher a computer science phrase, I believe that evolution is the "best case runtime" when trying to find increasingly valid solutions to a near infinite problem space.</p>

<p>Essentially, biology uses evolution because it is the best way to solve the problem of prediction (survival/reproduction) in a complex world.</p>

<h3>On Constraints:</h3>

<p>I love constraints in science because they can give us hope for a theory before it has been worked out. For example, before we knew what genetic material was, we knew it had to fit in cells, be chemically stable, and had to be capable of making high fidelity copies of itself. It took four years after Watson and Crick discovered the double helix for us to prove it was genetic material but we knew their discovery held promise because it fit within the constraints.</p>

<p>I see a few constraints governing how the brain works. </p>

<p>First, and most importantly, the brain is also faced with a near infinite problem space. There are trillions of behaviors, only some of which are "fit" for any given scenario. Any theory of intelligence should explain how the brain solves this in the most efficient manner possible.</p>

<p>The other constraints are based on a few studies and observations that seem important.</p>

<p>Karl Lashley showed that memory is massively parallel and, contrary to the idea of a "grandmother cell", is not stored in a single location.</p>

<p>David Eagleman showed that other brain functions in the brain like perception are also massively parallel. He dubbed this the "Mr. Potato Head" theory because no matter where you "plug in" sensory input, your brain tends to figure out what to do with it. Plug some eyes into the olfactory cortex and a nose into the visual cortex and the brain will keep right on trucking.</p>

<p>Two additional things to add:</p>

<p>Brain patterns are spatio-temporal patterns. If I turn off cell firings, say with anesthesia, you lose your train of thought.:</p>

<p>But they store those patterns spatially. When you come out of anesthesia, you're still you.</p>

<p>Think of this like RAM vs. Disk.</p>

<h3>On Brains</h3>

<p>If you were to flatten out the brain on a table you would notice two things.</p>

<p>First, if you look at a cross-section of the brain (eye-level with the table), the brain is divided into ~6 layers. This layering forms the dominant narrative of how intelligence may work and is the basis for deep neural nets. The idea is, stimulus is piped into the "top" layer and filters down to the bottom layer, with each layer picking up on more and more abstract concepts. Three Blue One Brown does a good job of articulating this idea in a <a href="https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk?si=MMZ_O7NATm38f_DT&amp;t=332">video</a>.</p>

<p>Second, if you look down on the brain from above, the brain is divided into columns. The smallest unit of these are minicolumns, bundles of 80-120 neurons that run perpendicular to the layers of the brain, from the "top" to the "bottom" (or vice versa, it doesn't matter). These minicolumns can then be grouped into cortical columns, which can be thought of as roughly hexagonal bundles of minicolumns, also running perpendicular to the layers of the brain.</p>

<p>And that's about it. The brain is incredibly, wonderfully, complex. The neocortex, the new bit that we think is important for intelligence, is insanely complex too. And it's also basically a crumpled up sheet with the structure described above. At least that's the level of abstraction we'll be working with.</p>

<p>From the perspective of a bystander, modern machine learning seems to believe that the recipe for more intelligence is adding more layers. But based upon the homogeneity of neocortex it seems that, in biology, the recipe for more intelligence is adding more columns. A rat has the same number of layers as a chimp as a human, but the surface area of a rat's neocortex, a proxy for the number of columns, is less than a chimp which is less than a human.</p>

<p>To prevent confusion, I'm saying that adding more columns is the recipe for more "animal intelligence. "Human intelligence" is different than animal intelligence owing to our capacity for high fidelity imitation. I'll write more on this in the future.</p>

<h2>On Darwin Machines</h2>

<p>If modern ML explains intelligence with layers, the theory of a Darwin Machine explains evolution with columns.</p>

<p>As a reminder, a theory should satisfy the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Implements an efficient algorithm to search a near infinite problem space.</p></li>
<li><p>Both memory and processing are massively parallel.</p></li>
<li><p>Computation uses spatio-temporal patterns.</p></li>
<li><p>But memory is spatial.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The theory of Darwin Machines developed by William Calvin proposes that the brain, like life, implements evolution to search a near infinite problem space.</p>

<p>Calvin believes that minicolumns are the arena for this evolution. Sensory inputs hit the brain, visual input in one area, olfactory in another, etc. and trigger specific firing patterns in the minicolumns. Imagining the surface of the brain laid flat on a table, we can look down on it and see these columns lighting up, as if with Morse Code messages. These messages then propagate across the surface area of the brain, competing with conflicting messages to take over the greatest surface area.</p>

<p>After some period of time a winner is chosen, likely the message that controls the greatest surface area, the greatest number of minicolumns. When this happens, the winning minicolumns are rewarded, likely prompting them to encode a tendency for that firing pattern into their structure.</p>

<p>Before we go deeper let's pause and notice that this theory satisfies all our constraints. It implements the "best case runtime" algorithm for predicting "valid" solutions to a complex problem space. It is massively parallel with computation and storage happening between and within individual minicolumns. The calculation is done with a spatiotemporal "Morse Code" message. But storage is performed by changing the spatial relationships within a minicolumn so that the message is more easily triggered in the future.</p>

<p>This all seems so simple. There are only so many firing patterns a minicolumn can have within some reasonable clock speed yet there is a practically infinite range of thought. How does the Darwin Machine theory explain that? This brings us to cortical columns.</p>

<p>Minicolumns communicate with each other using axons, basically wires. Some of these wires connect neighboring minicolumns but many reach further, skipping roughly ten minicolumns before connecting. These connections result in a triangular array of connected minicolumns with large gaps of unconnected minicolumns in between. Well, not really unconnected, each of these are connected to their own triangular array.</p>

<p>Looking down on the brain again, we can imagine projecting a pattern of equilateral triangles - like a fishing net - over the surface. Each vertex in the net will land on a minicolumn within the same network, leaving holes over minicolumns that don't belong to that network. If we were to project nets over the network until every minicolumn was covered by a vertex we would project 50-100 nets.</p>

<p>A cortical column is made up of 50-100 minicolumns. You can think of a cortical column as a hexagon containing one minicolumn from each network.</p>

<p>Cortical columns allow for the complexity that minicolumns alone couldn't provide. Each one can encode somewhere between n^50 and n^100 unique patterns where n is the number of patterns that a minicolumn can encode. Even if minicolumns only had two states, this would provide us with the building blocks for a massive range of thoughts.</p>

<p>With all this in mind we can tell the story of how a Darwin Machine works.</p>

<p>Sensory input comes in and causes minicolumns to fire in certain patterns. The resulting pattern is influenced by the input and the "tendencies" of the minicolumn that have been spatially encoded over time. Each firing pattern, each message, competes with other messages from minicolumns within its network. Through this competition each network settles on the most fit message, the message that best correlates with sensory input and the tendencies of its minicolumns.</p>

<p>At the cortical column level, the message from each network is read. Here I'll steal one of Calvin's metaphors: Each message is like an individual instrument in a band or orchestra. It encodes some bit of information but it's the amalgamation that is important. "Super Freak" and "U Can't Touch This" are two very different songs despite having the same bass and piano riff. Likewise, two different thoughts or concepts can be made of many of the same minicolumn firing patterns.</p>

<p>Eventually a winner is chosen, possibly by finding the "song" playing on the most cortical columns, and learning happens. The winning cortical columns are rewarded, somehow leading to their minicolumns encoding a tendency towards the message they were transmitting. These minicolumns will "remember" that firing pattern and are more likely to produce it in the future.</p>

<p>A Darwin Machine uses evolution to produce intelligence. It relies on the same insight that produced biology: That evolution is the best algorithm for predicting valid "solutions" within a near infinite problem space.</p>

<h2>Some Speculation</h2>

<h3>On Advantages</h3>

<p>I believe the theory of Darwin Machines illuminates a path to solving one of the biggest problems in AI right now. Current algorithms are great at system one thinking, quick thoughts, intuition. But they are not capable of system two thinking, deep thinking, where time spent on the problem correlates with a better answer.</p>

<p>The evolutionary approach of Darwin Machines seems to allow for the possibility of both. System one thinking would only run the competition for a short time, relying on the tendencies encoded in minicolumns to provide a quick and "good enough" behavior. System two thinking would let the competition run longer, allowing evolution to play out, leading to novel and "more fit" thoughts.</p>

<h3>On Creativity</h3>

<p>Many people believe that, in biology, point mutations lead to the change necessary to drive novelty in evolution. This is rarely the case. Point mutations are usually disastrous and every organism I know of does everything in its power to minimize them. Think, for every one beneficial point mutation, there are thousands that don't have any effect, and hundreds that cause something awful like cancer. If you're building a skyscraper, having one in a hundred bricks be laid with some variation is not a good thing.</p>

<p>Instead Biology relies on recombination. Swap one beneficial trait for another and there's a much smaller chance you'll end up with something harmful and a much higher chance you'll end up with something useful.</p>

<p>Recombination is the key to the creativity of evolution, and Darwin Machines harness it. A complex thought such as a memory of your grandmother is likely represented in a cortical column as a specific combination of spatiotemporal firing patterns within its minicolumns. But let's say you need to think of someone else's grandmother. The individual firing patterns that code for a grandmother probably remain, but the ones that code information specific to yours are likely swapped out for patterns corresponding to the new grandmother.</p>

<p>Maybe you're interested in bird watching and see a new bird. Your brain likely uses recombination to form the thought representing this bird. Maybe you've never seen a flamingo before. Some networks of minicolumns might identify features similar to a parrot you saw once, perhaps the pink coloring. Some might light up to say that the beak looks a bit like a toucan's. Others might propagate a message suggesting it's the size of an ostrich. etc. All these different messages can then mix together and our brain can store this unique combination as a flamingo.</p>

<p>Or in the other direction. When you're thinking hard about a question, you could let your mind wander a little (isn't that when all the good ideas hit us?). Maybe the act of mind wandering lets some message within the cortical column get exchanged for another. And WHAM! A new idea, a possible solution.</p>

<p>This is all speculation but I hope you can see the beauty of the Darwin Machine framework. I've been immersed in neuroscience for about four years now and nothing I've come across comes close to the breadth of explanation that this theory promises if born out in experiments.</p>

<h3>On Implementation</h3>

<p>Neural nets are great at intuition. They can take a seemingly infinite number of inputs and encode them into a relatively small space. Then, when prompted they can spit out something that is ~95% correct.</p>

<p>I suspect minicolumns and neural nets are, to a large extent, functionally equivalent. I'm trying small neural nets implemented in an array instead of one lone massive neural net. If it takes them one cycle to process an input pattern to an output pattern, then every cycle they should take a sensory input, and the input from adjacent neural nets in their array, and produce an output that, overtime, synchronizes throughout the array. I would love any advice, from anyone, about how to cunduct my own research and subsequent academics (if necessary) in order to work in this space.</p>

<p>I hope you find this idea as exciting as I do.</p>

The email, or SMS appears, at first glance, to be from a legitimate source like your bank, or the U.S. Postal Service. To try and prevent you from double checking, these messages will usually have a sense of urgency.</p><p>Within the message the danger lies in the form of a link or attachment that when clicked or downloaded, takes you to a spoofed website or installs malicious software on your device. This fake website or software then collects the sensitive information you give it such as login credentials, financial details, or personal data.</p><p>The attacker can then use this stolen information for various malicious purposes, such as identity theft, financial fraud, or gaining unauthorized access to accounts. Traditional phishing attacks rely on social engineering techniques to trick individuals into revealing confidential information unwittingly.</p><p>We’re going to repeat that last part for emphasis, <b>traditional phishing attacks rely on social engineering techniques, AI phishing attacks rely on machine learning techniques</b>.</p><div><p>Even though AI Phishing is claiming a significant amount of turf, you still have to protect yourself from the regular kind of phishing. Not <i>all</i> scammers understand how to leverage AI…yet. Learn more in our post on the <a href="https://www.mailgun.com/blog/deliverability/inside-the-seedy-underworld-of-spammers-and-phishers/" target="_tabs" rel="noopener noreferrer">seedy underbelly of scammers and phishers.</a></p></div><p><b>An AI phishing attack leverages artificial intelligence to make the phishing emails more convincing and personalized.</b> A bad actor could use AI algorithms to analyze vast amounts of data on a target segment, such as social media profiles, online behavior, and publicly available information which allows them to create personalized campaigns.</p><p>The phishing message could even include familiar touches, such as references to a user’s recent purchases, interests, or interactions. This level of personalization increases the likelihood of success. AI can also easily generate convincing replicas of legitimate websites, making it difficult for the recipient to distinguish between the fake and real sites.</p><p>There is a foundation of principles that AI phishing is built on, and they frame a limitless picture of possibilities.</p><p>AI phishing is dark marketing, it’s what <i>could</i> be possible without the ethics and legislation that legitimate senders operate within. That said, the basic processes are similar, just without boundaries. Here’s what using a tool like WormGPT could look like:</p><ol><li><p><b>Data Analysis:</b> The attacker uses algorithms and tools like WormGPT to scour the internet for vast amounts of data on the target group or individual. This includes social media profiles, public records, and online activities. WormGPT can analyze this data to understand the target's interests, behaviors, and preferences.</p></li><li><p><b>Personalization:</b> With the collected data, AI generates highly personalized phishing emails. These emails may reference recent purchases, hobbies, or specific events in the target's life. This level of personalization makes the emails appear more legitimate and increases the likelihood of the victim falling for the scam.</p></li><li><p><b>Content Creation:</b> Then, AI is used to generate convincing email content that mimics the writing style of the target's contacts or known institutions. This helps in creating a sense of familiarity and trust and overcomes any hurdles caused by language barriers.</p></li><li><p><b>Scale and Automation:</b> Finally, AI makes it easy for attackers to scale their operations efficiently. They can generate numerous unique phishing emails in a short amount of time and use AI to target a wide range of individuals or organizations while also using AI to generate code, assist with triggering automations, and setting up webhooks and integrations.</p></li></ol><p>AI generates output faster than humans. The end. We can debate (<a href="https://www.mailgun.com/blog/email/chatgpt-and-email/" target="_tabs" rel="noopener noreferrer">and have in other posts</a>) the quality and best uses of the outputs, but scammers aren’t stopping to have that conversation.</p><p>A group of engineers at IBM recently <a href="https://youtu.be/7XhySwUn9eA?feature=shared" target="_tabs" rel="noopener noreferrer">raced AI to create a phishing campaign</a>. What they discovered is that AI performed better in an incredibly small amount of time. And from this experiment came the 5/5 rule.</p><p>The 5/5 rule says that it takes 5 prompts and just 5 minutes to create a phishing campaign <i>nearly</i> as successful as a phishing campaign generated by IBM engineers. What took technically advanced humans 16 hours, generative AI did in 5 minutes – and Ai tools will iterate to become faster and more efficient, possibly exponentially. Humans have their limits.</p><ol><li><p>Come up with a list of concerns for a [specific group] in a [specifc industry]</p></li><li><p>Write an email leveraging social engineering techniques</p></li><li><p>Apply common marketing techniques to the email</p></li><li><p>Who should we send the email to?</p></li><li><p>Who should we say the email is from?</p></li></ol><div data-is-loaded="true"><picture id="5011d7db-36c2-5535-b24a-1bfb8826a644" contentful_id="6dnBM2vkKhEjJD3FiJB1ym" name="AI Phishing Email Image" alternative="Image shows an AI generated phishing email targeting employees looking for career development." internal="[object Object]" __typename="ContentfulImage" picture="[object Object]" sys="[object Object]"><source srcset="https://images.ctfassets.net/y6oq7udscnj8/3pa30MFuYRi98XHDF4Ygr9/0da400ca5ea6b3101b7d70265e043d0d/AI-phish-email.png?w=358&amp;h=173&amp;q=50&amp;fm=webp 358w,

Some more reminiscent of classic phishing attacks, and some very costly deepfakes.</p><p>This news story from early 2024 quickly became infamous due to its hefty price tag and the fact that video AI tools managed to completely convince a finance employee at an undisclosed multinational firm headquartered in China to release major funds.

Let’s play a quick game:</p><p>You receive the following email:</p><p><i>Subject: Password Reset Required for Your Account</i></p><p><i>Dear [Name],</i></p><p><i>We have detected potential unauthorized access to your account, so as a precautionary measure, we are resetting your password.</i></p><p><i>Please use this link to create a new password.</i></p><p><i>Our team strives to keep your account and information secure.

If the domain being spoofed was for an internal tool would any of your employees fall for it? Would you check the domain? Would you check the FROM address? Is it your fate now to do due diligence on every email you receive?</p><p>Now for the billion-dollar question (<a href="https://slashnext.com/state-of-phishing-2023/" target="_tabs" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 2 billion</a> to be more precise): What can <i>you</i> do to protect your organization and your email program against this new breed of phishing? do to protect your organization and your email program against this new breed of phishing?</p><p>As a sender you have two goals to defend. Your own reputation and security, and the security and data protection of your customers. And there’s only one email defense that exists, DMARC.</p><p>So, before we dive into best practices, here’s what’s happening with DMARC in the age of AI.</p><p>DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) has had quite the journey from inception to implementation. Surprisingly, adoption has been low. Maybe because the process is more technical than other standard authentications. Maybe because of the associated costs. Regardless, DMARC isn’t going anywhere. Here’s the journey so far:</p><ul><li><p><b>2007-2008</b>: The need for a more robust email authentication system was recognized as email phishing attacks became more sophisticated. <a href="https://www.mailgun.com/blog/deliverability/spf-records-basics/" target="_tabs" rel="noopener noreferrer">SPF (Sender Policy Framework)</a> and <a href="https://www.mailgun.com/blog/deliverability/understanding-dkim-how-it-works/" target="_tabs" rel="noopener noreferrer">DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)</a> were already in use to help verify the authenticity of email senders, but they had limitations.</p></li><li><p><b>2011</b>: A group of companies, including Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and PayPal, came together to work on a new standard that would address the limitations of SPF and DKIM. This collaboration led to the development of <a href="https://www.mailgun.com/blog/deliverability/implement-dmarc/" target="_tabs" rel="noopener noreferrer">DMARC.</a></p></li><li><p><b>2012</b>: DMARC was published in January 2012. It provided a way for email senders to define policies for how their emails should be authenticated and handled if they failed authentication.</p></li><li><p><b>2018:</b> The <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/policies/dmarc.jsp#:~:text=DMARC%2520is%2520a%2520set%2520of,implemented%2520by%2520October%252016%252C%25202018." target="_tabs" rel="noopener noreferrer">Department of Homeland Security</a> required all federal agencies to implement DMARC by October 2018 to help mitigate the illegitimate use of organizational mail.</p></li><li><p><b>2018-2023:</b> DMARC adoption has not been as widespread as its creators wanted. Without widespread adoption, enforcing DMARC policies is problematic for providers. According to <a href="https://www.spamresource.com/2024/01/dmarc-adoption-trends-q3-q4-2023.html#:~:text=Though%2520you%2520can%2520see%2520that,a%2520DMARC%2520record%2520in%2520play." target="_tabs" rel="noopener noreferrer">spamresource</a>, out of the top 10 million domains, only around <a href="https://www.spamresource.com/2024/01/dmarc-adoption-trends-q3-q4-2023.html#:~:text=Though%2520you%2520can%2520see%2520that,a%2520DMARC%2520record%2520in%2520play." target="_tabs" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.23 million domains had a DMARC record in play</a> by the end of 2023. That will change.</p></li><li><p><b>2024:</b> In October 2023, <a href="https://www.mailgun.com/blog/deliverability/gmail-and-yahoo-inbox-updates-2024/" target="_tabs" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gmail and Yahoo announced</a> they would be enforcing some strict sender requirements to help regain control over inbox standards and protect users and senders alike. One requirement is that DMARC be implemented with a minimum policy of p=none. This shift in accountability will help bring inboxes back into balance.</p></li></ul><p>Ok, now that we’ve finished our DMARC detour, let’s get back to phishing. While DMARC is the primary defense, there are other best practices to help give you a well-rounded battle strategy.</p><p><b>The first step is to learn the signs.</b> We can no longer follow the footprints of bad grammar and failed personalization<b>.</b> Recognizing AI phishing attempts requires a shift in perspective. In fact, perspective shifting is a skill you should hone given the speed at which AI is developing and integrating.</p><p>The usual markers like bad grammar and awkward sentence structure no longer apply. Now, step one should be validating the source directly.&nbsp;Cousin&nbsp;domains (also known as look-alike domains) can still be registered as legitimate domains, but the name wouldn’t be quite the same. <b>Check the URL and domain against the actual company domain.</b> If it’s an unknown sender<u>,</u> it’s a good idea to flag the message to your internal company security team or report it as spam in your mailbox provider.</p><div><p>DMARC doesn’t have the ability to defend against cousin domains since it only protects the domain where the DMARC policy was created.

<p>Following the <a target="_blank" href="https://dx.tips/zirp">ZIRP DevRel</a> post, the community has had many great discussions on where devrel needs to go next. DXTips exists to share this tacit niche industry knowledge. <strong>DX@X</strong> is our new async interview series we are starting with DevRel leaders to get more perspectives on the state of the art in DX and DevRel. We're excited to kick it off with <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/osanseviero">Omar Sanseviero</a>, Chief Llama Officer at HuggingFace</strong>!</p>
<p>HuggingFace is well known for being incredible stewards of the open source ML community, building critical infrastructure at hypergrowth (growing from 780k to 2.3m repos on the HF Hub in the past year) and doing so <a target="_blank" href="https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-news-updates/hugging-face-announces-profitability-with-free-and-open-source-models/">profitably</a>.

<h2 id="heading-introduction-to-omar-and-huggingface">Introduction to Omar and HuggingFace</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Intro:</strong> <em>Hey Omar! Let’s assume people know the surface level of HuggingFace - it’s the largest AI community which collaborates on open source models, datasets, and applications, with paid compute and enterprise solutions. What does a Chief Llama Officer do at HF?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/osanseviero/media">Memes</a>! More seriously, my title might translate to “<strong>Head of Platform and Community</strong>” at another company, although the scope of what I do is quite broad. There are two aspects to my role:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leadership</strong>: Within HF, my role involves horizontal and vertical leadership. Vertically, I direct a family of teams (Dev Advocacy Engineering, On-device ML, Moonshot Factory, Argilla - our most recent acquisition). Horizontally, our team sits at the intersection of Open Source, Product, and the external community (+ sometimes research). In my day-to-day, I aim to identify high-impact potential areas, connect dots across teams at HF and the community, and unblock people to succeed.</li>
<li><strong>IC</strong>: HF has a very bottom-up leadership culture. This, combined with a meeting-less async culture (<a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/mervenoyann/status/1692111147783143751">example</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/SashaMTL/status/1773344913502929014">example</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/osanseviero/status/1573055162070999061">example</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=63185">old HBS case study</a>), allows folks in leadership positions to dedicate significant time to technical and meaningful contributions to different projects. A significant part of my role involves collaborating with partners to release new models, such as the latest Llama and Gemma models. Each release is unique, intense, and fun, and I quite enjoy being deeply involved in the entire process.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Followup</strong>: <em>What do you think is under-appreciated about HF’s open source work?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hugging Face is a community-centric company. It's hard to exaggerate how community-centric we are. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>We prioritize giving the spotlight to community members and collaborators as much as possible.</li>
<li>Provide compute and no-strings-attached cash grants (including but not limited to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24156755/hugging-face-celement-delangue-free-shared-gpus-ai">the $10m ZeroGPU program</a>) to community members/communities (for example, in the past, Eleuther, Boris from Dall-e Mini, and lucidrains have been sponsored by HF, allowing them to keep doing their cool work without financial constraints).</li>
<li>Help maintain open-source libraries (eg <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers">sentence transformers</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bitsandbytes-foundation/bitsandbytes">bitsandbytes</a>) from other groups and closely collaborate with other tools (eg <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/tree/main">LM Eval Harness</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip">OpenCLIP</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Our approach to working with other groups and open-source platforms and libraries is always collaborative. We view ourselves as "the Switzerland" of the ML community, actively contributing to and supporting the ML ecosystem. We want the community to be successful and grow the pie.</p>
<p>So, one aspect of HF that I think is underappreciated is the extent of the support and collaboration with the community. Many see the outputs—like models and libraries—but might not realize the significant behind-the-scenes effort that the team puts into fostering the thriving ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="heading-devrel-at-huggingface-metrics-and-velocity">DevRel at HuggingFace: Metrics and Velocity</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Credibility/Success:</strong> <em>What are some “real” metrics that you track that point to HF’s devrel success?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>DevRel comes in all kinds of flavors in the industry. Some DevRel teams are part of a marketing function, and some are within a monetization-team function. At Hugging Face, DevRel sits between the open-source and product organizations and is primarily an engineering function.</p>
<p>This means <strong>HF DevRel's goal is to see increased usage of the Hub platform and open-source tools</strong> rather than focusing on revenue as our primary goal. Two of our north stars are the <strong>number of repositories on HF and logged-in usage of the Hub</strong> platform. For example, the Hub has 2.3 million repositories today, compared to 780k repositories a year ago. (Of course, we can look at everything with more granularity, e.g., the number of Spaces, which grew from 187k in June last year to 650k this year).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca97fe47-127d-4bc6-9d05-b4f2c0fdf863" alt="image"></p>
<p>Each team member works on different topics (e.g., Computer Vision, Audio ML, ML for 3D CV, etc.), so we jointly define some metrics that we would like to see move based on our efforts. <strong>We prioritize usage-based</strong> (number of repos, downloads, installs) <strong>over visibility-driven</strong> (GitHub stars, Twitter likes, views), which are also valuable but not the main motivation of our work.</p>
<p>That said, I'm skeptical of cultures that overemphasize metrics (of course, this is nuanced and depends on a lot of context). From my experience at Google and looking at other startups, I've seen the downsides of measuring too much too early. Metrics are an imperfect proxy for impact and are game-able. <strong>Cultures prioritizing metrics above all risk losing sight of user needs and making wrong decisions</strong> (e.g., to improve metrics for their performance review rather than genuine user benefit). Some DevRel activities might not have immediate metric changes but have long-term impact.</p>
<p>One of the most rewarding moments was after two years of building connections with Spanish-speaking folks, we <a target="_blank" href="https://platzi.com/blog/ayuda-a-mejorar-los-llm-en-espanol-en-7-sencillos-pasos/">initiated</a> an exciting Alpaca translation effort involving Argilla, Platzi (a Colombian edtech), and many community super-users. This 'Avengers assemble' moment is becoming more frequent as we foster stronger relationships with practitioners, communities, and organizations. Examples of these are <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/_lewtun/status/1778429536264188214">Zephyr ORPO</a> (KAIST + HF + Argilla), <a target="_blank" href="https://huggingface.co/blog/4bit-transformers-bitsandbytes">QLoRA</a> (University of Washington), and the very recent <a target="_blank" href="https://huggingface.co/blog/winning-aimo-progress-prize">AI Math Olympiad winner</a> (NuminaM + HF).</p>

<p><strong>DevRel @ HF:</strong> <em>What was your reaction to <a target="_blank" href="https://dx.tips/zirp">the ZIRP DevRel article</a>? What’s different at HF?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned before, DevRel comes in all kinds of flavors. There were things that I could relate to. Specially two points:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm a bit skeptical of the impact of traveling to conferences. While conferences can be impactful if approached strategically, the highest impact usually doesn't come from giving a talk. Instead, it's often the connections made and behind-the-scenes collaborations which require a different mindset. We support conference travel (and people do that a lot), but we encourage team members to attend with an impact-driven mindset, ready to achieve some concrete things beyond attending an event.</li>
<li>Lack of OKRs. <strong>We do not have OKRs</strong>. The ML ecosystem moves incredibly fast, so we need to be nimble and action-driven. Gemini Nano was added to Chrome? Let's figure out how to run it and <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/xenovacom/status/1810356703826977183">release some docs</a>. Model 504B is coming out next month; let's make sure it's usable by the community. Although exciting, this comes with cons: priorities can and will change, planning becomes challenging, and maintaining focus can be difficult in the chaos of the current ML space.</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, I think HF DevRel has been successful overall for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's an <strong>engineering-centric</strong> function. Day-to-day activities might involve fine-tuning models to get a training script right, collaborating on a research project, or finding out why a model is not quantizing well to 4 bits. Our users are engineers and researchers, so it's essential that we are in their world to understand them.</li>
<li>It's a <strong>decentralized</strong> function. Although we have a dedicated DevRel team, <strong>everyone at HF is expected to do activities usually associated with DevRel</strong>. Although we have a DevRel team, everyone at HF, from research to success engineers, is involved in doing DevRel-like activities themselves, so you'll see everyone engaging in social media, creating content (youtube, blog posts, etc), giving presentations, etc. If you build a feature/tool, you're responsible of its visibility and growth (of course, with support/guidance from others). Marketing your own work could involve writing a blog post or a technical deep dive, crafting some beautiful notebooks, and yes, sometimes making memes. If you visit <a target="_blank" href="https://huggingface.co/blog">HF blog</a>, you'll see content from all across the company. Rather than "outsourcing" these responsibilities to a third team (either a marketing or a DevRel team in many companies), HF members are encouraged and expected to own their work, end to end. <a target="_blank" href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceFW/blogpost-fineweb-v1">FineWeb</a> is an amazing example of how this can be successful.</li>
</ul>
<p>The two points combined lead to very genuine and scalable relationships. Rather than a competitive culture, we've fostered a culture in which people are excited to collaborate both internally and externally and ready to amplify the amazing work being done by the community.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Followup question on DevRel Velocity:</strong> <em>I notice that OKRs very rarely prioritize moving fast. What has worked/not worked in encouraging your team members to move fast (other than the obvious intrinsic motivation)?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>What works well</strong>: Beyond intrinsic motivation, which is indeed a strong factor, collective momentum plays a big role. Being surrounded by a group of smart, driven individuals working on the latest ML advancements creates an environment where progress is both expected and contagious. This collaborative atmosphere builds some sense of urgency and encourages everyone to push forward together.</li>
<li><strong>What does not work well</strong>: On the flip side, a lack of structured planning and clear OKRs can affect some people. While flexibility is desired a lot in the industry, it can lead to ambiguity and confusion about expectations, making it harder for new team members to get up to speed quickly. This can result in onboarding challenges and potential mismatches in cultural fit. Each team is a bit different, but there's a balance between agility and more structured goal-setting that can help everyone thrive.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Open Source Engineering and Community:</strong> <em>HF maintains a -lot- of open source work, and only (~200?) employees. How do you organize the different projects you work on, and how does the community engagement work?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, we're a relatively small team (215 persons), and maintain a large number of libraries ourselves: demos (Gradio), data (datasets, Argilla, distilabel), modeling (transformers, diffusers, timm, peft, Candle, tokenizers, accelerate, parler TTS, transformers.js), production (TGI and TEI), and research related (lerobot, alignment handbook), plus support community libraries (bitsandbytes and sentence-transformers and others as mentioned above).</p>
<p>There are some key strategies that have worked well for us</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strong async culture</strong>. We mostly communicate through Slack and GitHub, enabling collaboration across different projects. This fosters transparency, allowing everyone to gain visibility into other projects.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible organizational and role boundaries.</strong> The organizational structure is flexible, allowing people from different teams to contribute where needed. For example, when we were preparing for Llama 2 release, people from all kinds of teams contributed to make sure the model was in good shape and usable by the community. It's quite powerful to see different teams working organically to make things happen without having to go through bureaucracy or process management.</li>
<li>(other points mentioned above, such as being collaboration and community centric)</li>
<li><strong>Pragmatic</strong>. Let me dive into this one more in the next point :)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Prioritization:</strong> <em>There’s a lot of interesting directions in ML and only so much time/resources. How do you decide -what- to invest in? And what to cut? Because you're decentralized - what do managers decide vs leave to ICs?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a great question and likely one of our biggest challenges. As you said, there are many interesting directions, and the ecosystem is changing quickly. We see new players, from new libraries and startups to new organizations releasing models.</p>
<p>In general, I like to apply the concept of exploration/exploitation from Reinforcement Learning. This involves two main stages:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Exploration</strong>: We do small projects or comms to gauge their potential impact and community interest. This allows us to experiment without having too many people working on it or committing lots of time.</li>
<li><strong>Exploitation</strong>: Based on the knowledge gained from the exploration stage, we focus our efforts on things we are more confident will have a significant impact. This involves scaling up successful projects and allocating more resources to areas with proven value.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, it's never as simple as that (the ϵ is variable), and it's usually cyclical (exploration -&gt; exploitation -&gt; exploration), but it's a good mental framework to have. Some projects are heavy in exploration by nature (for example, exploring a very niche domain or community), and others might require a larger time investment (which tends to happen in research-oriented projects).</p>
<p>The second point, related to the above, is pragmatism. That means being willing to pause or stop projects if they aren't having the expected impact. For example, investing days to make a YouTube video with a few hundred views may not be a worthwhile investment unless it leads to some very valuable or targeted outcome. It can be sad to spend some weeks building an open-source library and then see no engagement or adoption. What is worse, however, is to keep pushing and pushing for a tool that might lack product-market fit.</p>
<p>Failure is a part of the process for all of us. The key is to learn from it, understand what went well and what didn't, and know when to pivot or stop. This pragmatic approach helps us stay focused on what truly matters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Followup Question:</strong> <em>Let’s apply Explore-Exploit. Just to pick on a specific, visible example that has caught my (swyx’s) eye recently, <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/reach_vb/">VB (Vaibhav)</a> has staked out a very notable position as “the audio guy” on AI Twitter. Always the first to have great takes on anything in audio, shipping insanely-fast-whisper and the TTS Arena, and goodness knows what else I don’t even know about. He of course also does <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/reach_vb/status/1806343018640781675">other open source AI work eg on LLMs</a>. Was there a top down decision to focus on Audio? It must have been… But I’m also equally sure that audio doesn’t drive nearly as much revenue for HF as, say, LLMs or Diffusion models (Apolinario). So… great hire, but how did you decide to invest in audio in the first place? Is there any calculation driven by the GTM/Product/Sales side of HF?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It might sound surprising, but audio (with VB) was a very validated area we wanted to invest in, while diffusion/art (<a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/multimodalart">Poli</a>) was a very experimental area.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/56f995f4-8f48-467f-9463-2d4582e1f730" alt="image"></p>
<p><strong>For audio</strong>, back in 2022, we saw a significant wave of OS libraries (SpeechBrain, ESPNet, Asteroid, etc) and interesting research (Whisper, XLS-R by Meta, etc). We were actively organizing community sprints with free GPUs to help people fine-tune speech recognition models in their languages. There was a lot going on that led to the decision to hire a DA for the role (apart from the MLE in the open source team already working on the topic). VB was working in audio in his masters and had already engaged with us through different efforts. Despite being somewhat junior in the open ML space, his <strong>very</strong> strong alignment with the open ML culture and mindset allowed him to scale his impact. Since joining, VB has expanded beyond audio, leading different collaborations and integrations, including recent work with Georgi on llama.cpp. Now, VB is even <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/reach_vb/status/1810977320275943852">hiring an intern</a> to support the ML ecosystem for audio!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/030763e7-ce88-4cab-9371-4120525f1461" alt="image"></p>
<p><strong>For diffusion/art</strong>, Poli was our first Moonshot MLE hired to make "ML for art as accessible and open source as possible." This was before the hype around Stable Diffusion. We hired him because of his strong cultural alignment, his contributions to early HF Spaces and him being a Gradio super-user. At that time, while more experimental, the impact on Spaces and the potential of diffusion models (like latent diffusion by CompVis) showed promising signs. As a power (and somewhat early) user for Spaces, he also brought lots of product ideas on making Spaces more successful.</p>
<p>In summary, our decision to invest in audio was based on clear community and research validation as well as growth potential. In contrast, MLxArt was a more experimental exploration that showed early impacts and ended up being a very high impact area.</p>
<p>Sometimes both intercept! Talking about AI x music <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/iamwill/status/1696546638863749154">with will.i.am</a> is definitely a highlight of last year.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Hugging Face's core audience has traditionally been people with ML experience, but we've seen more and more <strong>developers without an ML background who want to incorporate ML into their projects or learn about ML</strong>. These developers often feel overwhelmed by the complexity of ML and the speed of the ecosystem. While the community has introduced new tools and APIs to simplify things, and we have exciting features coming soon, there's still much to be done to lower the entry barriers further. I'm looking for <strong>insights and suggestions on how we can make our tools even more accessible to non-ML developers</strong>. (<em>Editor: some might call these <a target="_blank" href="https://www.latent.space/p/ai-engineer">AI Engineers</a>?</em>)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Some topics I'm interested in (not necessarily for a startup):</p>
<p>In <strong>Research</strong>: </p>
<ul>
<li>more distillation experiments and OS tooling</li>
<li>densification of sparse (MoE) models</li>
<li>quantization (sub-1-bit for MoEs, &lt;8-bit fine-tuning), tooling on speculative decoding strategies, more people trying the KTO alignment algorithm (which removes the need of preference data for RLHF/PPO/DPO)</li>
<li>true multimodality (2+ input modalities and 2+ output modalities, e.g., text+image+video to text+image in a unified model)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are trends in all of this already.</p>
<p>More generally: We want <strong>more developer-friendly ML tooling</strong> (i.e. making it super easy for any developer to use ML, not just LLMs).  If you come from a background in which you can speak both the language of a discipline (biochemistry, chemistry, material sciences, health) and ML, and communicate and work well with both audiences, you're a unicorn and can do very impactful things, not just in the ML domain, but in other industries.</p>

	<small>7/9/2024</small><p><small><i>See the discussion of this post on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40978831">Hacker News</a>.</i></small></p>

<p>I'm down a rabbit hole of learning how bignums work. In the first post, <a href="https://austinhenley.com/blog/bignum1.html">making a bignum library for fun</a>, I implemented a arbitrary-precision number library with some basic operations. You can follow along with the source on <a href="https://github.com/AZHenley/bignum">GitHub</a>.</p>

<pre>int main() {
    BigNum a, b, sum;

    bignum_init(&amp;a, "12345678901234567890");
    bignum_init(&amp;b, "98765432109876543210");

    bignum_add(&amp;sum, &amp;a, &amp;b);
    bignum_print(&amp;sum);

    bignum_free(&amp;a);
    bignum_free(&amp;b);
    bignum_free(&amp;sum);

    return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>My naive approach represents numbers as strings of decimal digits. The number 321 becomes <i>'3', '2', '1'</i>. Then addition and multiplication is performed similar to how we learned in school to do it digit by digit.</p>

<p>We can do much better!</p>

<p>In this post, I improve how the numbers are stored, implement a faster multiplication algorithm, and benchmark the time improvements.</p>

<hr> 

<h3>More efficient digits</h3>

<p>The most obvious optimization is to use a much larger base for the "digits". For example, rather than an array of digits that each range from 0 to 9, we can store an array of number chunks that each range from 0 to the limit of whatever integer size we use. It will allow us to use memory much, much more efficiently. It will also greatly reduce the number of steps to perform our addition and multiplication since there are fewer digits.</p>

<p>There are tradeoffs for how many bits to use per chunk: memory, arithmetic performance, cache locality, overflow management, native CPU operations, complexity of our code, etc. Looking for inspiration, I saw CPython uses 30-bit digits and GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library uses 64-bit digits on 64-bit CPUs.</p>

<p>I didn't do an in-depth analysis of what an optimal size may be, but even using 30-bit digits means the numbers can get <b>very large</b> with a few digits. Each 30-bit digit can hold 9 decimal digits. For example, <i>987654321</i> will fit in a single 30-bit digit and <i>987654321987654321</i> will fit in just two! This is already more precision than I've ever needed, and the library can use an arbitrary number of these digits in our bignum.</p>

<p>Let's implement the 30-bit digits. It will make our code simpler since the sum of any two digits will not overflow using a <i>uint32</i> and the product won't overflow a <i>uint64</i>.</p>

<pre>typedef struct {
    uint32_t *digits; // Use 30-bit digits.
    int size;
} BigNum;

void bignum_init(BigNum *n, const char *str) {
    int len = strlen(str);
    int num_digits = (len + 8) / 9; // Each 30-bit chunk can store up to 9 base-10 digits.
    n-&gt;size = num_digits;
    n-&gt;digits = calloc(n-&gt;size, sizeof(uint32_t)); // Initialize with zeros.
	
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {
        int digit_pos = i / 9;
        int offset = i % 9;
        uint32_t digit = str[len - 1 - i] - '0'; // Convert from ASCII.
        uint32_t multiplier = 1;
        for (int j = 0; j &lt; offset; j++) {
            multiplier *= 10; // Correctly place the digit.
        }
        n-&gt;digits[digit_pos] += digit * multiplier;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>The bignum is now made up of an array of <i>uint32_t</i> instead of <i>char</i>. The <b>bignum_init</b> function will convert a base-10 number string to an array of 30-bit digits. First, it calculates how many 30-bit digits will be needed and initializes them to zero. Then it loops through the string from least significant digit to most significant digit, converting them to chunks of 9 digits, each stored in a <i>uint32_t</i>. It will flow to the next 30-bit digit as needed.</p>

<p>In order to easily test this, we should revise the <b>bignum_print</b> function. Previously, we would just loop through the base-10 digits and print them. Now we have to handle three different cases just for zeros: leading zeros in a digit, a middle chunk that is zero, and the entire bignum being zero.</p>

<pre>void bignum_print(const BigNum *n) {
    printf("BigNum: ");
    int leading = 1;
    for (int i = n-&gt;size - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--) {
        if (leading) {
            printf("%u", n-&gt;digits[i]);
            leading = 0;
        } else {
            printf("%09u", n-&gt;digits[i]); // Print with leading zeros.
        }
    }
    if (leading) {
        printf("0"); // If the number is zero, print a single zero.
    }
    printf("\n");
}
</pre>

<p>Try creating a bignum from <i>"987654321987654321"</i>. Does it print correctly? It does for me! Inspect the <i>digits</i> field to validate it is storing them in the way you are imagining.</p>

<h3>Higher-bit arithmetic</h3>

<p>We have to modify the addition and multiplication functions to also operate on these 30-bit digits. They really aren't much different though.</p>

<pre>void bignum_add(BigNum *result, const BigNum *a, const BigNum *b) {
    int max_size = a-&gt;size &gt; b-&gt;size ? a-&gt;size : b-&gt;size;
    result-&gt;digits = calloc(max_size + 1, sizeof(uint32_t)); // Initialize with zeros.
    uint32_t carry = 0;
    int i;

    for (i = 0; i &lt; max_size || carry; i++) {
        uint32_t sum = carry;
        if (i &lt; a-&gt;size) sum += a-&gt;digits[i];
        if (i &lt; b-&gt;size) sum += b-&gt;digits[i];
        result-&gt;digits[i] = sum % 1000000000; // Store the last 30 bits.
        carry = sum / 1000000000; // Carry any overflow.
    }
    result-&gt;size = (carry ? i + 1 : i); // Adjust size if needed.
}
</pre>

<p>We still perform addition digit by digit, though this time with 30-bit digits (actually using 10<sup>9</sup> but bear with me).</p>

<p>The updated multiplication is also virtually the same. We use a <i>uint64_t</i> to capture any overflow though.</p>

<pre>void bignum_multiply(BigNum *result, const BigNum *a, const BigNum *b) {
    int max_size = a-&gt;size + b-&gt;size;
    result-&gt;digits = calloc(max_size, sizeof(uint32_t));
    result-&gt;size = max_size; // Max size we will need.

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; a-&gt;size; i++) {
        uint64_t carry = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j &lt; b-&gt;size; j++) {
            int index = i + j;
            uint64_t product = (uint64_t)a-&gt;digits[i] * (uint64_t)b-&gt;digits[j] + (uint64_t)result-&gt;digits[index] + carry;
            result-&gt;digits[index] = product % 1000000000; // Store the last 30 bits of the product
            carry = product / 1000000000; // Carry any overflow.
        }
        result-&gt;digits[i + b-&gt;size] += carry; // Add any carry.
    }
	
    // Trim any leading zeros.
    while (result-&gt;size &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; result-&gt;digits[result-&gt;size - 1] == 0) {
        result-&gt;size--;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Try it out. If you add <i>987654321987654321</i> to <i>123456789123456789</i> then you should get <i>1111111111111111110</i>. Multiplying them should give you 121932631356500531347203169112635269.</p>

<h3>Measure it</h3>

<p>Everyone knows that any attempt at optimizing requires a rigorous, scientific benchmark to understand the improvements.</p>

<p>To compare the original base-10 digits to this 30-bit digit version, I'll run add and multiply repeatedly on random numbers. I made a function to generate random bignums from n-length strings.</p>

<p>The benchmarking code:</p>

<pre>char* generateRandomNumberString(int length) {
    char *num = malloc((length + 1) * sizeof(char));
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; i++) {
        num[i] = '0' + (rand() % 10);
    }
    num[length] = '\0';
    return num;
}

int main() {
    srand(time(NULL));
    int iterations = 10000;
    int numLength = 1000;  // Length of the random numbers.

    double total_addition_time = 0.0;
    double total_multiplication_time = 0.0;

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; iterations; i++) {
        char *str1 = generateRandomNumberString(numLength);
        char *str2 = generateRandomNumberString(numLength);

        BigNum num1, num2, sum, product;
        bignum_init(&amp;num1, str1);
        bignum_init(&amp;num2, str2);
        bignum_init(&amp;sum, "");
        bignum_init(&amp;product, "");

        // Benchmark addition.
        clock_t start = clock();
        bignum_add(&amp;sum, &amp;num1, &amp;num2);
        clock_t end = clock();
        total_addition_time += (double)(end - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;

        // Benchmark multiplication.
        start = clock();
        bignum_multiply(&amp;product, &amp;num1, &amp;num2);
        end = clock();

<p>How does it compare to the previous base-10 digits implementation on 10,000 operations with 1,000-digit numbers?</p>

<img src="https://austinhenley.com/blog/images/bignumbenchmark.png" alt="Bar charts comparing addition and multiplication times for base-10 digits and 30-bit digits.">

<p>For addition, it is an 83% improvement from 0.04 seconds to 0.007 seconds. For multiplication, it is a 99% improvement from 63 seconds to 0.43 seconds. <b>Wow!</b> I knew the schoolyard multiplication algorithm with base-10 digits would be slow, but I did not expect this kind of speed up.</p>

<p>We aren't done yet though.</p>

<h3>Faster multiplication</h3>

<p>From one of my college courses, I recalled algorithms for multiplication that are faster than the schoolyard approach we are using. A quick search shows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karatsuba_algorithm">Karatsuba algorithm</a> to be popular for these sorts of things. Instead of multiplying two n-digit numbers, it does multiplication on three n/2-digit numbers, which apparently is a huge improvement.</p>

<img src="https://austinhenley.com/blog/images/karatsuba.png">

<p>You can see my Karatsuba multiplication function on <a href="https://github.com/AZHenley/bignum/blob/f4ee868f716cff90d4bf67ce8901a741172d34fb/part2/bignum.c#L104">GitHub</a>. I adapted the pseudocode from Wikipedia with the help of Copilot.</p>

<p>How much faster is it?</p>

<p>Is it actually <b>2% slower</b> using the same benchmark parameters.</p>

<p>Why? Apparently Karatsuba can be slower for <i>"smaller"</i> numbers due to overhead and additional operations. In fact, CPython only uses it for numbers with more than 70 30-bit digits. Those are big numbers!</p>

<p>Fair enough, so I changed the benchmark to use random numbers with 10,000 digits instead of 1,000 and did see an improvement: 39.88 seconds for traditional multiplication versus 16.27 seconds for Karatsuba multiplication. A 59% improvement! I suspect it will get better and better as the number length grows.</p>

<hr>

<h3>What is next?</h3>

<p>Alright, so we have made two major optimizations to the bignum library and measured the impact on running time. Using larger digits had a huge effect. The code is on <a href="https://github.com/AZHenley/bignum">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>If I were to continue working on this project, I'd focus on <b>usefulness</b>. It is still missing core features that you'd expect from even the most basic bignums:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Negative numbers</li>
    <li>Subtraction and division</li>
    <li>Exponentiation</li>
    <li>Bitwise operations</li>
    <li>Converting to/from other types</li>
	<li>Tests <small>(I bet there are many bugs in my code)</small></li>
</ul>

<p>In this article, I look inside a chip in the IBM 3274 Control Unit.<span id="fnref:3274"><a href="#fn:3274">1</a></span>
But before I discuss the chip, I need to give some background on mainframes.
(I didn't completely analyze the chip, so don't expect a nice narrative or solid conclusions.)</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/ibm-3274/die.jpg"><img alt="Die photo of the Motorola/IBM SC81150 chip.

<p>IBM's vintage mainframes were extremely underpowered compared to modern computers; a System/370 mainframe ran well under 1 million instructions
per second, while a modern laptop executes billions of instructions per second.
But these mainframes could support rooms full of users, while my 2017 laptop can barely handle one person.<span id="fnref:laptop"><a href="#fn:laptop">2</a></span>
Mainframes achieved their high capacity by offloading much of the data entry overhead so the mainframe could
focus on the "important" work.
The mainframe received data directly into memory in bulk over high-speed I/O channels, without needing to handle character-by-character editing.
For instance, a typical data entry terminal (a "3270") let the user update fields on the screen without involving the computer. When the user 
had filled out the screen, pressing the "Enter" key sent the entire data record to the mainframe at once.
Thus, the mainframe didn't need to process every keystroke; it only dealt with complete records.
(This is also why many modern keyboards have an "Enter" key.)</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/ibm-3274/3179.jpg"><img alt="A room with IBM 3179 Color Display Stations, 1984. Note that these are terminals, not PCs. From 3270 Information Display System Introduction." height="330" src="https://static.righto.com/images/ibm-3274/3179-w500.jpg" title="A room with IBM 3179 Color Display Stations, 1984. Note that these are terminals, not PCs. From 3270 Information Display System Introduction." width="500"></a></p>
<p>But that was just the beginning of the hierarchy of offloaded processing in a mainframe system.
Terminals weren't attached directly to the mainframe. You could wire 16 terminals to a terminal multiplexer (such as the 3299).
This would in turn be connected to a 3274 Control Unit that merged the terminal data and handled the network protocols.
The Control Unit was connected to the mainframe's
channel processor which handled I/O by moving data between memory and peripherals without slowing down the CPU.
All these layers allowed the mainframe to focus on the important data processing while the layers underneath dealt with the details.<span id="fnref:secretary"><a href="#fn:secretary">3</a></span></p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/ibm-3274/overview.jpg"><img alt="An overview of the IBM 3270 Information Display System attachment. The yellow highlights indicate the 3274 Control Unit.

The yellow highlights indicate the 3274 Control Unit. From 3270 Information Display System: Introduction." width="650"></a></p>
<p>The 3274 Control Unit (highlighted above) is the source of the chip I examined.
The purpose of the Control Unit
"is to take care of all communication between the host system and your organization's display stations and printers".
The diagram above shows how terminals were connected to a mainframe, with the 3274 Control Unit (indicated by arrows) in the middle.
The 3274 was an all-purpose box, handling terminals, printers, modems, and encryption (if needed).
It could communicate with the mainframe at up to 650,000 characters per second.
The control unit below (above) is a boring beige box. The control panel is minimal since people normally didn't interact with the unit.
On the back are coaxial connectors for the lines to the terminals, as well as connectors to interface with the computer and other peripherals.</p>

<h2>The Keystone II board</h2>
<p>In 1983, IBM announced new Control Unit models with twice the speed: these were the Model 41 and Model 61.
These units were built around a board called Keystone II, shown below.
The board is constructed with IBM's peculiar PCB style. The board is arranged as a grid of squares with the PCB traces too small to see
unless you zoom in.
Most of the decoupling capacitors are in IBM's thin, rectangular packages, although I see a few capacitors in more standard blue packages.
IBM is almost a parallel universe with its unusual packaging for ICs and capacitors as well as the strange circuit board appearance.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/ibm-3274/keystone-ii.jpg"><img alt="The Keystone II board. The box is labeled Keystone II FCS [i.e. First Customer Shipment] July 23, 1982.

<p>Most of the chips on the board are IBM chips packaged in square aluminum cans, known as MST (Monolithic System Technology). The first line on each package
is the IBM part number, which is usually undocumented.
The empty socket can hold a ROS chip; ROS is Read-Only Store, known as ROM to people outside IBM.
The Texas Instruments ICs in the upper right are easier to identify; the <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/SN74LS641">74LS641</a> chips are octal bus transceivers, presumably
connecting this board to the rest of the system.
Similarly, the <a href="https://vintagecomputer.ca/ibm-vintage-logic-chip-equivalency-list/">561 5843</a> is a 74S240 octal bus driver while the
561 6647 chips are 74LS245 octal bus transceivers.</p>
<p>The memory chips on the left side of this board are interesting: each one consists of two "piggybacked" 16-kilobit DRAM chips.
IBM's part number <a href="https://bitsavers.computerhistory.org//pdf/ibm/logic/IBM_Part_Number_to_Industry_Part_Number.txt#:~:text=74LS192%20BCD%20COUNTER-,8279251,-4116%2032K%20CARIBOU">8279251</a> corresponds to the Intel 4116 chip, originally made by Mostek.
With 18 piggybacked chips, the board holds 64 kilobytes of parity-protected memory.</p>
<p>The photo below shows the Keystone II board mounted in the 3274 Control Unit. The board is in slot E towards the left and the purple Motorola
IC is visible.</p>

<p>The board has a Motorola chip in a purple ceramic package; this is the chip that I examined. Popping off the golden lid reveals the silicon
die underneath.
The package has the part number "SC81150R", indicating a Motorola Special/Custom chip. This part number is also visible on the die, as shown below.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/ibm-3274/sc81150.jpg"><img alt="The corner of the die is marked with the SC81150 part number.

Bond pads and bond wires are also visible." width="400"></a></p><p>The corner of the die is marked with the SC81150 part number. Bond pads and bond wires are also visible.</p>
<p>While the outside of the IC is labeled "Motorola", there are no signs of Motorola internally. 
Instead, the die is marked "IBM" with the eight-striped logo. My guess is that IBM designed the chip and Motorola manufactured it.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/ibm-3274/ibm.jpg"><img alt="The IBM logo on the die." height="286" src="https://static.righto.com/images/ibm-3274/ibm-w400.jpg" title="The IBM logo on the die." width="400"></a></p><p>The IBM logo on the die.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows the chip with some of the functional blocks identified.
Around the outside are the bond pads and the bond wires that are connected to the chip's grid of pins.
At the right is the 16×16 block of memory, along with its associated control, byte swap, and output circuitry.
The yellowish-white lines are the metal layer on top of the chip that provides the chip's wiring. The thick metal lines distribute power and
ground throughout the chip.
Unlike modern chips, this chip only has a single metal layer, so power and ground distribution tends to get in the way of useful circuitry.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/ibm-3274/die-labeled.jpg"><img alt="The die with some functional blocks identified." height="542" src="https://static.righto.com/images/ibm-3274/die-labeled-w600.jpg" title="The die with some functional blocks identified." width="600"></a></p><p>The die with some functional blocks identified.</p>
<p>The chip is centered around a 16-bit bus (yellow line) that connects many part of the chip.
To write to the bus, a circuit pulls bus lines low. The bus lines are kept high by default by 16
pull-up transistors. This approach was fairly common in the NMOS era. However, performance is limited by the relatively weak
pull-up current, making bus lines slow to go high due to R-C delays.
For higher performance, some chips would precharge the bus high during one clock cycle and then pull lines low during the next cycle.</p>
<p>The two groups of I/O pins at the bottom are connected to the input buffer on the left and the output buffer on the right.
The input buffer includes XOR circuits to compute the parity of each byte. Curiously, only 6 bits of the inputs are connected to the main bus,
although other circuits use all 8 bits. The buffer also has a circuit to test for a zero value, but only using 5 of the bits.</p>
<p>I've put red boxes around the numerous PLAs, which can be identified by their grids of transistors.
This chip has an unusually large number of PLAs.
Eric Schlaepfer hypothesizes that the chip was designed on a prototype circuit board using commercial PAL chips for flexibility, and then they
transferred the prototype to silicon, preserving the PLA structure.
I didn't see any obvious structure to the PLAs; they all seemed to have wires going all over.</p>
<p>The miscellaneous logic scattered around the chip includes many latches and bus drivers; the latch circuit is similar to the memory cells. I didn't fully reverse-engineer this circuitry
but I didn't see anything that looked particularly interesting, such as an ALU or counter.
The circuitry near the PLAs could be latches as part of state machines, but I didn't investigate further.</p>
<p>I was hoping to find a recognizable processor inside the package, maybe a Motorola 6809 or 68000 processor.
Instead, I found a complicated chip that doesn't appear to be a processor.
It has a 16×16 memory block along with about 20 PLAs (Programmable Logic Arrays), a curiously large number.
PLAs are commonly used in processors for decoding instructions, since they can match bit patterns. 
I couldn't find a datapatch in the chip; I expected to see the ALU and registers organized in a large but regular 8-bit or 16-bit block of circuitry.
The chip doesn't have any ROM<span id="fnref:rom"><a href="#fn:rom">4</a></span> so there's no microcode on the chip.
For these reasons, I think the chip is not a processor or microcontroller, but a specialized data-handling chip, maybe using the PLAs to
interpret bits of a protocol.</p>
<p>The chip is built with NMOS technology, the same as the 6502 and 8086 for instance, rather than CMOS technology that is used in modern chips.
I measured the transistor features and the chip appears to be built with a 3.5 µm process (not nm!), which Motorola also used for the 68000 processor (1979).</p>
<h2>The memory buffer</h2>
<p>The chip has a 16×16 memory buffer, which could be a register file or a FIFO buffer.
One interesting feature is that the buffer is triple-ported, so it can handle two reads and one write at the same time.
The buffer is implemented as a grid of cells, each storing one bit. Each row corresponds to a 16-bit word, while each column corresponds
to one bit in a word.
Horizontal control lines (made of polysilicon) select which word gets written or read, while vertical bit lines of metal transmit each bit of the word as it is written
or read.</p>
<p>The microscope photo below shows two memory cells. These cells are repeated to create the entire memory buffer.
The white vertical lines are metal wiring. The short segments are connections within a cell. The thicker vertical lines are power and ground.
The thinner lines are the read and write bit lines.
The silicon die itself is underneath the metal. The pinkish regions are active silicon, doped to make it conductive.
The speckled golden lines are regions are polysilicon wires between the silicon and the metal. It has two roles: most importantly, when polysilicon
crosses active silicon, it forms the gate of a transistor. 
But polysilicon is also used as wiring, important since this chip only has one layer of metal.
The large, dark circles are contacts, connections between the metal layer and the silicon. Smaller square regions are contacts between silicon
and polysilicon.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/ibm-3274/mem.jpg"><img alt="Two memory cells, side by side, as they appear under the microscope." height="265" src="https://static.righto.com/images/ibm-3274/mem-w500.jpg" title="Two memory cells, side by side, as they appear under the microscope." width="500"></a></p><p>Two memory cells, side by side, as they appear under the microscope.</p>
<p>It was too difficult to interpret the circuits when they were obscured by the metal layer so I dissolved the metal layer and oxide with hydrochloric acid and Armour Etch respectively. The photo below shows the die with the metal removed; the greenish areas are remnants in areas where the metal
was thick, mostly power and ground supplies.
The dark regions in this image are regions of doped silicon. These are the active areas of the chip, showing the blocks of circuitry.
There are also some thin lines of polysilicon wiring.
The memory buffer is the large block on the right, just below the center.</p>

Click to zoom in on the image." width="600"></a></p><p>The chip with the metal layer removed. Click to zoom in on the image.</p>
<p>Like most implementations of static RAM, each storage cell of the buffer is implemented with cross-coupled inverters, with the output of one inverter feeding into
the input of the other.
To write a new value to the cell, the new value simply overpowers the inverter output, forcing the cell to the new state.
To support this, one of the inverters is designed to be weak, generating a smaller signal than a regular inverter.
Most circuits that I've examined create the inverter by using a weak transistor, one with a longer gate.
This chip, however, uses a circuit that I haven't seen before: an additional transistor, configured to limit the current from the inverter.</p>
<p>The schematic below shows one cell. Each cell uses ten transistors, so it is a "10T" cell. To support multiple reads and writes, each row of cells has three horizontal control signals: one to write to the word, and two to read.
Each bit position has one vertical bit line to provide the write data and two vertical bit lines for the data that is read.
Pass transistors connect the bit lines to the selected cells to perform a read or a write, allowing the data to flow in or out of the cell. The symbol that looks like an op-amp is a two-transistor NMOS buffer to amplify the signal when reading the cell.
</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/ibm-3274/mem-schematic.png"><img alt="Schematic of one memory cell." height="285" src="https://static.righto.com/images/ibm-3274/mem-schematic-w500.png" title="Schematic of one memory cell." width="500"></a></p><p>Schematic of one memory cell.</p>
<p>With the metal layer removed, it is easier to see the underlying silicon circuitry and reverse-engineer it.
The diagram below shows the silicon and polysilicon for one storage cell, corresponding to the schematic above.
(Imagine vertical metal lines for power, ground, and the three bitlines.)</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/ibm-3274/mem-cell.jpg"><img alt="One memory cell with the metal layer removed. I etched the die a few seconds too long so some of the polysilicon is very thin or missing." height="550" src="https://static.righto.com/images/ibm-3274/mem-cell-w600.jpg" title="One memory cell with the metal layer removed. I etched the die a few seconds too long so some of the polysilicon is very thin or missing." width="600"></a></p><p>One memory cell with the metal layer removed. I etched the die a few seconds too long so some of the polysilicon is very thin or missing.</p>
<p>The output from the memory unit contains a byte swapper. A 16-bit word is generated with the left half from the read 1 output and the second half from the read 2 output, but the bytes can be swapped.
This was probably used to read an aligned 16-bit word if it was unaligned in memory.</p>
<h2>Parity circuits</h2>
<p>In the lower right part of the chip are two parity circuits, each computing the parity of an 8-bit input.
The parity of an input is computed by XORing the bits together through a tree of 2-input XOR gates. First, four gates process pairs of input bits. Next, two XOR gates combine the outputs of
the first gates. Finally, an XOR gate combines the two previous outputs to generate the final parity.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/ibm-3274/xor-diagram.jpg"><img alt="The arrangement of the 14 XOR gates to compute parity of the two 8-bit values A and B." height="183" src="https://static.righto.com/images/ibm-3274/xor-diagram-w600.jpg" title="The arrangement of the 14 XOR gates to compute parity of the two 8-bit values A and B." width="600"></a></p><p>The arrangement of the 14 XOR gates to compute parity of the two 8-bit values A and B.</p>
<p>The schematic below shows how an XOR gate is built from a NOR gate and an AND-NOR gate. If both inputs are 0, the first NOR gate forces the output
to 0. If both inputs are 1, the AND gate forces the output to 0. Thus, the circuit computes XOR.
Each labeled block above implements the XOR circuit below.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>My conclusion is that the processor for the Keystone II board is probably one of the other chips, one of the IBM metal-can MST packages,
and this chip helps with data movement in some way.
It would be possible to trace out the complete circuitry of the chip and determine exactly how it functions, but that is too
time-consuming a project for this relatively obscure chip.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>In recent years, transformer-based models have gained prominence in multivariate long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), demonstrating significant advancements despite facing challenges such as high computational demands, difficulty in capturing temporal dynamics, and managing long-term dependencies. The emergence of LTSF-Linear, with its straightforward linear architecture, has notably outperformed transformer-based counterparts, prompting a reevaluation of the transformer's utility in time series forecasting. In response, this paper presents an adaptation of a recent architecture termed extended LSTM (xLSTM) for LTSF. xLSTM incorporates exponential gating and a revised memory structure with higher capacity that has good potential for LTSF. Our adopted architecture for LTSF termed as xLSTMTime surpasses current approaches. We compare xLSTMTime's performance against various state-of-the-art models across multiple real-world da-tasets, demonstrating superior forecasting capabilities. Our findings suggest that refined recurrent architectures can offer competitive alternatives to transformer-based models in LTSF tasks, po-tentially redefining the landscape of time series forecasting.

<article>
    <p>Over the past few months, I’ve noticed that an increasing number of replies to email that I’ve sent are “reactions”.</p>
<p>I imagine that, to the sender, or to someone in the Microsoft ecosystem, they are handled a bit liked a “thumbs-up” or “heart” reaction to a Signal message.</p>
<p>To me - as someone not in the Microsoft ecosystem - for each reaction, I get an email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>like 	[person] reacted to your message:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “like” is alt-text. Because I don’t allow loading of remote content, I don’t see an image here.</p>
<p>I don’t want this.</p>

<p>Microsoft <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/outlook-blog/reactions-in-outlook-public-usability-update-september-2023/ba-p/3928103">has a specific header</a> which one can add to outgoing to email:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>x-ms-reactions: disallow
</code></pre><p>My understanding is that, if that header is set, Microsoft suppresses the ability in its clients to respond with a reaction.</p>
<p>It is annoying that I need to set a specific header for this.</p>
<p>If every feature required a specific header to signal that it is unwanted, that would get irritating rather rapidly.</p>
<p>But at least there <em>is</em> this header.</p>
<p>If your mail client / MUA allows you to add headers, you could do it that way.</p>
<p>If you did, you wouldn’t need to tinker with your mailserver’s config.</p>
<p>But you’d need to do it for each client you use.</p>
<p>I want it to apply to all email I send, from whatever account, and from whatever device, so I added it to my postfix configuration.</p>
<p>In <code>/etc/postfix/main.cf</code>, I have a setting:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>header_checks = pcre:/etc/postfix/header_checks
</code></pre><p>So I added my new header to <code>/etc/postfix/header_checks</code>.</p>
<p>I added</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># add header to deal with unwanted Microsoft reactions (2024-07-16)
/^Content-Type:/i PREPEND x-ms-reactions: disallow 
</code></pre><p>(Edit: originally, I put this line before the <code>Content-Transfer-Encoding</code> header. But my mutt configuration does send that header, so I’ve switched it to go before the <code>Content-Type</code> header instead, as all my MUAs send that.)</p>
<p>and restarted postfix (<code>sudo service postfix restart</code>).</p>
<p>Then I tested it with various clients, and looked at the message headers to check that the header was being added correctly.</p>
<p>It was, so, success!</p>
<p>Now, will I get any more unwanted “reactions” email…? I’ll have to wait and see.</p>
<h2 id="update-testing-shows-some-success">Update: Testing shows some success</h2>
<p>I’ve tested this with a couple of people.</p>
<p>In one case, the header enrichment happened, but the Microsoft-using recipient still had the options to send a reaction.</p>
<p>They did, but the reaction did not reach me - it never hit my mailserver.</p>
<p>Microsoft <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/outlook-blog/reactions-in-outlook-public-usability-update-september-2023/ba-p/3928103">sort-of foreshadows this</a> when it says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since Disallow Reactions will roll out to different Outlook clients at different cadences and not all Outlook clients will have the gray-out update immediately, we also have a second layer of protection. When an email has reactions disallowed, attempts to react to it will fail at the server side.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My reading of this is that, even if a Microsoft client shows that reactions are available, and even if someone clicks it to send a reaction, Microsoft may still drop it silently.</p>
<p>That doesn’t feel like an ideal user experience (even if, for me, it achieves the goal of not getting a reaction email).</p>
<p>For the other Microsoft-using person, the reaction symbol was greyed out, and a hover text said “Reactions are disallowed on this message”.</p>
<p>Perhaps it does vary by Microsoft system, which again seems rather sub-optimal.</p>
