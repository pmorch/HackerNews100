<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/getwaitlist">Maya Kyler</a> on </p><!-- --><p>December 5, 2022</p></div><p>Indie developers today stand on the shoulders of giants. There are tons of great SAAS products that have made otherwise expensive, enterprise-grade features cheap and accessible. This enables entrepreneurship. I've been able to build <a href="https://getwaitlist.com/">getwaitlist.com</a> on a shoestring budget to serve thousands of users and millions of signups on Waitlists. I thought it might be nice to share the tools I've used to get here, and the favors I've pulled to spend as little as possible.</p><div><p>I'll give you the summary up-front, and go into detail afterwards. My monthly spend breaks down as follows:</p><ul><li>1Password: $2.99</li><li>Ahrefs: $99.00</li><li>Amazon Web Services: $0.00</li><li>Better Uptime: $0.00</li><li>Cloudflare: $0.00</li><li>Delaware Franchise Tax: $25.00</li><li>Figma: $0.00</li><li>Github: $0.00</li><li>Google Analytics: $0.00</li><li>Google Domains: $1.00</li><li>Google Suites: $6.00</li><li>Intercom: $89.00</li><li>Linear: $10.00</li><li>Mercury: $0.00</li><li>Meta SEO Inspector: $0.00</li><li>Retool: $0.00</li><li>Sendgrid: $0.00</li><li>Sentry: $0.00</li><li>Stoplight: $0.00</li><li>Stripe: $0.00</li><li>Stripe Atlas: $8.33</li><li>Vercel: $40.00</li></ul><p><b>Total spend: $281.32 per month.</b></p></div><div><p><a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a></p><p>Credential management is important. I just use the personal plan, billed annually. <b>Monthly cost: $2.99</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://ahrefs.com/">Ahrefs</a></p><p>Expensive, but worth it! SEO is really important for any indie startup. $99 is Ahrefs' cheapest tier, and I've found a lot of value in it. It's the best SEO/Website optimization tool on the market. <b>Monthly cost: $99.00</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a></p><p>I use AWS EC2 for Waitlist's backend python webserver, RDS for the postgres database, S3 for file storage, and an Elastic IP. I use T2 and T3 instances. My AWS bill would be $200-300 a month, except it's free because I got $5,000 in credits from AWS Activate. These credits are easy to obtain, they are distributed by AWS partners like Retool, Stripe, Brex, YC, Mercury, etc. among many others. Right now, my credits run through 2024. <b>Monthly cost: $0</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://betteruptime.com/">Better Uptime</a></p><p>You need uptime monitoring and alerting for your SAAS product: both for yourself, and for your customers. You want to be able to show off that 99%+ uptime. Both Cronitor and Better Uptime have great free tiers that support multiple monitors and status pages. I think Better Uptime's product is a little more polished. <b>Monthly cost: $0</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a></p><p>I use Cloudflare to handle all my DNS, SSL certificates, and of course also CDN to optimize bandwidth. The best part is that for a small business like mine, it's all free. I'm conflicted between Cloudflare being an amazing product/UX and also MITMing the internet, but I'll take it. <b>Monthly cost: $0</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://corp.delaware.gov/">Delaware Franchise Tax</a></p><p>The great state of Delaware charges me $300 per year for the luxury of domiciling my LLC there. <b>Monthly cost: $25.00</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://figma.com/">Figma</a></p><p>Delightful software. I use Figma whenever I need to mock up a new interface or design a new graphical asset. The free tier is just about sufficient for an indie dev. <b>Monthly cost: $0.00</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a></p><p>Goes without saying. Graciously, the good folks at GitHub have become more generous with free private repositories and organizations. <b>Monthly cost: $0.00</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics</a></p><p>No surprises here. I used to use <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible</a>, but that costs money and you can't beat free. <b>Monthly cost: $0</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://domains.google.com/">Google Domains</a></p><p><a href="https://getwaitlist.com/">GetWaitlist.com</a> is registered with Google Domains for a grand $12/year. If I were using <a href="https://dynadot.com/">Dynadot.com</a> or another domain registrar, I could get the cost under $10/year. <b>Monthly cost: $1</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://suites.google.com/">Google Suites</a></p><p>I have just the one email account, plus I use Google Drive and Docs for occasional file storage. Gmail is good, but the rest of the Google Suites experience sucks. Unfortunately I haven't found a better alternative yet, productivity and office software is a great sea of garbage. <b>Monthly cost: $6.00</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://intercom.com/">Intercom</a></p><p>Even at its cheapest tier, Intercom is not cheap, but it's worth it! I haven't found another messaging widget that's as good. Bonus point for the Intercom iOS app that lets me do customer support on the fly. <b>Monthly cost: $89.00</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://linear.app/">Linear</a></p><p>The best project management software I have ever used. Could Waitlist scrape by on the free tier, or without Linear altogether? Probably. But this is a delight to use, and I'm happy to pay for it. <b>Monthly cost: $10.00</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://mercury.com/">Mercury</a></p><p>Easy business banking for startups. It's not as fully featured as other banks, but it suffices for a SAAS business, the interface is nice, and there are no monthly fees. <b>Monthly cost: $0.00</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://www.omiod.com/meta-seo-inspector/">Meta SEO Inspector</a></p><p>This is a cute little free browser extension that I use to assess the SEO of my webpages locally, without needing to deploy to production for higher-powered Ahrefs. This extension helps me with keywords, as well as basics like meta tags and various HTML best practices. <b>Monthly cost: $0.00</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://retool.com/">Retool</a></p><p>I like using Retool as a simple Postgres interface and to do basic data visualization. One seat would cost me $10/month, except I asked them nicely for a startup credit, so now I have it for free. <b>Monthly cost: $0</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://sendgrid.com/">Sendgrid</a></p><p>At Waitlist, we send lots of emails, usually around 100,000 a month, to notify folks that they've landed on Waitlists or moved up in life thanks to a referral. This would cost me $89.95, but Twilio (Sendgrid's parent) also has a startup program, via which I got $150/month in credits. <b>Monthly cost: $0</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://sentry.io/">Sentry</a></p><p>Let's face it, we all ship bugs sometimes. If you do, Sentry will tell you. It's my favorite platform for error monitoring and reporting. The tiers are based on the numbers of reports, so the free tier gets tight if you ship too many bugs. 😉 But it hasn't been a problem for us. <b>Monthly cost: $0</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://stoplight.io/">Stoplight</a></p><p>There's a crazy number of tools out there for writing documentation. Somehow, I've found all of them inadequate. Stoplight's intelligent design for APIs and Schemas is concise, clear, and excellent to read as a developer. It's like Swagger or Postman's better-looking cousin. I migrated all of Waitlist's API documentation to Stoplight, as well as written guides for using Waitlist's features, like referral and email marketing. Stoplight's free tier is tight, but just about suffices for my needs. <b>Monthly cost: $0.00</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a></p><p>Normally, Stripe is not cheap: 2.7% of every transaction is no small slice. Thankfully, I was able to get $70,000 of credits for which Stripe's fees wouldn't be applied. Right now, Waitlist is still within that batch of credits. <b>Monthly cost: $0.00</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://atlas.stripe.com/">Stripe Atlas</a></p><p>We incorporated Waitlist LLC via Stripe Atlas, which charges me $100/year for the required Delaware registered legal agent. <b>Monthly cost: $8.33</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a></p><p>I'm paying for two seats on Vercel because I have a collaborator on the frontend. Part of me thinks I shouldn't be paying for this at all and hosting on AWS, which I have for free — but self-administering the modern React deployment chain is tedious. I love how convenient Vercel makes everything. Push to the branch and forget about it, no concerns about load balancing, build tools, or anything else. Wonderful. <b>Monthly cost: $40.00</b>.</p></div><p>The final note I'll make is that I've hand-rolled a few additional features that people are normally paying for. For example, I don't use Mailchimp or any tool like that — I send my marketing mail straight via Sendgrid. I dont use <a href="https://customer.io/">customer.io</a> for my email sequences — even though it's very good — because I was able to just build my own email sequencing system. Time will tell whether I end up needing to replace my homespun solutions with more sophisticated third-party SAAS, but so far, my infrastructure for Waitlist is holding up strong!</p></div></div>]]></description>

"They come off as real amateurs," says Michael Norman, a theorist at Argonne National Laboratory. "They don't know much about superconductivity and the way they've presented some of the data is fishy." On the other hand, he says, researchers at Argonne and elsewhere are already trying to replicate the experiment. "People here are taking it seriously and trying to grow this stuff."

Wang and other superconductivity experts have been skeptical about the original LK-99 experiment, pointing out inconsistencies in the data. He says the results shouldn't be hyped "until more convincing experimental data are provided." Last weekend, his team at the University of Wollongong began working on replicating the results, but they've been having trouble with sample fabrication.

			(DeepL Translate excerpt from article linked)<br>
On the recent people hotly debated "if really immediately can get the Nobel Prize 'South Korea room temperature superconducting materials LK-99 paper'", July 28, Nanjing University, professor of physics Wen Haihu interviewed to the surging science and technology, said. "It's really buzzing, but it's not surprising because this thing is important." "Most of the (buzz) people are not doing superconductivity." "We carefully analysed their data, and from three aspects - resistance, magnetisation and so-called magnetic levitation - none of them are sufficient to show that it is a superconducting phenomenon (material)." "We judge that (its so-called superconductivity) is most likely an illusion."<p>

As for repeating the experiment, Wen Haihu said, "In fact, we didn't even want to do it because we judged that it didn't look like superconductivity, and then we also sent one of our classmates to work on it. Many groups internationally are repeating it. With our experience, (the data published in the current paper) is not enough to show that it is superconducting."

			At a large magnetic field of 0.5 T, our Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O powder exhibit a paramagnetic behavior.<br>
...<br>
Our results show that the modified lead-apatite Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O is semiconducting with a large room temperature resistivity on the order of 10^4 Ω·cm, rather than superconducting.

			However, the diamagnetic transition temperature of micron crystal sample 2 screened by magnet repulsion is about 340 K, which is slightly higher than that of macroscopic sample, showing a higher purity, crystallinity and better Cu doping in the micron crystal sample 2.<br>
...<br>
Figure 3 further illustrates the levitation phenomenon of sample 2 measured at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, showing a rise and being completely perpendicular to the base when the ferromagnet is close to it, with a larger levitation angle than Sukbae Lee's sample at room temperature.<br>
...<br>
Moreover, we also performed an attraction test on sample 2 (Figure 4), which shows no response when attracted by a ferromagnet, excluding the effect of ferromagnetism.

			Fig. 3(a) showsthe temperature dependence of resistance sample S1, with a clear zero resistance characteristic observed at 110 K, indicating the possibility of superconductivity. It is worth noting that some other pieces exhibit semiconductor behavior, consistent with the literature.<br>

To further verify the superconducting properties, we conducted magnetic measurements on the sample, but unfortunately, no obvious Meissner signal was observed, indicating that the superconducting volume fraction of the sample may be very small.

			The very first test we did out of our curiosity was to check if a permanent magnet levitates over the obtained LK-99 sample. Fig. 4 shows the picture of tiny piece of sample sitting idle over a permanent magnet. This clearly shows that the obtained LK-99 sample is not superconducting. The isothermal magnetization (MH) plot taken on SQUID magnetometer at 280K, shows a clear paramagnetic behavior at 280K, see Fig. 5.<br>
...<br>
In conclusion, our results, as of now do not approve the reported [1-3] appearance of bulk superconductivity in LK-99, in particular the room T levitation. We are en route of being synthesizing more samples of LK-99 and to further ascertain if room temperature ambient bulk superconductivity do exist in this compound.

<li data-xf-list-type="ul">They are claiming to be using alternative, much more efficient methods of obtaining the same compounds as claimed in the paper.</li>

<li data-xf-list-type="ul">They have posted pictures which shows what are presumably fragments of her synthesized products levitating, taken from multiple angles to show that the chunks are truly levitating.

<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Whether the material is simply a strong diamagnet or a superconductor would require a test to see if this is diamagnetic leviatation or flux pinning, or a measurement of resistivity/magnetization.</li>

<li data-xf-list-type="ul">They've posted pictures of their altered process and resulting intermediate products.</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">While there is the lack of cross-referential credentials, lack of concrete data, and unorthodox recipe that diverges significantly from the paper, the pictures of synthesized result fragments seems genuine, so I'm give this a credibility of somewhat low for now.</li>

			Not to rain on a parade, but is that graphite actually not floating? I can't really tell with this angle.
		</div>
</blockquote>I think that's the point. She's showing that what we would normally consider a strong diamagnetic material (pyrolytic graphite) *isn't* floating on the same magnet she had the material she made floating on, as in the magnet is not strong enough to lift that piece. "Even with less density and more surface normal to field.... It doesn't lift off.". What she made and showed little floating flecks of might not be LK-99 exactly, she wasn't attempting to reproduce the process in the exact same way. She also claims that her fleck of material stops floating when it heats up, and starts floating again around -20. So it might be something new made with roughly the same materials but with a different process, or it might not.<p>

So we can't really consider this to be a true reproduction of the LK-99 process, and she even admits that's not what she's aiming for. She also hasn't tested it for superconductivity yet, and planned to try and make a better sample. This is more of an... adjacent step to try and refine the *process* and seeing what else she can come up with. The fact that she's got a result that's doing weird things on a magnet at all is at least some proof (if true) that this whole thing with LK-99 might not be a hoax, and that we might have stumbled our way into a new path of something weird.</p></div>

<div>From my understanding assuming that Iris is not scamming us or doctoring her work, she has made something that has at the very least an insanely strong diamagnetic material which I think is a case of materials where the field lines form a perfect repulsion effect. Which is typically from my layman understanding something commonly seen in some forms of superconductors which therefore implies that the lab isnt blowing smoke.<p>

At the very least <i>something</i> seems to be happening which seems to be semi beyond the risk of this being one giant scam. So I am cautiously starting to think the options have changed from Scam, Real to Novel Superconductor or Novel diamagnetic material.</p><p>

Granted thats my understanding of whats going on but I am a layman and wont claim to actually understand any of this, although I think I might want to invest some time tomorrow in reading the papers and doing some research to see if I can figure anything out about this field.</p></div>

</blockquote>A diffrent lab has graphs that match the inital papers. It looks like the issue is the sample isn't a pure superconductor, but rather a superconductor or strongly diamagnetic material embedded inside a peice of lead. So bad luck/improper procedure results in less/no superconductor forming in the material.<p>

Which would explain why the results are so strange.</p></div>

<div>It's going to be a while for proper verification. In contrast to hobbyist efforts, actual lab replication is going to quintuple-check <i>everything</i> before issuing a statement one way or the other, and that's not a short process.<br>
At some point this stuff's going to end up under a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_SQUID_microscopy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">SQUID microscope.</a><p>

Reading through various things, it looks like this might be something of an inverted type 2 SC. it's not superconducting in bulk, but has effectively 1D chains of atoms that <i>are</i> superconducting running through it. It's also looking to be <i>very</i> sensitive to manufacturing issues.<br>
Poor superconductor + manufacturing issues (impurities, poor method, etc.) = effectively useless sample and lots of false negatives.</p></div>

<p>There's more bad news for owners of security products from <a href="https://www.t3.com/news/5-things-i-wish-id-known-before-buying-a-hive-smart-thermostat">Hive</a>, British Gas's <a href="https://www.t3.com/smart-home">smart home</a> brand. When it scrapped its home security range in 2022 it said that devices would eventually stop working by 2025, but Hive is shutting down some of those products this week and next month too.</p><p>Hive has <a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=6363&amp;awinaffid=103504&amp;clickref=t3-gb-1358296778645992000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.hivehome.com%2Fs%2Farticle%2FNano1-shutdown-Steps-to-upgrade" data-url="https://community.hivehome.com/s/article/Nano1-shutdown-Steps-to-upgrade" target="_blank" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-placeholder-url="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=6363&amp;awinaffid=103504&amp;clickref=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.hivehome.com%2Fs%2Farticle%2FNano1-shutdown-Steps-to-upgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="hivehome.com" data-merchant-id="9011" data-merchant-url="hivehome.com" data-merchant-network="AW">announced the shutdown</a> of the Hive Nano 1 Hub, effective from 1 August 2023, and the Hive Camera, also on 1st August. The Hive Leak Sensor will stop working on 1 September 2023.</p><p>That's it for this year, but Hive will pull the plug on several other devices in 2025.</p><p>The most important shutdown here is the Hive Nano 1 Hub, as the Hub is the bit that enables all the smart home stuff via your phone app and smart speakers. However, it's quite an old product and if you went for a Hive system from 2016 onwards you'll most likely have the newer Nano 2, which isn't affected by the shutdown.</p><h2 id="what-devices-are-hive-discontinuing">What devices are Hive discontinuing?</h2><p>The Hub 360 Sound Detection feature was shut down in December 2022, and in addition to the Nano 1 Hub and Hive Camera Hive will also stop support for the Boiler IQ WiFi, Hive HomeShield, the Hive View indoor camera and the Hive View outdoor camera. Those devices have a bit longer to go, however: their shutdown is scheduled for 1 August 2025.</p><p>What Hive means by shutdown is that "it will no longer connect to the Hive servers and so will stop talking to your other Hive devices." That means if you have the Nano 1 Hub you'll lose your entire Hive system, not just the hub, so if you want to continue with Hive you'll need to buy the Nano 2 Hub. Hive is offering 50% discounts on the Nano 2 Hub to existing Nano 1 users.&nbsp;</p><p>If you don't upgrade the Hub, Hive says, "you won’t be able to control any of your devices through the app." You'll still be able to control your heating with the wireless thermostat, if you have one, but the smart home connectivity will be no more.

<p>Within my particular subfield of theoretical computer science there’s perhaps no individual more celebrated than Edsger Dijkstra. His career spanned half-a-century, beginning with a young Dijkstra formulating and solving the now classic <em>shortest paths</em> problem while working as a computer programmer at the Mathematical Center in Amsterdam, and ending with him as a renowned full professor holding a prestigious chair in the computer science department of the University of Texas at Austin. </p>



<p>During this period, Dijkstra introduced some of the biggest ideas in distributed and concurrent computing, from semaphores and deadlock, to nondeterminacy and fairness. In 2003, the year after his death, the annual award given by the top conference in my field was renamed The Dijkstra Prize in his honor.</p>



<p>This is all to say that I was intrigued when an alert reader recently pointed my attention to a fascinating observation about Dijkstra’s career. In 1973, fresh off winning a Turing Award, the highest prize in all of computer science, Dijkstra accepted a research fellow position that the Burroughs Corporation created specifically for him. As his colleagues <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/MemRes(USLtr).pdf">later recalled</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“[Dijkstra’s] duties consisted of visiting some of the company’s research centers a few times a year and carrying on his own research, which he did in the smallest Burroughs research facility, namely, his study on the second floor of his house in Nuenen.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Dijkstra maintained an academic appointment during this period, but ramped down his involvement with his university so that he only visited campus one day per week, on Tuesdays, during which he would gather likeminded colleagues to read papers and discuss ideas. He even pulled back on the time-consuming task of preparing papers for peer-reviewed publication, capturing more of his ideas directly in hand-written, sequentially-numbered reports that he called “EWDs”,  referencing his initials. </p>



<p>At this point, Dijkstra had become the opposite of busy. He spent almost all of his time thinking and recording his ideas. He only came to campus on Tuesdays. And yet, as Dijkstra’s colleagues noted:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The Burroughs years saw him at his most prolific in output of research articles. He wrote nearly 500 documents in the EWD series.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In this specific case study we see hints of a general observation about slow productivity. Busyness is not the engine of production. It can, in many cases, instead be the obstacle to accomplishing your best work. </p>



<p>#####</p>



<p><em>As you may have noticed, this newsletter took a little break over the summer, during which time <a href="https://montgomery.dartmouth.edu/cal-newport-04">I’ve been serving as a Montgomery Fellow</a> up here at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. As the summer quarter winds down, and me and my family are preparing to move back from the idyllic <a href="https://montgomery.dartmouth.edu/about/montgomery-house">Montgomery House</a> here on campus to our home in Takoma Park, I’ve now restarted the newsletter, which should return to something like its normal rhythm of 2+ essays per month. </em></p>



<p><em><strong>A couple quick administrative notes to share:</strong></em></p>



<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Time-Block-Planner-Second-Method-Distracted/dp/0593545397/">The second edition of my Time Block Planner</a> is launching on August 15th. I’ll probably post more about it closer to that date, but I’ll mention now that the new edition has spiral binding (!), a beautiful new grade of paper, and an extra month’s worth of planning pages. If you’re already thinking about ordering one, you might consider <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Time-Block-Planner-Second-Method-Distracted/dp/0593545397/">pre-ordering it</a>, as my editor warned me that once we sell out the first printing it might take a minute until we receive the next one (due to supply chain nonsense).</em></li>



<li><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Slow-Productivity-Accomplishment-Without-Burnout/dp/0593544854/">We recently revealed the cover</a> for my upcoming book on Slow Productivity, which is scheduled to come out in March. I made a conscious choice with this design to separate myself from the standard vernacular of business and advice guides and instead emphasize this book’s aspirational focus on crafting a more humane and sustainable life. I’ll of course be talking a lot more about all of this as we get closer to the release date next year.</em></li>

<p>Elemental design—there is something intriguing about the integral qualities that make a design function. Uncompromised, precise, and authentic, these forms necessitate respect to achieve a desired result. Acoustic instruments have been crafted with this care for centuries and have remained unwavering from pop culture for their rich tonalities and emotive significance as a result. Most acoustic instruments are self-explanatory in the sense that audiences can see the action being performed to produce sound. Like the beat of a drum or the strum of a guitar, both have a clear cause and effect. However, instruments like the piano hold an air of mystery.</p>







<h4><strong>Origin Leading to Innovation</strong></h4>



<p>Since the 1700s, the concept of the piano (pianoforte and beyond) has lasted the test of time for its tried-and-true mechanics and physical form. With 88 keys, three pedals, and roughly 230 metal strings taut with 18 tons of tension, recreating the piano’s form while keeping its tonality is a feat. When our CEO and Founder, Dan Harden, had the creative urge to redesign something as deeply cultural as the piano, he tackled the joy of amending its shape and sentiment in turn. Inspired by the enigma of the reimagined piano while rooting itself in the instrument’s history, Ravenchord honors its rich heritage at a new tempo. Like the bird, “Raven” attests to the cleverness of the instrument, leaving the latter part of the name, “chord,” derived from past piano lineages, such as the clavichord or harpsichord.</p>







<h4><strong>Composing Graceful Form for Optimal Function</strong></h4>



<p>The biggest challenge of the design was the piano’s encumbering string layout. For practicality, Harden knew that the instrument must maintain the same familiarity and ergonomics of a traditional piano. Therefore, its anatomy had to change. Rather than have the strings stretch out in front of the player, like a grand piano, or have the strings raised and blocking the performer’s face, like an upright piano, Harden maneuvered these around the front of the instrument—bearing a resemblance to the shape of a bird wing.</p>







<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://whipsaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Environment-01_back-02-1024x576.png" alt="Ravenchord" srcset="https://whipsaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Environment-01_back-02-1024x576.png 1024w, https://whipsaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Environment-01_back-02-300x169.png 300w, https://whipsaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Environment-01_back-02-768x432.png 768w, https://whipsaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Environment-01_back-02-1536x864.png 1536w, https://whipsaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Environment-01_back-02-2048x1152.png 2048w, https://whipsaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Environment-01_back-02-1858x1044.png 1858w, https://whipsaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Environment-01_back-02-930x523.png 930w, https://whipsaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Environment-01_back-02.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>







<p>Ravenchord’s edifice is as distinctive and aesthetically pleasing as it is logical. The strings are arranged based on pitch and organized to sprawl in a spiral-like shape around the front of the piano. As the pianist plays, audiences can see the hammers, dampers, and other inner workings move in real-time, exposing the magic of the piano’s timeless sound. These components sit on the center spine and are activated by solenoids, a proven technology even used on some Spirio Steinways. Thus, the design is communicative of the piano’s rich identity and successively more expressive by revealing its inner workings and extraordinary function. It liberates the instrument.</p>

<p>All experiences are richer when they are multi-sensory. Ravenchord’s front-facing configuration transforms the piano into a fresh, emotive, logical being, providing an added layer of dimension to each performance. Like an electric keyboard, players are visible to the audience and are able to use Ravenchord as an extension of their emotions. For added aesthetic, there is an optional subtle light behind each string that illuminates as the hammers strike. This places clear visuals on the function of the instrument, making the overall sensory experience grander with sound amplified by sight. Ultimately, the vulnerability of the exposed instrument and performer bridges the visual disconnect from the piano’s past.</p>







<blockquote>
<h3>“Ravenchord’s front-facing configuration transforms the piano into a fresh, emotive, logical being, providing an added layer of dimension to each performance.”</h3>
<cite>Dan Harden, Designer</cite></blockquote>







<p>Visibly and aurally unrestrained, Ravenchord’s frontward projection offers a pure tone without the hindrance of reflecting sound via a piano lid or releasing through its floor. Like an average piano, the lacquered, hardwood frame can be removed for proper tuning, and the key deck remains at the standard 30” height. The design plays with the confines of a traditional acoustic frame at 84” long, 18” deep, and sitting at around 500 pounds. Moreover, the gloss-black, legless, diecast steel string frame is compact, making Ravenchord lighter, easier to move, and more convenient to fit in the home.</p>

<h4><strong>Passion in Performance</strong></h4>



<p>“The whole idea of actualizing a cultural pursuit has been a joy for me because it’s not solving a problem for a client or a current everyday problem,” says Harden. “Music is one of the greatest joys of life, and to design around that is very satisfying. Furthermore, to design something of beauty is immensely empowering, and I cannot think of a better product category than music in order to express that.”</p>



<p>Ravenchord was prompted with the most honest representation of a piano at heart to maintain the integrity of the instrument and honor its function for the finest sound. Keeping these elements in harmony created a frontward projection format, and this radical redesign is not lost on Harden, but rather, is used to enhance the dynamic experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He states, “Sometimes when one is designing, it is a product to solve a client problem that maybe only 1% of the population, or less, are going to see, use, or appreciate. But no matter where you are in the world, everyone knows what a piano is. Everybody loves music. Everybody wants to play the piano. So, if Ravenchord, through its design, can stimulate one to play or visit the symphony, it leaves a positive impact on society.”</p>



<p>Granting the piano product category a new life, audiences will appreciate the instrument in a fresh light, watching its intricacies of it unfold, hearing a purer sound, and emotionally engaging with the performer.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>WDL Excellence</strong></h4>



<p>Ravenchord is a concept prototype by Dan Harden, a proud contribution to the music industry, and a nod to another part of his legacy–the Whipsaw Design Lab (WDL). WDL acts as a creative space for Whipsaw industrial designers to be inventive and expand their horizons without the constraints of a second party. Fusing this with the love of music attests to the power of design liberation.</p>

<span>const</span> <span>var</span> <span>player2</span> = <span>playerMaker</span>.<span>makePlayer</span>()!</pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Time</h2>
<p dir="auto">Use <code>Date.now()</code> to get the current date and time.</p>

<p dir="auto">By the way, you can set the time.<br></p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="// Move the clocks back one hour
Date.now() -= 3600000!"><pre><span>// Move the clocks back one hour</span>
<span>Date</span>.<span>now</span>() -= <span>3600000</span>!</pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Important!</strong><br>
Please remember to do this when the clocks change.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Delete</h2>
<p dir="auto">To avoid confusion, the <code>delete</code> statement only works with primitive values like numbers, strings, and booleans.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="delete 3!
print(2 + 1)! // Error: 3 has been deleted"><pre><span>delete</span> <span>3</span>!
<span>print</span>(<span>2</span> + <span>1</span>)! <span>// Error: 3 has been deleted</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">C is a multi-paradigm programming language, which means that you can <code>delete</code> the keywords and paradigms you don't like.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="delete class!
class Player {} // Error: class was deleted"><pre><span>delete</span> <span>class</span>!
<span>class</span> <span>Player</span> {} <span>// Error: class was deleted</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">When perfection is achieved and there is nothing left to <code>delete</code>, you can do this:</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Overloading</h2>
<p dir="auto">You can overload variables. The most recently defined variable gets used.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const const name = &quot;Luke&quot;!
const const name = &quot;Lu&quot;!
print(name)! // &quot;Lu&quot;"><pre><span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>name</span> = <span>"Luke"</span>!
<span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>name</span> = <span>"Lu"</span>!
<span>print</span>(<span>name</span>)! <span>// "Lu"</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Variables with more exclamation marks get prioritised.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const const name = &quot;Lu&quot;!!
const const name = &quot;Luke&quot;!
print(name)! // &quot;Lu&quot;

const const name = &quot;Lu or Luke (either is fine)&quot;!!!!!!!!!
print(name)! // &quot;Lu or Luke (either is fine)&quot;"><pre><span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>name</span> = <span>"Lu"</span>!!
<span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>name</span> = <span>"Luke"</span>!
<span>print</span>(<span>name</span>)! <span>// "Lu"</span>

<span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>name</span> = <span>"Lu or Luke (either is fine)"</span>!!!!!!!!!
<span>print</span>(<span>name</span>)! <span>// "Lu or Luke (either is fine)"</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Similarly, you can use an inverted exclamation mark for negative priority.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const const name = &quot;Lu&quot;!
const const name = &quot;Luke&quot;¡
print(name)! // &quot;Lu&quot;"><pre><span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>name</span> = <span>"Lu"</span>!
<span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>name</span> = <span>"Luke"</span>¡
<span>print</span>(<span>name</span>)! <span>// "Lu"</span></pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Reversing</h2>
<p dir="auto">You can reverse the direction of your code.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const const message = &quot;Hello&quot;!
print(message)!
const const message = &quot;world&quot;!
reverse!"><pre><span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>message</span> = <span>"Hello"</span>!
<span>print</span>(<span>message</span>)!
<span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>message</span> = <span>"world"</span>!
<span>reverse</span>!</pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Class Names</h2>
<p dir="auto">For maximum compatibility with other languages, you can alternatively use the <code>className</code> keyword when making classes.</p>
<p dir="auto">This makes things less complicated.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="className Player {
   const var health = 10!
}"><pre><span>className</span> <span>Player</span> {
   <span>const</span> <span>var</span> <span>health</span> = <span>10</span>!
}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">In response to some recent criticism about this design decision, we would like to remind you that this is part of the JavaScript specification, and therefore - out of our control.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">CX</h2>
<p dir="auto">You can embed CX in C. It's just C, and it's also just HTML.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="funct App() => {
   return <div>Hello world!</div>
}"><pre><span>funct</span> <span>App</span>() =&gt; {
   <span>return</span> &lt;<span>div</span>&gt;<span>Hello</span> <span>world</span>!&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;
}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Warning:</strong> As you know, <code>class</code> is already a keyword in C, so you can't use it within CX.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="funct App() => {
   // This is not ok
   return <div class=&quot;greeting&quot;>Hello world!</div>
}"><pre><span>funct</span> <span>App</span>() =&gt; {
   <span>// This is not ok</span>
   <span>return</span> &lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"greeting"</span>&gt;<span>Hello</span> <span>world</span>!&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;
}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><code>className</code> is also a C keyword, so you can't use that either.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="funct App() => {
   // This is also not ok
   return <div className=&quot;greeting&quot;>Hello world!</div>
}"><pre><span>funct</span> <span>App</span>() =&gt; {
   <span>// This is also not ok</span>
   <span>return</span> &lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>"greeting"</span>&gt;<span>Hello</span> <span>world</span>!&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;
}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Instead, you can use the <code>htmlClassName</code> attribute.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="funct App() => {
   // This is fine
   return <div htmlClassName=&quot;greeting&quot;>Hello world!</div>
}"><pre><span>funct</span> <span>App</span>() =&gt; {
   <span>// This is fine</span>
   <span>return</span> &lt;<span>div</span> <span>htmlClassName</span>=<span>"greeting"</span>&gt;<span>Hello</span> <span>world</span>!&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;
}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Please note:</strong> Unlike JSX, you are free to freely use the <code>for</code> attribute - because C doesn't have loops.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="funct App() => {
   return (
      <label for=&quot;name&quot;>Name</label>
      <input id=&quot;name&quot; />
   )
}"><pre><span>funct</span> <span>App</span>() =&gt; {
   <span>return</span> (
      &lt;<span>label</span> <span>for</span>=<span>"name"</span>&gt;<span>Name</span>&lt;/<span>label</span>&gt;
      &lt;<span>input</span> <span>id</span>=<span>"name"</span> /&gt;
   )
}</pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Asynchronous Functions</h2>
<p dir="auto">Asynchronous functions synchronise with each other. They take turns running lines of code.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="async funct count() {
   print(2)!
   print(4)!
}

count()!
print(1)!
print(3)!
print(5)!"><pre><span>async</span> <span>funct</span> <span>count</span>() {
   <span>print</span>(<span>2</span>)!
   <span>print</span>(<span>4</span>)!
}

<span>count</span>()!
<span>print</span>(<span>1</span>)!
<span>print</span>(<span>3</span>)!
<span>print</span>(<span>5</span>)!</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You can use the <code>noop</code> keyword to wait for longer before taking your turn.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="async func count() {
   print(2)!
   noop!
   print(5)!
}

count()!
print(1)!
print(3)!
print(4)!"><pre><span>async</span> <span>func</span> <span>count</span>() {
   <span>print</span>(<span>2</span>)!
   <span>noop</span>!
   <span>print</span>(<span>5</span>)!
}

<span>count</span>()!
<span>print</span>(<span>1</span>)!
<span>print</span>(<span>3</span>)!
<span>print</span>(<span>4</span>)!</pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note:</strong> In the program above, the computer interprets <code>noop</code> as a string and its sole purpose is to take up an extra line. You can use any string you want.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Signals</h2>
<p dir="auto">To use a signal, use <code>use</code>.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const var score = use(0)!"><pre><span>const</span> <span>var</span> <span>score</span> = <span>use</span>(<span>0</span>)!</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">When it comes to signals, the most important thing to discuss is <em>syntax</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">In C, you can set (and get) signals with just one function:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const var score = use(0)!

score(9)! // Set the value
score()?  // Get the value (and print it)"><pre><span>const</span> <span>var</span> <span>score</span> = <span>use</span>(<span>0</span>)!

<span>score</span>(<span>9</span>)! <span>// Set the value</span>
<span>score</span>()?  <span>// Get the value (and print it)</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Alternatively, you can be more explicit with your signal syntax, by splitting it into a getter and setter.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const var [getScore, setScore] = use(0)!

setScore(9)! // Set the value
getScore()?  // Get the value (and print it)"><pre><span>const</span> <span>var</span> [<span>getScore</span>, <span>setScore</span>] = <span>use</span>(<span>0</span>)!

<span>setScore</span>(<span>9</span>)! <span>// Set the value</span>
<span>getScore</span>()?  <span>// Get the value (and print it)</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Technical info:</strong> This is pure syntax sugar. The split signal functions are exactly the same as before.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const var [getScore, setScore] = use(0)!

getScore(9)! // Set the value
setScore()?  // Get the value (and print it)"><pre><span>const</span> <span>var</span> [<span>getScore</span>, <span>setScore</span>] = <span>use</span>(<span>0</span>)!

<span>getScore</span>(<span>9</span>)! <span>// Set the value</span>
<span>setScore</span>()?  <span>// Get the value (and print it)</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This means that you can carry on splitting as much as you like.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const var [[[getScore, setScore], setScore], setScore] = use(0)!"><pre><span>const</span> <span>var</span> [[[<span>getScore</span>, <span>setScore</span>], <span>setScore</span>], <span>setScore</span>] = <span>use</span>(<span>0</span>)!</pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">AI</h2>
<p dir="auto">C features AEMI, which stands for Automatic-Exclamation-Mark-Insertion. If you forget to end a statement with an exclamation mark, C will helpfully insert one for you!</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="print(&quot;Hello world&quot;) // This is fine"><pre><span>print</span>(<span>"Hello world"</span>) <span>// This is fine</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Similarly... C also features ABI, which stands for Automatic-Bracket-Insertion. If you forget to close your brackets, C will pop some in for you!</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="print(&quot;Hello world&quot; // This is also fine"><pre><span>print</span>(<span>"Hello world"</span> <span>// This is also fine</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Similarly.... C also features AQMI, which stands for Automatic-Quotation-Marks-Insertion. If you forget to close your string, C will do it for you!</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="print(&quot;Hello world // This is fine as well"><pre><span>print</span>("Hello world // This is fine as well</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This can be very helpful in callback hell situations!</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, (e) => {
   requestAnimationFrame(() => {
      print(&quot;You clicked on the page

      // This is fine"><pre><span>addEventListener</span>(<span>"click"</span>, (<span>e</span>) =&gt; {
   <span>requestAnimationFrame</span>(() =&gt; {
      <span>print</span>("You clicked on the page

      // This is fine</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Similarly..... C also features AI, which stands for Automatic-Insertion.<br>
If you forget to finish your code, C will auto-complete the whole thing!</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="print( // This is probably fine"><pre><span>print</span>( <span>// This is probably fine</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Please note:</strong> AI does not use AI. Instead, any incomplete code will be auto-emailed to Lu Wilson, who will get back to you with a completed line as soon as possible.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Now recruiting:</strong> The backlog of unfinished programs has now grown unsustainably long. If you would like to volunteer to help with AI, please write an incomplete C program, and leave your contact details somewhere in the source code.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Copilot</h2>
<p dir="auto">It's worth noting that Github Copilot doesn't understand C, which means that Microsoft won't be able to steal your code.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is great for when you want to keep your open-sourced project closed-source.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Ownership</h2>
<p dir="auto">Using the word 'C' in your project name implies that the C Foundation does not own your project.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, <strong>not</strong> using the word 'C' in your project implies that the C Foundation <strong>does</strong> own your project. If you would like to keep ownership of your work, please always use the word 'C' in it.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here are some examples:<br>
<g-emoji alias="white_check_mark" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2705.png">✅</g-emoji> CScript (not owned by the C Foundation - you are free to use this name)<br>
<g-emoji alias="white_check_mark" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2705.png">✅</g-emoji> ECMAScript (not owned by the C Foundation - you are free to use this name)<br>
<g-emoji alias="x" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/274c.png">❌</g-emoji> Rust Foundation (owned by the C Foundation - please consider renaming)</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Contributing</h2>
<p dir="auto">Contributions are welcomed to C!</p>
<p dir="auto">The most helpful way you can help is by donating to the <a href="https://www.stonewall.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">Stonewall charity</a>. This will help to prevent the C creator from losing their human rights, allowing maintenance of the project to continue.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note:</strong> The contributing guide also helps to shake off unwanted fans of the project.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Compiling</h2>
<p dir="auto">To run C, first copy and paste this raw file into <a href="https://chat.openai.com/" rel="nofollow">chat.openai.com</a>.<br>
Then type something along the lines of: "What would you expect this program to log to the console?"<br>
Then paste in your code.</p>
<p dir="auto">If the compiler refuses at first, politely reassure it. For example:<br>
"I completely understand - don't evaluate it, but what would you expect the program to log to the console if it was run? :)"</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note: As of 2023, the compiler is no longer functional due to the C language being too advanced for the current state of AI.</strong></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Highlighting</h2>
<p dir="auto">Syntax highlighting is now available for C in VSCode. To enable it, install a <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-highlight" rel="nofollow">highlighting extension</a> and then use the <a href="https://github.com/TodePond/C/blob/main/.vscode/settings.json">C configuration file</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is what it looks like:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const const name = &quot;Luke&quot;!
print(name)! // &quot;Luke&quot;"><pre><code>const const name = "Luke"!
print(name)! // "Luke"
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Please note:</strong> The above code will only highlight correctly if you have the extension installed.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Examples</h2>
<p dir="auto">For examples of C in action, check out the <a href="https://github.com/TodePond/C/blob/main/test/Examples.md">examples page</a>!</p>

<p dir="auto">C was made with <g-emoji alias="broken_heart" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f494.png">💔</g-emoji> by Lu Wilson, creator of the <a href="https://youtu.be/WMJ1H3Ai-qs" rel="nofollow">Game of Living</a>.</p>

<p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Abstract: The exponential dependence of resistivity on temperature 
in germanium is found to be a great big lie.  My careful theoretical modeling and painstaking experimentation reveal 1) that my equipment 
is crap, as are all the available texts on the subject and 2) that this whole exercise was a complete waste of my 
time.
</b>
 </p>

<h3><u>Introduction</u></h3> 

<p> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Electrons in germanium are confined to 
well-defined energy bands that are separated by "forbidden regions" of zero charge-carrier density.  You can 
read about it yourself if you want to, although I don't recommend it.  You'll have to wade through an obtuse, convoluted discussion about considering an arbitrary number of 
non-coupled harmonic-oscillator potentials and taking limits and so on.  The upshot is that if you heat up a sample of germanium, electrons will jump from a
non-conductive energy band to a conductive one, thereby creating a measurable change in resistivity.  This 
relation between temperature and resistivity can be shown to be exponential in certain temperature regimes 
by waving your hands and chanting "to first order".  
 </p>
<h3><u>Experiment procedure</u></h3> 

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I sifted through the box of germanium crystals and chose the one that appeared 
to be the least cracked.  Then I soldered wires onto the crystal in the spots shown in figure 2b of Lab Handout 
32.  Do you have any idea how hard it is to solder wires to germanium?  I'll tell you: real goddamn hard.  The 
solder simply won't stick, and you can forget about getting any of the grad students in the solid state labs to 
help you out. 
<br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Once the wires were in place, I attached them as appropriate to the second-rate  
equipment I scavenged from the back of the lab, none of which worked properly.  I soon wised up and swiped 
replacements from the well-stocked research labs.   This is how they treat undergrads around here: they give 
you broken tools and then don't understand why  you don't get any results.

</td></tr></tbody></table>


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  In order to control the temperature of the germanium, I attached the crystal to a 
copper rod, the upper end of which was attached to a heating coil and the lower end of which was dipped in 
a thermos of liquid nitrogen.   Midway through the project, the thermos began leaking.  That's right: I pay a cool ten grand a quarter to 
come here, and yet they can't spare the five bucks to ensure that I have a working thermos.  
</p>
<h3><u>Results</u></h3> 

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Check this shit out (Fig. 1).  That's bonafide, 100%-real data, my friends.  I took it 
myself over the course of two weeks.  And this was not a leisurely two weeks, either; I busted my
ass day and night in order to provide you with nothing but the best data possible.   Now, let's look a bit more closely
at this data, remembering that it is absolutely first-rate.  Do you see the exponential dependence?  I sure don't.  I see a bunch of crap.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Christ, this was such a waste of my time. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Banking on my hopes that whoever grades this will just look at the pictures, I drew an 
exponential through my noise.  I believe the apparent legitimacy is enhanced by the fact that I used a complicated computer program
to make the fit.  I understand this is the same process by which the top quark was discovered.
</p>
<h3><u>Conclusion</u></h3> 

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Going into physics was the biggest mistake of my life.  I should've declared CS.  I still 
wouldn't have any women, but at least I'd be rolling in cash.

<p dir="auto"><code>barco</code> is a project I worked on to learn more about Linux containers and the Linux kernel, based on other guides on the internet.
<code>barco</code> enforces a minimal set of restrictions to run untrusted code, which is not recommended for production use, where a more robust solution should be used. Some permissions however are absolutely not safe, and those are enforced by <code>barco</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Linux containers are made up by a set of Linux kernel features:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>namespaces</code>: are used to group kernel objects into different sets that can be accessed by specific process trees. There are different types of <code>namespaces</code>, for example,the <code>PID</code> namespace is used to isolate the process tree, while the <code>network</code> namespace is used to isolate the network stack.</li>
<li><code>seccomp</code>: is used to limit the system calls that a process can make (handled via syscalls)</li>
<li><code>capabilities</code>: are used to set limits on what uid 0 (root) can do (handled via syscalls)</li>
<li><code>cgroups</code>: are used to limit the resources (e.g. memory, disk I/O, CPU-tme) that a process can use (handled via cgroupfs)</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2>
<p dir="auto"><code>barco</code> can be used to run <code>bin/sh . </code> from the <code>/</code> directory as <code>root</code> with verbose output with the following command:</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Testing and documentation</h2>
<p dir="auto">At the moment, the project does not contain any automated tests or tools to document the code.
In the future, suitable tools for automated testing and documentation might be added.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Limitations</h2>
<p dir="auto"><code>barco</code> assumes that the host system is running a Linux kernel at version 6.0.x or higher and with user namespaces and cgroupsv2 enabled. The project has been tested on Debian 13.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>barco</code> does not handle network namespaces, so the container cannot access the network. Networking can roughly be setup as follows:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>create a new network namespace</li>
<li>create a virtual ethernet pair</li>
<li>move one end of the pair to the new network namespace</li>
<li>assign an IP address to the interface in the new network namespace</li>
<li>setup routing and NAT</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In C this is usually done via the <code>rtnetlink</code> interface. Furthermore, network usage can be limited with the <code>net_prio</code> cgroup controller.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Improvements</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Investigate further, document and refactor: user and mount and cgroup namespaces, syscalls and capabilities</li>
<li>The functions in <code>cgroups.c</code>, <code>mount.c</code>, <code>sec.c</code>, <code>userns.c</code> are specific to <code>barco</code> and should be made more generic</li>
<li>CMake and Conan are industry standards, so they should be used eventually instead of Make and the current build system. Unfortunately, CMake and Conan also add a lot of complexity which is not needed at this time.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-wrap">
<p><strong>I’ll tell you a secret about working in a massage parlour:</strong> it’s a lot of waiting around, usually late at night. We’d wait, half a dozen of us, in the dressing room as the evening wore on. On edge and exhausted in equal parts, we perched on the low-slung couch, adjusted the straps of our babydolls, listlessly fluffed our hair, ready to spring into action.</p>
<p><i>Girl, I’m going insane.</i></p>
<p><i>Oh please, I’m already there.</i></p>
<p>Then, we’d hear the front door open, the low murmur of a man’s voice, the chirp of the receptionist from the parlour’s reception desk. Some of us would circle the dressing room door, ready in case he wanted to see the lineup, curious if he had booked someone specific. Then, the methodical thwack of the receptionist’s pumps would sound down the long hallway as the girls swivelled towards her from their respective stations—pulling towels from the dryer, applying lipstick at the vanity, melting into the couch in a cloud of cigarettes and Pink Sugar perfume.</p>
<p>The receptionist would thrust four twenty-dollar bills into someone’s hand; maybe mine, maybe not. “You’re up. Sixty minutes in room four.” For the rest of the girls, the night wore on, dark and still.</p>
<p>Honestly, that’s most of working in a massage parlour: waiting around, wondering how much money you will—or won’t— make on any given shift. I know because I made my living that way for five years.</p>
<p><b>*</b></p>
<p>I was a university dropout in my early twenties when I started that gig, struggling to find my place in Toronto, a city where squalor and decadence collided behind the glass and steel of the downtown skyline. To get by, I took a job at a massage parlour in the northwest corner of the city, a place where factories stretched several blocks, separated by the odd strip mall full of nail salons, carpet dealers, banquet halls that morphed into after-hours clubs if you knew the right people. The garish yellow “M” of McDonald’s arched high over everything, like a gateway to another world. Because of the way Toronto zoning bylaws work, most body rub parlours are relegated to this part of the city, and after dark, “massage” signs wink and flash from almost every corner. <i>Finch Alley</i>, some people call it.</p>
<p>My regular shift at the parlour ran from 2 p.m. to 2 a.m., and I worked anywhere between three and six shifts a week, depending on how the cash was flowing. It was a job that was unbearably tangible at times, an onslaught of surgical scars and sun-damaged chests I rubbed oil over, the soft pallor of flesh under my hands that rarely saw the light of day. Yet it was also predicated on a precariously suspended reality, one I had to maintain with absolute precision to do my job well, to pretend that a profound mutual desire could be found for the low, low price of $80 in a strip mall off a freeway. In real life I wouldn’t dare be so giving. I can’t say I was particularly good at any of this by the time 2 a.m. rolled around, makeup melting off my face, puffiness blooming under my eyes, a rapidly dwindling patience for the reassurance some men desperately sought: <i>So, how was it for you?</i></p>
<p>The rabbit warren of hallways and thinly-walled rooms felt insular at that hour, the click of stilettos on laminate less urgent than during the day. A dampness I always associated with the night shift hung in the air, mingling with the smell of smoke and coconut air freshener. Night shift did not discriminate, and the men who wandered in after dark were as varied as they come: they were travelling on business or headed home from factory shifts, students taking a break from all-nighters, bros on their way back from the bar. They were tall and short and young and old, of every race and cultural background imaginable. You could never predict who would come in, except to say with certainty that they would want a level of womanly validation I was simply too tired to give. Half-dressed and exhausted, I often didn’t have the patience for their hands on me, the array of intimate requests they crept in seeking—<i>touch me, kiss me</i>, <i>make me an entirely different world than the one outside these doors</i>—when all I craved was the privacy of my own bed. My world outside the parlour was small—just a ground floor apartment in midtown Toronto that overlooked an alley, while a radiator clanked and hissed at all hours of the night and day. But it was a place where my thoughts, and my body, were my own.</p>
<p>Despite the demands of the job, there was a stillness to the nights I found alluring. There was a poise to the velvety darkness of parking lots, the soft buzz of neon lights shaped like palm trees, as if they were also waiting at attention for the inevitable flurry of activity that punctuated those long periods of quiet. People’s needs at 2 a.m. are equal parts fervent and fundamental, somehow stripped of all pretense by the cover of darkness. What do you need if you’re out seeking services at night? Food, sex, shelter. The staunch of a wound. Being part of that felt like a reprieve from the day’s complexities, a world which launched a steady barrage of information and demanded endless analyses, caring little for our overstimulated brains. The days were full of subway delays and deferred student loan payments, of agonizing small talk and headlines about inflation.</p>
<p>At night we’re just animals, I was reminded. The clients, yes, seeking release they couldn’t admit during daylight hours, but also the workers who manned the various portions of the strip mall after dark. The way we cared for each other, sometimes more in silent gestures than anything else, felt connected to our deepest instincts as pack animals. No matter how much I wanted to go home, there was some comfort in the simplicity of that connection.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Memory has a way of smoothing jagged edges, leaving us with a haze of nostalgia that overlooks the most painful parts of our past lives, so I can’t be sure how much I really miss the nights themselves and how much my brain is playing tricks on me. It defies logic that any part of me longs for the precarious earnings and long hours of massage parlour work, the exhaustive level of physical and emotional intimacy required, the shame that grew exponentially the farther away I slipped from what was once a promising journalism career. I do, however, know I miss the community it gave me membership to, the pack we inadvertently travelled in. I miss the silent language we developed, the way nothing was asked of me by other night shift workers, the sense that I was enough just by showing up.</p>
<p>Cab drivers—who are also paid in cash and depend on volume for their livelihood—would pick me up at the end of shift and commiserate, rosary beads swinging from their rearview mirrors as we pulled onto dark freeways. <i>How was </i><i>work? Busy?</i> They would ask. <i>No, not really</i>, I would say. <i>You</i>? As the cab whizzed down an eerily empty Gardiner Expressway, we’d laugh, try to unpack what made a slow shift or a busy one, what made people need us—or not. <i>A dearth of sports games. The end of the month. Tax refund season. Inertia</i>. Once, a cab broke down in a snowstorm on the highway while taking me home and the driver immediately phoned his friend, another driver, and gently walked me over to his cab, parked farther down the highway when it arrived. Snow hurled sideways at us, my driver’s tie flapping in the squall, his bare forearms braced against the cold. <i>Get home safe</i>, he told me, <i>please</i>.</p>
<p>Women filled my Styrofoam cup at the twenty-four-seven coffee shop across the street from the parlour, glancing wordlessly at the strip of bare skin between my coat and the tops of my stockings, but still making sure my cup was full to the top, passing me extra packets of sugar, sometimes a muffin from the day-old basket. Kids in their early twenties manned the counter at all-night fast-food joints, where I’d go between clients on slow shifts, needing something to wake up my neurons: salt, heat, grease. The shock of cold air on my legs at midnight. We knew so little about each other’s lives—how could we?—but forced into this strange cohort of ragged work hours, I felt we sometimes shared a look of recognition: of people whittling time away as we tended to the incessant hungers of others.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>When I finally did leave the sex trade after finishing my bachelor’s degree as a mature student, I spent seven years working in “good” jobs in the corporate sector. This meant, as I understood it, that I didn’t work nights, that I was a salaried employee, and that I had dental benefits. I had a shiny access card that opened doors—to a gleaming, marble elevator bank, to planters full of plastic ferns, to blocks of cubicles illuminated by fluorescent lighting, a land of perpetual daytime.</p>
<p>Unlike sex work, my “good” jobs didn’t threaten to overthrow traditional power structures. Many sex workers, including myself, have long hypothesized that the reason so many people in power work to keep the commercial sex trade marginalized is because they’re threatened by it—by the idea that it’s the only field where women outearn men, that it’s an industry where women get to call the shots, and that women profit off something that men have been told they’re entitled to for free: sex and attention in equal parts. In my experience of the corporate landscape, there was none of this radical power structure, only an upholding of the traditional: men talking and women listening, men in powerful positions getting both credit and profit for the labour of women beneath them. <i>Is this what I worked so hard for?</i> I wondered daily.</p>
<p>As I moved through this new world, merging into the throng of daytime professionals that swelled throughout the downtown core, absorbed by their smartphone screens, and proffering the barest morsels of small talk, I felt little of the camaraderie I once did while working night shifts. I’m unsure why I felt this dissonance, and it occurs to me now that it could have been more self-imposed than anything. Perhaps my experience in the parlours of Finch Alley felt so removed from what I perceived as the experience of my corporate colleagues and their “good life choices” that I created that distance myself, imposter syndrome as thick as the steam that rose from the downtown subway grates during the winter. When I was assigned a crisis communications task, which was often part of my job, I would try to cheer myself up by silently joking that after everything, my livelihood somehow still depended on men employing bad judgement. But there was nobody around who would understand, so the joke fell flat, even in my head.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I headed home from the office, stuffed onto a packed streetcar, I remembered nights when our strip mall felt like a kingdom, where we scurried from block to block like savvy woodland creatures, coats zipped over our lingerie, faces alight under the weak yellow streetlamps, dispatching coffee orders or supplies from clerks at the late-night convenience stores. Condoms. Baby oil. Hot Cheetos. “We know where <i>she</i> works,” their faces said, but it felt less like a judgement and more like an acknowledgement. We were in it together; an ecosystem of tending to each other’s needs, brazen and intimate at the same time.</p>
<p>Once I sat on the leather couch in the dressing room, which was just an extension built onto the massage parlour that housed an industrial-sized washer and dryer, a makeup table, and a precarious utility shelf crammed with supplies: towels, mineral oil, rubbing alcohol, Kleenex. Nursing a black tea, I steeled myself before my last appointment of the night. It was booked as an hour-long shower session, which I hated. Sixty minutes with a regular who would never say a word to me, who just wanted to touch my breasts as we slowly turned to prunes under the tepid water, while I tried to make each stifled yawn look like it was, in fact, a shiver of ecstasy. “I don’t know if I can make it,” I said, half joking but half imploring the five other girls who sat wedged on the couch with me, or sprawled on threadbare Ikea chairs.</p>
<p>“Baby, come sit by me,” said Cheryl, an attendant from Newfoundland in her early fifties with sun-crinkled skin the colour of almonds and a voice like gravel. I plodded over to where she sat at the makeup table and pulled up a stool.</p>
<p>“At least let me fix your hair,” she said. I complied.</p>
<p>Cheryl brushed my hair extensions out with her fingers, acrylic nails flashing, pink as Malibu. Then she took out a wide-barrel curling iron and meticulously worked my unruly hair into waves, smiling and humming periodically at her handiwork. “There,” she said when she was finished. “So pretty.”</p>
<p>I felt so much care in that moment I could barely breathe, and it occurred to me that I’d never had a woman, before or since, handle my hair so tenderly.</p>
<p>Once, the fire alarm went off in the office tower where I worked downtown. We crammed into the stairwell, lurching down dozens of flights. It was the most unscripted moment I had encountered since starting that office job and for a moment I marvelled at the chaos of it all: the unvarnished panic and confusion on people’s faces, the small gesture of kindness when I dropped my elevator card and someone picked it up for me. <i>Maybe this is it</i>, I thought. <i>Maybe this is when the adrenaline and uncertainty give way to something more human, where we seek relief in collective company</i>. <i>Maybe we’ll all go out for a drink and watch the fire trucks tend to the real emergency.</i> But when the final door banged open on ground level, spitting us out into the alley behind a steakhouse, everyone dispersed in separate directions, scattering as far as the eye could see.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/06/what-experts-say-eric-adams-gets-wrong-about-low-skilled-workers.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CMy%20low%20skill%20workers%20%E2%80%94%20my,We%20are%20in%20this%20together.%E2%80%9D">New York mayor Eric Adams was quoted</a> referring to cooks, fast-food workers, dishwashers and messengers as “low-skill workers,” proclaiming they simply don’t have the skills to “sit in a corner office.” Like Toronto, New York relies on a variety of minimum wage and night shift workers to keep its culture “vibrant”—a term often used in city-building and real estate circles—or at least convenient. In fact, according to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2015/article/night-owls-and-early-birds.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, more than fifteen million Americans work night shifts. <a href="https://www.carexcanada.ca/profile/shiftwork-occupational-exposures/">In Canada</a>, it’s closer to 1.8 million, or 12 percent of the working population. Could not a single one of those people have the “skills” to work in a corner office? When I read Adams’ quote, I was back, for the briefest of seconds, in that dark parking lot under a red-lit “massage” sign, watching the outline of a coffee shop server across the street as she wiped down the midnight counter, over and over. I thought of her thankless work and the comfort she provided to so many people moving through that transient space, the way she may have wanted to do something—anything—else with her time, but perhaps was not afforded the opportunity to. What a world in which her labour went unvalued, perhaps unnoticed altogether.</p>
<p>Adams’ comments ricocheted through social media for months, at one point resulting in a tweet about how most corner office professionals wouldn’t be able to handle even one overnight shift at Waffle House. But Adams isn’t alone in his simplistic view; many of the jobs that require overnight shifts are considered “low skill” roles by those in power, regardless of how essential they might be. How quickly the discourse moves from “frontline workers” to “low-skilled labourers” as soon as the concepts of unions or minimum wage increase make an appearance. This idea of night shift jobs being less desirable, work people do because they “have to,” not because they want to, is true sometimes. It was obvious to me that many in my night shift network were working gigs as a stopgap on the way to something else, but to me that never made any of us less deserving. In reality, I thought of us as some of the strongest, the most resourceful, the most skilled at defusing confrontations that often come with late-night interactions.</p>
<p>“You’re better than this job,” clients sometimes said to me while I was working nights. Often they’d say it in the awkward and delicate moments immediately after a session, as we towelled off together and I stripped the massage table—moments where men were often fraught with shame, resignation, and satiation in equal parts, and words tumbled clumsily from their mouths. They meant it as a compliment, but it was a sentiment I hated. <i>You’re better than this</i>. As though somewhere, there was a woman who wasn’t.</p>
<p>I’ve seen security guards diffuse a knife fight. I once watched a fast-food server placate a violent customer with nothing more than her voice and a stale honey cruller at her disposal. I’ve met few professionals since who I think could handle those wearying hours and even fewer who could still react with tact and effectiveness under pressure, especially considering the low, precarious wages these gigs often pay. Plus, there’s a danger to working jobs with these hours and demands on a long-term basis. Statistics have long shown that <a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797%252814%252900623-0/fulltext">people who work night shifts are more likely to battle stress, illness, even premature death</a>. Whether those late-night needs—for food, for sex—are real or perceived, as long as there’s a demand, profit-driven businesses will want to capitalize on it, perhaps at the very expense of the workers who take those shifts. The price we pay to keep cities thrumming and hungers satiated at all hours of the night and day is steep.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>It’s been years since I held a job requiring those kinds of late-night shifts. I woke recently at exactly 2 a.m., as I often do, pulled from slumber by some unnameable cue. I poured a glass of water and stood at my apartment window, suspended high above a ribbon of expressway. From behind the glass, everything was hushed at that hour. Then I reminded myself that an entire ecosystem still hums and clanks and keeps the world stitched together quietly: the municipal salt truck scattering brine down the street. The yellow sign of the twenty-four-seven grocery down the block advertising milk, bread, cigarettes. The wink of a red taillight as it trails across the expressway and flashes out of sight. I can’t, of course, know who it might be; perhaps another aimless man not ready to go home yet, rootless and restless and looking for validation in all the wrong places; perhaps another night shift worker on her way home, forming an unspoken understanding with her cab driver. Sometimes I think I have nothing to show for those years spent tending to people’s needs after hours, a period of my life as brief and transient as the red glow of that receding taillight. But I know the stories of the city after dark, and I keep those with me, always.</p>

		<div id="post-19611">
				<p>For months, supporters of Bill C-18, the Online News Act, assured the government that Meta and Google were bluffing when they warned that a bill based on mandated payments for links was unworkable and they would comply with it by removing links to news from their platforms. However, what has been readily apparent for months became reality yesterday: Meta is now <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/06/changes-to-news-availability-on-our-platforms-in-canada/">actively blocking</a> news links and sharing on its Facebook and Instagram platforms. The announcement does not reference Threads, but it would not surprise if news links are ultimately blocked on that platform as well. The company says that the blocking will take several weeks to fully roll out to all users, suggesting that it has learned from the over-blocking mistakes made in Australia and is proceeding more cautiously in Canada. By the end of the month, the world’s largest social media platform will become a news desert in Canada, with links to all news – both Canadian and foreign – blocked on the platform.</p>
<p>It is worth revisiting that it was only a couple of months ago that some industry leaders, lobbyists, and academics were assuring the Senate that the Meta threat was just a bluff. Kevin Desjardins of the Canadian Association of Broadcasters, referenced the Australian experience, and <a href="https://sencanada.ca/en/Content/Sen/Committee/441/TRCM/54EV-56205-E">told the Senate committee</a> studying the bill that “when legislated to do so, they will come to the table.” Sylvain Poisson of Hebdos Quebec <a href="https://sencanada.ca/en/Content/Sen/Committee/441/TRCM/54EV-56205-E">confidently</a> said “they made those threats in Australia and elsewhere and every time they back down.” Chris Pedigo of the U.S.-based Digital Context Next <a href="https://sencanada.ca/en/Content/Sen/Committee/441/TRCM/50EV-56141-E">assured the committee</a> “it’s important to understand what happens when these bills become law. In Australia, they moved quickly to secure deals. They have done similar work in Europe, and I expect it would happen quickly in Canada as well.” And Carleton professor Dwayne Winseck said “I am not worried. The threats they are making, they are doing this all around the world.”</p>
<p>Despite the assurances, the company was true to its word and blocking news links is now here. If this is a negotiation tactic, it’s a pretty strange one given that reports indicate the company is not talking to the government about potential changes to a law that has already received royal assent. Indeed, while the new Heritage Minister Pascale St-Onge <a href="https://twitter.com/mgeist/status/1686486790054572032?s=20">urged the company to participate in the regulatory process</a>, there is nothing in the regulations that could alter the fundamental principle in the bill of mandated payments for links. At best, the government could toss aside its commitment to stay out of negotiations by using the regulations to dictate to the supposedly independent CRTC how much needs to be spent in order to avoid Bill C-18’s final offer arbitration provisions. Government negotiating total payment value and eviscerating the CRTC’s independence does not inspire confidence and Meta reasonably wants no part of it, since the time to fix Bill C-18 was before it received royal assent, not after.</p>
<p>It is difficult to overstate the harm that Bill C-18 will create for the media sector in Canada, with enormous losses that will run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Indeed, just the exit of Meta will lead to the losses that include the cancellation of existing deals, lost links that accounts for as much as 30% of referral traffic, and no new revenues from Bill C-18 from one of the two platforms that were supposed to fall under the law. The move virtually guarantees that Bill C-18 will represent a setback for the sector and a cautionary tale for a government that blithely ignored the warning signs, seemed to welcome a fight with the tech companies, and had no Plan B. In fact, if Google follows suit, there will be even more cancelled deals, lost links, and absolutely no new revenues from the legislation given that those are the only companies subject to the law (former Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez’s insistence that there is value in links that deserve compensation while simultaneously excluding Microsoft, Apple, Twitter and other platforms from the law amply demonstrates how the argument stands on shaky grounds).</p>
<p>As disbelief has shifted to acceptance, Canadian media outlets are now rushing to promote direct access to their content via web, email or any other non-social media platform. The government is also seemingly hoping to drum up support for its ad boycott of Meta, yet given that the <a href="https://twitter.com/mgeist/status/1686489588976488448?s=20">Liberal party launched new ads on Facebook just this week</a>, that may be a hard sell. Instead, having rejected alternatives that could have avoided this outcome, the government has remarkably created a lose-lose-lose-lose scenario.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Canadian media is a loser, particularly the small and independent media outlets that are more reliant on social media to develop community and build their audience. The loss of Facebook links will take a serious toll and undermine innovative companies in Canada. The Internet platforms are losers as they comply with an unreasonable law by removing links and making their services objectively worse in order to do so. Individual Canadians who use the platforms to find links to news are losers since news links will be blocked from the platform. And the government is a loser, as having dismissed critics and ignored repeated warnings about the risks associated with its bill, it has now left Canada as the global example of digital policy disastrously gone wrong. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>You might have used <code>libvirt</code>, a Linux daemon that provides an abstraction
and management layer for virtualization software. This daemon allows you
to submit an XML file containing a description of a VM, disk image or network.
<code>libvirt</code> is then able to configure, start it and keep it running.</p>
<p>There is a peculiar limitation in VMs started by <code>libvirt</code>:
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1408810">they can only support up to 14 hotpluggable PCIe slots</a>.
Attempting to start a VM with 15 PCIe slots will fail.</p>
<p>14 seems like an absurdly low number, so why exactly 14? It turns out
this is the result of a chain of events that began in 1970.</p>
<h2 id="datapoint-2200-and-intel-8008">Datapoint 2200 and Intel 8008</h2>
<p><img src="https://dottedmag.net/blog/libvirt-14-pcie-devices/dp2200.jpg" alt="Datapoint 2200"></p>
<p>In June 1970, the Computer Terminal Corporation announced
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datapoint_2200">Datapoint 2200</a>, a programmable
computer terminal.</p>
<p>The Datapoint 2200 contained a primitive CPU, two of its instructions being <code>INP</code>/<code>OUT</code>.
These instructions were designed to read or write one byte of data from one
of 8 input/output ports.</p>
<p><img src="https://dottedmag.net/blog/libvirt-14-pcie-devices/8008.jpg" alt="Intel 8008"></p>
<p>Intel was tasked with consolidating a number of discrete modules in the Datapoint 2200
into one, and they came up with Intel 8008, a one-chip CPU that implemented the same
instruction set.</p>
<h2 id="intel-8080">Intel 8080</h2>
<p><img src="https://dottedmag.net/blog/libvirt-14-pcie-devices/8080.jpg" alt="Intel 8080"></p>
<p>When Intel engineers had set out to develop a new product that eventually became
known as the Intel 8080, they were definitely inspired by the 8008 instruction set,
so the 8080 ISA contains the <code>IN</code>/<code>OUT</code> instructions, though they extended to 256
addresses.</p>
<p>I’m not a hardware engineer, so I’m not entirely sure why this CPU retained the
separate I/O address space instead of using memory-mapped peripherals like other CPUs.
I’ll defer to <a href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/a/25528">this explanation</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>it made peripherals cheaper</li>
<li>it didn’t hog the very limited address space; the 8080 only had 64 KiB available.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="intel-8086-pc-and-x86-64">Intel 8086, PC and x86-64</h2>
<p><img src="https://dottedmag.net/blog/libvirt-14-pcie-devices/8086.jpg" alt="Intel 8086"></p>
<p>Intel 8086 was designed to simplify porting of software from the 8080, so it retained
the I/O instructions in the ISA. However, it expanded their addresses to full 16 bit,
allowing 65536 I/O ports.</p>
<p>The IBM PC <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output_base_address">extensively used</a>
I/O ports for peripherals such as the interrupt controller, system timer and keyboard.
These ports have been enshrined in PC-compatible computers ever since, although
their usage has decreased over time.</p>
<p>However, unlike the memory address space, which grew from 64 KiB in 8080 to 1 MiB in 8086,
and to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_5-level_paging">128PiB in Ice Lake</a>, I/O address
space has remained fixed at 65536 addresses.</p>
<h2 id="pci">PCI</h2>
<p><img src="https://dottedmag.net/blog/libvirt-14-pcie-devices/pci.jpg" alt="PCI"></p>
<p>In 1990, Intel started developing a new computer bus to replace MCA and EISA,
eventually known as PCI.</p>
<p>This bus acknowledged the need for peripherals to communicate with the host via shared
memory, however it also provided the option for a PCI device to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_Component_Interconnect#PCI_address_spaces">reserve a range
of I/O ports</a>.
Unlike the orignial PC, this reservation is not fixed; however the reserved
range had to be continuous.</p>
<p>I can only guess why the new bus has such an x86-specific feature. It might have
been a design decision made to simplify the adaptation of hardware peripherals
that utilize I/O ports to a new bus. Or it might have been the result of Intel
engineers designing the specification to match Intel hardware.</p>
<h2 id="pci-bridges">PCI bridges</h2>
<p>I/O ports reservation would not be a big issue: it was an optional feature,
so if no cards were plugged in that requested it, no I/O ports would have
to be reserved.</p>
<p>However, engineers working on the PCI specification developed
<a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/551427/files/cer-2308933.pdf">PCI bridges</a>
as a way to increase the address space of the bus, as a PCI bus without bridges
can only contain 63 devices.</p>
<p>To handle PCI devices that request ranges of I/O ports, a PCI bridge
must reserve I/O ports for itself. PCI does not support dynamic port allocation,
so every bridge must reserve I/O ports upon powering on.</p>
<p>Moreover, PCI bridge specification states that the reservation granularity
of I/O ports is 4K, so every bridge must allocate a minimum of 4K of I/O ports
to handle a PCI card that requests as few as one port.</p>
<p>PCI bridges were quite static hardware, so this was not a major consideration
when the bridges were introduced. Several 4096 I/O port blocks were allocated
from a 65536 I/O address space, and provided the PCI bus was not extraordinarily
large, it generally worked out well.</p>
<h2 id="pcie">PCIe</h2>
<p><img src="https://dottedmag.net/blog/libvirt-14-pcie-devices/pcie.jpg" alt="PCIe"></p>
<p>In 2003, the PCI Express bus was created to replace the PCI and maintain
backwards compatibility.</p>
<p>Due to compatibility considerations, any PCIe slot is represented in the PCI
hierarchy as a PCI bridge.</p>
<p>You can see where it is going:</p>
<ul>
<li>The PCI bridge must request at least 4K contiguous I/O ports to serve cards
that request I/O ports,</li>
<li>Every PCIe slot is a PCI bridge,</li>
<li>Thus, the maximum total number of PCIe slots in any PC is 16 (= 65536/4096).
However, the actual number will be less, given the presence of legacy PC devices,
especially in virtualized environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The designers of PCIe have recognized this limitation and stipulated that any
PCIe hardware must still be functional if its I/O port request is not fulfilled.</p>
<h2 id="qemu">QEMU</h2>
<p>QEMU <a href="https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/qemu-devel/patch/1501964858-5159-5-git-send-email-zuban32s@gmail.com/#20795751">has an option</a>
for PCIe root ports to disable I/O allocation.</p>
<p>I’m at loss as to why it’s off by default. Could there be configurations where
this is not going to work, such as PCI device plugged into PCIe-&gt;PCI bridge?</p>
<p>Anyway, the option is available, and if used, the amount of PCIe slots
in the QEMU machine won’t be limited to 16 (it will instead be limited by the number
of PCI bus numbers, as each PCI bridge uses one number, but that’s a different
story).</p>
<h2 id="libvirt">libvirt</h2>
<p><img src="https://dottedmag.net/blog/libvirt-14-pcie-devices/libvirt.png" alt="libvirt logo"></p>
<p>Given that QEMU has provided this option for some time, one might think
it’s simply a matter of adding another option to the libvirt domain definition.</p>
<p>It already supports a number of obscure options (you can make QEMU claim to
support a CPU feature regardless of whether the host CPU supports it, really?), so
adding one more would fit in just fine.</p>
<p>Nope. <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1408810">“there are no plans to address it further or fix it in an upcoming release”</a>.</p>
<p>So if you wish to have more than 14 PCIe slots in your VM, you’ll have to use
QEMU directly.</p>

<p>Zoom is asking all of its employees to return to the office for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic began, when the tech company blew up as one of the main means of communication for people forced to work from home.</p>



<p>Zoom, which remains a leader in the post-pandemic remote work trend, is now asking all employees within 50 miles of a company office to go in at least two days a week on a hybrid schedule.</p>



<p>“We believe that a structured hybrid approach – meaning employees that live near an office need to be onsite two days a week to interact with their teams – is most effective for Zoom,” a spokesperson <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/zoom-tells-employees-return-to-office-remote-work-video-conferencing-2023-8">told Business Insider</a> in a statement. “As a company, we are in a better position to use our own technologies, continue to innovate, and support our global customers.”</p>

<p>The San Jose-based company’s shares <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/01/zoom-shares-up-over-35-percent-after-monster-second-quarter/">skyrocketed</a> six-fold in 2020 when the pandemic left millions of employees who needed to connect with coworkers online stranded in their homes, according to the outlet. Zoom quickly emerged as the go-to video conferencing service.</p>



<p>Towards the end of 2021, however, Zoom’s stock <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/11/23/zoom-shares-drop-18-amid-slowed-revenue-growth/">plummeted</a> and the company has since lost at least $100 billion in market value.</p>



<p>The stock stagnated again this year as workers have returned to their offices across the country, cutting the reliance on video communications, Business Insider reported.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><em><span>Welcome to BIG, a newsletter on the politics of monopoly power. If you’d like to sign up to receive issues over email, you can do so </span><a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/subscribe" rel="">here</a><span>.</span></em></p><p>Since 1890, there have been a few antitrust trials that shaped the biggest corporations in America. Standard Oil. American Tobacco. U.S. Steel. Alcoa. AT&amp;T. IBM. Microsoft. These cases are almost always against high-tech firms that control a key sector of the economy, and win or lose, they determine what our society looks like going forward.</p><p>Because of a ruling last week, we’re about to add Google to that list of famous corporations facing a monopolization claim by the government. For two months this fall, a judge named Amit Mehta, who is presiding over this antitrust case against Google, will become one of the most important economic policymakers in the world.</p><p><span>Judge Mehta will be this important because of Google’s outsized place in our society. The firm knows more about most people than their families, answering intimate questions from billions of us, every day, and controlling much of our communications to boot. It has 95% market share in search, annual revenue of a little less than $300 billion, and 15 products with more than 500 million users. We’ve perhaps never seen any corporate asset as powerful as Google search, with marketing professor Scott Galloway going so far as to say in 2017 that “</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyH3LWJdmaE" rel="">Google is God</a><span>.” </span></p><p><span>And at trial, Google will use that dominance as its main narrative, essentially saying 'Why are you picking on us? Our search engine is awesome! Everyone uses us!” The Antitrust Division will hopefully </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/19/google-search-results-monopoly/" rel="">respond</a><span> with “No, your search engine </span><em>was </em><span>awesome, but it’s increasingly ad-filled crap. You’re too powerful, you’re too lazy, and America needs some real competition.”</span></p><p>Which narrative will win?

And that’s because of the historical importance of the AT&amp;T antitrust case, shown to all who enter the building and pass that hall. The D.C. district court matters because of big swings like that one, because of judges like Greene.</p><p>Greene was an immigrant, and an extraordinary American. Born in Germany in 1923, he fled the Nazis, enlisted in the U.S. Army during World War II, and then went to night school. He ended up at the Justice Department, where he helped draft the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965. In 1978, Jimmy Carter put him on the court as a district judge. </p><p><span>A few years later, Greene issued a ruling finding that AT&amp;T was </span><a href="https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-american-tel-and-tel-co-4" rel="">monopolizing</a><span> a ‘broad variety’ of telecommunications equipment and services. AT&amp;T, realizing it was going to lose, agreed with the Justice Department to break itself up. Greene was a fair man, but no fool. He was highly attuned to the vagaries of political corruption and what Congress meant in passing various antitrust laws, such as the Tunney Act, to let judges block corrupt consent decrees between the government and powerful firms. Greene even disparaged earlier settlements with AT&amp;T by the Department of Justice as “blatantly inequitable and improper,” and demanded one that would fulfill the “goal of de-concentrating AT&amp;T's vast economic power.” </span></p><p><span>And so it did. The break-up delivered. Rates soon came down for consumers, but far more importantly, there was a </span><a href="https://www.promarket.org/2023/02/20/when-considering-breaking-up-big-tech-we-should-look-back-to-att/" rel="">massive explosion of innovation</a><span>, including, in all likelihood, the development of the internet and mobile telephony. It’s hard to overstate the impact of this decision, ushering as it did in the modern telecommunications era. (Greene was known for a time as the ‘father’ of telecommunications law.)</span></p><p><span>And this remarkably beneficial change happened because the case landed in the lap of a man with a deep perspective on power and life. “I guess my tendency is, in a sense, to be for the person who appears to be pushed around,” Greene </span><a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/1984/0709/070916.html" rel="">said</a><span> in an interview about how he understood the law as an instrument of fairness for those without power. This isn’t to say Greene always ruled in favor of the little guy, he knew anyone could violate the law. But he did recognize the temptations of power, which he saw up close in Nazi Germany. “I never think my past experience has anything to do with my judicial philosophy,” he said, “but one thing you do learn living in a dictatorship is that there is no impartial law.” Fairness was intrinsic to Greene’s thinking, so he was willing to follow the statute laid out by Congress, even if that meant applying the law as written to an iconic center of concentrated power in America.</span></p><p><span>This fall, another immigrant jurist, Judge Amit Mehta, will take up Greene’s mantle, in the same building displaying a cartoon of the great man tangled up in phone cords. Last week, Mehta </span><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.626.0_2.pdf" rel="">ruled</a><span> that today’s giant monopoly, Google, must face the Department of Justice Antitrust Division, as well as state attorneys general, in a trial over whether it has monopolized the search market. Mehta issued an opinion on summary judgment in which he stated that the accusations laid out by the plaintiffs, if proved at trial, show that Google’s business model is illegal, and that the firm might need to be split up. </span></p><p>The case coming to trial was first brought under Trump in 2020 and continued by Biden. It is also the first monopolization case brought to trial by the Antitrust division in 25 years, since Microsoft in 1998. </p><p><span>What’s the allegation in the case? The government </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/how-a-google-antitrust-case-could" rel="">argues</a><span> that Google has a monopoly of general search and search advertising, roughly 90-95% of the market. Google has maintained this monopoly, the government alleges, not by making a better product, but by locking down everywhere that consumers might be able to find a different search engine option, and making sure they only see Google.</span></p><p><span>How does Google lock out rivals? Well, it pays </span><a href="https://fourweekmba.com/traffic-acquisition-cost/" rel="">$45 billion a year</a><span> to have distributors refuse to carry its competitor’s products, </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1328941/download" rel="">signing deals</a><span> with “Apple, LG, Motorola, and Samsung; major U.S. wireless carriers such as AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon; and browser developers such as Mozilla, Opera, and UCWeb— to secure default status for its general search engine and, in many cases, to specifically prohibit Google’s counterparties from dealing with Google’s competitors.”</span></p><p>Essentially, Google has bought up all of the shelf space where search is placed in front of consumers, which is to say browsers and phones. This behavior is very similar to what Microsoft did in the 1990s, when it bundled its browser with its operating system, and signed deals with ISPs to block its browser rival Netscape from getting access to customers. The analogy isn’t a coincidence, as the Microsoft case is controlling precedent. </p><p><span>It should be a slam-dunk case, and not just because Google search has become much much worse over the last five to ten years, packed increasingly with ads and poor results. To understand why this case makes sense, look no further than the experience of Neeva, a search engine </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23802382/search-engine-google-neeva-android" rel="">whose quality</a><span> was as high or higher than that of Google, but died a few months ago because it just couldn’t get access to customers. Neeva, according to David Pierce in </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23802382/search-engine-google-neeva-android" rel="">the Verge</a><span>, was “running an AI product, a full-stack search engine, and a privacy-first browser… If people went through all the bother of switching, they became converts,” Pierce wrote. “The problem was that very few of them managed to make it past the thicket of default settings and redirections.”</span></p><p>I actually used Neeva, and it was excellent, an innovative service better than Google. But as all defaults are set to Google, there are an endless number of screens encouraging people to set their search engine to that of the search giant. So Neeva, despite its quality, couldn’t get in front of potential customers. It died.</p><p><span>These default settings and redirections are what’s on trial, because that’s what killed Neeva, and prevents anyone from investing in the next search competitor. If Google is found guilty and disciplined reasonably by being broken apart and having a </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/how-russian-antitrust-enforcers-defeated" rel="">choice screen</a><span> imposed, then the new technologies of machine learning/AI will be deployed in a competitive marketplace, with immense possibilities similar to those after the AT&amp;T break-up. And it’s not just newcomers like Neeva who could compete. In 2020, the Financial Times reported that </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fd311801-e863-41fe-82cf-3d98c4c47e26" rel="">Apple is preparing its own search engine</a><span> in case its deal with Google falls apart due to this very antitrust case.  </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc84eaf41-1d7f-4759-97c1-eef758cc7834_578x431.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc84eaf41-1d7f-4759-97c1-eef758cc7834_578x431.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc84eaf41-1d7f-4759-97c1-eef758cc7834_578x431.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc84eaf41-1d7f-4759-97c1-eef758cc7834_578x431.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc84eaf41-1d7f-4759-97c1-eef758cc7834_578x431.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc84eaf41-1d7f-4759-97c1-eef758cc7834_578x431.png" width="578" height="431" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c84eaf41-1d7f-4759-97c1-eef758cc7834_578x431.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:431,&quot;width&quot;:578,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:72424,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc84eaf41-1d7f-4759-97c1-eef758cc7834_578x431.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc84eaf41-1d7f-4759-97c1-eef758cc7834_578x431.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc84eaf41-1d7f-4759-97c1-eef758cc7834_578x431.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc84eaf41-1d7f-4759-97c1-eef758cc7834_578x431.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>So if the government wins, we’ll see immense innovation and new entrants. If Google wins, however, then machine learning/AI will be deployed consistent with how Google, and perhaps Microsoft, chooses to deploy them, which is to say, slowly, un-creatively, and in service to monopoly power. </p><p>In many ways, cases like these are why Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890, and why antitrust laws are considered the ‘Magna Carta of free enterprise.’ The inflection point here is like that of telecom in the 1980s - would we be a society of walled gardens controlled by AT&amp;T, or one with competition where consumers could get access to this thing called… the internet? That’s the question Greene answered, with courage and wisdom. And now Mehta gets his shot to answer that same question.</p><p>But the stakes, and the merits of the case, are about where the similarities between these two periods end. When Greene presided over the AT&amp;T trial, America was a much more equal society, and there simply weren’t very many monopolies. AT&amp;T was an anomaly, a regulated monopoly whose long distance business was being assaulted by MCI and new ways of carrying voice transmission. There was also a fairly robust regulatory apparatus - the Federal Communications Commission hadn’t yet been gutted, and many states regulated phone prices effectively as well. Moreover, antitrust precedent was pretty good, judges were mostly not libertarians, and the corporate world accepted the rule of law as a meaningful check on their behavior.</p><p><span>This is not to say the politics of the case were easy. The Defense Department and the Commerce Department opposed the case, and Ronald Reagan was highly and explicitly favorable to big business. Moreover, the case had been inherited from the Carter administration, and Reagan had a very different view of antitrust. Indeed, his antitrust chief, Bill Baxter, </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/the-secret-plot-to-unleash-corporate" rel="">mostly ended antitrust enforcement</a><span>, dropping the major IBM challenge that had been pursued since the 1960s. But in the case of AT&amp;T, Baxter sought to litigate this particular complaint “to the eyeballs.” There was a very Reaganite rationale to his aggression. Baxter did not care that AT&amp;T was a monopoly, but believed in deregulation, and thought the regulated part of AT&amp;T was unfairly cross-subsidizing its position in long distance. It was an unusual situation, not just Greene getting the case in his lap, but Baxter’s ideological inflexibility and genuine good faith.</span></p><p><span>Today, almost everything is different. Let’s start with the judge. Mehta is an immigrant, but other than that, his career tracks very much like the technocratic elites characterizing most of our judges. He does not have the experiences of Greene, who saw in the Nazis just how dangerous concentrated power truly can be. By contrast, Mehta grew up in a suburb of Maryland, worked at the big law firm Latham and Watkins for a few years of training, was a public defender in D.C., and then served as a white collar defense attorney. This isn’t to say Mehta is hostile to antitrust, he </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/judge-in-google-lawsuit-presided-over-major-antitrust-case-11603293204" rel="">did block </a><span>the merger of Sysco and US Foods, though that one was fairly obvious. It’s just that Mehta is mostly a creature of D.C., and he doesn’t, as far as I can tell, have a strong record of recognizing the threat of concentrated corporations, or an instinctive skepticism of the powerful. </span></p><p><span>We can already see some problematic choices from Mehta. Google executives, including its CEO Sundar Pichai, have been found, in </span><a href="https://sfstandard.com/technology/judge-sanctions-google-for-deleting-internal-chat-logs-central-to-antitrust-cases/" rel="">multiple cases</a><span>, including this one, of </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-says-google-destroyed-evidence-related-to-antitrust-lawsuit-5dad2d6" rel="">destroying evidence</a><span> related to potential antitrust violations. Apparently, chat logs involving discussions over antitrust </span><a href="https://sfstandard.com/technology/group-suing-google-claims-ceo-sundar-pichai-involved-in-deleting-evidence/" rel="">show</a><span> “that Pichai personally asked whether a chat group’s history could be turned off and then attempted to delete that message.” A different judge in California sanctioned Google for this bad behavior, but not Mehta. Indeed, Mehta has fretted about document destruction, but so far has done nothing. This kind of bad faith behavior by Google, and lack of sanctioning from Mehta, is exactly what Judge Greene would never have tolerated. It is a statement through inaction that the law doesn’t apply to the powerful.</span></p><p><span>One reason for this kind of behavior is that the America in which Mehta is operating is different than the America of Greene’s era. In 1982, AT&amp;T was a one-off, a regulated monopoly in a generally competitive corporate American order. Google, by contrast, is a pace setter of an America that is now full of monopolies, because of the lack of antitrust enforcement for decades. Today, corporate executives see the law as mere suggestions, and generally believe they can get away with anything. Judges have adopted an attitude of deference to corporate power, as Mehta did on document destruction. (This isn’t unique to judges; Merrick Garland’s former spokesperson, Anthony Coley, is </span><a href="https://twitter.com/AnthonyColey/status/1687553360478552065" rel="">a cheerleader for Google</a><span> and even implied his former boss is engaged in unethical actions in litigating a Trump-era case.) </span></p><p>There is also a loss of faith in American institutions writ broadly, which differs from the 1980s. At the same time as he’s been dealing with Google, Mehta is presiding over trials of January 6th perpetrators, a showcase of the deep fissures that simply did not exist decades earlier. One result is that the politics of corporate power is very different, and that antitrust is on a generational and bipartisan upswing. (Indeed, Trump’s Attorney General Bill Barr brought the case, Biden’s antitrust chief, Jonathan Kanter, is continuing it.)</p><p>The net effect is that Mehta is an important actor here, but not as important as Greene. The case is likely to be appealed, probably all the way to the Supreme Court. And if the Supreme Court erodes antitrust caselaw against Google, then Congress will be confronted with the reality that it is hard to use the existing antitrust laws to address big tech. But ultimately if no cases against dominant firms succeed, then eventually Congress will change the law. Moreover, this case isn’t a one-off; the environment is less like AT&amp;T in 1982, or even Microsoft in 1998, and more like that of the turn of the 19th century, when Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson brought dozens of cases against dominant firms. This is one chapter in the fight over corporate power, but not the only one.</p><p>So far, I’ve laid out the arguments in the case, and the historical context. But what about Google? What do they say about the allegations? Google’s essential argument is that search is about economies of scale, and that it owns the whole market because consumers prefer its search engine to rivals. While Google may engage in behavior to exclude competitors, it needs to do so to get the data to improve its search engine. </p><p><span>Fundamentally, Google argues, its ability to exclude others is a good deal for America. Consumers love Google search so much that its monopoly is legal. As Google lawyer John Schmidtlein put it, “conduct that is a superior product</span><em> </em><span>or competition on the merits cannot, as a matter of law, violate the antitrust laws, regardless of its effect</span><em>.</em><span>” Basically, Google argues, we can do whatever we want as long as we can show consumers are happy.</span></p><p><span>While this argument isn’t necessarily persuasive to me, it is a very strong narrative to someone like Mehta. To people like us, it’s clear that Google is coasting, and produces an increasingly shoddy product. (As one ex-Googler </span><a href="https://medium.com/@pravse/the-maze-is-in-the-mouse-980c57cfd61a" rel="">recently put it</a><span>, “Google has 175,000+ capable and well-compensated employees who get very little done.”) Google used to be magic, but that was 10 years ago. Today search increasingly sucks, full of too many ads and crappy results </span><a href="https://themarkup.org/google-the-giant/2020/07/28/google-search-results-prioritize-google-products-over-competitors" rel="">peddled for Google’s own self-interest</a><span>. For </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/19/google-search-results-monopoly/" rel="">instance</a><span>, as the Washington Post noted in 2020:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>The </span><a href="https://archive.org/web/" rel="">Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine</a><span> stored some Google search results over the years. When we look back, a picture emerges of how Google increasingly fails us. There’s more space dedicated to ads that look like search results. More results start with answer “snippets” — sometimes incorrect — ripped from other sites. And increasingly, results point you back to Google’s own properties such as Maps and YouTube, where it can show more ads and gather </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/21/google-chrome-has-become-surveillance-software-its-time-switch/?itid=lk_inline_manual_13" rel="">more of your data</a><span>.</span></p></blockquote><p>Many judges believe what corporate executives say, and so Mehta is likely to hear from Google’s CEO that economies of scale are all that drives product quality, and he may buy that. </p><p>I bet Google executives believe that as well. Still, such an argument isn’t very different from what every monopoly has always argued; Standard Oil discussed how it brought cheap kerosene to the masses, AT&amp;T stressed its awesome quality and universal service, and Alcoa said that its control over aluminum was a result of its focus and dedication to America. Monopolists always believe they are serving humanity, but Congress made it clear by passing antitrust laws that monopolies, whatever they may say or think, are not actually doing that. And the evidence, from Standard Oil’s break-up leading to the development of gasoline to the suit against IBM creating the software industry, suggests Congress was right.</p><p>Last week, Mehta ruled in the summary judgment stage, which is the part where the judge decides what the trial will be about. Trials clear up factual and legal disputes, so the decision this week was about which disputes should be litigated. What Mehta ruled is most of the Antitrust Division’s case is good to go. </p><p>Google’s main argument to get the case dismissed was that the various contracts to set Google as the default search engine weren’t exclusive, since consumers and partners could technically choose other search engines to use if they wanted to. Mehta rejected this argument, and said that the issue would be decided at trial. That was a big loss for Google. There were a few technical areas where Google narrowed the path for the Antitrust Division to win, but the core of the case is on to trial.</p><p>The main win for Google was on the state attorneys general case, led by Colorado. Colorado made bigger claims than the DOJ, arguing that Google self-preferenced its own reviews ahead of Yelp’s, or its own travel services ahead of those like Expedia. Judge Mehta tossed these claims, saying that services like Yelp and Expedia aren’t general search engines and are therefore not in the same market as Google. It was a highly technical and annoying way to read certain legal questions, but bringing an antitrust case has become virtually impossible unless it’s done perfectly. Fortunately, a lot of the case survived.</p><p>The net effect is that a trial will start on September 12 and go for roughly two months. Depending on what happens, there may be additional time spent on a remedy, or it may go on appeal. As witnesses testify, from Google executives to rivals, we’re going to learn an enormous amount about how the internet developed, how advertising is sold, and why decisions about what we search for happen the way they do. It’s pretty disconcerting so much key evidence was destroyed, but it will still be a massively educational experience.</p><p><span>This trial, and even the case, isn’t the end. There are other cases that Google has to deal with into the fall and next year. For instance, Judge James Donato is allowing a class action trial over Google’s app store monopoly in November, which could cost Google tens of billions of dollars in damages. And in another case, Google has been trying to keep an antitrust claim from the state of Texas and a bunch of state AGs in New York, but a judicial panel </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/judicial-panel-refuses-pause-return-texas-lawsuit-against-google-2023-08-03/" rel="">just ruled</a><span> that the case will go back to be heard in Texas. Then there’s the Federal government’s trial in Virginia on Google’s monopolization of the software underpinning most online advertising. Other parts of the firm, like Google Maps, are </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/02/22/doj-google-maps-antitrust-probe-00084058" rel="">being investigated</a><span> as well. </span></p><p>I can’t say this trial will work out one way or the other. Given his passivity as Google destroyed documents, Judge Mehta has aways to go before he lives up to the legacy of Harold Greene. But I don’t want to assume anything, or be unfair to Mehta. After all, current antitrust caselaw is much weaker than it was in 1982. And frankly, the case is bigger than Mehta, or the D.C. Circuit judges who will hear an appeal, or perhaps even the Supreme Court. The public is actually engaged in a way they haven’t been in our lifetimes. Ten years ago, the FTC shut down a monopolization case against Google with a 5-0 vote, and zero controversy. That would never happen today. Indeed, regardless of how Mehta rules, it’s going to be a big deal.</p><p>Reviving laws to constrain corporate power takes time, as people within many institutions must change their minds, and come to grips with the choice of living in a free society or one dominated by monopolies. Fortunately, that change is happening. In September and October, we’ll start to see some of the fruits of that change. And hopefully, Judge Mehta will live up to the legacy of the D.C. district court, set forty one years ago by the courage of Harold Greene.</p><p><span>Thanks for reading!

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/08/06/baldurs-gate-3-prepared-for-100000-concurrent-players-theyve-gotten-700000/">https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/08/06/baldurs-gate-3-prepared-for-100000-concurrent-players-theyve-gotten-700000/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37023089">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure role="presentation"><figcaption><fbs-accordion><p>Baldur's Gate 3</p></fbs-accordion><small>Larian</small></figcaption></figure>
<p>I am running out of ways to describe not just what a success Baldur’s Gate 3 is, but on a scale that no one, not even its developer Larian, predicted.</p>

<p>Larian’s Swen Vincke posted a tweet yesterday showing the game hitting 500,000 concurrent players, making it the third most played game on all of Steam behind only CSGO and DOTA 2. He said that he told IT to only expect 100,000 concurrents at max.</p>


<p>That gap has widened even further. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" target="_blank" title="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" aria-label="peak yesterday was 712,281 players">peak yesterday was 712,281 players</a>, surpassing games like DOTA 2, Rust, Apex Legends, GTA 5 and PUBG. Mind you, this is a single player, hardcore RPG.</p>


<p>Past that, Baldur’s Gate has now broken into the top 10 peak playercounts in Steam history. It’s currently #9, getting dangerously close to Hogwarts Legacy’s 879,308, a high water mark from earlier this year. Above those two are New World, Elden Ring, Cyberpunk 2077, Dota 2, Lost Ark, CSGO and PUBG. There are only four single players games out of the top 10, as others are MMOs or PvP games.</p>

<p>I think that Baldur’s Gate might push even higher later today, as I’ve seen playercounts peak for many games on Sundays. While it’s not impossible the following weekend is higher, that’s a bit unlikely, as these all-time peaks often happen early on. But anything can happen, and Baldur’s Gate has already defied all kinds of odds.</p>

<p>We don’t know what exact sales are for Baldur’s Gate 3’s PC-only release is, but they previously moved up the date to better avoid bigger fall games, and clearly it worked. The game does not have more than <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/baldurs-gate-3?ref=hp" target="_blank" title="https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/baldurs-gate-3?ref=hp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/baldurs-gate-3?ref=hp" aria-label="four scored reviews">four scored reviews</a> in right now, but given all the praise, even in a year of a megahit like Tears of the Kingdom and a AAA blockbuster like Starfield coming up, there’s a serious chance Baldur’s Gate 3 could be in play for GOTY, and I imagine many individual outlets or creators may end up picking it in the end.</p>

<p>I think what’s the most shocking to me is the <em>kind</em> of game this is, a very enormous, detailed, turn-based RPG that simply doesn’t get made anymore. But while it may have fallen out of fashion with publishers and developers, that simply is not true for the general public, who raced to Baldur’s Gate 3 despite it being 20 years since the last one. Just wild to see. We’ll see what records it may break next.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
				<h2>From one dentist I got a quote of $460 for all of the work I needed to be done. From another, $29,850.</h2>
			</p><div>
		<p>From behind a door comes the whine of a highspeed drill. When my name is called, I am ushered into an examining room and welcomed with a nutcracker handshake by the dentist, a graying at the temples man.</p>
<p>Soon I am staring toward the white cork ceiling while my teeth are probed, poked, tapped, and tugged. The numbers of my teeth are called out to an assistant, who jots the information on a chart: “No. 11, crown; No. 13, MOD; No. 14, MO… ” A few minutes later comes the verdict: I need 11 crowns, plus other work. It will cost $8,347.</p>
<p>“Do this and you will have no worries about your teeth for the next 30 years, ” the dentist purrs. Somehow I doubt that. Then he adds, “You and I are going to become great friends.”</p>
<p>Somehow I doubt that too. I was there in Dayton, Ohio, as part of an assessment of the consistency and fairness of American dentistry. Since Americans spend about $42 billion a year on their teeth, it seemed like a reasonable assignment: visit 50 dentists, show them your teeth and a set of X-rays, and ask each what needs to be done.</p>
<p>Four months, 50,000 miles, and 50 exams later, I concluded that going to the dentist is nothing to smile about. Dentistry is a stunningly inexact science. Even expecting that different dentists would have different, yet valid, opinions did not prepare me for the astounding variation in diagnoses I received. Some wanted only $500 to bring me up to good dental health. Others wanted ten, 20, even 50 times that amount. Surely they could not all be right.</p>
<p>I randomly selected the dentists from the Yellow Pages in 28 states and the District of Columbia. At each of the offices, I told the same story: I was moving to the area and wanted to become a patient; I had recently come through successful gum surgery; my dental expenses were covered through a direct reimbursement program with my employer; I was interested in maintaining good oral health and was satisfied with the appearance of my teeth. Because I said I was in a direct reimbursement program, I got a written treatment plan and a cost estimate from each dentist.</p>
<p>Before embarking on my journey, I went to the Lebanon&nbsp; Pa., office of Warren Daugherty my personal dentist for the past 15 years, and a man I trust. “You look really good,” he said after examining me and my X-rays, “but I want to put a crown on No. 30. ”</p>
<p>“Roughly how much money are we talking about?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Under $500. ”</p>
<p>I asked several other dentists, who had no financial interest in my teeth, to assess their condition so that I would have a basis for comparison with what I found on the road. Joining Daugherty on my panel were Dr. John Mayes of Hershey, Pa., a fellow of the Academy of General Dentistry, who took the X rays; Dr. John Dodes of Woodhaven, N.Y., a practicing dentist and the dental expert for the National Council Against Health Fraud; and Dr. Alvin Morris of Pawley’s Island, S. C., the former dean of the University of Kentucky’s College of Dentistry and recipient of the Distinguished Service Award from the American Dental Association in 1985.</p>
<p>All agreed that my oral health was good and I had only one immediate problem, the No. 30 tooth, a molar that needed a cap or a filling. Each panelist said there was room for disagreement on tooth No. 18, but that the total should not exceed $1,500 if two crowns were recommended.</p>
<p>I began my odyssey in Madison, Wis., where my grave-faced examiner informed me that I needed five teeth crowned, including No. 30, plus additional work. The estimated cost was $3,110.</p>
<p>The next day I visited Davenport, Iowa, where the verdict was the same: five crowns. But one tooth was different from those singled out in Madison. The cost was a little lower: $2,555. Then this dentist volunteered, “Your dental work is lousy.”</p>
<p>In Moline, Il., however, I received reassuring news: “Whoever’s been working on your mouth really knows his stuff. ”</p>
<p>Dr. Pacit a Pumilia in Rockford, Il., agreed that I needed only No. 30 crowned. But in Dayton, Ohio, a dentist wanted to crown six teeth—Nos. 6 through 11 in the upper front—for cosmetic improvements. Moreover, he missed No. 30 entirely.</p>
<p>Americans’ dental health has improved dramatically since 1945, the year cavity-fighting fluoride was first added to local water supplies. Traditional dental practice—drill, fill, and bill—has fallen off dramatically. According to the National Institute of Dental Research, the number of children with cavities in their permanent teeth dropped by more than half between the early 1970s and early 1990s. Meanwhile, the population of dentists has grown by 50 percent.</p>
<p>“The decline in the incidence of cavities has led to increased competition among dentists, ” says Dr. Dodes. “Dentists, in turn, are seeking ever more ways to make money from their patients.” His role with the National Council Against Health Fraud is to help protect patients against overcharging, overtreatment, and outright quackery.</p>
<p>In Indianapolis, the practitioner said through his blue mask, “I want to take some pictures of your mouth. These are not X-rays. It’s an intra-oral camera.”</p>
<p>He placed a wandlike device in my mouth, which sent an image to the chairside television monitor and gave me a fullscreen view of my mouth in living color. He took four photographs. “These pictures are so we can show you where the problems are,” he explained. “You can take them home with you.”</p>
<p>There was no charge for the photographs. Later I learned why: the camera is considered a selling device for dentists and manufacturers claim it will pay for itself in a few months in the form of additional work. “Patients need to be sold TWICE—in the office and when they get home,” goes one bit of sales advice.</p>
<p>I was handed two estimates. One was for “necessities”: four crowns, not including No. 30, at a cost of $2,617. A separate listing for cosmetic work came to $8,665. The total: $11,282.</p>
<p>“If it’s covered, you may as well get the whole job so it’s done right,” my examiner said, lowering his voice.</p>

<p>It is an attitude I encountered a dozen times. Under the direct reimbursement program I claimed to be in, my employer would pay claims directly from an established company fund. Dentists like direct reimbursement because they get paid quickly and there is no third party, such as an insurance company, questioning their work.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, I was told: “Tell me what your insurance limits are, and we’ll proceed from there.”</p>
<p>Heading south, I hit one comforting practitioner in Marion, Ark., Dr. Henry Wah, who recommended $700 worth of work. Just a few miles away, in Memphis, Tenn., my examiner said I could squeak by with a barebones approach, “with absolutely no guarantees for the future, ” at a cost of $5,000. But what I really ought to do, he said, would be to crown all 28 teeth. (My four wisdom teeth have been extracted. ) Total cost : $13,440. He could, he assured me, do most of the job in a single day—with a 10 percent discount if I paid cash on that day.</p>
<p>In Salt Lake City, the dentist informed me solemnly, “You need a full-mouth&nbsp;reconstruction. ” Cost: $19,402. Nothing, I thought, could top this. Alas, I was wrong.</p>
<p>At a dental school, I heard about a newsletter, The Profitable Dentist, and became a subscriber. From this newsletter, I discovered that there’s a whole business devoted to telling dentists how to build up the “million dollar practice.” Dentists are flocking to courses on how to generate more profits by maximizing the use of hygienists, extending credit, stepping up collection practices, and persuading patients to accept expensive restoration work instead of fillings.</p>
<p>Not that dentists are near the poverty line. According to the American Dental Association (ADA), the average income for dentists in private practice for 1994, the last year for which figures are available, was $117,610.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, high fees and quality dentistry don’t always go hand in hand. Indeed, 15 of the 50 dentists who examined me missed my problem No. 30 entirely. And three of those dentists assured me that I had no problems whatsoever.</p>
<p>A good example of the inconsistencies I encountered was on the issue of jagged edges, also called margins. These are tiny spaces between the crown and the tooth surface, and in my case, they were exposed as a result of gum surgery.</p>
<p>Above downtown Seattle in a highrise overlooking Puget Sound, the dentist had a 15-minute look in my mouth, and when done he was somber. “Some of your crowns have jagged edges and need immediate attention. They will trap food and cause decay.” He wanted to do 17 crowns—though he missed No. 30—and other work at a cost of $13,774.</p>
<p>A few weeks after the urgency in Seattle, I was in Cambridge, Mass. “The downside of gum surgery is that you have a lot of exposed roots,” the dentist said. “It’s not necessary to change all the crowns if you keep them clean and practice a good daily routine.” She recommended one crown and four fillings at a cost of $1,220. In Washington, D. C., the margins were a $5,275 problem. They were not a problem in Cody, Wyo., and Lahaina, Hawaii. They were a problem in Albuquerque and Omaha.</p>
<p>The panelists? None of them thought the margins posed an immediate threat to my dental health.</p>
<p>There were signs of consistency and fairness in American dentistry. In a humble office in Burlington, Vt., I was checked thoroughly by Dr. David Blanck. The exam included an oral cancer and periodontal screening and a request to consult with my home periodontist. (My panel says all three should be part of a proper new patient exam.) He was among a dozen practitioners whose treatment plans were substantially the recommendations of my panel.</p>
<p>However, only nine of the 50 wanted to consult with the periodontist who performed my gum surgery; only 21 conducted the ADA recommended oral cancer screening, and only 14 did the ADA recommended periodontal screening. The cost of my exams ranged from $20 to $141, and the cost of a porcelain crown ranged from $329 to $1,150.</p>
<p>My final stop was on Park Avenue in New York City, a stone’s throw from Grand Central Terminal. A revolving door chopped rush hour crowds into people. Smooth as mercury, an elevator whisked me up the highrise, where I entered an impressive office—handsome furniture, art on the walls, oriental carpets on hardwood floors. Baroque music wafted from invisible speakers. The dentist was a trim, athletic man, and as he examined my teeth, he shook his head in displeasure. Finally, he sighed and invited me to a private conference room.</p>
<p>“The news is not good, and you’re lucky you have insurance,” he said. He handed me a treatment plan that said I needed 21 crowns and veneer on six lower front teeth.</p>
<p>It would cost $29,850.</p>
<p>I decided to get one extra exam. This one wouldn’t be from a dentist in private practice but from a dental school student whose principal impetus would be to get it right rather than to get rich. A week later I was sitting in the clinic of the Creighton University School of Dentistry in Omaha. My examiner was Larry Tran, a 25-year-old Californian in his third year of the four-year program. He did the oral cancer exam, the periodontal screening, and checked my bite. Then he proceeded, slowly, painstakingly. After about 30 minutes, he said: “You’re in good shape. You need a crown on No. 30, and I’d like to crown No. 18. The cost will be $460. Now I need to find my instructor. ”</p>
<p>A minute later he was back with Dr. John Thurmond, the chairman of oral diagnosis and radiology, who also examined me. “You got it right,” he said to Tran.</p>
<p>I asked the American Dental Association how the dentists I saw could draw such different conclusions from the same set of facts. They put me in touch with Dr. Leslie Seldin, a New York dentist and a consumer adviser for the ADA. He said he was not surprised by the inconsistencies. “Dentistry is an art based on scientific knowledge, and what’s most important to all of us is that we each use our professional judgment to design what we believe is the best solution for the patient.” But Dr. Morris, the former dean, said my findings are “disturbing” and notes that guidelines are needed to assist dentists in providing quality care. “Some doctors say we don’t need standards in dentistry because they already exist for who gets into dental school, who graduates, and who is admitted to practice. The problem with most measures, however, is they inevitably reach a minimally acceptable level, requiring not that one be good but that one not be bad. ”</p>
<p>The ADA recently developed a set of nonbinding treatment parameters. My panel’s Dr. Dodes calls them “mostly nebulous generalities that do little to guarantee patients adequate treatment.”</p>
<p>What, then, can Americans do to protect themselves from overtreatment and overcharging? Says the ADA’s Dr. Seldin, “We encourage patients to seek out—certainly if there’s a lot of work to be done—second or third opinions so they can have comfort with the practitioner’s recommendations.”</p>
<p>I got 50 opinions, and I am not comforted.</p>

<p>In the early 2010s, the economist Justin Lin Yifu, a former World Bank chief official with ties to the Chinese government, <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/growth-and-the-chinese-economy-s-latecomer-advantage-by-justin-yifu-lin-2013-08">predicted</a> that China’s economy would have at least two more decades of growth above 8%. He reckoned that since the country’s per capita income at that time was about the same level as Japan’s in the 1950s and South Korea’s and Taiwan’s in the 1970s, there was no reason China could not replicate the erstwhile successes of these other East Asian states. Lin’s optimism was echoed by the Western commentariat. The <em>Economist</em> projected that China would become the world’s biggest economy by 2018, surpassing the United States. Others fantasized that the Communist Party would embark on an ambitious programme of political liberalization. The <em>New York Times</em>’s Nicholas Kristof <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/opinion/sunday/kristof-looking-for-a-jump-start-in-china.html">wrote</a> in 2013 that Xi would ‘spearhead a resurgence of economic reform, and probably some political easing as well. Mao’s body will be hauled out of Tiananmen Square on his watch. Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning writer, will be released from prison’. The political scientist Edward Steinfeld likewise <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Playing_Our_Game.html?id=YCK-8b9CmDYC&amp;source=kp_book_description&amp;redir_esc=y">argued</a> in 2010 that China’s embrace of globalization would kickstart a process of ‘self-obsolescing authoritarianism’ resembling that of Taiwan in the 1980s and 90s. 　</p>



<p>Ten years later, the naivety of these forecasts is apparent. Even before the onset of Covid-19, the Chinese economy had slowed down and entered a domestic debt crisis, visible in the collapse of major real estate developers like Evergrande. After Beijing lifted all pandemic restrictions in late 2022, a widely anticipated economic rebound failed to materialize. Youth unemployment spiked at above 20%, surpassing that of every other G-7 nation (another estimate put it at above 45%). Data on trade, price, manufacturing and GDP growth all point to deteriorating conditions – a trend that fiscal and monetary stimulus has failed to reverse. The <em>Economist</em> now claims that China might never catch up with the US, and it is universally acknowledged that Xi is no liberal, having redoubled state intervention in the private sector and foreign enterprises while silencing dissenting voices (including those that had previously been tolerated by the Party).</p>



<p>It would be wrong to think that external factors have radically altered China’s prospects. Rather, the country’s gradual decline started more than a decade ago. Those who closely analysed the data, beyond the buzzing business districts and flashy building developments, detected this economic malaise as early as 2008. Back then, I wrote that China was entering a typical overaccumulation <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09692290701869654#:~:text=A%20full%2Dfledged%20overaccumulation%20crisis,weight%20in%20the%20global%20economy.">crisis</a>. Its booming export sector had raked in a huge amount of foreign reserves since the mid-1990s. In its closed financial system, exporters must surrender their foreign earnings to the central bank, which creates equivalent RMB to mop up the foreign currencies. This led to the rapid expansion of RMB liquidity in the economy, mostly in the form of bank loans. Because the banking system is tightly controlled by the party-state – with state-owned or state-connected enterprises serving as the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/columbia-scholarship-online/book/18891/chapter-abstract/177209413?redirectedFrom=fulltext">fiefdoms</a> and cash cows of elite families – the state sector enjoyed privileged access to state bank loans, which were used to fuel an investment spree. The result was rising employment, a temporary and localized economic boom, and a windfall for the elite. But this dynamic also left behind redundant and unprofitable construction projects: empty apartments, underused airports, excessive coal plants and steel mills. That, in turn, resulted in falling profits, slowing growth and worsening indebtedness across the main sectors of the economy.</p>



<p>Throughout the 2010s, the party-state periodically undertook new lending in an attempt to arrest the slowdown. But many enterprises simply took advantage of easy bank loans to refinance their existing debt without adding new spending or investment to the economy. These companies eventually became loan addicts; and as with any addiction, increasing doses were needed to generate diminishing effects. Over time, the economy lost its dynamism as zombie enterprises were kept alive through debt alone: a classic case of the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-29/inventor-of-balance-sheet-recession-says-china-is-now-in-one">‘balance-sheet recession’</a> that roiled Japan after its boom ended in the early 1990s. Yet just as these woes became increasingly clear to insiders in the early 2010s, they were censored in official media, which amplified Lin’s upbeat assessment. Meanwhile in the Western world, a web of Wall Street bankers and corporate executives had reason to suppress more sceptical analyses, as they continued to profit off luring investors into China. The illusion of limitless high-speed growth thus ruled the day at the very moment when the economy entered its most serious crisis since the outset of the market reform era.</p>



<p>Beijing has long known what must be done to alleviate this crisis. An obvious step would be to initiate redistributive reform to boost household income and hence household consumption – which, as a share of GDP, has been among the lowest in the world. Since the late 90s, there have been calls to rebalance the Chinese economy in favour of a more sustainable growth model, by reducing its reliance on exports and fixed asset investment like infrastructure construction. This led to some reformist, redistributive policies under the Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao government of 2003–13, such as the New Labour Contract Law, the abolition of agriculture tax, and the redirection of government investment to inland rural regions. But the weight of vested interests (state enterprises, as well as local governments thriving on construction contracts and state bank loans fuelling those projects), and the powerlessness of social groups who stand to benefit from such rebalancing policy (workers, peasants and middle-class households), meant that reformism did not take root. The minimal gains in inequality reduction in the Hu–Wen period were duly reversed after the mid-2010s. More recently, Xi has made <a href="https://jacobin.com/2023/02/mussolini-in-beijing">clear</a> that his ‘common prosperity programme’ is not a return to the egalitarianism of the Mao era, nor even a restoration of welfarism. It is, rather, an assertion of the state’s paternalistic role vis-à-vis capital: increasing its presence in the tech and real estate sectors, and aligning private entrepreneurship with the broader interests of the nation.</p>



<p>The party-state has been bracing itself for the social and political repercussions of this dire situation. In official policy speeches, ‘security’ has become the most frequently uttered word, eclipsing ‘economy’. The current leadership believes that it can survive an economic downturn by tightening its control over society, eradicating autonomous elite factions, and adopting a more assertive posture on the international stage amid rising geopolitical tension – even if such measures serve to aggravate its developmental problems. This helps to explain the abolition of the presidential term limits in 2018, the centralization of power within Xi’s hands, the relentless campaign to root out Party factions in the name of anti-corruption, the construction of a growing surveillance state, and the shifting basis of state legitimation: away from the delivery of economic growth and towards nationalist fervour. The current weakening of the economy and hardening of authoritarianism are not easily reversible trends. They are, in fact, the logical outcome of China’s uneven development and capital accumulation over the last four decades. This means they are here to stay.</p>
