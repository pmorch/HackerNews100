Now, I wouldn’t normally say a random state legislator introducing a proposal is a big deal.

The answer is that corporate-run gambling is now pervasive in America, and Americans don’t like what they see. Gambling, particularly online sports betting, is now everywhere. About a fifth of Americans </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/10/02/americans-increasingly-see-legal-sports-betting-as-a-bad-thing-for-society-and-sports/" rel="">placed</a><span> a bet in the past year, mostly through gambling apps. Since 2018, when online sports gambling got a big boost from a key Supreme Court decision, Americans have </span><a href="https://www.legalsportsreport.com/sports-betting-states/revenue/" rel="">bet</a><span> more than half a trillion dollars on sports. </span></p><p><span>And the attempts to change our culture are extremely visible; I watched the Dolphins-Ravens game last night on Amazon Prime, and I lost count of the number of ads for DraftKings and FanDuel, with various celebrities lending their names to this cultural phenomenon. Every major sports media network, sports league, and podcast are now working with a major gambling company. At this point, gambling is intrinsic to the financing of sports; FanDuel now </span><a href="https://www.theringer.com/2025/10/24/nba/nba-gambling-scandal-chauncey-billups-terry-rozier-adam-silver" rel="">operates</a><span> “15 regional sports networks across the country previously on the brink of bankruptcy.”</span></p><p><span>The broad consequences are also extremely visible. Take athletics. Americans love sports, and that cultural centerpiece is being corrupted in an orgy of greed and speculative ferver. Last week, the government </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/nyregion/nba-sports-betting-gambling-scandal.html" rel="">charged</a><span> six people, including two NBA players, for gambling-related fraud. It’s also contributing to a courser culture, with a lot of unfair pressure on athletes. According to </span><a href="https://www.usnews.com/banking/articles/2025-sports-betting-and-debt-survey" rel="">US News</a><span>, “21% of sports bettors say they’ve verbally abused an athlete, either in person or online, after losing money on a bet.”</span></p><p><span>And that’s not even getting into the costs of fostering a nation of gamblers, lured in by an app-based model that is far more convenient and addictive than traditional in-person betting. Today, four out of five </span><a href="https://www.usnews.com/banking/articles/2025-sports-betting-and-debt-survey" rel="">betters</a><span> are using betting apps or online platforms. A quarter of bettors can’t pay a bill because of their wagers, a third have gambling debts, more than half carry credit card debts, and a quarter of them are afraid they can’t control their gambling. Economists are </span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4903302" rel="">finding</a><span> a “substantial increase in average bankruptcy rates, debt sent to collections, use of debt consolidation loans, and auto loan delinquencies” for consumers in states that legalized online sports betting versus those that restrict it to in-person locations. The estimates I’m told privately by experts in the field is that in the next five years, all gambling - including lotteries, Las Vegas casinos, and online sports betting - will likely see Americans lose a trillion dollars or so. </span></p><p><span>Last year, I did an Organized Money episode with </span><a href="https://www.organizedmoney.fm/p/episode-9-vice-monopolists-fanduel" rel="">Les Bernal and Dr. Kavita Fischer</a><span> on the problem; Fischer is a psychiatrist who downloaded Draft Kings in 2022 to unwind after putting her kids to bed. She ended up losing $600,000, explaining to the Wall Street Journal </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/hospitality/gambling-addiction-sports-betting-apps-4463cde0?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqe_LgM0Z396EKHXo_vX_T0lmObkaGlhcn_70DubGAlGLAdOYy3eVA3oEIMTn54%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6903c02c&amp;gaa_sig=4Unk99tCx4UcVWnftJq8NI6YmawFu_0g7uLipAxDCJHhMqxXNTJwZpnNcAEIbnSPCv8Prh1ibH__NiNBzMETJA%3D%3D" rel="">the story</a><span> of how DraftKings used sophisticated techniques to keep her betting, even as she desperately tried to stop. (Most of the loss was not on sports, but on standard casino games.)</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zWRH!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd268c66b-cf7f-4913-b6e3-d8410002eb3b_1030x461.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zWRH!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd268c66b-cf7f-4913-b6e3-d8410002eb3b_1030x461.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zWRH!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd268c66b-cf7f-4913-b6e3-d8410002eb3b_1030x461.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zWRH!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd268c66b-cf7f-4913-b6e3-d8410002eb3b_1030x461.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zWRH!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd268c66b-cf7f-4913-b6e3-d8410002eb3b_1030x461.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zWRH!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd268c66b-cf7f-4913-b6e3-d8410002eb3b_1030x461.png" width="1030" height="461" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d268c66b-cf7f-4913-b6e3-d8410002eb3b_1030x461.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:461,&quot;width&quot;:1030,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:350710,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.thebignewsletter.com/i/177563599?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd268c66b-cf7f-4913-b6e3-d8410002eb3b_1030x461.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zWRH!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd268c66b-cf7f-4913-b6e3-d8410002eb3b_1030x461.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zWRH!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd268c66b-cf7f-4913-b6e3-d8410002eb3b_1030x461.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zWRH!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd268c66b-cf7f-4913-b6e3-d8410002eb3b_1030x461.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zWRH!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd268c66b-cf7f-4913-b6e3-d8410002eb3b_1030x461.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Online sports betting is reaching new more politically empowered groups. Fischer’s story is very common, and it’s occurring among middle and upper middle class people who were never exposed to other forms of gambling, like state lotteries and casinos. It’s also hitting kids, who themselves are often calling in to help lines with addiction. It’s so common that Saturday Night Live did a viral skit for a fictional company called “Rock Bottom Kings,” which allows people to take bets on their degenerate gambling addict friend’s behavior. </p><div id="youtube2-wXZNuwY_5-U" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;wXZNuwY_5-U&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wXZNuwY_5-U?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p><span>Increasingly, people are turning against this form of betting. According to Pew,  43% of U.S. adults </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/10/02/americans-increasingly-see-legal-sports-betting-as-a-bad-thing-for-society-and-sports/" rel="">say</a><span> “the fact that sports betting is now legal in much of the country is a bad thing for society,” up from 34% just a few years ago. And that’s concentrated among young men, who are most exposed; “47% of men under 30 say legal sports betting is a bad thing for society, up from 22% who said this in 2022.” And opposition is increasing faster among people who bet than people who don’t. It’s not that people oppose betting with friends, what’s problematic is the ability to build a business around being the house.</span></p><p><span>In an important sense, it’s odd that we’re even dealing with pervasive corporate-run gambling. Historically, Americans understood systemic gambling, and associated similar abuses of power like usury, as a moral and social catastrophe in waiting. That has been true since the 19th century, with many states making gambling unconstitutional, through to the fixing of the 1919 World Series, but it was also true well into the 20th century, when corporate gambling was constrained to mobster-run places like Las Vegas and Atlantic City. Even into the 1960s, courts </span><a href="https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=2957&amp;context=clr" rel="">prevented</a><span> the patenting of gambling machines on the grounds they conflicted with the “sound morals of society.”</span></p><p><span>And culturally, we understood it as well, with gambling represented as a sinful and harmful enterprise. Take the 1987 smash hit movie </span><em>Back to the Future II. </em><span>In it, the villain, Biff Tannen, uses a time machine to alter the past so that he becomes a wealthy and corrupt casino magnate over a dilapidated town, Hill Valley. The hero, Marty McFly, in turn, must find a way to revert Hill Valley to its previous state. </span><em>Back to the Future II</em><span> was the third highest grossing film of 1989, and I remember as a kid we all saw it, and in school all my friends wondered whether hoverboards were real. Everyone just knew that corporate-run gambling was seedy.</span></p><p><span>With a few exceptions, up until the 1960s this attitude applied to all corporate gambling, from sports betting to lotteries, which were seen as similar to the “numbers racket” of the mob. But in 1963, New Hampshire Governor John King, egged on by the conservative </span><em>Manchester Union Leader, </em><span>signed a bill to create the first state lottery, to the horror of most newspapers nationwide and the Federal government, which arrested out-of-state residents for buying tickets. </span></p><p><span>Why did New Hampshire allow its new “sweepstakes” game? Well, it was </span><a href="https://www.nhmagazine.com/how-nh-defied-the-feds-mob-and-church-to-create-the-first-state-lottery/" rel="">pitched</a><span> as part of the anti-tax revolution that would take over the nation fifteen years later. One of the key supporters was Bill Loeb, the arch-conservative publisher of the </span><em>Manchester Union Leader, </em><span>who “favored the Sweepstakes because he feared without it the Legislature would pass a sales tax — something he abhorred over all else.” </span></p><blockquote><p>Pointing to the state’s reliance on so-called “sin taxes,” Loeb penned the strongest defense of the lottery yet. “No one has to go to the track and bet. No one has to smoke tobacco. No one has to drink. But how do those who oppose the Sweepstakes propose to raise the money? Either a sales tax or a property tax or some other kind of levy that people will have to pay, even though it will hurt them dreadfully to do so.”</p></blockquote><p>The New Hampshire lottery served as the “legitimization” of gambling, turning it from a seedy activity into something sanctioned by a state. And it also set in motion the same dynamic with gambling we see today, which is that residents from outside of New Hampshire would buy lottery tickets from that state, because they couldn’t get them where they live. So their state officials would wonder why they are foregoing revenue, leading to a daisy chain of legalization. Corporate gambling tended to expand in a similar pattern. After people saw that a simple state lottery could bring in more revenue, they allowed more complex gambling games, and then in-person casinos and racetracks, slot machines, and sports betting. And every time someone tried to block the expansion, the response was “well people will just do it across state lines.”</p><p>After New Hampshire, New Jersey and New York created lotteries. Then, in the 1970s, a host of progressive-leaning states across the northeast created lotteries to deal with austerity budgets, and to capture the revenue they were foregoing when their own residents went to other states to buy lottery tickets. These included Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Illinois, Ohio, Rhode Island, Vermont, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. Much of the rest of the country legalized lotteries in the 1980s for similar reasons, though a few states - Utah, Alaska, and Hawaii - have not. </p><p><span>In the South, religious conservatives opposed gambling, but Reagan Republicans changed this dynamic. Moral scold Bill Bennett, who wrote “The Book of Virtues” and served as Secretary of Education and Drug Czar under Reagan, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/03/us/relentless-moral-crusader-is-relentless-gambler-too.html" rel="">exempted</a><span> gambling from his list of sins, himself carrying millions in gambling debts. A key actor was eventual RNC Chair Frank Fahrenkopf, who brought casino interests into the national Republican world, welding it together with Wall Street cash and big hotel chains by forming the American Gaming Association. </span></p><p>Corporations got into gambling in a major way. “Before 1989, you couldn’t get mainstream, Wall Street money in this industry,” said one reporter. “Now, not only can you get, they’re throwing it at you.” Fahrenkopf talked about the inflow of big corporate interests, it was now “professionals - people who have gone to business school.” These were “some of the brightest business men and women now involved in running these companies,” with the ability to “sit down with Goldman Sachs, or Bear Sterns or whoever it might be and convince them that number one, it’s a legitimate business.”</p><p><span>Martin Scorcese, in the ending of the iconic movie </span><em>Casino, </em><span>described this shift from the mob control of Vegas to Wall Street control. “Where did the money to rebuild the pyramids come from?” asked Las Vegas Sands casino leader and mobster Sam “Ace” Rothstein after he lost control of the town. “Junk Bonds.”</span></p><div id="youtube2-fBp8lLjZohg" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;fBp8lLjZohg&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:&quot;78&quot;,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fBp8lLjZohg?start=78&amp;rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p>When the internet became mainstream in the 1990s, online gambling wasn’t legal, but online gambling offerings from offshore casinos became a major problem. Tennessee Senator Bill Frist, with a coalition of progressives and religious conservatives, moved a bill called the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act in 2006, which banned money transfers to offshore gaming companies. But the UIGEA had an exemption for fantasy sports, which proponents laughably called a game of skill and not chance. Over the course of the next two decades, the firms that took advantage of this law then unleashed a state-by-state lobbying campaign to legalize online sports betting.</p><p><span>The Supreme Court, in 2018, </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-476_dbfi.pdf" rel="">said</a><span> states could legalize online sports gambling, unleashing a lobbying campaign such that 39 states now allow it. Today, when you pass sports bars on Sunday’s, many of them now have special sections dedicated to gambling. On a moral and political level, many Americans came to accept corporate gambling as just another business, like usury or wild forms of financial speculation. </span></p><p>Democrats often invite gambling as a mechanism to bring in more revenue for the state. And on the right, a former casino magnate, Donald Trump, is now in the White House, and his track record running that sort of business simply didn’t enter the political debate. Trump drew immense support from the anti-gambling religious right, and progressive Democrats mocked Trump for losing money running a casino, but not for engaging in that business in the first place. </p><p>In other words, Biff Tannen’s dastardly scheme to organize a town around gambling interests would today be framed as just good economic development. </p><p>Beyond the substantive harm, there’s an ideological valence to corporate gambling. Corporate-run gambling is an unusual commercial activity, for two reasons. One is that there’s nothing produced, it’s a pure net transfer of wealth from the gambler to the casino. But the second and more important one is that it’s addictive, and thus coercive. </p><p>Gambling releases dopamine, the chemical behind pleasure and anticipation, and over time, it changes the chemistry of one’s brain to create a dependency on continuing the activity. As Fischer put it, “There was just something in my brain that made me keep going.” Thus, a company engaged in corporate gambling is seeking to take advantage of the other party’s very ability to govern their own rational faculties. </p><p>Most people think of legitimate market transactions as involving two parties coming together in a voluntary exchange based on reasonably honest information. You can go back to Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas, all the way through the populists and John Wanamaker, and find the basics of fair pricing - no coercion, no deception. But the coercion is real, and so is deception. Every online sports gambling commercial includes a help line if you have a problem, and all of the firms in the industry say they maintain ethical standards. And yet, as the Wall Street Journal story showed, their ideal customer is one who gambles excessively. </p><p><span>As legal scholar Matthew Lawrence noted, addiction is a </span><a href="https://scholarlycommons.law.emory.edu/faculty-articles/82/" rel="">fundamental threat</a><span> to liberty. Because there is an imbalance in power between the parties in the transaction, corporate gambling requires far stricter rules and regulations, or perhaps even bans, than markets for goods that are not addictive. </span></p><p>Corporate gambling also has significant broader negative consequences. Online sports betting corrupts sports and the public itself. And states often derive revenue from the practice, meaning that legislators, even if they wanted to eliminate the activity, would have to plug a fiscal hole. Like all products that foster addiction, corporate gambling creates a form of social pollution, in the form of ruined lives and public corruption. And that’s why it’s important to impose market rules that significantly limit the activity and the political power of those who profit from it.</p><p>While the religious right and Catholic institutions oppose gambling, progressives have not been particularly concerned until recently, preferring to scold around questions of race and gender than traditional fire and brimstone sins. But that is changing, as the left swings more towards concern over inequality and economics than non-commercial questions. </p><p>So what can be done?</p><p><span>Gambling is legal in other countries, for better or worse. There are a number of regulatory choices that lessen its impact. In the UK, for instance, they have what are called “</span><a href="https://harmreductionjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12954-024-01150-3" rel="">stake limits</a><span>” for certain online games, meaning that gamblers have a limit on the amount they can bet in any one contest. The stake limits </span><a href="https://www.gamblinginsider.com/news/28198/government-debates-gambling-reform-online-slot-stake-limits-and-statutory-levy-introduced" rel="">are lower</a><span> for certain ages. In addition, they regulate VIP programs such as the ones that entrapped Fischer, which has cut problem gambling somewhat.</span></p><p>In the U.S., we are just starting to figure out how to push back. There are possible levers around the use of data to target customers with advertisements, eliminating push notifications and VIP programs, prohibiting discrimination against “sharps,” aka people who are good at sports betting. </p><p><span>But there are significant hurdles, and not just the standard issues involved in dealing with well-capitalized corporate opponents, who engage in multiple forms of lobbying, everything from direct contacts with lawmakers to working with think tanks like </span><a href="https://www.progressivepolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PPI-Legalized-Sports-Betting.pdf" rel="">the Progressive Policy Institute</a><span>. Unlike most other industries, corporate gambling is also a partnership with the state. To run a casino, race track, or online betting app, you need a license, and must pay the state some portion of your revenues. States themselves run lotteries. And that means gambling revenue is part of state budgets.</span></p><p><span>Take Maryland. Out of $24.86 billion of </span><a href="https://www.marylandcomptroller.gov/content/dam/mdcomp/md/reports/financial/FY2024-Closeout.pdf" rel="">state revenue</a><span> last year, $1.589 billion came from the lottery, the state’s casinos, sportsbooks and daily fantasy sports operators. Most of that was from casinos and lotteries, sports was just $89.9 million. But if you want to outlaw this harmful activity, you have to find a way to replace 6.4% of Maryland’s budget, which is slightly less than the entire amount the state brings in from corporate taxes. The fiscal gains from gambling revenues </span><a href="https://rockinst.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2016-04-12-Blinken_Report_Three-min.pdf" rel="">are vastly overstated</a><span>. In the short-term, it usually delivers, but quickly peters out. Indeed, Maryland Governor Wes Moore just </span><a href="https://www.legalsportsreport.com/233974/moore-signs-maryland-sports-betting-tax-hike/" rel="">increased taxes</a><span> on sports betting, as a way to plug a budget gap. And the costs are </span><a href="https://www.crainsnewyork.com/op-ed/op-ed-casino-revenues-are-often-short-lived-and-not-sustainable-over-long-run" rel="">likely higher</a><span> than the revenue gains. Gambling, as it turns out, is just as addictive to states as it is to gamblers, with less bang for the buck over time.</span></p><p><span>And it gets worse during economic downturns, as Pat Garofalo </span><a href="https://boondoggle.substack.com/p/the-biggest-lottery-scam-is-the-lottery" rel="">wrote</a><span> in his invaluable newsletter. </span></p><blockquote><p><span>Lottery playing increases </span><a href="https://taxfoundation.org/blog/does-lottery-revenue-rise-or-fall-during-economic-hardship/#:~:text=Of%20the%2042%20states%20with,.%20%2C%20in%202001%2D2." rel="">when joblessness rises</a><span>, and more than 20 state lotteries set sales records during the Great Recession.</span></p><p><span>Because states have tied specific programs to lottery funding, they </span><em>need</em><span> that desperation, or else lottery-tied funding falls during economic downturns, when other revenues are also going south, leaving states with more holes they need to fill.</span></p><p><span>Just look at </span><a href="https://www.governing.com/finance/what-happens-to-public-budgets-when-residents-spend-less-on-the-lottery?utm_campaign=Newsletter%20-%20GOV%20-%20Future%20of%20Finance&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_7WehIfJlb1uP4po4OjBslRQp91fDfrmHzge7Rpdrq7BjHEk9kLWH_Xf9Al028bB-6WJ9cjW_aaApgTQPU7575UtilXw&amp;_hsmi=387104456&amp;utm_content=387104456&amp;utm_source=hs_email" rel="">this recent interview</a><span> with the executive director of the Virginia lottery. Though he pays a lot of lip service to ensuring that Virginians don’t become addicted to lottery games, it’s clear his overriding concern is ensuring that people keep playing even as the state’s economic outlook worsens.</span></p><p>He brings up expanding online games in order to bring in more young players, explains that “offering a mix of gaming experiences and price points helps draw in different kinds of players,” and says he wants to put lottery games into restaurants and bars — because nothing says “we’re taking gambling addiction seriously” quite like giving people easy access to gambling and alcohol together.</p></blockquote><p><span>As Garofalo noted, </span><a href="https://www.governing.com/finance/what-happens-to-public-budgets-when-residents-spend-less-on-the-lottery?utm_campaign=Newsletter%20-%20GOV%20-%20Future%20of%20Finance&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_7WehIfJlb1uP4po4OjBslRQp91fDfrmHzge7Rpdrq7BjHEk9kLWH_Xf9Al028bB-6WJ9cjW_aaApgTQPU7575UtilXw&amp;_hsmi=387104456&amp;utm_content=387104456&amp;utm_source=hs_email" rel="">10 percent</a><span> of Virginia’s public education is tied to gambling money. Even though gambling costs a state more than it brings in, cutting corporate gambling likely means it’ll be necessary to tax the wealthy.</span></p><p><span>Beyond the fiscal hurdles, there are attempts to make it impossible to even regulate gambling at a state level. Kalshi, a company that operates what it calls “prediction markets” to allow people to speculate on things like elections, is now offering sports betting. Kalshi claims that its sports betting is not gambling, but a form of useful financial market-exchange. That’s of course nonsense, but the goal is to have a Federal regulator, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, override state limits on gambling. If Kalshi wins on its legal argument, then online sports betting will be legal everywhere, without state permission. So far, Kalshi </span><a href="https://www.bhfs.com/insight/third-times-the-charm-for-gambling-regulators-in-kalshi-litigation/" rel="">has won</a><span> in Nevada and New Jersey, but lost in Maryland, which means this decision will eventually have to be addressed on appeal.</span></p><p><span>The politics of this particular administration on gambling are ugly; Trump’s first pick to run the CFTC was a board member of Kalshi; after he withdrew, the </span><a href="https://www.ingame.com/cftc-pick-selig-letter-backing-sports-contracts/" rel="">next pick</a><span> is a lawyer for a firm that invested in Kalshi. Moreover, Donald Trump Jr. is an investor in Kalshi, and President Trump’s company, TruthSocial, is </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/trump-truth-social-launches-prediction-market/" rel="">launching</a><span> a predictions market as well (as is DraftKings).</span></p><p>All of these dynamics make the institutions hard to reform. Yet, the most important tool is public opinion, and that has not been brought to bear until recently. </p><p>The underpinning of the anti-corporate gambling movement is the same as the anti-monopoly argument. A free society relies on rules that prevent arbitrary coercion, both in and out of the marketplace. For a long time, we have neglected the role of commerce in a moral order, choosing to ignore gambling, usury, fraud, and deceit, as well as monopolization and a whole variety of games around price. What’s happening, as we are enveloped in a world of unreality, of crypto and fraud, AI bubbles, and sports gambling, is that the corruption of our society, with the rise of scams and flattery, is becoming impossible to ignore.</p><p>Senator Benson’s bill to roll back online sports gambling in Maryland may be one of the first important moves to go on offense against corporate gambling, but it won’t be the last.</p><p><span>Thanks for reading!

<p><em>As part of our <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/our-work/public-data-project/">Public Data Project</a>, LIL recently launched <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/data-gov-archive/">Data.gov Archive Search</a>. In this post, we look under the hood and reflect on how and why we built this project the way we did.</em></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="rethinking-the-old-trade-off-cost-complexity-and-access">Rethinking the Old Trade-Off: Cost, Complexity, and Access</h2>

<p>Libraries, digital humanities projects, and cultural heritage organizations have long had to perform a balancing act when sharing their collections online, negotiating between access and affordability. Providing robust features for data discovery, such as browsing, filtering, and search, has traditionally required dedicated computing infrastructure such as servers and databases. Ongoing server hosting, regular security and software updates, and consistent operational oversight are expensive and require skilled staff. Over years or decades, budget changes and staff turnover often strand these projects in an unmaintained or nonfunctioning state.</p>

<p>The alternative, static file hosting, requires minimal maintenance and reduces expenses dramatically. For example, storing gigabytes of data on Amazon S3 may cost $1/month or less. However, static hosting often diminishes the capacity for rich data discovery. Without a dynamic computing layer between the user’s web browser and the source files, data access may be restricted to brittle pre-rendered browsing hierarchies or search functionality that is impeded by client memory limits. Under such barriers, the collection’s discoverability suffers.</p>

<p>For years, online collection discovery has been stuck between a rock and a hard place: accept the complexity and expense required for a good user experience, or opt for simplicity and leave users to contend with the blunt limitations of a static discovery layer.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="why-we-explored-a-new-approach">Why We Explored a New Approach</h2>

<p>When LIL began thinking about how to provide discovery for the <a href="https://source.coop/harvard-lil/gov-data/">Data.gov Archive</a>, we decided that building a lightweight and easily maintained access point from the beginning would be worth our team’s effort. We wanted to provide low-effort discovery with minimal impact on our resources. We also wanted to ensure that whatever path we chose would encourage, rather than impede, long-term access.</p>

<p>This approach builds on our recent experience when the Caselaw Access Project (CAP) hit <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2024/03/26/transitions-for-the-caselaw-access-project/">a transition moment</a>. At that time, we elected to switch <a href="http://case.law/">case.law</a> to a static site and to partner with others dedicated to open legal data to provide more feature-rich access.</p>

<p>CAP includes some 11 TB of data; the Data.gov Archive represents nearly 18 TB, with the catalog metadata alone accounting for about 1 GB. Manually browsing the archive data in its repository, even for a user who knows what she’s looking for, is laborious and time-consuming. Thus we faced a challenge. Could we enable dynamic, scalable discovery of the Data.gov Archive while enjoying the frugality, simplicity, and maintainability of static hosting?</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="our-experiment-rich-discovery-no-server-required">Our Experiment: Rich Discovery, No Server Required</h2>

<p>Recent advancements in client-side data analysis led us to try something new. Tools like <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/api/wasm/">DuckDB-Wasm</a>, <a href="https://phiresky.github.io/blog/2021/hosting-sqlite-databases-on-github-pages/">sql.js-httpvfs</a>, and <a href="https://protomaps.com/">Protomaps</a>, powered by standards such as WebAssembly, web workers, and HTTP range requests, allow users to efficiently query large remote datasets in the browser. Rather than downloading a 2 GB data file into memory, these tools can incrementally retrieve only the relevant parts of the file and process query results locally.</p>

<p>We developed Data.gov Archive Search on the same model. Here’s how it works:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Data storage:</strong> We store Data.gov Archive catalog metadata as sorted, compressed Parquet files on Source.coop, taking advantage of performant static file hosting.</li>
  <li><strong>In-browser query engine:</strong> Our client-side web application loads DuckDB-Wasm, a fully functional database engine running inside the user’s browser.</li>
  <li><strong>On-demand data access:</strong> When a user navigates to a resource or submits a search, our DuckDB-Wasm client executes a targeted retrieval of the data needed to fulfill the request. No dedicated server is required; queries run entirely in the browser.</li>
</ul>

<p>This experiment has not been without obstacles. Getting good performance out of this model demands careful data engineering, and the large DuckDB-Wasm binary imposes a considerable latency cost. As of this writing, we’re continuing to explore speedy alternatives like <a href="https://github.com/hyparam/hyparquet">hyparquet</a> and <a href="https://idl.uw.edu/arquero">Arquero</a> to further improve performance.</p>

<p>Still, we’re pleased with the result: an inexpensive, low-maintenance static discovery platform that allows users to browse, search, and filter Data.gov Archive records entirely in the browser.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-matters-for-libraries-digital-humanities-projects-and-beyond">Why This Matters for Libraries, Digital Humanities Projects, and Beyond</h2>

<p>This new pattern offers a compelling model for libraries, academic archives, and DH projects of all sizes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Lower operating costs:</strong> By shifting from an expensive server to lower cost static storage, projects can sustainably offer their users access to data.</li>
  <li><strong>Reduced technical overhead:</strong> With no dedicated backend server, security risks are reduced, no patching or upgrades are needed, and crashing servers are not a concern.</li>
  <li><strong>Sustained access:</strong> Projects can be set up with care, but without demanding constant attention. Organizations can be more confident that their archive and discovery interfaces remain usable and accessible, even as staffing or funding changes over time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing that we are not the only group interested in approaching access in this way, we’re sharing our generalized learnings. We see a few ways forward for others in the knowledge and information world:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Prototype or pilot:</strong> If your organization has large, relatively static datasets, consider experimenting with a browser-based search tool using static hosting.</li>
  <li><strong>Share and collaborate:</strong> Template applications, workflows, and lessons learned can help this new pattern gain adoption and maturity across the community.</li>

The Ministry achieved this status by <a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/austrias-ministry-of-economy-takes-decisive-steps-toward-digital-sovereignty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">migrating 1,200 employees to a Nextcloud-based cloud and collaboration platform</a> hosted on Austrian-based infrastructure.&nbsp;</p><p>This shift away from proprietary, foreign-owned cloud services, such as <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-you-can-get-microsoft-365-formerly-office-for-free-3-easy-ways/">Microsoft 365</a>, to an <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-open-source-and-how-does-it-benefit-you/">open-source</a>, European-based cloud service aligns with a growing trend among European governments and agencies. They want control over sensitive data and to declare their independence from US-based tech providers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/europes-plan-to-ditch-us-tech-giants-is-built-on-open-source-and-its-gaining-steam/">Europe's plan to ditch US tech giants is built on open source - and it's gaining steam</a></strong></p><p>European companies are encouraging this trend. Many of them have joined forces in the newly created non-profit foundation, the EuroStack Initiative. This foundation's goal is " to organize action, not just talk, around the pillars of the initiative: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/euro-stack_foundation-press-release-activity-7389635091049840641-J3gZ?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAAAKH4BBvA-ZwpVFbaZDTqwLgneEpGsrHQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Buy European, Sell European, Fund European</a>."&nbsp;</p><p>What's the motive behind these moves away from proprietary tech? Well, in Austria's case, Florian Zinnagl, CISO of the Ministry of Economy, Energy, and Tourism (BMWET), explained, "We carry responsibility for a large amount of sensitive data -- from employees, companies, and citizens. As a public institution, we take this responsibility very seriously. That's why we view it critically to rely on cloud solutions from non-European corporations for processing this information."</p><p><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/europes-plan-to-ditch-us-tech-giants-is-built-on-open-source-and-its-gaining-steam/">Austria's move and motivation echo similar efforts in Germany, Denmark, and other EU states and agencies</a>. The organizations include the German state of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/german-state-replaces-microsoft-exchange-and-outlook-with-open-source-email/">Schleswig-Holstein, which abandoned Exchange and Outlook for open-source programs</a>. Other agencies that have taken the same path away from Microsoft include the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-european-military-just-ditched-microsoft-for-open-source-libreoffice-heres-why/">Austrian military</a>, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-denmark-is-dumping-microsoft-office-and-windows-for-libreoffice-and-linux/">Danish government</a> organizations, and the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-city-is-dumping-microsoft-office-and-windows-for-onlyoffice-and-linux-heres-why/">French city of Lyon</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/inside-canonicals-plan-to-make-ubuntu-26-04-the-linux-desktop-that-finally-goes-mainstream/">Inside Canonical's plan to make Ubuntu 26.04 the Linux desktop that finally goes mainstream</a></strong></p><p>All of these organizations aim to keep data storage and processing within national or European borders to enhance security, comply with privacy laws such as the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/gdpr-an-executive-guide-to-what-you-need-to-know/">EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>, and mitigate risks from potential commercial and foreign government surveillance.&nbsp;</p><p>Open-source software is seen as combining the virtues of faster development and better security, while providing companies and governments with more control, as general manager Thierry Carrez of the <a href="https://openinfra.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">OpenInfra Foundation</a> recently suggested: "Open infrastructure allows nations and organizations to maintain control over their applications, their data, and their destiny while benefiting from global collaboration." &nbsp;</p><!----><p>The US government is worried about this trend. <a href="https://pro.politico.eu/news/207200" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">American diplomats have complained to French and German officials</a> ahead of November's <a href="https://dig.watch/event/summit-on-european-digital-sovereignty" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Summit on European Digital Sovereignty</a>&nbsp;about the European push for digital sovereignty. This high-level event will bring together EU institutions, member states, public and private sector leaders, and other key stakeholders to advance Europe's digital sovereignty agenda.&nbsp;</p><p>While the US may not like it, with NextCloud's help, BMWET completed its migration in just four months. Although BMWET had already begun adopting Microsoft 365 and <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-copilot-is-taking-over-teams-heres-how-ai-will-shape-your-daily-workflow/">Teams</a>&nbsp;before the project's start, the shift was still considered a success. That's because instead of reversing its path, the ministry implemented a hybrid architecture: Nextcloud handles internal collaboration and secure data management, while Teams remains available for external meetings.</p><p>The project emphasized integration with existing workflows, including seamless integration with Outlook email and calendar via Sendent's Outlook app. This approach minimized disruption and ensured user acceptance. However, not all migrations progress so well.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, in Austria, the <a href="https://www.derstandard.de/story/3000000293383/prozentzeichen-statt-bundesadler-wie-die-justiz-ihre-it-umstellt" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ministry of Justice decided to replace Office with LibreOffice</a>. Yet the transition has run into trouble. It appears that the move of 20,000 desktops, which was prompted by a desire to reduce spending on Microsoft licenses, has been, as one person reported, an "unprofessional, rushed operation." Some offices are still on Office, others on LibreOffice, and they're running into incompatible document format problems and misfires in e-mail systems.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Also:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/10-open-source-windows-apps-i-cant-live-without-and-theyre-all-free/">10 open-source Windows apps I can't live without - and they're all free</a></strong></p><p>The moral of the story is that any switch from one software suite to another requires careful handling by the IT department and helpdesk staff. Otherwise, you end up with unhappy users.</p><p>That said, BMWET's bold shift to Nextcloud appears to have gone well. This initiative demonstrates that adopting sovereign cloud solutions can be practical, user-friendly, and rapid in the public sector. However, as Austria's Justice Ministry experience has shown, simply shifting to an open-source approach without careful planning can get in the way of getting work done.&nbsp;</p><div id="pinbox-575d8711-4f9c-4bea-8980-f0ae20a04381"><h4>Open Source</h4> <!---->  </div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>I’ve written <em>a bit</em> about <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> and I still face moments where foundational aspects of the package system confounds and surprises me.</p>

<p>Recently I hit an issue that stumped me as it break some basic comprehension I had on how Nix works. I wanted to produce the build and runtime graph for the Ruby interpreter.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix-shell <span>-p</span> ruby

<span>&gt;</span> which ruby
/nix/store/mp4rpz283gw3abvxyb4lbh4vp9pmayp2-ruby-3.3.9/bin/ruby

<span>&gt;</span> nix-store <span>--query</span> <span>--include-outputs</span> <span>--graph</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>$(</span>nix-store <span>--query</span> <span>--deriver</span> <span>$(</span>which ruby<span>))</span>
error: path <span>'/nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv'</span> is not valid

<span>&gt;</span> <span>ls</span> /nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv
<span>ls</span>: cannot access <span>'/nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv'</span>:
No such file or directory
</code></pre></div>

<p>Huh. 🤔</p>

<p>I have Ruby but I don’t seem to have the derivation, <code>24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g</code>, file present on my machine.</p>

<p>No worries, I think I can <code>--realize</code> it and download it from the NixOS cache.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix-store <span>--realize</span> /nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv
don<span>'t know how to build these paths:
  /nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv
error: cannot build missing derivation '</span>/nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv<span>'
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>I guess the NixOS cache doesn’t seem to have it. 🤷</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This was actually perplexing me at this moment. In fact there are <a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/how-to-get-a-missing-drv-file-for-a-derivation-from-nixpkgs/2300/1">multiple</a> <a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/why-isnt-deriver-and-realize-identity-functions-see-example/47490/1">discourse</a> posts about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My mental model however of Nix though is that I must have first evaluated the derivation (drv) in order to determine the output path to even substitute. How could the NixOS cache not have it present?</p>

<p>Is this derivation wrong somehow? Nope. This is the derivation Nix believes that produced this Ruby binary from the <code>sqlite</code> database. 🤨</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> sqlite3 <span>"/nix/var/nix/db/db.sqlite"</span> 
    <span>"select deriver from ValidPaths where path = 
    '/nix/store/mp4rpz283gw3abvxyb4lbh4vp9pmayp2-ruby-3.3.9'"</span>
/nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv
</code></pre></div>

<p>What does the binary cache itself say? Even the cache itself thinks this particular derivation, <code>24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g</code>, produced this particular Ruby output.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> curl <span>-s</span> https://cache.nixos.org/mp4rpz283gw3abvxyb4lbh4vp9pmayp2.narinfo |<span>\</span>
  <span>grep </span>Deriver
Deriver: 24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv
</code></pre></div>

<p>What if I try a different command?</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix derivation show <span>$(</span>which ruby<span>)</span> | jq <span>-r</span> <span>"keys[0]"</span>
/nix/store/kmx8kkggm5i2r17s6l67v022jz9gc4c5-ruby-3.3.9.drv

<span>&gt;</span> <span>ls</span> /nix/store/kmx8kkggm5i2r17s6l67v022jz9gc4c5-ruby-3.3.9.drv
/nix/store/kmx8kkggm5i2r17s6l67v022jz9gc4c5-ruby-3.3.9.drv
</code></pre></div>

<p>So I seem to have a completely different derivation, <code>kmx8kkggm5i2r17s6l67v022jz9gc4c5</code>, that resulted in the same output which <em>is not</em> what the binary cache announces. WTF? 🫠</p>

<p>Thinking back to a previous post, I remember touching on <a href="https://fzakaria.com/2025/03/28/what-s-in-a-nix-store-path">modulo fixed-output derivations</a>. Is that what’s going on? Let’s investigate from first principles. 🤓</p>

<p>Let’s first create <code>fod.nix</code> which is our <em>fixed-output derivation</em>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>let</span>
  <span>system</span> <span>=</span> <span>builtins</span><span>.</span><span>currentSystem</span><span>;</span>
<span>in</span> <span>derivation</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"hello-world-fixed"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>builder</span> <span>=</span> <span>"/bin/sh"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>system</span> <span>=</span> <span>system</span><span>;</span>
  <span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"-c"</span> <span>''</span><span>
</span><span>    echo -n "hello world" &gt; "$out"</span><span>
</span><span>  ''</span> <span>];</span>
  <span>outputHashMode</span> <span>=</span> <span>"flat"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>outputHashAlgo</span> <span>=</span> <span>"sha256"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>outputHash</span> <span>=</span> <span>"b94d27b9934d3e08a52e52d7da7dabfac484efe37a5380ee9088f7ace2efcde9"</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>☝️ Since this is a <em>fixed-output derivation</em> (FOD) the produced <code>/nix/store</code> path will not be affected to changes to the derivation beyond the contents of <code>$out</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix-instantiate fod.nix
/nix/store/k2wjpwq43685j6vlvaarrfml4gl4196n-hello-world-fixed.drv

<span>&gt;</span> nix-build fod.nix
/nix/store/ajk19jb8h5h3lmz20yz6wj9vif18lhp1-hello-world-fixed
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now we will create a derivation that uses this FOD.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>{</span> <span>fodDrv</span> <span>?</span> <span>import</span> <span>./fod.nix</span> <span>}:</span>

<span>let</span>
  <span>system</span> <span>=</span> <span>builtins</span><span>.</span><span>currentSystem</span><span>;</span>
<span>in</span>
<span>builtins</span><span>.</span><span>derivation</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"uses-fod"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>inherit</span> <span>system</span><span>;</span>
  <span>builder</span> <span>=</span> <span>"/bin/sh"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"-c"</span> <span>''</span><span>
</span><span>    echo </span><span>${</span><span>fodDrv</span><span>}</span><span> &gt; $out</span><span>
</span><span>    echo "Good bye world" &gt;&gt; $out</span><span>
</span><span>  ''</span> <span>];</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>/nix/store</code> for the output for this derivation <em>will change</em> on changes to the derivation <strong>except</strong> if the derivation path for the FOD changes. This is in fact what makes it “modulo” the fixed-output derivations.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix-instantiate uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/85d15y7irq7x4fxv4nc7k1cw2rlfp3ag-uses-fod.drv

<span>&gt;</span> nix-build uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/sd12qjak7rlxhdprj10187f9an787lk3-uses-fod
</code></pre></div>

<p>Let’s test this all out by changing our <code>fod.nix</code> derivation.
Let’s do this by just adding some <em>garbage</em> attribute to the derivation.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>@@ -4,6 +4,7 @@</span>
   name = "hello-world-fixed";
   builder = "/bin/sh";
   system = system;
<span>+  garbage = 123;
</span>   args = [ "-c" ''
     echo -n "hello world" &gt; "$out"
   '' ];
</code></pre></div>

<p>What happens now?</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix-instantiate fod.nix
/nix/store/yimff0d4zr4krwx6cvdiqlin0y6vkis0-hello-world-fixed.drv

<span>&gt;</span> nix-build fod.nix
/nix/store/ajk19jb8h5h3lmz20yz6wj9vif18lhp1-hello-world-fixed

<p>The path of the derivation itself, <code>.drv</code>, has changed but the output path <code>ajk19jb8h5h3lmz20yz6wj9vif18lhp1</code> remains consistent.</p>

<p>What about the derivation that leverages it?</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix-instantiate uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/85wkdaaq6q08f71xn420v4irll4a8g8v-uses-fod.drv

<span>&gt;</span> nix-build uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/sd12qjak7rlxhdprj10187f9an787lk3-uses-fod
</code></pre></div>

<p>It also got a new derivation path but the output path remained unchanged. 😮</p>

<p>That means changes to <em>fixed-output-derivations</em> didn’t cause new outputs in either derivation <em>but</em> it did create a complete new tree of <code>.drv</code> files. 🤯</p>

<p>That means in <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs">nixpkgs</a> changes to <em>fixed-output</em> derivations can cause them to have new store paths for their <code>.drv</code> but result in dependent derivations to have the same output path. If the output path had already been stored in the NixOS cache, then we lose the link between the new <code>.drv</code> and this output path. 💥</p>

<p>The amount of churn that we are creating in derivations was unbeknownst to me.</p>

<p>It can get even weirder! This example came from <a href="https://github.com/ericson2314">@ericson2314</a>.</p>

<p>We will duplicate the <code>fod.nix</code> to another file <code>fod2.nix</code> whose only difference is the value of the garbage.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>@@ -4,7 +4,7 @@</span>
   name = "hello-world-fixed";
   builder = "/bin/sh";
   system = system;
<span>-  garbage = 123;
</span><span>+  garbage = 124;
</span>   args = [ "-c" ''
     echo -n "hello world" &gt; "$out"
   '' ];
</code></pre></div>

<p>Let’s now use both of these in our derivation.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>{</span> <span>fodDrv</span> <span>?</span> <span>import</span> <span>./fod.nix</span><span>,</span>
  <span>fod2Drv</span> <span>?</span> <span>import</span> <span>./fod2.nix</span>

</span><span>    echo "Good bye world" &gt;&gt; $out</span><span>
</span><span>  ''</span> <span>];</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>We can now instantiate and build this as normal.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix-instantiate uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/z6nr2k2hy982fiynyjkvq8dliwbxklwf-uses-fod.drv

<span>&gt;</span> nix-build uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/211nlyx2ga7mh5fdk76aggb04y1wsgkj-uses-fod
</code></pre></div>

<p>What is weird about that?</p>

<p>Well, let’s take the JSON representation of the derivation and remove one of the inputs.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix derivation show <span>\</span>
    /nix/store/z6nr2k2hy982fiynyjkvq8dliwbxklwf-uses-fod.drv <span>\</span>
    jq <span>'values[].inputDrvs | keys[]'</span>
<span>"/nix/store/6p93r6x0bwyd8gngf5n4r432n6l380ry-hello-world-fixed.drv"</span>
<span>"/nix/store/yimff0d4zr4krwx6cvdiqlin0y6vkis0-hello-world-fixed.drv"</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>We can do this because although there are two input derivations, we know they both produce the same output!</p>

<div><pre><code><span>@@ -12,12 +12,6 @@</span>
       "system": "x86_64-linux"
     },
     "inputDrvs": {
<span>-      "/nix/store/6p93r6x0bwyd8gngf5n4r432n6l380ry-hello-world-fixed.drv": {
-        "dynamicOutputs": {},
-        "outputs": [

-        ]
-      },
</span>       "/nix/store/yimff0d4zr4krwx6cvdiqlin0y6vkis0-hello-world-fixed.drv": {
         "dynamicOutputs": {},
         "outputs": [
</code></pre></div>

<p>Let’s load this modified derivation back into our <code>/nix/store</code> and build it again!</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix derivation add &lt; derivation.json
/nix/store/s4qrdkq3a85gxmlpiay334vd1ndg8hm1-uses-fod.drv

<span>&gt;</span> nix-build /nix/store/s4qrdkq3a85gxmlpiay334vd1ndg8hm1-uses-fod.drv
/nix/store/211nlyx2ga7mh5fdk76aggb04y1wsgkj-uses-fod
</code></pre></div>

<p>We got the same output <code>211nlyx2ga7mh5fdk76aggb04y1wsgkj</code>. Not only do we have a <code>1:N</code> trait for our output paths to derivations but we can also take certain derivations and completely change them by removing inputs and still get the same output! 😹</p>

<p>The road to Nix enlightenment is no joke and full of dragons.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          <h3>
            <span>

          </h3>
          <p>The Nim Team is happy to announce version 2.2.6, the third patch release for our stable release, Nim 2.2.</p>

<p>It comes six months after the 2.2.4 release and it contains <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/compare/v2.2.4...v2.2.6">141 commits</a>, bringing bugfixes and improvements.</p>

<p>If you’re still on Nim 1.6, take a look at the <a href="https://nim-lang.org/blog/2023/08/01/nim-v20-released.html">version 2.0 release article</a> to see all the features you’re missing.
If you’ve been using Nim 2.0, the <a href="https://nim-lang.org/blog/2024/10/02/nim-220-2010.html">version 2.2 release article</a> shows the improvements available in Nim 2.2.</p>

<p>The Nim 2.2.6 changelog is available <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/blob/v2.2.6/changelog.md">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<p>Exception handling combined with Nim’s <code>async</code> is more stable than ever before
as the underlying closure iterator transformation has been rewritten.</p>

<p>The compiler is now smart enough to produce a move operation for <code>return obj.field</code>.
Previously it performed a copy.
Expect your code to run slightly faster due to this and other minor performance improvements.</p>

<h2 id="installing-nim-226">Installing Nim 2.2.6</h2>

<p>Check out if the package manager of your OS already ships version 2.2.6 or
install it as described <a href="https://nim-lang.org/install.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you have installed a previous version of Nim using <code>choosenim</code>,
getting Nim 2.2.6 is as easy as:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>choosenim update self
<span>$ </span>choosenim update stable
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> We recommend you to install and use the latest version of <code>choosenim</code>, v.0.8.16, available in <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/choosenim">our choosenim repo</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can download Nim 2.2.6 from
<a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/nightlies/releases/tag/2025-10-31-version-2-2-ab00c56904e3126ad826bb520d243513a139436a">our nightlies builds</a>.</p>

<p>GitHub releases now support immutability, adding a new layer of supply chain security. With immutable releases, assets and tags are protected from tampering after publication, so the software you publish—and your users consume—remains secure and trustworthy.</p>
<h3 id="about-immutable-releases"><a href="#about-immutable-releases">About immutable releases</a></h3>
<p>Immutable releases offer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Immutable assets</strong>: Once you publish a release as immutable, its assets can’t be added, modified, or deleted. This helps protect distributed artifacts from supply chain attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Tag protection</strong>: Tags for new immutable releases are protected and can’t be deleted or moved.</li>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org"><h2>Abstract</h2><div><p>Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the structure of the brain, offers advantages in parallel processing, memory storage, and energy efficiency. However, current semiconductor-based neuromorphic chips require rare-earth materials and costly fabrication processes, whereas neural organoids need complex bioreactor maintenance. In this study, we explored shiitake (<em><em>Lentinula edodes</em></em>) fungi as a robust, sustainable alternative, exploiting its adaptive electrical signaling, which is akin to neuronal spiking. We demonstrate fungal computing via mycelial networks interfaced with electrodes, showing that fungal memristors can be grown, trained, and preserved through dehydration, retaining functionality at frequencies up to 5.85 kHz, with an accuracy of 90 ± 1%. Notably, shiitake has exhibited radiation resistance, suggesting its viability for aerospace applications. Our findings show that fungal computers can provide scalable, eco-friendly platforms for neuromorphic tasks, bridging bioelectronics and unconventional computing.</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section1"><h2>Background</h2>
<div id="section1"><h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The development of neuromorphic hardware relies on memristive devices capable of emulating synaptic behavior, with potential applications in energy-efficient computing and artificial intelligence<sup>1</sup>. Recent work has explored natural, biodegradable substrates as sustainable alternatives to conventional inorganic memristors [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref001">1</a>]. In this study, we investigated the potential of the edible fungus <em><em>Lentinula edodes</em></em> (shiitake mushroom) as a platform for memristor fabrication. By examining the electrical response of mushroom-derived materials under repeated voltage cycling, we explored stable memristive switching behavior, retention, and endurance. Shiitake-based devices not only demonstrate reproducible memory effects, but also highlight the potential for scalable, low-cost, and environmentally friendly neuromorphic components.</p>
</div>

<div id="section2"><h3>Memristors</h3>
<p>Memristor devices offer substantial advantages in robotic, industrial, and transport applications due to their unique electrical properties and ability to mimic neural functions. They can enhance various control systems, facilitate efficient information processing, and ultimately improve the overall performance of autonomous systems.</p>
<p>One of the key strengths of memristors is their capacity for efficient and self-adaptive in situ learning, which is critical for applications in robotics and autonomous vehicles. In memristor-based neural networks, the devices can adjust their resistance based on previous inputs, allowing for a form of analog learning that closely resembles the synaptic behavior in biological systems [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref001">1</a>]. This capability enables robots and autonomous vehicles to learn from their environment and adapt in real time, enhancing their ability to navigate complex situations effectively. It has been found that such systems can achieve low-latency responses, which are essential for high-speed decision-making in dynamic environments [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref002">2</a>].</p>
<p>Memristors also have the advantage of integrating memory and processing capabilities into a single device, enabling a simplified architecture for autonomous control systems [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref003">3</a>]. For instance, in autonomous vehicles, trajectory-tracking and path-following tasks can be performed using memristor-based controllers that allow for rapid calculations and real-time adjustments to control variables [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref004">4</a>]. This integration, especially with parallelization, helps to address the challenges posed by separate memory and processing units, which can lead to delays and increased power consumption in traditional control systems [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref004">4</a>].</p>
<p>Additionally, the resilience of memristor devices against environmental changes, and their ability to operate under varying conditions, make them particularly suitable for autonomous applications, such as spacecraft electronics or vehicles operating in unpredictable road environments [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref004">4</a>]. This is complemented by the precision in control that memristor-based systems can offer, which is significant for maintaining stability and performance while following desired trajectories [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref005">5</a>].</p>
<p>Moreover, the low power consumption of memristors is particularly beneficial in robotics and autonomous vehicles, where energy efficiency is paramount. Hybrid analog–digital memristor systems can minimize power usage during processing without sacrificing responsiveness, which can prolong operational times by reducing the frequency at which recharging or battery replacement is required, enhancing the feasibility of deploying such systems in mobile applications [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref002">2</a>].</p>
<p>Ultimately, the potential of memristors to emulate human-like decision-making and learning processes could be exploited to endow robotic systems and autonomous vehicles with functionalities not found in conventional control systems. The ability of memristors to perform complex computations efficiently, learn adaptively, and integrate both memory and processing into a unified approach make them a cornerstone technology for the future development of intelligent autonomous systems. However, the production of memristors often requires rare-earth minerals and expensive semiconductor foundries.</p>
</div>

<div id="section3"><h3>Fungal electronics</h3>
<p>Fungi possess innate abilities to adapt to various environmental conditions and efficiently process information through their interconnected network of hyphae. These characteristics make fungi an ideal candidate for developing sustainable computing systems from. Our aim was to design and implement a novel fungal memristor-based computing architecture that could significantly reduce energy consumption and minimize electronic waste. We approached this using substantially simpler bioreactors and nutrient cultures than those required for conventional neurons and neural organoids. The unique advantages of fungal memristors stem from the biological properties of fungal materials, which distinguish them from typical inorganic or polymer alternatives [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref006">6</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref007">7</a>].</p>
<p>First, one of the main benefits of fungal memristors is their environmentally sustainable and biodegradable nature. Conventional memristors often contain transition metal oxides or silicon-based structures, the production or disposal of which can pose environmental challenges [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref006">6</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref007">7</a>]. By contrast, fungal materials are derived from organic biomass, making them both sustainable and significantly less harmful to the environment. This aligns with increasing efforts toward developing greener electronic materials, as highlighted in previous work emphasizing the importance of sustainability in technology development [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref008">8</a>].</p>
<p>Second, fungal memristors exhibit remarkable adaptability in their electrical properties. The structural composition of fungal materials often allows for a range of conductive pathways that can form dynamically under the influence of electrical stimuli, similar to the conductive filaments formed in conventional memristors [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref009">9</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref010">10</a>]. This adaptability can lead to enhanced performance in neuromorphic applications through the facilitation of variable resistance states that mimic synaptic behaviors more closely than traditional memristive materials, which often have static crystalline structures that can lead to variability problems or performance limitations at the nanoscale [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref011">11</a>].</p>
<p>Furthermore, fungal memristors may consume less power than traditional materials due to their unique electrochemical properties. It has been claimed that some organic materials, including those derived from fungi, can operate effectively at lower voltages while maintaining stable switching characteristics––a trait that is crucial for developing energy-efficient devices for portable electronics and Internet of Things applications [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref012">12</a>]. This can significantly extend battery life and reduce energy costs in processing and memory applications, which have become focal points in the research into neuromorphic systems [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref013">13</a>].</p>
<p>Finally, the natural composition and multicellularity of fungal materials can lead to more naturalistic models for neural networks. Because these materials are subject to biological processes, they may inherently incorporate characteristics that resemble biological neuronal networks, including plasticity and memory capabilities that could evolve with usage. This biological mimicry could strengthen the development of more advanced artificial neural networks, enabling applications such as adaptive learning systems and intelligent sensor networks [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref014">14</a>].</p>
</div>

<div id="section4"><h3>Fungus types</h3>
<p>The potential use of common food mushrooms, such as shiitake and button mushrooms (<em><em>Agaricus bisporus</em></em>), as organic memristors is an emerging area of research that exploits the unique properties of these fungi [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref006">6</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref007">7</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref013">13</a>]. Memristors, which are non-volatile memory devices that retain information even without power, can benefit from the porous structures and electrical properties of the organic materials derived from mushrooms.</p>
<p>Shiitake mushrooms have been shown to possess a hierarchically porous carbon structure when activated. This porous structure can enhance the electrochemical performance of devices, making them suitable candidates for use in energy storage systems, including supercapacitors and, potentially, memristors [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref015">15</a>]. Highly conductive carbon materials have been created from shiitake, suggesting that these materials could be engineered to exhibit memristive behavior [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref016">16</a>]. Shiitake-derived carbon is a sustainable alternative to traditional materials and can enhance the performance of electronic devices due to its unique structural properties.</p>
<p>Button mushrooms have also shown significant potential in this context. Research has indicated that their porosity can be exploited to create materials with large surface areas, which are essential for the development of efficient electronic components [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref017">17</a>]. The synthesis of carbon composites from button mushrooms has been explored, revealing their ability to function effectively in energy storage applications [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref017">17</a>]. Furthermore, the integration of button mushrooms into electronic systems has been investigated, demonstrating their potential as substrates for electronic devices [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref018">18</a>].</p>
<p>In addition to their structural properties, the unique biological characteristics of fungi, including their ability to interact with various chemical compounds, can be harnessed to develop novel sensing technologies. For instance, electronic noses have been developed that use mushroom extracts to detect volatile compounds. These could be adapted for use in electronic devices that require environmental-sensing capabilities [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref019">19</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref020">20</a>]. This intersection of biology and electronics opens new avenues for creating multifunctional devices that incorporate the sensory capabilities of mushrooms.</p>
</div>

<div id="section5"><h3>Radiation, resistance, and resilience</h3>
<p>The radiation resistance of shiitake mushrooms has been studied primarily in terms of their ability to withstand and possibly derive benefits from exposure to ionizing radiation. This resistance can be attributed to several biochemical and physiological attributes. A possible factor is lentinan, a polysaccharide found in the cell walls of shiitake. Lentinan provides structural integrity and exhibits immunomodulatory effects that may enhance the mushroom’s ability to respond to environmental stresses, including radiation exposure. Although some research has suggested that lentinan possesses properties that may help mitigate oxidative stress [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref021">21</a>], there have been limited studies directly linking lentinan to radiation resistance in shiitake mushrooms.</p>
<p>Shiitake mushrooms have also shown a notable ability to adapt to their environmental conditions, including variable radiation levels. Studies involving fungi in space research have indicated that certain taxa can enhance their survival through morphological changes or increased melanin production in response to radiation [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref022">22</a>]. This radiation resistance implies a suitability of fungal electronics for aerospace applications, where cosmic rays and ambient radiation can interfere with conventional electronics. Fungi’s physical flexibility and low energy requirements would also be advantageous relative to conventional solutions [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref018">18</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref019">19</a>]. These studies have not specifically addressed shiitake, but the general adaptability observed in fungi suggests that this species could respond similarly to such conditions.</p>
<p>Another example of the resilience of shiitake mushrooms is their ability to maintain their nutritional and bioactive qualities after irradiation. For example, they retain essential nutrients and bioactive compounds even after exposure to ultraviolet radiation [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref023">23</a>]. The high content of ergosterol, a precursor to vitamin D, found in shiitake mushrooms, reinforces their potential for beneficial outcomes following exposure to radiation because this compound can be converted into vitamin D<sub>2</sub> when subjected to ultraviolet light [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref024">24</a>].</p>
<p>Lastly, shiitake mushrooms could be considered in the development of dietary supplements or functional foods that could serve a broader purpose in radioprotection. Their multirole efficacy as a food source and electrical component emphasizes a sustainable approach to utilizing biological entities that can withstand environmental stresses, including radiation. This is especially relevant in aerospace and exploration contexts, where promoting health in astronauts could reduce the risks associated with their increased radiation exposure during missions [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref022">22</a>]. Also, shiitake mushrooms can withstand environmental stresses, including radiation, while remaining safe for human consumption.</p>
<p>In summary, the radiation resistance of shiitake mushrooms is linked to the presence of protective compounds, such as lentinan, and their ability to adapt morphologically. These factors have contributed to our understanding of their survival strategies and are suggestive of potential applications in areas where radiation exposure is a significant concern, such as aerospace and radiation sensing. By culturing and evaluating the memristive properties of shiitake mushrooms, we can determine their suitability for use as sustainable, low-cost bioelectronics.</p>

</div>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section2"><h2>Methods</h2>
<div id="section1"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Testing the memristive behavior of shiitake mycelium involved several steps, the first being culturing the fungi, and then preparing the samples by drying and rehydrating them. Following this, the most successfully cultivated samples were electrically characterized using a test circuit. Additionally, a special circuit was constructed for further evaluating the feasibility of using mycelium for violate memory.</p>
</div>

<div id="section2"><h3>Hyphal cultivation</h3>
<p>Due to the financial and environmental constraints of this project, all four evaluated memristors fabricated for our experiments were composed exclusively of low-cost, organic materials. Based on previous research, we identified materials such as biocompatible composites [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref025">25</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref026">26</a>] as viable candidates for device construction and programming due to their biodegradability and compatibility with fungal growth.</p>
<p>The initial phase of experimentation focused on the cultivation of fungal hyphae in the selected organic growth media. Nine samples were prepared in standard polycarbonate Petri dishes. The growth conditions were carefully maintained to promote optimal fungal development, with a controlled temperature range of 20–22°C, a relative humidity of 70%, and mixed light exposure to replicate natural terrestrial conditions. The nutrient substrate consisted of a mixture of farro seed, wheat germ, and hay, selected for their organic compositions and ability to support robust fungal growth. Each sample was inoculated with spores or mycelial plugs of shiitake.</p>
<p>The samples (e.g., see <a href="#pone-0328965-g001">Fig 1</a>) were observed and documented biweekly to track their growth consistency and morphological development. Observations including hyphal density, surface coverage, and color changes were recorded in a structured laboratory logbook. In addition to these visual inspections, a brief scratch test was performed to track the progress of the mycelium throughout the substrate. The log included timestamps and qualitative notes, enabling consistent comparison across samples and time points.</p>
</div>

<div id="section3"><h3>Drying and rehydration process</h3>
<p>Once full hyphal coverage and structural maturation were achieved (i.e., when the Petri dish was covered), the samples were transitioned to the drying phase. The Petri dishes were left in a well-ventilated area under direct sunlight at room temperature for approximately seven days to ensure uniform dehydration. The samples were rotated periodically to avoid uneven hardening. As previously reported, this process transformed the fungal matrix into a rigid, disk-like structure while retaining its overall shape and connectivity [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref026">26</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref027">27</a>].</p>
<p>Prior to testing, the samples were rehydrated using a fine mist of aerosolized deionized water. The rehydration was conducted using a standard commercial spray bottle, held within a distance of 10 cm from each sample. This brief rehydration step restored the required level of conductivity without introducing bulk moisture that could have altered their mechanical integrity.</p>
</div>

<div id="section4"><h3>Electrical characterization</h3>
<p>Electrical testing protocols were designed based on theoretical memristors [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref006">6</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref007">7</a>]. An alternating current was applied to each sample, and the corresponding current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were measured using a digital oscilloscope. As established in previous works, the test setup used a voltage divider to model multiple memristors in the same circuit [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref006">6</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref007">7</a>].</p>
<p>To extract accurate current values, a known shunt resistor was placed in series with each sample. As shown in <a href="#pone-0328965-g002">Fig 2</a>, voltage readings were captured across both the sample and the resistor, with Channel 1 of the oscilloscope measuring the input voltage and Channel 2 capturing the voltage drop across the shunt resistor. The current values were then calculated using Kirchhoff’s current law, allowing derivation of the I–V characteristics from the voltage differentials. All waveform data were exported in comma-separated values (CSV) format for subsequent digital analysis and visualization.</p>
<p>To thoroughly investigate the memristive behavior of the four samples using mycelium coverage density, voltage sweeps were conducted using both square and sinusoidal waveforms. The square waves were employed to detect sharp threshold-based resistance changes, whereas the sinusoidal inputs provided insights into the more subtle, continuous mem-fractive behaviors. This dual approach enabled the identification of hysteresis loops in the I–V curves––a key signature of memristor functionality.</p>
<p>A square wave was used first, with the peak-to-peak voltage starting at 200 mV<sub>pp</sub> and increasing. If a sinusoidal wave form exhibited more promising results, a broader range of frequencies was explored. The frequencies and voltages used in the initial tests for memristive properties are detailed in <a href="#pone-0328965-t001">Table 1</a>.</p>
<p>Accuracy and error were calculated based on how many reads agreed with the analog threshold, the number of malformed readings, timing jitter, recording instability, and port delays [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref028">28</a>].</p>

<p>In the event that the fungal samples exhibited memristive behavior, a specialized electronic circuit was designed and implemented to investigate the volatile memory characteristics of two fungal samples in series. The test circuit was a voltage divider with memory. The test involved setting an arbitrary analog voltage value to represent a high value, and below that threshold was a low value. The frequency range started at 200 Hz and concluded at 5.85 kHz. Similarly to previous work, <a href="#pone-0328965-g003">Fig 3</a> shows the configuration and layout of this testing circuit [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref006">6</a>].</p>
<p>Comparably to previous work in memristive computing, the volatile memory circuit employed an Arduino UNO microcontroller development board and a voltage divider consisting of two memristive elements [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref006">6</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref007">7</a>]. Given the polarized nature of memristors, the circuit was designed to allow a voltage of opposite polarity to that used during read operations to be set. Both voltages used were approximately 5 V. The Arduino UNO cyclically applied a high signal to a relay containing a half-rectified sine wave through one of its digital output pins when reading the memristor bridge, thereby charging the divider. This process induced an asymmetry in resistance, with the memristor closest to the input experiencing a reduction in resistance, while the output-side memristor exhibited an increase. The voltage across the divider was subsequently read using an analog input pin, and another digital pin was used to run 5 V across the divider. The Arduino interpreted the stored state as “on” only when the measured voltage exceeded a predefined threshold, effectively enabling volatile memory detection based on the transient resistance states of the memristors. Ten tests were repeated on each of the four samples. The physical implementation of this circuit is shown in <a href="#pone-0328965-g004">Fig 4</a>.</p>
<p>The memristor voltage divider was tested by applying a 5 V<sub>pp</sub> sinusoidal signal to the memristors for approximately 0.01–0.1 ms. This signal was delivered via a relay triggered by digital pin 6 of the Arduino UNO. Following this brief stimulation period, the sinusoidal input was disabled, and digital pin 5 was activated to initiate the read phase. Analog voltage measurements were then acquired through the A1 analog input pin. To minimize the effects of floating voltages, a 1 MΩ pull-down resistor was connected to this pin. Voltage readings were recorded for approximately 0.1–0.10 ms before the cycle repeated, allowing for rapid and continuous testing of the memristive behavior.</p>
<p>The measurements were transmitted over a serial communication interface at a baud rate of 57,600 and were captured as raw text files for analysis. The data were post-processed and visualized using a custom Python script based on the matplotlib library, enabling clear identification of memory retention patterns and resistance state changes across successive cycles.</p>
</div>

<div id="section6"><h3>Hypothesis</h3>
<p>The general testing setup, based on that used in the literature, is able to indicate memristive behavior in fungal samples. If present, this behavior would manifest as a characteristic pinched hysteresis loop in the I–V curves, typically intersecting at or near the origin––a well-established signature of memristive systems [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref006">6</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref007">7</a>]. We hypothesized that such a response would emerge under specific combinations of voltage amplitude and input frequency. Where memristive behavior was indicated, volatile memory tests were conducted.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section3"><h2>Results</h2>
<div id="section1"><h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The fungal memristors were tested across a range of voltages, waveforms, and frequencies. Below, we first detail the test inputs used to explore the memristive properties and generate I–V curves. Then we present the voltage and frequency (graphical) test results, followed by the volatile memory test results. Each figure represents the averaged, smoothed results across the samples.</p>
</div>

<div id="section2"><h3>Voltage testing</h3>
<p>The first five tests were conducted to determine which voltage amplitude produced the most favorable memristive response. These initial trials revealed that a 1 V<sub>pp</sub> signal yielded the most consistent and measurable results. As outlined in the Methods section, the first four of these tests were performed using a square wave input.</p>
</div>

<div id="section3"><h3>Frequency testing</h3>
<p>After identifying 1 V<sub>pp</sub> as the optimal input voltage during the initial square wave tests (Tests 1–4), the waveform was switched to a sine wave for further analysis (Tests 5–10). The aim of this phase was to identify the frequency at which memristive behavior––specifically a pinched hysteresis loop––became apparent.</p>
<p>In Tests 1–5, the voltage amplitude was optimized using square waves. Between Tests 5 and 6, the waveform was changed from square to sine. From Tests 6–10, frequency sweeps were carried out with sine waves to identify memristive crossing. In Test 11, the voltage range was expanded at 10 Hz (5 V<sub>pp</sub>) to enhance the response. This revealed behavior close to that of an ideal memristor. Notably, Test 1 had already shown consistent linear behavior, indicating resistive characteristics. The results are shown in <a href="#pone-0328965-g005">Figs 5</a>–<a href="#pone-0328965-g013">13</a>. <a href="#pone-0328965-g014">Fig 14</a> details a sample noise profile, and <a href="#pone-0328965-g015">Fig 15</a> summarizes memristive accuracy.</p>
<p><a href="#pone-0328965-g005">Figs 5</a>–<a href="#pone-0328965-g010">10</a> show the output of Tests 2–7. The frequency was gradually reduced until a crossing near the origin was first observed, as shown in <a href="#pone-0328965-g010">Fig 10</a>. To ensure this result was not an outlier caused by overshooting the ideal frequency, the test was repeated at a slightly higher frequency (50 Hz, Test 8, shown in <a href="#pone-0328965-g011">Fig 11</a>). This confirmed that the optimal response occurred below 25 Hz.</p>
<p>As summarized in <a href="#pone-0328965-t002">Table 2</a>, the frequency was decreased to 10 Hz (Test 9, shown in <a href="#pone-0328965-g012">Fig 12</a>), which produced a clear crossing in the I–V curve near the −0.4 V region. To enhance the visibility of this behavior, the voltage was increased to 5 V<sub>pp</sub>, which resulted in a more pronounced memristive signature (Test 10). <a href="#pone-0328965-g013">Fig 13</a> illustrates this result, displaying a nearly ideal pinched hysteresis loop indicative of memristor functionality. The highest accuracy, at 95%, was at a 10 Hz sine wave at 1 V. <a href="#pone-0328965-g014">Fig 14</a> details the noise from an individual sample. <a href="#pone-0328965-g015">Fig 15</a> details the average memristive accuracy of each configuration.</p>
</div>

<div id="section4"><h3>Volatile memory experiment</h3>
<p>For the volatile memory tests 1 and 2, single read and write operations were performed across the memristor voltage divider. For volatile memory test 3, continuous read and write operations were performed across the memristor voltage divider while the frequency was gradually increased. The primary results are summarized in <a href="#pone-0328965-t003">Table 3</a>. The results are displayed in <a href="#pone-0328965-g016">Figs 16</a>–<a href="#pone-0328965-g020">20</a>. Averaged nemristive accuracy is displayed in <a href="#pone-0328965-g021">Fig 21</a>.</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section4"><h2>Discussion</h2>
<div id="section1"><h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Using low-cost materials, shiitake mushrooms were cultured into ideal memristors. Ideal and non-ideal memristive properties have been observed previously in fungi, but these required far more complex interfacing methods [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref026">26</a>]. Although several techniques have been proposed to preserve fungal samples, we obtained experimental validation that dehydration can preserve the observed properties in a previously “programmed” sample [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref027">27</a>]. Ideal memristor properties are observed at lower frequencies, but potential latencies can be offset through massive parallelization, as in nature [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref026">26</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref028">28</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref029">29</a>]. As known from previous works on fungal memristors, the mycelial structure contains capacitive, memfractive, and memristive proteins [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref025">25</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref026">26</a>]. In the memristive tests, accuracy decreased as the frequency increased. The observed rapid switching speed of 5,850 Hz, an accuracy of 90% (± 1%) low energy consumption relative to prior conventional systems, light weight, and radiation resistance all make fungal memristors attractive for edge computing, aerospace, and embedded firmware applications [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref025">25</a>–<a href="#pone.0328965.ref027">27</a>]. Unlike expensive conventional memristors, culturing fungal memristors does not require large facilities or rare minerals. The process can be scaled to grow large systems, which can be programmed and preserved for long-term use at low cost.</p>
</div>

<div id="section2"><h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>Our study was limited by the relatively short timescale of less than two months. Other researchers have documented memristive properties in mycelial materials, but their studies also focused on short-term performance [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref026">26</a>]. Another limitation was that only single, relatively bulky samples were prepared. To truly compete with conventional devices at the microscale and below, memristors will need to be far smaller [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref007">7</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref008">8</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref011">11</a>]. Even in the same growth medium, each sample produced a vastly different culture, and the outcomes have yet to be fully characterized by electrical properties. However, the development of these devices is in an early stage, and they could eventually be miniaturized, especially using improved cultivation techniques. Complications associated with the growth media were not explored, although previous research has found that fungi are quite robust to varying conditions [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref026">26</a>].</p>
</div>

<div id="section3"><h3>Future work</h3>
<p>Although fungal memristors can be produced at low cost, certain aspects of the process could be further optimized. First, consistent cultivation techniques could be improved using three-dimensional (3D)-printed templates and structures that shape the shiitake mushroom into the desired geometry. Second, programming could be facilitated by adding electrical contacts into a 3D-printed cultivation structure. Finally, long-term use would necessitate preservation, which could involve a variety of techniques, including dehydration, desiccation, freeze-drying, certain hydrogels, and special coatings [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref027">27</a>]. By testing devices produced to physical stress conditions, a combination of these techniques could enable the development of fast, radiation-resistant, and low-energy memristors grown from low-cost organic materials. The future of computing could be fungal.</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section5"><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>Currently, the fabrication of semiconductor memristors requires rare-earth minerals and large facilities, and culturing delicate neural organoids requires a complex chemical environment to be maintained in a bioreactor. Fungal computing may provide a robust and accessible alternative. Fungal systems have lower power requirements, lighter weights, faster switching speeds, and lower industrial overheads than conventional devices. In this study, fungal memristors were fabricated, programmed, and tested using shiitake mushrooms and conventional electronics. Dehydration-based preservation was successfully explored, demonstrating the robustness of our devices. When used as RAM, our mushroom memristor was able to operate at up to 5,850 Hz at an accuracy of 90 ± 1%. In addition, shiitake mushrooms are biodegradable and have demonstrated radiation resistance, suggesting that the potential applications of fungal computing range from sustainable computing devices to aerospace technologies.</p>

            <p>Nearly everyone has experienced it: After a night of poor sleep, you don’t feel as alert as you should. Your brain might seem foggy, and your mind drifts off when you should be paying attention.</p><p>A new study from MIT reveals what happens inside the brain as these momentary failures of attention occur. The scientists found that during these lapses, a wave of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flows out of the brain — a process that typically occurs during sleep and helps to wash away waste products that have built up during the day. This flushing is believed to be necessary for maintaining a healthy, normally functioning brain.</p><p>When a person is sleep-deprived, it appears that their body attempts to catch up on this cleansing process by initiating pulses of CSF flow. However, this comes at a cost of dramatically impaired attention.</p><p>“If you don’t sleep, the CSF waves start to intrude into wakefulness where normally you wouldn’t see them. However, they come with an attentional tradeoff, where attention fails during the moments that you have this wave of fluid flow,” says Laura Lewis, the Athinoula A. Martinos Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, a member of MIT’s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science and the Research Laboratory of Electronics, and an associate member of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory.</p><p>Lewis is the senior author of the study, which <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02098-8" target="_blank">appears today</a> in <em>Nature Neuroscience</em>. MIT visiting graduate student Zinong Yang&nbsp;is the lead author of the paper.</p><p><strong>Flushing the brain</strong></p><p>Although sleep is a critical biological process, it’s not known exactly why it is so important. It appears to be essential for maintaining alertness, and it has been well-documented that sleep deprivation leads to impairments of attention and other cognitive functions.</p><p>During sleep, the cerebrospinal fluid that cushions the brain helps to remove waste that has built up during the day. In a 2019&nbsp;<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax5440" target="_blank">study</a>, Lewis and colleagues showed that CSF flow during sleep follows a rhythmic pattern in and out of the brain, and that these flows are linked to changes in brain waves during sleep.</p><p>That finding led Lewis to wonder what might happen to CSF flow after sleep deprivation. To explore that question, she and her colleagues recruited 26 volunteers who were tested twice — once following a night of sleep deprivation in the lab, and once when they were well-rested.</p><p>In the morning, the researchers monitored several different measures of brain and body function as the participants performed a task that is commonly used to evaluate the effects of sleep deprivation.</p><p>During the task, each participant wore an electroencephalogram (EEG) cap that could record brain waves while they were also in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner. The researchers used a modified version of fMRI that allowed them to measure not only blood oxygenation in the brain, but also the flow of CSF in and out of the brain. They also measured each subject’s heart rate, breathing rate, and pupil diameter.</p><p>The participants performed two attentional tasks while in the fMRI scanner, one visual and one auditory. For the visual task, they had to look at a screen that had a fixed cross. At random intervals, the cross would turn into a square, and the participants were told to press a button whenever they saw this happen. For the auditory task, they would hear a beep instead of seeing a visual transformation.</p><p>Sleep-deprived participants performed much worse than well-rested participants on these tasks, as expected. Their response times were slower, and for some of the stimuli, the participants never registered the change at all.</p><p>During these momentary lapses of attention, the researchers identified several physiological changes that occurred at the same time. Most significantly, they found a flux of CSF out of the brain just as those lapses occurred. After each lapse, CSF flowed back into the brain.</p><p>“The results are suggesting that at the moment that attention fails, this fluid is actually being expelled outward away from the brain. And when attention recovers, it’s drawn back in,” Lewis says.</p><p>The researchers hypothesize that when the brain is sleep-deprived, it begins to compensate for the loss of the cleansing that normally occurs during sleep, even though these pulses of CSF flow&nbsp;come with the cost of attention loss.</p><p>“One way to think about those events is because your brain is so in need of sleep, it tries its best to enter into a sleep-like state to restore some cognitive functions,” Yang says. “Your brain’s fluid system is trying to restore function by pushing the brain to iterate between high-attention and high-flow states.”</p><p><strong>A unified circuit</strong></p><p>The researchers also found several other physiological events linked to attentional lapses, including decreases in breathing and heart rate, along with constriction of the pupils. They found that pupil constriction began about 12 seconds before CSF flowed out of the brain, and pupils dilated again after the attentional lapse.</p><p>“What’s interesting is it seems like this isn’t just a phenomenon in the brain, it’s also a body-wide event. It suggests that there’s a tight coordination of these systems, where when your attention fails, you might feel it perceptually and psychologically, but it’s also reflecting an event that’s happening throughout the brain and body,” Lewis says.</p><p>This close linkage between disparate events may indicate that there is a single circuit that controls both attention and bodily functions such as fluid flow, heart rate, and arousal, according to the researchers.</p><p>“These results suggest to us that there’s a unified circuit that’s governing both what we think of as very high-level functions of the brain — our attention, our ability to perceive and respond to the world — and then also really basic fundamental physiological processes like fluid dynamics of the brain, brain-wide blood flow, and blood vessel constriction,” Lewis says.</p><p>In this study, the researchers did not explore what circuit might be controlling this switching, but one good candidate, they say, is the noradrenergic system. Recent research has shown that this system, which regulates many cognitive and bodily functions through the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, oscillates during normal sleep.</p><p>The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Research Fellowship, a NAWA Fellowship, a McKnight Scholar Award, a Sloan Fellowship, a Pew Biomedical Scholar Award, a One Mind Rising Star Award, and the Simons Collaboration on Plasticity in the Aging Brain.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Did you know that most modern passports are actually embedded devices containing an entire filesystem, access controls, and support for several cryptographic protocols? Such passports display a small symbol indicating an electronic machine-readable travel document (eMRTD), which digitally stores the same personal data printed in traditional passport booklets in its embedded filesystem. Beyond allowing travelers in some countries to skip a chat at border control, these documents use cryptography to prevent unauthorized reading, eavesdropping, forgery, and copying.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.trailofbits.com/img/passports_figure_1.png" alt="Image showing the Chip Inside symbol"><figcaption>Figure 1: Chip Inside symbol (ICAO Doc 9303 Part 9)</figcaption></figure><p>This blog post describes how electronic passports work, the threats within their threat model, and how they protect against those threats using cryptography. It also discusses the implications of using electronic passports for novel applications, such as zero-knowledge identity proofs. Like many widely used electronic devices with long lifetimes, electronic passports and the systems interacting with them support insecure, legacy protocols that put passport holders at risk for both standard and novel use cases.</p><h2 id="electronic-passport-basics">Electronic passport basics</h2><p>A passport serves as official identity documentation, primarily for international travel. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines the standards for electronic passports, which (as suggested by the “Chip Inside” symbol) contain a contactless integrated circuit (IC) storing digital information. Essentially, the chip contains a filesystem with some access control to protect unauthorized reading of data. The full technical details of electronic passports are specified in <a href="https://www.icao.int/publications/doc-series/doc-9303">ICAO Doc 9303</a>; this blog post will mostly focus on part 10, which specifies the logical data structure (LDS), and part 11, which specifies the security mechanisms.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.trailofbits.com/img/passports_figure_2.png" alt="Flowchart showning electronic passport logical data structure"><figcaption>Figure 2: Electronic passport logical data structure (ICAO Doc 9303 Part 10)</figcaption></figure><p>The filesystem architecture is straightforward, comprising three file types: master files (MFs) serving as the root directory; dedicated files (DFs) functioning as subdirectories or applications; and elementary files (EFs) containing actual binary data. As shown in the above figure, some files are mandatory, whereas others are optional. This blog post will focus on the eMRTD application. The other applications are part of LDS 2.0, which would allow the digital storage of travel records (digital stamps!), electronic visas, and additional biometrics (so you can just update your picture instead of getting a whole new passport!).</p><h3 id="how-the-emrtd-application-works">How the eMRTD application works</h3><p>The following figure shows the types of files the eMRTD contains:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.trailofbits.com/img/passports_figure_3.png" alt="Image showing the contents of the eMRTD application"><figcaption>Figure 3: Contents of the eMRTD application (ICAO Doc 9303 Part 10)</figcaption></figure><p>There are generic files containing common or security-related data; all other files are so-called data groups (DGs), which primarily contain personal information (most of which is also printed on your passport) and some additional security data that will become important later. All electronic passports must contain DGs 1 and 2, whereas the rest is optional.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.trailofbits.com/img/passports_figure_4.png" alt="Image showing DGs in the LDS"><figcaption>Figure 4: DGs in the LDS (ICAO Doc 9303 Part 10, seventh edition)</figcaption></figure><p>Comparing the contents of DG1 and DG2 to the main passport page shows that most of the written data is stored in DG1 and the photo is stored in DG2. Additionally, there are two lines of characters at the bottom of the page called the machine readable zone (MRZ), which contains another copy of the DG1 data with some check digits, as shown in the following picture.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.trailofbits.com/img/passports_figure_5.png" alt="Image showing an example passport with MRZ"><figcaption>Figure 5: Example passport with MRZ (ICAO Doc 9303 Part 3)</figcaption></figure><h2 id="digging-into-the-threat-model">Digging into the threat model</h2><p>Electronic passports operate under a straightforward threat model that categorizes attackers based on physical access: those who hold a passport versus those who don’t. If you are near a passport but you do not hold it in your possession, you should not be able to do any of the following:</p><ul><li>Read any personal information from that passport</li><li>Eavesdrop on communication that the passport has with legitimate terminals</li><li>Figure out whether it is a specific passport so you can trace its movements<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></li></ul><p>Even if you do hold one or more passports, you should not be able to do the following:</p><ul><li>Forge a new passport with inauthentic data</li><li>Make a digital copy of the passport</li><li>Read the fingerprint (DG3) or iris (DG4) information<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></li></ul><p>Electronic passports use short-range RFID for communication (ISO 14443). You can communicate with a passport within a distance of 10–15 centimeters, but eavesdropping is possible at distances of several meters<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Because electronic passports are embedded devices, they need to be able to withstand attacks where the attacker has physical access to the device, such as elaborate side-channel and fault injection attacks. As a result, they are often certified (e.g., under Common Criteria).</p><p>We focus here on the threats against the electronic components of the passport. Passports have many physical countermeasures, such as visual effects that become visible under certain types of light. Even if someone can break the electronic security that prevents copying passports, they would still have to defeat these physical measures to make a full copy of the passport. That said, some systems (such as online systems) only interact digitally with the passport, so they do not perform any physical checks at all.</p><h2 id="cryptographic-mechanisms">Cryptographic mechanisms</h2><p>The earliest electronic passports lacked most cryptographic mechanisms. Malaysia issued the first electronic passport in 1998, which predates the first ICAO eMRTD specifications from 2003. Belgium subsequently issued the first ICAO-compliant eMRTD in 2004, which in turn predates the first cryptographic mechanism for confidentiality specified in 2005.</p><p>While we could focus solely on the most advanced cryptographic implementations, electronic passports remain in circulation for extended periods (typically 5–10 years), meaning legacy systems continue operating alongside modern solutions. This means that there are typically many old passports floating around that do not support the latest and greatest access control mechanisms<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. Similarly, not all inspection systems/terminals support all of the protocols, which means passports potentially need to support multiple protocols. All protocols discussed in the following are described in more detail in ICAO Doc 9303 Part 11.</p><h3 id="legacy-cryptography">Legacy cryptography</h3><p>Legacy protection mechanisms for electronic passports provide better security than what they were replacing (nothing), even though they have key shortcomings regarding confidentiality and (to a lesser extent) copying.</p><h4 id="legacy-confidentiality-protections-how-basic-access-control-fails">Legacy confidentiality protections: How basic access control fails</h4><p>In order to prevent eavesdropping, you need to set up a secure channel. Typically, this is done by deriving a shared symmetric key, either from some shared knowledge, or through a key exchange. However, the passport cannot have its own static public key and send it over the communication channel, because this would enable tracing of specific passports.</p><p>Additionally, it should only be possible to set up this secure channel if you have the passport in your possession. So, what sets holders apart from others? Holders can read the physical passport page that contains the MRZ!</p><p>This brings us to the original solution to set up a secure channel with electronic passports: basic access control (BAC). When you place your passport with the photo page face down into an inspection system at the airport, it scans the page and reads the MRZ. Now, both sides derive encryption and message authentication code (MAC) keys from parts of the MRZ data using SHA-1 as a KDF. Then, they exchange freshly generated challenges and encrypt-then-MAC these challenges together with some fresh keying material to prove that both sides know the key. Finally, they derive session keys from the keying material and use them to set up the secure channel.</p><p>However, BAC fails to achieve any of its security objectives. The static MRZ is just some personal data and does not have very high entropy, which makes it guessable. Even worse, if you capture one valid exchange between passport and terminal, you can brute-force the MRZ offline by computing a bunch of unhardened hashes. Moreover, passive listeners who know the MRZ can decrypt all communications with the passport. Finally, the fact that the passport has to check both the MAC and the challenge has opened up the potential for <a href="https://www.ifca.ai/pub/fc10/17_43.pdf">oracle attacks that allow tracing</a> by replaying valid terminal responses.</p><h4 id="forgery-prevention-got-it-right-the-first-time">Forgery prevention: Got it right the first time</h4><p>Preventing forgery is relatively simple. The passport contains a file called the Document Security Object (EF.SOD), which contains a list of hashes of all the Data Groups, and a signature over all these hashes. This signature comes from a key pair that has a certificate chain back to the Country Signing Certificate Authority (CSCA). The private key associated with the CSCA certificate is one of the most valuable assets in this system, because anyone in possession of this private key<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> can issue legitimate passports containing arbitrary data.</p><p>The process of reading the passport, comparing all contents to the SOD, and verifying the signature and certificate chain is called passive authentication (PA). This will prove that the data in the passport was signed by the issuing country. However, it does nothing to prevent the copying of existing passports: anyone who can read a passport can copy its data into a new chip and it will pass PA. While this mechanism is listed among the legacy ones, it meets all of its objectives and is therefore still used without changes.</p><h4 id="legacy-copying-protections-they-work-but-some-issues-remain">Legacy copying protections: They work, but some issues remain</h4><p>Preventing copying requires having something in the passport that cannot be read or extracted, like the private key of a key pair. But how does a terminal know that a key pair belongs to a genuine passport? Since countries are already signing the contents of the passport for PA, they can just put the public key in one of the data groups (DG15), and use the private key to sign challenges that the terminal sends. This is called active authentication (AA). After performing both PA and AA, the terminal knows that the data in the passport (including the AA public key) was signed by the government and that the passport contains the corresponding private key.</p><p>This solution has two issues: the AA signature is not tied to the secure channel, so you can relay a signature and pretend that the passport is somewhere it’s not. Additionally, the passport signs an arbitrary challenge without knowing the semantics of this message, which is generally considered a dangerous practice in cryptography<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p><h3 id="modern-enhancements">Modern enhancements</h3><p>Extended Access Control (EAC) fixes some of the issues related to BAC and AA. It comprises chip authentication (CA), which is a better AA, and terminal authentication (TA), which authenticates the terminal to the passport in order to protect access to the sensitive information stored in DG3 (fingerprint) and DG4 (iris). Finally, password authenticated connection establishment (PACE<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>, described below) replaces BAC altogether, eliminating its weaknesses.</p><h4 id="chip-authentication-upgrading-the-secure-channel">Chip Authentication: Upgrading the secure channel</h4><p>CA is very similar to AA in the sense that it requires countries to simply store a public key in one of the DGs (DG14), which is then authenticated using PA. However, instead of signing a challenge, the passport uses the key pair to perform a static-ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange with the terminal, and uses the resulting keys to upgrade the secure channel from BAC. This means that passive listeners that know the MRZ cannot eavesdrop after doing CA, because they were not part of the key exchange.</p><h4 id="terminal-authentication-protecting-sensitive-data-in-dg3-and-dg4">Terminal Authentication: Protecting sensitive data in DG3 and DG4</h4><p>Similar to the CSCA for signing things, each country has a Country Verification Certificate Authority (CVCA), which creates a root certificate for a PKI that authorizes terminals to read DG3 and DG4 in the passports of that country. Terminals provide a certificate chain for their public key and sign a challenge provided by the passport using their private key. The CVCA can authorize document verifiers (DVs) to read one or both of DG3 and DG4, which is encoded in the certificate. The DV then issues certificates to individual terminals. Without such a certificate, it is not possible to access the sensitive data in DG3 and DG4.</p><h4 id="password-authenticated-connection-establishment-fixing-the-basic-problems">Password Authenticated Connection Establishment: Fixing the basic problems</h4><p>The main idea behind PACE is that the MRZ, much like a password, does not have sufficient entropy to protect the data it contains. Therefore, it should not be used directly to derive keys, because this would enable offline brute-force attacks. PACE can work with various mappings, but we describe only the simplest one in the following, which is the generic mapping. Likewise, PACE can work with other passwords besides the MRZ (such as a PIN), but this blog post focuses on the MRZ.</p><p>First, both sides use the MRZ data (the password) to derive<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> a password key. Next, the passport encrypts<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> a nonce using the password key and sends it to the terminal, which can decrypt it if it knows the password. The terminal and passport also perform an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Now, both terminal and passport derive a new generator of the elliptic curve by applying the nonce as an additive tweak to the (EC)DH shared secret<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. Using this new generator, the terminal and passport perform another (EC)DH to get a second shared secret. Finally, they use this second shared secret to derive session keys, which are used to authenticate the (EC)DH public keys that they used earlier on in the protocol, and to set up the secure channel. Figure 6 shows a simplified protocol diagram.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.trailofbits.com/img/passports_figure_6.png" alt="Simplified protocol diagram for PACE"><figcaption>Figure 6: Simplified protocol diagram for PACE</figcaption></figure><p>Anyone who does not know the password cannot follow the protocol to the end, which will become apparent in the final step when they need to authenticate the data with the session keys. Before authenticating the terminal, the passport does not share any data that enables brute-forcing the password key. Non-participants who do know the password cannot derive the session keys because they do not know the ECDH private keys.</p><h2 id="gaps-in-the-threat-model-why-you-shouldnt-give-your-passport-to-just-anyone">Gaps in the threat model: Why you shouldn’t give your passport to just anyone</h2><p>When considering potential solutions to maintaining passports’ confidentiality and authenticity, it’s important to account for what the inspection system <em>does</em> with your passport, and not just the fancy cryptography the passport supports. If an inspection system performs only BAC/PACE and PA, anyone who has seen your passport could make an electronic copy and pretend to be you when interacting with this system. This is true even if your passport supports AA or CA.</p><p>Another important factor is tracing: the specifications aim to ensure that someone who does not know a passport’s PACE password (MRZ data in most cases) cannot trace that passport’s movements by interacting with it or eavesdropping on communications it has with legitimate terminals. They attempt to achieve this by ensuring that passports always provide random identifiers (e.g., as part of Type A or Type B ISO 14443 contactless communication protocols) and that the contents of publicly accessible files (e.g., those containing information necessary for performing PACE) are the same for every citizen of a particular country.</p><p>However, all of these protections go out of the window when the attacker knows the password. If you are entering another country and border control scans your passport, they can provide your passport contents to others, enabling them to track the movements of your passport. If you <a href="https://cert-agid.gov.it/news/in-vendita-documenti-di-identita-trafugati-da-hotel-italiani/">visit a hotel in Italy and they store a scan of your passport and get hacked</a>, anyone with access to this information can track your passport. This method can be a bit onerous, as it requires contacting various nearby contactless communication devices and trying to authenticate to them as if they were your passport. However, some may still choose to include it in their threat models.</p><p>Some countries state in their issued passports that the holder should give it to someone else only if there is a statutory need. At Italian hotels, for example, it is sufficient to provide a prepared copy of the passport’s photo page with most data redacted (such as your photo, signature, and any personal identification numbers). In practice, not many people do this.</p><p>Even without the passport, the threat model says nothing about tracking particular groups of people. Countries typically buy large quantities of the same electronic passports, which comprise a combination of an IC and the embedded software implementing the passport specifications. This means that people from the same country likely have the same model of passport, with a unique fingerprint comprising characteristics like communication time, execution time<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>, supported protocols (ISO 14443 Type A vs Type B), etc. Furthermore, each country may use different parameters for PACE (supported curves or mappings, etc.), which may aid an attacker in fingerprinting different types of passports, as these parameters are stored in publicly readable files.</p><h2 id="security-and-privacy-implications-of-zero-knowledge-identity-proofs">Security and privacy implications of zero-knowledge identity proofs</h2><p>An emerging approach in both academic research and industry applications involves using zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs with identity documents, enabling verification of specific identity attributes without revealing complete document contents. This is a nice idea in theory, because this will allow proper use of passports where there is no statutory need to hand over your passport. However, there are security implications.</p><p>First of all, passports cannot generate ZK proofs by themselves, so this necessarily involves exposing your passport to a prover. Letting anyone or anything read your passport means that you downgrade your threat model with respect to that entity. So when you provide your passport to an app or website for the purposes of creating a ZK proof, you need to consider what they will do with the information in your passport. Will it be processed locally on your device, or will it be sent to a server? If the data leaves your device, will it be encrypted and only handled inside a trusted execution environment (TEE)? If so, has this whole stack been audited, including against malicious TEE operators?</p><p>Second, if the ZK proving service relies on PA for its proofs, then anyone who has ever seen your passport can pretend to be you on this service. Full security requires AA or CA. As long as there exists any service that relies only on PA, anyone whose passport data is exposed is vulnerable to impersonation. Even if the ZK proving service does not incorporate AA or CA in their proofs, they should still perform one of these procedures with the passport to ensure that only legitimate passports sign up for this service<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>.</p><p>Finally, the system needs to consider what happens when people share their ZK proof with others. The nice thing about a passport is that you cannot easily make copies (if AA or CA is used), but if I can allow others to use my ZK proof, then the value of the identification decreases.</p><p>It is important that such systems are audited for security, both from the point of view of the user and the service provider.

            <span>Abstract:</span>Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in reasoning tasks. However, recent studies show that transformers and LLMs fail catastrophically once reasoning problems exceed modest complexity. We revisit these findings through the lens of large reasoning models (LRMs) -- LLMs fine-tuned with incentives for step-by-step argumentation and self-verification. LRM performance on graph and reasoning benchmarks such as NLGraph seem extraordinary, with some even claiming they are capable of generalized reasoning and innovation in reasoning-intensive fields such as mathematics, physics, medicine, and law. However, by more carefully scaling the complexity of reasoning problems, we show existing benchmarks actually have limited complexity. We develop a new dataset, the Deep Reasoning Dataset (DeepRD), along with a generative process for producing unlimited examples of scalable complexity. We use this dataset to evaluate model performance on graph connectivity and natural language proof planning. We find that the performance of LRMs drop abruptly at sufficient complexity and do not generalize. We also relate our LRM results to the distributions of the complexities of large, real-world knowledge graphs, interaction graphs, and proof datasets. We find the majority of real-world examples fall inside the LRMs' success regime, yet the long tails expose substantial failure potential. Our analysis highlights the near-term utility of LRMs while underscoring the need for new methods that generalize beyond the complexity of examples in the training distribution.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><figure data-testid="cne-audio-embed-figure"></figure><p>Last week, as <em>ICE</em> raids ramped up in New York, city residents set about resisting in the ways they had available: confronting agents directly on sidewalks, haranguing them as they processed down blocks, and recording them on phone cameras held aloft. Relentless <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/08/11/ices-spectacle-of-intimidation">documentation</a> has proved something of an effective tool against President Donald Trump’s empowerment of <em>ICE</em>; agents have taken to wearing masks in fear of exposure, and the proliferation of imagery showing armed police and mobilized National Guard troops in otherwise calm cities has underlined the cruel absurdity of their activities. Activist memes have been minted on social media: a woman on New York’s Canal Street, dressed in a polka-dotted office-casual dress, flipping <em>ICE</em> agents off; a man in Washington, D.C., throwing a Subway sandwich at a federal agent in August. The recent “No Kings” marches were filled with protesters in inflatable frog costumes, inspired by a similarly outfitted man who got pepper-sprayed protesting outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Building in Portland, Oregon. Some might write the memes off as resistance porn, but digital content is at least serving as a lively defense mechanism in the absence of functional politics.</p><p>At the same time, social media has served as a reinvigorated source of transparency in recent weeks, harking back to the days when Twitter became an organizing tool during the Arab Spring, in the early twenty-tens, or when Facebook and Instagram helped fuel the Black Lives Matter marches of 2020. The grassroots optimism of that earlier social-media era is long gone, though, replaced by a sense of posting as a last resort. After Trump authorized the deployment of the National Guard <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/the-conflict-on-the-streets-of-chicago">in Chicago</a> earlier this month, the governor of Illinois, J.&nbsp;B. Pritzker, told residents to “record and narrate what you see—put it on social media.” But, if the anti-<em>MAGA</em> opposition is taking advantage of the internet, <em>ICE</em> and the Trump Administration are, too. Right-wing creators have been using the same channels to identify and publicize targets for raids. According to reporting in Semafor, the Trump-friendly YouTuber Nick Shirley’s videos of African migrant vendors on Canal Street seemed to help drive recent <em>ICE</em> sweeps of the area. <em>ICE</em> itself is also working to monitor social media. The investigative outlet <em>The Lever</em> found documents revealing that the agency has enlisted an A.I.-driven surveillance product called Zignal Labs that creates “curated detection feeds” to aid in criminal investigations. According to reporting in <em>Wired</em>, <em>ICE</em> also has plans to build out a team of dozens of analysts to monitor social media and identify targets. Recent videos, identified by 404 Media and other publications, have purportedly shown <em>ICE</em> agents using technology developed by the data-analytics firm Palantir, founded by Peter Thiel and others, to scan social-media accounts, government records, and biometrics data of those they detain. Social media has become a political panopticon in which your posts are a conduit for your politics, and what you post can increasingly be used against you.</p><p>Meanwhile, a new wave of digital tools has emerged to help surveil the surveillants. The apps ICEBlock, Red Dot, and DEICER all allow users to pinpoint where <em>ICE</em> agents are active, forming an online version of a whisper network to alert potential targets. Eyes Up provides a way for users to record and upload footage of abusive law-enforcement activity, building an archive of potential evidence. Its creator is a software developer named Mark (who uses only his first name to separate the project from his professional work); he was inspired to create Eyes Up earlier this year, when he began seeing clips of <em>ICE</em> abductions and harassment circulating on social media and worried about their shelf life. As he put it to me, “They could disappear at any given moment, whether the platforms decide to moderate, whether the individual deletes their account or the post.”</p><p>Ultimately, the app itself was also vulnerable to sudden disappearance. After launching, on September 1st, Eyes Up accumulated thousands of downloads and thousands of minutes of uploaded footage. Then, on October 3rd, Mark received a notice that Apple was removing the app from its store on the grounds that it may “harm a targeted individual or group.” Eyes Up is not alone. ICEBlock and Red Dot have been blocked from both Apple and Google’s app stores, the two largest marketplaces; DEICER, like Eyes Up, was removed by Apple. Pressure on the tech platforms seemed to come from the Trump Administration; after a deadly shooting at an <em>ICE</em> field office in Dallas in late September, the Attorney General, Pam Bondi, said in a statement to Fox News Digital that ICEBlock “put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs.” Mark is contesting Apple’s decision about Eyes Up through its official channels, and the creator of ICEBlock, Joshua Aaron, has argued that his app should be treated no differently than services, such as Google’s Waze, that allow users to warn one another of highway speed traps. But for now they must try to make do with a limited reach.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The politicized removal of these tools reflects an irony—<em>ICE</em> is aggrieved that its own tactics have been turned against it. Mark described a “double standard”: applications of technology that are friendly to the Administration’s goals are going unchallenged, in part because tech companies have become increasingly willing to support the President’s whims. “It’s clear whose rules they’re following, who they are trying to win over,” Mark said. Like other forms of self expression, digital-communication technology has become dangerously circumscribed under Trump; only the tools that exist independent of Big Tech seem like safe bets for dissent. Posting clips of the polka-dotted-dress lady on social media might be cathartic, but it will take the resistance only so far.</p><p>Still, we record and we post because it’s better than the alternative, which is suffering governmental predations in silence. This past weekend, a friend of mine in Washington, D.C., where I live, sent a photo she had taken of armed National Guard members patrolling the Sunday-morning farmers’ market in Dupont Circle. Trump’s militarized policing has operated on and off in the city <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/08/25/trump-sends-in-the-national-guard">since August</a>, when the Administration seized control of the local police force, and residents have become all too accustomed to seeing camouflaged troops intrude on our daily routines. Most often, I encounter them walking through largely empty residential streets in the middle of the afternoon, and I take photos with my phone to mark the ominous superfluity of the exercise: our President’s extreme and dangerous response to a nonexistent emergency. Sharing footage is a small reminder that this is really happening.&nbsp;♦</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">Quibbler is a critic for your coding agent. It runs in the background and critiques your coding agent's actions, either via hooks or an MCP. When your coding agent is once again failing in the same ways, or ignoring your spec, instead of having to prompt it, the Quibbler agent will automatically observe and correct it.</p>
<p dir="auto">It will also learn rules from your usage, and then enforce them so you don't have to.</p>

<p dir="auto">Kimi Linear is a hybrid linear attention architecture that outperforms traditional full attention methods across various contexts, including short, long, and reinforcement learning (RL) scaling regimes.
At it's core is Kimi Delta Attention (KDA)—a refined version of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06464" rel="nofollow">Gated DeltaNet</a> that introduces a more efficient gating mechanism to optimize the use of finite-state RNN memory.</p>
<p dir="auto">Kimi Linear achieves superior performance and hardware efficiency, especially for long-context tasks. It reduces the need for large KV caches by up to 75% and boosts decoding throughput by up to <math-renderer data-run-id="f25158f9fd31eccbf36457b4050ca2f6">$6\times$</math-renderer> for context as long as 1M tokens.</p>
<p dir="auto">We open-sourced the KDA kernel in <a href="https://github.com/fla-org/flash-linear-attention/tree/main/fla/ops/kda">FLA</a>, and released two versions model checkpoints trained with 5.7T tokens.</p>
