<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><article><div><p><span><p><span>The first time I spoke to Alexa, it felt like the future had arrived. I walked into the room, asked Alexa to play “A Sky Full of Stars,” and it just worked. As a product maker, it struck me that this was technology at its best—doing what the customer wants effortlessly, intuitively, and naturally—and I wanted all the technology in my life to work that way. With 600 million Alexa devices now out in the world, the latest advancements in generative AI have unlocked new possibilities—enabling us to reimagine the experience in our pursuit of making customers’ lives better and easier every day.</span></p></span></p></div><div><p><span><p><span>Today, we’re excited to introduce Alexa+, our next-generation assistant powered by generative AI. Alexa+ is more conversational, smarter, personalized—and she helps you get things done. She keeps you entertained, helps you learn, keeps you organized, summarizes complex topics, and can converse about virtually anything. Alexa+ can manage and protect your home, make reservations, and help you track, discover, and enjoy new artists. She can also help you search, find or buy virtually any item online, and make useful suggestions based on your interests. Alexa+ does all this and more—all you have to do is ask.</span></p></span></p></div><div><p><img alt="Echo Show conversation in motion." height="743" role="" src="https://assets.aboutamazon.com/dims4/default/3940e98/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1600x900+0+0/resize/1320x743!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon-blogs-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8e%2Ff6%2Fb6c5d6d943eea6091686d78a069a%2Finline001-aboutamazon-alexa-alexa-conversational-cx-hiking-reccomendations-1-1600x900.GIF" width="1320"><span></span></p></div><div><p><h2>Alexa+ is easy to talk to.</h2></p></div><div><p><span><p><span>Conversations with Alexa+ feel expansive and natural. Whether you’re speaking in half-formed thoughts, using colloquial expressions, or exploring complex ideas, Alexa+ understands what you mean, and responds like a trusted assistant. It feels less like interacting with technology, and more like engaging with an insightful friend.</span><br></p></span></p></div><div><p><h2>Alexa+ turns talk into action.</h2></p></div><div><p><span><p><span>At the foundation of Alexa’s state-of-the-art architecture are powerful large language models (LLMs) available on Amazon Bedrock, but that’s just the start. Alexa+ is designed to take action, and is able to orchestrate across tens of thousands of services and devices—which, to our knowledge, has never been done at this scale. To achieve this, we created a concept called “experts”—groups of systems, capabilities, APIs, and instructions that accomplish specific types of tasks for customers.</span></p></span></p></div><div><p><span><p><span>With these experts, Alexa+ can control your smart home with products from Philips Hue, Roborock, and more; make reservations or appointments with OpenTable and Vagaro; explore discographies and play music from providers including Amazon Music, Spotify, Apple Music, and iHeartRadio; order groceries from Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market, or delivery from Grubhub and Uber Eats; remind you when tickets go on sale on Ticketmaster; and use Ring to alert you if someone is approaching your house.</span></p></span></p></div><div data-testid="RelatedContent"><p><a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-alexa-tech-generative-artificial-intelligence"><img alt="Alexa partner expert logos" height="200" role="" src="https://assets.aboutamazon.com/dims4/default/2016e23/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1688x1125+0+0/resize/300x200!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon-blogs-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc3%2F06%2F6608b1cd46b7947fc2f8918289e2%2Fartifact-expression-2000x1125.jpg" width="300"></a></p></div><div><p><span><p><span>Alexa+ also introduces agentic capabilities, which will enable Alexa to navigate the internet in a self-directed way to complete tasks on your behalf, behind the scenes. Let’s say you need to get your oven fixed—Alexa+ will be able to navigate the web, use Thumbtack to discover the relevant service provider, authenticate, arrange the repair, and come back to tell you it’s done—there’s no need to supervise or intervene.</span><br></p></span></p></div><div><p><h2>Alexa+ is personalized to you.</h2></p></div><div><p><span><p><span>The new Alexa is highly personalized—and gives you opportunities to personalize further. She knows what you’ve bought, what you’ve listened to, the videos you’ve watched, the address you ship things to, and how you like to pay—but you can also ask her to remember things that will make the experience more useful for you. You can tell her things like family recipes, important dates, facts, dietary preferences, and more—and she can apply that knowledge to take useful action. For example, if you are planning a dinner for the family, Alexa+ can remember that you love pizza, your daughter is vegetarian, and your partner is gluten-free, to suggest a recipe or restaurant.</span></p></span></p></div><div><p><img alt="Echo Show Home screen" height="743" role="" src="https://assets.aboutamazon.com/dims4/default/30a6f49/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1125+0+0/resize/1320x743!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon-blogs-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F65%2F78%2Fa2f287624e9e9c796fafe40e9362%2Falexa-home-screen-smart-home-calendar-widget-ui-3.png" width="1320"><span></span></p></div><div><p><h2>Alexa+ is there when you want it, and fades into the background when you don’t.</h2></p></div><div><p><span><p><span>The new Alexa is like having an assistant available to help any time you want—she’s there when you need her, and disappears when you don’t. Alexa+ is also proactive when it’s important—like suggesting you start your commute early when there’s heavy traffic, or telling you a gift you wanted to buy is on sale.</span><br></p></span></p></div><div><p><h2>Alexa+ manages your home.</h2></p></div><div><p><span><p><span>There are over 600 million Alexa devices out there today, which customers already use to play music, watch videos, and manage their smart homes. All these capabilities are meaningfully better with Alexa+, and come together to create a much smarter and more capable home experience. For example, you could be eating dinner in the kitchen and tell Alexa you want to watch The Boys on your Fire TV in the living room so she can set it up for you there; you can move music to different speakers around your home; and you can use Ring to see if your package has been delivered or if anyone has walked the dog.</span></p></span></p></div><div data-testid="RelatedContent"><p><a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-alexa-top-features"><img alt="Echo Show Calendar Widget on Home" height="200" role="" src="https://assets.aboutamazon.com/dims4/default/bf9a0a0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1688x1125+216+0/resize/300x200!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon-blogs-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe2%2F1a%2F40c5872c47d3add7e3250e6cef32%2Falexa-calendar-widget-home-screen-2000x1125.jpg" width="300"></a></p><div><a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-alexa-top-features"><h2>50 things to try with Alexa+</h2></a><p>Alexa+ is our next-generation AI assistant that gets things done—it solves daily problems, keeps you entertained, helps you stay connected, and can converse about virtually any topic.</p></div></div><div><p><h2>Alexa+ will be available everywhere you are.</h2></p></div><div><p><span><p><span>Alexa is already available in your home, office, and increasingly your car. Customers will also be able to access Alexa+ in a new mobile app (available in the Apple App Store and Google Play store) and a new browser-based experience at Alexa.com. You can start a conversation with Alexa+ on your Echo device, continue on the go with your phone or in the car, and pick it up on your computer—Alexa+ remembers the context, and can continue the conversation across any of your endpoints.</span><br></p></span></p></div><div><p><h2>Alexa+ has deep knowledge.</h2></p></div><div><p><span><p><span>We've infused cutting-edge LLMs with Alexa's vast knowledge base, creating a meaningfully smarter AI assistant that never stops learning. But it’s not just about knowing a lot of things, it’s about deeply understanding and bringing it all together into an accurate and real-time response—and Alexa+ does that, whether you know what you’re looking for (“What is the lowest point in any ocean on earth?”) or just have a half-formed question or idea (“What’s the song that Bradley Cooper sings at the start of that country music movie?”).</span></p></span></p></div><div><p><span><p><span>You can also add to her knowledge by sharing documents, emails, photos, and messages—via a desktop browser, the mobile app, or even via email—for Alexa to remember, summarize, or take action on. For example, you could send a picture of a live music schedule, and have Alexa add the details to your calendar; upload study materials and ask Alexa to turn them into a quiz; or forward emails from the kids’ school to Alexa, then say, “Add all early dismissals to my calendar,” or, “Remind me what days I’m volunteering in the classroom.”</span></p></span></p></div><div><p><img alt="Echo family with Alexa+ experience." height="743" role="" src="https://assets.aboutamazon.com/dims4/default/6943a13/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1600x900+0+0/resize/1320x743!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon-blogs-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F01%2Fa1%2F6ce8f23a4663a2b3673c414aadb2%2Fecho-family-1600x900.jpg" width="1320"><span></span></p></div><div><p><h2>Alexa+ is built with privacy and security in mind.</h2></p></div><div><p><span><p><span>We built Alexa+ the same way we do any Amazon product—we set out to create something we think customers will love, while also designing it to protect their privacy and security, and provide them with the transparency and control they expect from Amazon. For example, we centralize important information such as your interactions with Alexa+ and various settings into the Alexa Privacy dashboard. Built on the secure infrastructure of AWS, Alexa+ brings world-class privacy and security protection to your everyday interactions.</span><br></p></span></p></div><div><p><h2>Alexa+ costs $19.99 per month, but is free for all Prime members.</h2></p></div><div><p><span><p><span>Alexa+ costs $19.99 per month, but all Amazon Prime members will get it for free. Alexa+ is the newest Prime benefit, building on the tremendous value members were already enjoying, including record-fast delivery speeds and free delivery on more than 300 million items—tens of millions which can be delivered the same or next day—exclusive deals and shopping events like Prime Day, entertainment like Prime Video and Amazon Music, as well as savings on groceries, prescription medication, gas, and Grubhub+.

Wishing you guys all the luck in the world!  Email in profile in case you wish to chat.</p><p>For all the naysayers, as a fusion startup, targeting the marine market is a good move.  They aren't even the first fusion startup to do so; IIRC Rostoker's group got their first major funding from the NRL. The marine market pays a premium for not having to refuel, and historically emerging energy technologies have early commercialization in ships.  This was true for fission in the 50s and for photovoltaic solar in the 70s/80s.</p><p>Now, sure, they have to make power to be able to sell it.  But to build a reactor, you have to raise funds, and in order to raise funds you have to show that you can make money if you are successful at making power.  Explicitly aiming at a market that might actually pay for overpriced power shows their investors that there may be a valid business case.  That doesn't make fusion happen any easier, but you don't make any reactions without first building a reactor.</p><p>You know, I'm sure these guys could work somewhere getting paid to get more people to click on stuff.  Instead they are taking a risk to do something that might be important.  Make no mistake: fusion founder is a tough gig.  There is no established off-ramp, and many fusion founders find that it's a job that can easily eat your career. I hope their plan B is in order, as well as their prenups and/or wills.  They are going off to fight a dragon that's eaten a lot of other people's careers, relationships and sanity.</p><p>As an aside, it's nice to see someone working on a tokamak actually not being overly optimistic about wall heat flux. It's like somebody actually paid attention to Stacey or something ;)</p></div></td></tr>

Fission works technically, but not practically. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) could power ships, but licensing fission reactors on land is already brutally hard and expensive—doing it for vessels moving between international ports with enriched uranium is nearly impossible</p><p>What makes you think that licensing a fusion reactor will be easier? Safely handling tritium is fantastically more complicated that the fuel of a fission power plant.</p><p>Also, do you plan on breeding your fuel aboard the ship? If no, how do you plan to produce, store the tritium and refuel the ship? If yes, I'd like to know how you are planning to host the massive chemical plant to purify coolant, recycle unburt fuel, separate isotopes, detriatiate water and refuel that comes with your tokamak.</p></div></td></tr>

Handling Tritium isn't easy but it's much more manageable.</p><p>Tritium breeding: we will have a FLiBe blanket and breed tritium, but we won't be processing and pulling out the Tritium on board, that will happen on land, so at port you drain the Tritiated FLiBe and replace it with Li-6 enriched FLiBe. There's a few companies working on the Tritium fuel cycle technology that are making great progress.</p></div></td></tr>

It's certainly a good idea to find a niche to make market entry easier, but I would guess that reliability requirements are actually higher for ships than for microgrids.  Find some isolated town or island running off flaky diesel generators on shipped-in fuel and negotiate a reasonable SLA.</p><p>This ignores, of course, the bigger problem: making fusion work at all at Q &gt; 1.  If it were me, I'd work on solving that before worrying too much about optimizing market entry.  So far every single fusion effort has failed to clear that hurdle, and any effort on the other parts is wasted if you can't actually make power.</p></div></td></tr>

They'd have a turbine/generator setup driven by the water passing by and use the energy harvested there for filling the tank. Cruise around as long as it takes to nearly fill the tank then return to port (and fill the rest on the way back). There's <i>a lot of</i> oceans where systems like that could cruise around on.

                  <p>Saw that this morning as well, it's awesome. I do think long term especially for grid applications stellarators could be great... note that their design is ~2.7GW I believe. We're talking gigantic traditional power plant size, which the world needs, but the first generation of these facilities will cost multi billions of dollars. Also with the stellarator, doing non planar HTS coils and the associated manufacturing challenge is a very very hard problem.</p>

                  <p>Unlike what the nuclear Navy does today which is directly mechanically link the steam turbine to the propeller... we have the turbine spin a generator that creates a high voltage electric bus, which can than power a motor for propulsion. But you can 'easily' swap out the motor and tap off that HV bus for any other electrical load. Agree with all those other potential applications for mobile power at sea, there's a ton!

                  <p>Back of the envelope (and some quick googling), a large container ship burns hundreds of tons of fuel per day, at a cost of 700-1000 $/t. Plus, all that fuel occupies tonnage that isn't carrying paying cargo. If you can save on that with a magic new reactor, the cost of a well trained tech on every ship isn't going to break the budget.</p>

And it looks like the answer is <i>yes</i>, though it's still a tiny minority compared to general B2B SaaS companies:</p><p><a href="https://jaredheyman.medium.com/on-the-last-decade-of-y-combinator-fa19b387846a" rel="nofollow">https://jaredheyman.medium.com/on-the-last-decade-of-y-combi...</a></p><p>Government is a bigger slicer than it's been since 2017, and similar for industry. More drastically, the pool of companies has <i>greatly</i> constricted in geographic terms, with almost all of the 2024 batch coming from the US. Most importantly--as many of y'all probably already know, but I didn't--they just backed their first pure-defense startup in August, Ares Cruise Missiles.</p><p><a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/ares-industries">https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/ares-industries</a></p><p>As far as company mottos go, "Missiles are cool" is a fucking terrifying one...

Technical? check. Big important problem? check. Technically credible on <i>this</i> problem? check. "Did $Thing at $Company" can help on that last point for obvious reasons, but the idea of some triple-bank-shot collusion/corruption with Big Political Players is just Too Much Internet.</p><p>This matters! I would hate it if any smart, technical, wants-to-work-on-big-problem founder were to read HN threads and think "I don't have connections, so I guess YC is not for me."

However, the reason might not be what you'd expect. Trends among YC startups have to do with what founders want to work on, and that is mostly determined by macro factors beyond YC.</p><p>I suppose both my points could be summed up like this: "YC is all about the founders".

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/02/jeff-bezos-washington-post-opinion-1236302292/">https://deadline.com/2025/02/jeff-bezos-washington-post-opinion-1236302292/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43184762">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
	<a href="https://deadline.com/tag/jeff-bezos/" id="auto-tag_jeff-bezos" data-tag="jeff-bezos">Jeff Bezos</a> is exerting more influence over the content of the <em>Washington Post</em> opinion pages, as he announced Wednesday that its editorials will now focus on “defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets.”</p>



<p>
	But Bezos also made clear that alternate views will not appear on the pages.</p>








<p>
	“We’ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others,” Bezos wrote in a memo to staffers this morning.</p>



<p>
	Bezos also wrote that David Shipley, the opinion editor, is leaving the publication.</p>



<p>
	Bezos wrote, “I offered David Shipley, whom I greatly admire, the opportunity to lead this new chapter. I suggested to him that if the answer wasn’t ‘hell yes,’ then it had to be ‘no.’ After careful consideration, David decided to step away. This is a significant shift, it won’t be easy, and it will require 100% commitment — I respect his decision. We’ll be searching for a new Opinion Editor to own this new direction.”

	</p>

	</div>






<p>
	Bezos has owned the <em>Post </em>since 2013, and during the first Trump term, he was a consistent target of the president. As the <em>Post </em>reported critically on Trump’s administration, he threatened Bezos’ Amazon with antitrust action, and the company accused his attacks on its losing out to Microsoft on a lucrative government contract.</p>



<p>
	This time around, Bezos has been praiseworthy of the president, attending his inauguration. Amazon also contributed $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund. Before the election, Bezos also put the kibosh on editorial page plans to endorse in the presidential race, as it was likely to back Trump’s rival, Kamala Harris. </p>



<p>
	In 2023, the Biden-era Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general sued Amazon for antitrust violations. A trial is scheduled for October 2026.</p>



<p>
	Bezos’ action seemed to suggest that, just as Amazon is facing the antitrust litigation, the <em>Post </em>editorial pages will be advocating for less government intervention and regulation.</p>





<p>
	Bezos wrote in his note, “We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets. We’ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others. </p>



<p>
	“There was a time when a newspaper, especially one that was a local monopoly, might have seen it as a service to bring to the reader’s doorstep every morning a broad-based opinion section that sought to cover all views. Today, the internet does that job.

	</p>




<p>
	“I am of America and for America, and proud to be so. Our country did not get here by being typical. And a big part of America’s success has been freedom in the economic realm and everywhere else. Freedom is ethical — it minimizes coercion — and practical — it drives creativity, invention, and prosperity.”</p>



<p>
	Bezos’ announcement applies only to the opinion pages, not the news side. But it already has raised concerns in the newsroom.</p>



<p>
	Jeff Stein, chief economics reporter for the <em>Post</em>, wrote on X, “Massive encroachment by Jeff Bezos into <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/the-washington-post/" id="auto-tag_the-washington-post" data-tag="the-washington-post">The Washington Post</a>’s opinion section today – makes clear dissenting views will not be published or tolerated there I still have not felt encroachment on my journalism on the news side of coverage, but if Bezos tries interfering with the news side I will be quitting immediately and letting you know.”</p>



<p>
	Bezos’ action follows moves by another billionaire owner of a legacy publication, <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/los-angeles-times-endorsement-editorials-editor-resigns-1236156856/" data-type="post" data-id="1236156856">Patrick Soon-Shiong</a>, owns the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>. He has also sought to take more control over the publication’s opinion pages, leading to the resignation of its editorial editor as well as others.</p>



<p>
	Per <strong>The Daily Beast</strong>, former <em>Washington Post</em> executive editor Martin Baron sharply criticized Bezos’ move as one to focus the opinion pages on “those who think exactly as he does.”</p>



<p>
	“Bezos has done personal liberties a disservice by cravenly yielding to a president who shows no respect for liberty — one who aims to use the power of government to bully, punish and crush anyone who is not in his camp, especially the press. There is no doubt in my mind that [Bezos] is doing this out of fear of the consequences for his other business interests, Amazon (the source of his wealth) and Blue Origin (which represents his lifelong passion for space exploration). He has prioritized those commercial interests over The Post, and he is betraying The Post’s longstanding principles to do so.”</p>

            Chile’s president has declared a state of emergency after an electricity blackout plunged most of the country into darkness on Tuesday, including the capital Santiago.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7la3gss00003b6mx9o89pe9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The outage – in the middle of Chile’s summer, when temperatures in Santiago are around 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) – has affected some 8 million homes, President Gabriel Boric said in an address to the nation on Tuesday evening.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7kwu8cj0000356mkqux9263@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The National Disaster Prevention and Response Service said 14 of the country’s 16 regions were impacted by the blackout, which began Tuesday afternoon.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7lbaa0t0004356m99jetuiv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Internet and mobile phone services were down across much of the nation and parts of Santiago’s transport network was suspended, stranding commuters, as officials scrambled to restore power.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7lyiya300003b6mrj1y1l8d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            By Wednesday, the government said that 90% of homes and businesses affected by the blackout had had their electricity restored, according to the Chilean National Electric Coordinator.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7lyjoen00043b6m8e2vwdwp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            But Chilean Interior Minister, Carolina Tohá, acknowledged in a news conference that the service still had ongoing problems and that 220,000 customers remain without power. She also added that 100% of public transport services had been restored, and that the state of emergency would be lifted later.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7lyjoen00053b6mna3zw6av@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Tohá also said an investigation had been opened to establish what caused the outage. “One thing is the original failure that the company had (…) and another thing is how that system responds once the incident occurs.”
    </p>

  


    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7lb2da90000356msg8281zu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The National Electrical Coordinator, Chile’s grid operator, earlier said a high-voltage backbone transmission line, that carries power from the Atacama Desert of northern Chile to Santiago in the country’s central valley, had been disrupted, leading to the blackout. It did not say what caused the disruption.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3rp9k0000356me6rmm4f6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The president said the state of emergency aimed to “guarantee the safety” of citizens as the outage may last into the night. Authorities also announced a curfew in effect from 10 p.m. Tuesday until 6 a.m. Wednesday.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7laa42000043b6mg01ey6uw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Boric blamed the debacle on the electricity companies, saying “it is not tolerable” that millions of people have been affected.
    </p>

            “We are not going to let this pass and we are going to act firmly against companies that have not risen to the occasion. For this reason, all the necessary investigations will be carried out,” he said.
    </p>

            Tohá said hospitals, prisons and government buildings were switching to backup generators to keep essential services running and that the national gendarmerie force had been deployed on the streets, to maintain security and support the flow of traffic.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7lc4tfa000b356muhzxclwu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            “Our first concern, and the reason for this announcement, is to ensure people’s safety,” she said. “Obviously, this was something no one planned for.”

What ensued was a lengthy investigation that ultimately revealed some unexpected and highly undesirable behavior. This is a story of the complexities of cellular connectivity, the perils of closed ecosystems, and how to debug what you cannot see.<!-- notionvc: 0cbb8223-3cd5-4c29-a5ce-2b0badc516e7 --></p>

<h2>To Live is to Be Connected</h2>
<p>Before going into detail about the sad state of affairs that is the telecommunications industry, it is important to provide some context around why connectivity is so important for large fleets of devices. Sure, it can be frustrating when your phone or laptop is unable to access the internet. Whether it is because your internet service provider (ISP) is having an outage, there is a bug in your device’s network stack, or any other issue, you may not be able to complete essential tasks. However, you can call your ISP, go to a coffee shop and use their Wi-Fi to download a software update, or execute the tried and true “turn it off then turn it back on” strategy. While the lack of connectivity is not convenient for personal devices, it usually is temporary and does not render the device permanently useless.</p>
<p>The same cannot be said for large fleets of devices deployed in hard-to-access locations. Connection failures that require physical intervention can be fatal for a device, as it might be literally inaccessible, or the cost of accessing it may be so exorbitant that it might as well be. Because of this, we, and our customers, go to great lengths to ensure that devices that fail to connect are able to recover gracefully.<!-- notionvc: eb225e09-23f7-49b9-81fc-9fff0d05b5e9 --></p>
<p>For example, Golioth’s Over-the-Air (OTA) firmware update implementation integrates with recommended frameworks for each supported platform, such as <a href="https://docs.mcuboot.com/design.html">mcuboot</a> and <a href="https://espressif-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/api-reference/system/ota.html">esp-idf OTA</a>, to ensure that a deployed firmware update is able to be rolled back in the case of failure to connect. When a firmware update is initiated via the Golioth cloud platform, devices in the field that are currently connected are notified that a new image is available, and those that are not are notified on next connection. The device will then download the new image into flash in a secondary or “candidate” partition. If download and image verification is successful, the device will subsequently mark the new image as the boot image in a “test” mode, then reboot into it. If there is a crash after reboot or the device is unable to connect for a configurable time window, the device will swap the previous image back, reboot, and continue operation as before.</p>
<h2>Signs of Trouble</h2>

<p>Initial reports regarding connectivity issues with the nRF9160 centered around devices that had recently performed OTA firmware updates. It manifested as some devices in a cohort targeted by a deployment successfully downloading the new firmware image, starting an update, then eventually rolling back to a previous version. While this would typically indicate an issue in the new firmware image, it appeared to only be impacting a subset of devices in the cohort. Furthermore, a number of the devices eventually successfully updated to the new image after a handful of retries.</p>
<p>There are three broad categories of issues one can encounter when working with devices on a cellular connection:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firmware</li>
<li>Connectivity</li>
<li>Cloud</li>
</ul>
<p>We like firmware and cloud issues because they are domains that we and our customers can, for the most part, control. If something is going wrong on either side of a connection we are typically able to track down and resolve the issue using observability and debugging tooling. Given the correlation of the nRF9160 connectivity issues with recent firmware updates, our immediate inclination was that customers had updated to the latest version of the Golioth Firmware SDK (<code>v0.17.0</code>) and there had been a regression either in our SDK or one of the platform versions it pins (i.e. nRF Connect SDK, Zephyr). However, reports indicated that multiple versions of both our SDK and the nRF Connect SDK were exhibiting the issue.</p>
<p>We started out by attempting to reproduce the behavior using <code>v0.17.0</code>. The nRF9160 development kit is one of our <a href="https://docs.golioth.io/firmware/hardware/catalog/boards/continuously-verified/nrf9160dk_nrf9160">continuously verified boards</a>, meaning that we are constantly running continuous integration tests on it via our <a href="https://blog.golioth.io/how-we-use-allure-report-to-understand-continuous-integration-tests/">hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) infrastructure</a>. In fact, the history of firmware update test statuses for the nRF9160DK are available on our <a href="https://golioth.github.io/allure-reports/main">public dashboard</a>. However, after running a large number of firmware updates across a variety of geographic locations, we observed an issue that exhibited in a manner similar to the received reports. After downloading a new firmware image, devices would report an inability to resolve the <a href="http://coap.golioth.io/"><code>coap.golioth.io</code></a> domain name to an address, then subsequently rollback to the previous image.</p>

<p>When I said there were three broad categories of issues with cellular devices, I probably should have split the first, firmware, into two separate domains. We like solving problems in the application domain, but a large portion of the firmware running on a cellular device resides in the <em>modem</em>.</p>
<h2>Secret Handshakes and Back Alleys</h2>
<p>In some cases, there is some limited access to firmware on a modem. For example, we <a href="https://blog.golioth.io/golioth-can-now-run-entirely-on-qualcomm-modems/">recently announced</a> support for running Golioth on modem processors. However, even when limited access is available, it typically depends upon encrypted binary blobs, new versions of which are distributed at the whim of the silicon vendor. The nRF9160 modem falls into the category of lesser access, though we are fortunate enough to be blessed with <a href="https://nsscprodmedia.blob.core.windows.net/prod/software-and-other-downloads/dev-kits/nrf9160-dk/release_notes_modemfirmware/mfw_nrf9160_1.3.7_release_notes.txt">moderately detailed release notes</a> when a new firmware version is available.</p>
<p>But before you go egging the Nordic Semiconductor headquarters, consider the fact that they are one of the most open vendors in the industry. They invest heavily in the Zephyr RTOS ecosystem, open source the vast majority of their SDK, provide better developer tooling than their competitors, and are generally fairly responsive on their public forums. Let this blog post not be a slandering of their fine handiwork.</p>
<p>No, Nordic is merely a participant in a vast ecosystem that convenes via the 3rd Generation Partnership Project, or 3GPP as it’s known among friends. 3GPP was formed in 1998 out of the joining of seven different standards organizations — queue the <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">xkcd meme</a>. 3GPP develops the standards that underpin all wireless communication in the world today. These technical specifications (TS) are aggregated and included in “releases”, which are made freely available. Unfortunately, much of the technology that is <em>required to implement the standards</em> is patented. The patents are referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_patent">Standards Essential Patents</a>, or SEPs. Because of this arrangement, a vendor like Nordic probably can’t open source their modem firmware even if they wanted to.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if some brave soul was willing to painstakingly navigate the deluge of 3GPP specifications, they would be able to get an idea of what a modem and the cellular networks it connects to <em>should</em> be doing by reading through the hundreds of documents. In the case of the nRF9160, the primary specifications of interest would be part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_Advanced#LTE_Advanced_Pro">3GPP Release 13</a>, which introduced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE-M">LTE Cat-M1</a> (eMTC) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrowband_IoT">NB-IoT</a>.</p>
<h2>Figuring Out What Is Going On</h2>
<p>Prior to my divergence into the morass of intellectual property that provides the foundation of wireless communication, we had just observed that DNS requests were successful when issued via the Zephyr network shell. That felt like a good place to probe deeper, given that we clearly had an internet connection and were simply unable to use it.</p>
<p>The firmware used for testing was the Zephyr <code>fw_update</code> <a href="https://github.com/golioth/golioth-firmware-sdk/tree/main/examples/zephyr/fw_update">example</a> in the Golioth Firmware SDK. The Golioth Zephyr CoAP client implementation <a href="https://github.com/golioth/golioth-firmware-sdk/blob/e97dae07c5af785497089baebb4957c22478cbf5/src/coap_client_zephyr.c#L975">uses</a> <code>zsock_getaddrinfo</code> to resolve the server domain name (<code>coap.golioth.io</code>) to an IP address.</p>

<pre data-enlighter-language="c">ret = zsock_getaddrinfo(host, port, &amp;hints, &amp;addrs);
if (ret &lt; 0)
{
    LOG_ERR("Fail to get address (%s %s) %d", host, port, ret);
    return -EAGAIN;
}</pre>
<p>We could see the error log emitted on failure in the output of our reproduction. When using nRF91 series devices, <a href="https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/nrf/libraries/modem/nrf_modem_lib/nrf_modem_lib_socket_offloading.html">socket offloading</a> must be enabled for LTE connectivity.

<p>The initialization function then calls <code>socket_offload_dns_register</code>, to setup the corresponding offload implementations for <code>getaddrinfo</code> and <code>freeaddrinfo</code>.</p>

This is <em>not</em> the modem firmware, but rather the interface from the application processor to the modem firmware. It’s a shame that they don’t provide the source, but disassembling the binary mostly just shows performing some sort of inter-processor RPC with the modem.</p>

<p>This is ultimately where the error on the application processor originates, but the issue is only being propagated from the modem. At this point we turned our attention to the <code>net dns</code> handler in the network shell, which appeared to be communicating with the modem via another mechanism. Sure enough, following the call stack <a href="https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/8748a056f0d8b8aa15f6c9203c34a1849960f1bf/subsys/net/lib/shell/dns.c#L182">from <code>cmd_net_dns_query</code></a> revealed a <a href="https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/8748a056f0d8b8aa15f6c9203c34a1849960f1bf/subsys/net/lib/dns/resolve.c#L1233">call to <code>zsock_sendto</code></a>, notably with the server address provided.</p>

<pre data-enlighter-language="c">ret = zsock_sendto(sock, buf, len, 0, server, server_addr_len);</pre>
<p>The implementation is defined in the <a href="https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf/blob/859caae972f33e147649af67aea71e00c35006a2/lib/nrf_modem_lib/nrf9x_sockets.c#L1014">offloaded sockets vtable</a>.</p>

<pre data-enlighter-language="c">static const struct socket_op_vtable nrf9x_socket_fd_op_vtable = {
    .fd_vtable = {
        .read = nrf9x_socket_offload_read,
        .write = nrf9x_socket_offload_write,
        .close = nrf9x_socket_offload_close,
        .ioctl = nrf9x_socket_offload_ioctl,
    },
    .bind = nrf9x_socket_offload_bind,
    .connect = nrf9x_socket_offload_connect,
    .listen = nrf9x_socket_offload_listen,
    .accept = nrf9x_socket_offload_accept,
    .sendto = nrf9x_socket_offload_sendto,
    .sendmsg = nrf9x_socket_offload_sendmsg,

    .getsockopt = nrf9x_socket_offload_getsockopt,
    .setsockopt = nrf9x_socket_offload_setsockopt,
};</pre>
<p><code>nrf9x_socket_offload_sendto</code> then calls <code>nrf_sendto</code>, which takes us back into the binary modem library. The key difference between these paths is that the former asks the modem to perform a DNS request on its behalf, while in the latter, the DNS request is formed, then the modem is asked to send the request to the specified server. In this case, the server happens to be Cloudflare’s <code>1.1.1.1</code> , which is <a href="https://github.com/golioth/golioth-firmware-sdk/blob/e97dae07c5af785497089baebb4957c22478cbf5/examples/zephyr/common/Kconfig.defconfig#L23">set as the default</a> in the Golioth Firmware SDK for Zephyr examples.</p>
<p>At this point, we considered whether there could be a bug in the modem firmware. We had already reached out Nordic, but we needed to move quickly to address the issue. Unfortunately, we were unable to disassemble the encrypted modem firmware binary that Nordic distributes, and dumping the unencrypted firmware proved difficult. We quickly tested a few different versions of the modem firmware to ensure that the behavior had not been corrected in a newer version. The issue reproduced intermittently across all of them.</p>
<p>Perhaps there was an issue with the DNS server used by the modem? This raised the question of how the modem was deciding upon a DNS server to use in the first place. We discovered the <code>nrf_setdnsaddr</code> function in the modem library, which provided some <a href="https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrfxlib/blob/85954588939b0d6c46a84ae39ef7926cc2fe9810/nrf_modem/include/nrf_socket.h#L1124C1-L1130C37">interesting documentation</a>.</p>

<pre data-enlighter-language="c">/**

<p>It was still unclear as to how the primary DNS server address was being set, but we figured calling the function prior to attempting DNS resolution was worth a shot.<!-- notionvc: f0313c1e-933a-499d-9f79-2bca6f1eca29 --></p>

<p>Maddeningly, it worked. Given the behavior was intermittent, we made sure to test repeatedly, but the device connected every time. Suddenly we had the only thing worse than no solution: a solution that you don’t understand. Hardly comfortable recommending this as a generic workaround to our customers, our pursuit continued.</p>
<p>Curious as to what the modem considered its primary and secondary DNS server addresses, we began pouring through the AT commands supported by the nRF91 series. The <a href="https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ref_at_commands/page/REF/at_commands/packet_domain/cgcontrdp.html">PDN connection dynamic parameters</a> (<code>AT+CGCONTRDP</code>) command returns information about an active Packet Data Network (PDN) connection, including fields described as primary and secondary DNS. After removing the <code>nrf_setdnsaddr</code> call, we added the following immediately after successful LTE registration.</p>

<pre data-enlighter-language="c">err = nrf_modem_at_cmd(at_resp, sizeof(at_resp), "AT+CGCONTRDP=0");
if (err)
{
    LOG_WRN("nrf_modem_at_cmd failed. errno: %d", err);
    return -1;
}
LOG_INF("%s", at_resp);</pre>
<p>The first test was successful and revealed <code>8.8.8.8</code> and <code>8.8.4.4</code> as primary and secondary DNS servers respectively.</p>

<h2>You Can Just Read Stuff</h2>
<p>Remember our good friends at 3GPP and all of their wonderful specifications? It turns out that the aforementioned theoretical brave souls who operate outside of the telecom companies and silicon vendors, but venture into the specification mines nonetheless, are not so theoretical. You can find us at the bottom of the <em>r/telecom</em> Reddit threads where someone is claiming that “carrier standards are so complex that you couldn’t hope to understand them even if you tried”.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, the 3GPP release that introduced the technology supported by the nRF91 series modems is Release 13. Specifications across releases are organized into <a href="https://www.3gpp.org/specifications-technologies/specifications-by-series">series</a>. For example, <a href="https://portal.etsi.org/webapp/workprogram/Report_WorkItem.asp?WKI_ID=62371">3GPP TS 36.331 version 13.17.0 Release 13</a>, is a 3GPP technical specification (TS) in series 36 (LTE (Evolved UTRA), LTE-Advanced, LTE-Advanced Pro radio technology), with ID 331. It is under <a href="https://portal.3gpp.org/ChangeRequests.aspx?q=1&amp;specnumber=36.331">change control</a>, meaning that new versions may be released and included in subsequent releases. Version 13.17.0 was the final iteration included in 3GPP Release 13.</p>
<p>This specific TS is entitled “<em>LTE; Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Radio Resource Control (RRC); Protocol specification</em>” — really roles off the tongue. Radio Resource Control (RRC) is the protocol used for signalling between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_equipment">User Equipment (UE)</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENodeB">E-UTRAN Node B (Evolved Node B, eNodeB, eNB)</a>. To greatly simplify for our specific use case, the nRF9160 device is serving as the UE and the cell towers it attempts to connect to can be thought of as the eNodeB. We start with TS 36.331 because before the device can communicate with the network, it needs to communicate with towers, and it will use RRC to do so.</p>
<p>Once again giving credit to Nordic where it is due, they offer a terrific <a href="https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/nrfxlib/nrf_modem/doc/modem_trace.html">modem trace</a> feature on the nRF91 series devices. A firmware application can be configured to <a href="https://academy.nordicsemi.com/courses/cellular-iot-fundamentals/lessons/lesson-7-cellular-fundamentals/topic/lesson-7-modem-trace/">forward trace data</a> from the modem core over UART or RTT, or write it to flash or RAM. The binary modem trace data can be <a href="https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nrfutil/page/nrfutil-trace/guides/tracing_converting_data.html">converted</a> into multiple formats, including a <a href="https://pcapng.com/">PcapNG (PCAP Next Generation)</a> file that can be opened in <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>. Furthermore, the <code>nrfutil</code> <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nRF-Util">tool</a> enables live capturing from UART to Wireshark with the following command.</p>

<pre data-enlighter-language="generic">nrfutil trace lte --input-serial-port &lt;serial port&gt; --output-wireshark &lt;/path/to/wireshark/binary&gt;</pre>
<p>The first set of RRC messages we observed in the modem trace were <code>SystemInformationBlockType1</code>. According to TS 36.331: <em><code>SystemInformationBlockType1</code> contains information relevant when evaluating if a UE is allowed to access a cell and defines the scheduling of other system information (page 265)</em>.</p>

<p>Section 5.2.2.7 of TS 36.331 provides the logic for evaluating whether the Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) is a candidate for a given UE. After evaluating candidacy and receiving all necessary system information, the UE will send an <code>RRCConnectionRequest</code>, which the E-UTRAN will respond to with an <code>RRCConnectionSetup</code> message.</p>

<pre data-enlighter-language="generic">37	7.729614			LTE RRC UL_CCCH	30	RRCConnectionRequest
38	7.772034			LTE RRC DL_CCCH	74	RRCConnectionSetup</pre>
<p>These messages between the UR and the E-UTRAN are referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_stratum">Access Stratum (AS)</a> signalling. After the connection is established, the UE is then able to communicate with the Evolved Packet Core (EPC). Messages between the UE and the EPC are referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-access_stratum">Non-Access Stratum (NAS)</a> signalling. Perhaps the most helpful overview of this architecture is buried in <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/136400_136499/136401/13.02.00_60/ts_136401v130200p.pdf">3GPP TS 36.401 version 13.2.0 Release 13</a>, entitled <em>“LTE; Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN); Architecture description”</em>, in Section 5.3.</p>

<p>NAS messages may be piggybacked on AS messages, and you’ll also note the presence of the Evolved Packet System (EPS) Mobility Management (EMM) and Session Management (ESM) protocols on top of the Non-Access Stratum. We saw both appear in the next communication.<!-- notionvc: 14f374d7-e328-44aa-8ac6-12f3827cab09 --></p>

<p>The <code>Attach request</code> is an EMM message, while the <code>PDN connectivity request</code> is an ESM message, and both are encapsulated in the <code>RRCConectionSetupComplete</code> message sent by the UR. To understand the structure of NAS messages, we have to look at, you guessed it, another 3GPP TS. This time is it <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/124300_124399/124301/13.12.00_60/ts_124301v131200p.pdf">3GPP TS 24.301 version 13.12.0 Release 13</a>, entitled <em>“Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS); LTE; 5G; Non-Access-Stratum (NAS) protocol for Evolved Packet System (EPS); Stage 3”</em>. I promise I’m not making these names up. The <code>PDN connectivity request</code> is, according to the specification, sent by the UE to the network to initiate establishment of a Packet Data Network (PDN) connection (Section 8.3.20). It includes a variety of parameters, which which we were able see when expanding the data in Wireshark.</p>

<p>The vast majority of them fall under <code>Protocol Configuration Options</code> (PCO). Thankfully there is some information about these options in Section 9.9.4.11 of TS 24.301. It reads:</p>
<p><em>See subclause 10.5.6.3 in 3GPP TS 24.008.</em></p>
<p>You’ve got to be kidding me. We’ll skip the big reveal and jump right to the description in <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/124000_124099/124008/13.13.00_60/ts_124008v131300p.pdf">TS 24.008</a>.</p>
<p><em>The purpose of the protocol configuration options information element is to:</em></p>

<li><em>transfer external network protocol options associated with a PDP context activation, and</em></li>
<li><em>transfer additional (protocol) data (e.g. configuration parameters, error codes or messages/events) associated with an external protocol or an application.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>A Packet Data Protocol (PDP) context is the connection over which the UE can send packets to the network. The options that immediately stuck out when investigating our DNS issue was the presence of the <code>DNS Server IPv4 Address Request</code> and <code>DNS Server IPv6 Address Request</code>. In the <code>PDN connectivity request</code>, these indicate that the UE is requesting these addresses from the network. We can see the response in the <code>Attach accept</code> message which includes an <code>Activate default EPS bearer context</code> ESM message.</p>

<p><code>8.8.8.8</code> and <code>8.8.4.4</code> are Google’s primary and secondary DNS server addresses and matched what we already observed in the output from the <code>AT+CGCONTRDP</code> AT command. The nRF9160 was able to successfully resolve DNS and connect to the Golioth cloud platform after completing this attach procedure. However, upon rebooting and capturing another modem trace, the device failed DNS and the sequence of messages revealed a few differences.</p>
<p>First of all, the SIB messages were post-fixed with <code>-NB</code>, indicating we were receiving system information from an NB-IoT E-UTRAN rather than LTE Cat-M1.</p>

<p>Rather than Procotol Configuration Options (PCO), there were Extended Protocol Configuration Options (ePCO). They are defined in Section 9.9.4.26 of TS 24.301.</p>
<p><em>The purpose of the extended protocol configuration options information element is to:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>transfer external network protocol options associated with a EPS bearer context activation, and</em></li>
<li><em>transfer additional (protocol) data (e.g. configuration parameters, error codes or messages/events) associated with an external protocol or an application.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds pretty similar to PCO. Looking at one more specification, <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/129200_129299/129274/13.13.00_60/ts_129274v131300p.pdf">3GPP TS 29.274 version 13.13.0 Release 13</a>, entitled <em>“Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS); LTE; 3GPP Evolved Packet System (EPS); Evolved General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) Tunnelling Protocol for Control plane (GTPv2-C); Stage 3”</em> , states the following in Section 7.2.1 Note 15.</p>
<p><em>An MME, SGW and PGW which supports NB-IoT and/or Non-IP PDN type shall support ePCO. A UE supporting NB-IoT access and/or Non-IP PDN type also support ePCO.</em></p>
<p>GTP is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPRS_Tunnelling_Protocol">GPRS Tunnelling Protocol</a>, and GTP-C is the “control” section. LTE uses GTPv2, which is described as follows on the Wikipedia page.</p>
<p><em>The eGTP-C (or, GTPv2-C) protocol is responsible for creating, maintaining and deleting tunnels on multiple Sx interfaces. It is used for the control plane path management, tunnel management and mobility management. It also controls forwarding relocation messages; SRNS context and creating forward tunnels during inter LTE handovers.</em></p>
<p>Looking back at the diagram from TS 36.401, GTPv2 is the protocol that allows communication between the E-UTRAN and the EPC. That traffic is not observable from the modem trace, but TS 29.274 tells us that both the UE and the entities that make up the EPC must support ePCO when using NB-IoT. We already observed the UE support in the <code>PDN connectivity request</code>, and the accept and activate response was received shortly after.</p>

<h2>What Went Wrong</h2>
<p>At this point everything was starting to make sense.</p>
<ul>
<li>When using the nRF9160 modem for LTE connectivity, offloaded sockets must be enabled, which forces the use of offloaded DNS resolution.</li>
<li>The nRF9160 modem firmware was using PCO for LTE Cat-M1 networks and ePCO for NB-IoT.</li>
<li>When a DNS server address was provided, either via PCO or ePCO, by the network, the offloaded DNS functionality in the modem firmware would always use it as the first option.</li>
<li>If a DNS server address was not provided by the network, the offloaded DNS resolution would fail to resolve unless a fallback was explicitly set with <code>nrf_setdnsaddr</code>.</li>
<li>Some NB-IoT networks are not compliant with 3GPP specifications, leading to DNS failures when using nRF91 series modem firmware.</li>
</ul>
<p>So who is to blame for this state of affairs? The network provider seems to not be implementing the specification correctly, which certainly is not great. However, Nordic also does not fail gracefully in this scenario or document the possibility of its occurrence. In our investigation, we discovered a plethora tickets on their <a href="https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/">DevZone</a> forum detailing issues with DNS on nRF91 series modems. Most of the threads either fizzled out without resolution, or there was a suggestion to set <code>CONFIG_LEGACY_PDN_PCO=y</code>, <a href="https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-1.9.0/page/kconfig/CONFIG_PDN_LEGACY_PCO.html">completely disabling the use of ePCO</a>, which may cause issues in the event that ePCO <em>is</em> supported. In our testing, ensuring that a secondary DNS address is always configured via <code>nrf_setdnsaddr</code> appears to be a more reliable option.</p>
<p>However, I would argue that the details of this specific issue are not the root of the problem. The root of the problem is an ecosystem that is built on secretive, proprietary technology and complex specifications that even the people involved in writing them have trouble implementing. While some of us may have a strange obsession with combing through 3GPP documents, that shouldn’t be a prerequisite for a company to build a reliable cellular-enabled product. The root of the problem is that, even though we have performed a thorough investigation, tested extensively, and communicated with vendors about the issue, we are still guessing because the modem firmware is closed source and the mobile network operator (MNO) infrastructure is opaque.</p>

<h2>A Call for Change</h2>
<p>You may say this is the way it has always been, or that if you want something to change you better be ready to hire a small army of lawyers. We prefer a more optimistic, though perhaps naive, outlook.</p>
<p>The reality is that the most effective way to inspire change in a commercial context is to appeal to a major player’s self-interest. As previously noted, modem designers like Nordic may have limited control over which parts of the modem firmware can be open source and which cannot. However, given their embrace of open source application firmware, it is clear that they recognize the benefits of both building an ecosystem and allowing customers and other organizations to contribute.</p>
<p>For Nordic and other vendors like them, open source is not only the best thing for their customers, it is the best thing for their business. The same is true for MNOs and MVNOs. The number one reason we see customers opt to not use cellular when another connectivity option is on the table is due to concerns around cost and reliability. Because telecom is a heavily regulated industry, utilizing cellular connectivity when building a product almost always requires taking a dependency on a third party. In order to serve your customers well, you need to have a relationship with your vendors that is based on trust. Transparency is a foundational building block of trust, and vendors that are willing to embrace that will be able to differentiate in the market.</p>
<p>Until then, you can find us combing through 3GPP specifications and reverse engineering their infrastructure to ensure that our customers are able to build cellular-enabled devices with confidence.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Automattic is facing a class action lawsuit over its feud with WP Engine, with a cybersecurity expert accusing CEO Matt Mullenweg of waging “nuclear war” against the hosting company at the expense of hundreds of thousands of its customers.</p>



<p>Ryan Keller, who runs Ohio-based cybersecurity business SecureSight, has filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of WP Engine customers in the United States. The complaint alleges that Automattic deliberately sabotaged WP Engine’s business by blocking access to critical WordPress.org services, causing disruption, security risks, and financial harm.</p>



<p>The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, accuses Automattic of multiple counts of tortious interference and violations of California’s Unfair Competition Law. Keller is seeking financial damages for affected businesses and a permanent injunction to prevent Automattic from using its control over WordPress.org to interfere with competitors.</p>



<p>The class action covers all WP Engine customers in the U.S. who had active hosting plans between September 24, 2024, and December 10, 2024, a period when WP Engine lost access to plugin updates, security patches, and other essential services. The lawsuit claims that “hundreds of thousands” of WP Engine customers were affected.</p>



<p>Keller has retained two class action law firms—Schubert Jonckheer &amp; Kolbe, based in San Francisco, and Tycko &amp; Zavareei, which has offices in California and Washington, D.C. Schubert Jonckheer &amp; Kolbe’s most significant tech-related case resulted in a $22.5 million settlement for AdWords advertisers who alleged Google placed their ads on low-quality parked domains and error pages in violation of California law, benefiting approximately 1.1 million class members. In the past year, Tycko &amp; Zavareei has won class action cases against Apple and Meta, securing a combined $72.5 million in settlements.</p>



<p>Mullenweg has publicly defended his actions in recent months, arguing that he acted to protect WordPress and safeguard its long-term future. In his keynote address at WordCamp US 2024, Mullenweg accused WP Engine and its private equity backer, Silver Lake, of exploiting WordPress without giving enough back to the open source project. It was later revealed that Automattic had demanded that WP Engine pay an 8% licensing fee to use the WordPress trademarks.</p>



<p>But Keller’s lawsuit argues that Mullenweg weaponized his control over WordPress.org, cutting off WP Engine’s access to cripple its business and steer customers toward Automattic-owned hosting brands, including WordPress.com and Pressable. The complaint claims Automattic and Mullenweg publicly pressured WP Engine customers to leave by listing them on the <a href="https://wordpressenginetracker.com/">WordPress Engine Tracker website</a>, while Automattic-owned hosting brands directly solicited them with incentives to migrate.</p>



<p>The lawsuit describes Automattic and Mullenweg’s conduct as an abuse of the open-source internet architecture, alleging that “a single individual (Matt Mullenweg) exercises apparent singular control over what they claim to be more than 40% of all websites in the world through his personal website (WordPress.org).” It calls this level of control “an appalling deception” that is “contrary to every conceivable public policy.”</p>



<p>It also disputes Automattic’s justification for blocking WP Engine’s access, arguing that “a trademark dispute, even if legitimate, is not cause for the deliberate sabotage of the websites of innocent third-party individuals and companies who merely used WPE services.” The complaint calls Automattic’s trademark claims a “pretext” for harming WP Engine and its customers.</p>



<p>The lawsuit challenges Automattic’s influence over WordPress.org, arguing that its ability to block WP Engine’s access without oversight exposes a governance issue in WordPress, where a single company can control who has access to critical WordPress infrastructure.</p>



<p>Keller, who pays $3,300 per year for WP Engine’s Scale Plan, says he had to spend time and money managing security risks and considering alternative hosting providers. The lawsuit claims many small businesses were left in limbo, unsure whether WP Engine could provide stable service or if migrating would be worth the cost and disruption.</p>



<p>A case management conference is scheduled for May 22, 2025, in San Francisco before Judge Peter H. Kang, with both sides required to meet and discuss potential settlement options by May 1 and submit case management filings by May 15.</p>



<p><em>The Repository</em> contacted Keller for comment but hasn’t heard back yet.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Conventional self-attention mechanisms incur quadratic complexity, limiting their scalability on long sequences. We introduce FFTNet, an adaptive spectral filtering framework that leverages the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to achieve global token mixing in $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ time. By transforming inputs into the frequency domain, FFTNet exploits the orthogonality and energy preservation guaranteed by Parseval's theorem to capture long-range dependencies efficiently. A learnable spectral filter and modReLU activation dynamically emphasize salient frequency components, providing a rigorous and adaptive alternative to traditional self-attention. Experiments on the Long Range Arena and ImageNet benchmarks validate our theoretical insights and demonstrate superior performance over fixed Fourier and standard attention models.

    <h2><a href="https://adamscherlis.github.io/">Adam Scherlis</a></h2>
    
    <em>2025-01-01</em>

<h2>Floats with just the sign bits</h2>
<p>I've created a new format for encoding real numbers on computers. I'm proud of it! Let's dive in.</p>
<h2>Real number formats</h2>
<p>We have some real value . Could be positive or negative or zero, large or small. How can we store it in a bitstring?</p>
<p>Fixed-point numbers have one bit for the sign of  (positive or negative) and  bits for its absolute value , in binary, with an implied decimal point in some fixed location. (They actually usually use two's-complement instead of representing  directly, but let's not get into that right now.)</p>
<p>Floating-point numbers basically use scientific notation. One bit for the sign of  (positive or negative), some bits for an integer exponent, and some more for the significand. This is more flexible because it maintains constant <em>relative</em> precision instead of <em>absolute</em> precision. Note that the exponent is the floor of the logarithm of the absolute value, , and the significand accounts for the fractional part (mantissa): . (I'm using  and  to mean  and , or  and  if you want to generalize to an arbitrary base.)</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_number_system">Logarithmic number systems</a> are similar, but a bit more elegant: instead of separating the integer part of the logarithm from the fractional part and encoding them separately, it's just a direct fixed-point representation of  and a separate sign bit for .</p>
<p>At this point things are getting kind of interesting: we have a sign bit for  and another (inside the fixed-point representation) for . This second sign bit tells us whether the number is large ( or ) or small ().</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_level-index_arithmetic">Symmetric level-index</a> representations go farther, and let you represent truly enormous numbers: they encode the number of times you need to take a logarithm to make  be a reasonable size, as well as what's left over after the final logarithm. Like logarithmic number systems, they have two sign bits, one for  and one for its <em>first</em> logarithm.</p>
<p>But we can do better.</p>
<h2>Introducing the iterated-log format</h2>
<p>Let's describe , a little at a time.</p>
<p>First: is it positive or negative? That's determined by the sign , counting zero as positive. What's left over is the absolute value .</p>
<p>Then: is it large in magnitude or small? Take  and find its sign, . The information left over is .</p>
<p>Then: is it very large-or-small, like -10,000 and +0.0001, or just moderately large-or-small, like 1.3 or -0.8? This is determined by , where . (To elaborate a bit: we're asking about whether  is large in magnitude, because very large-or-small numbers have very positive-or-negative logs, i.e. large ones.)</p>
<p>You can see where we go from here. We define  and take its sign . At this point things are getting a bit abstract, but we can still interpret this sign: positive values indicate that  is extremely large, extremely small, or very close to ; negative values indicate that it's somewhere in between.</p>
<p>Okay, so what's our proposed format? It's essentially just:</p>

<p>So a small positive number begins , a large negative one begins , etc.</p>
<p>This might not seem like enough information to reconstruct the number, but it is: every additional sign restricts the range of possible values, and any level of precision for a given number can be achieved with enough signs.</p>
<h2>Gray code and lexicographic ordering</h2>
<p>Let's stop at three signs' worth of precision for now and see what we have, in order:</p>
<pre><code>-++
-+-
---
--+
+-+
+--
++-
+++
</code></pre>
<p>Well, that's funny! It's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code">Gray code</a>. Cute, but maybe not the most practical.</p>
<p>Let's convert our signs to bits, moving to a standard lexicographic ordering in the process. The rules for this are straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the first bit,  means positive and  means negative.</li>
<li>Every negative sign flips the encoding for subsequent bits</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rounding and padding</h2>
<p>So far, a finite string of sign bits specifies an interval, not a single value.</p>
<p>To fix a well-defined value for every bitstring and handle some annoying fencepost issues, let's specify that:</p>
<ul>
<li>An empty sequence of signs represents zero</li>
<li>If the sign sequence  represents , then  represents ...</li>
<li>...and  represents 
</li>
<li>After converting signs to bits, an extra  is appended, followed by an arbitrary number of zeroes for padding</li>
<li>The all-zero bitstring represents <code>NaN</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This gives us the following values for sequences of up to two signs:</p>
<pre><code>-+ [0 0 1] -2
-  [0 1 0] -1
-- [0 1 1] -0.5
   [1 0 0] 0
+- [1 0 1] 0.5
+  [1 1 0] 1
++ [1 1 1] 2
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the trailing  that we append has a nice semantic interpretation; with infinitely many zeroes appended, it decodes to </p>

<p>which is what we want an empty sequence to represent anyway.</p>
<p>So an alternative prescription, if you like mathematical elegance over efficiency, is to append an infinite string of zeroes and take the limit.</p>
<!-- 
Similarly, \(000\ldots\) in principle represents \(-\infty\), although the lack of a finite-length encoding for \(111\ldots = \infty\) makes this somewhat less useful.

And in addition to \(1000\ldots = +0\), there's also \(0111\ldots = -0\), so we have the usual fencepost ambiguity of infinite decimals. -->

<h2>Code</h2>
<p>The prototype implementation is in a notebook <a href="https://github.com/AdamScherlis/notebooks-python/blob/main/math/iterlog_coding.ipynb">here</a>, warts and all. There's also some bonus math which I might explain in a later post.</p>
<h2>Every 7-bit number</h2>
<p>I know 7 is a weird bit depth, but it's just enough to show off the killer features of this format:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lexicographic ordering</li>
<li>Wide range of values</li>
<li>Symmetric across zero</li>
<li>Any value representable in  bits is representable in  bits</li>
<li>Numbers too large to represent in any float format</li>
<li>Numbers too small to represent in any float format</li>
<li>Numbers extremely close to 1</li>
<li>Exciting fractally-nonuniform spacing of values</li>
<li>Wildly unpredictable precision</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>[0 0 0 0 0 0 1] -2.004e+19728

<p>A venture capital-backed “AI performance monitoring system for factory workers” is proposing what appears to be dehumanizing surveillance of factories, where machine vision tracks workers’ hand movements and output so a boss can look at graphs and yell at them about efficiency.</p><p>In a launch video demoing the product, Baid and Mohta put on a skit showing how Optifye.ai would be used by factory bosses.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The YC deleted video for sweatshop startup Optifye <a href="https://t.co/vCJvm2HTce?ref=404media.co">pic.twitter.com/vCJvm2HTce</a></p>— Adam Lerman (@AdamLerman5) <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamLerman5/status/1894215433366245457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=404media.co">February 25, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>“Ugh, it’s workspace 17. Workspace 17 is the bottleneck. The worst performing workspace here,” one of the bosses says, while watching a video of a man making clothing in a factory. “Hey number 17, what’s going on man? You are in red,” he says. “I have been working all day,” the person playing the worker says. “Working all day?” the line boss replies. “You haven’t hit your hourly output even once today. And you have 11.4% efficiency, this is really bad!”&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s just been a rough day,” the “worker” replies. “Rough day?” the boss says, looking at a calendar full of red days. “More like a rough month.”&nbsp;</p><p>Optifye.ai, launched by Duke University computer science students Vivaan Baid and Kushal Mohta, is backed by Y Combinator, <a href="https://archive.is/GtuTi?ref=404media.co" rel="noreferrer">according to the company’s site</a>. On their <a href="https://archive.is/Qu09c?ref=404media.co"><u>Y Combinator company profile</u></a>, they write that both of their families run manufacturing plants, where they’ve been exposed to factory working conditions since they were children. “I've been around assembly lines for as long as I can remember,” Baid wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>Mohta wrote, “My family also runs several manufacturing plants in various industries, which has given me unrestricted access to assembly lines since I was 15.”&nbsp;</p><p>They hope to sell cameras to factory owners to use on assembly lines, their website says, and “use computer vision to tell supervisors who's working and who's not in real-time.”</p><p>Y Combinator deleted its recent Linkedin and X posts congratulating the company on launching.</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXex26pUs8TaRaVO2vdq6klwTPae_pOM-aPnusQ-7taTTHHXcV3knsBxpl1boHfEFumrOfXZigYa0kti6H4K0JPvkpEpC3IOlHXj-SnYvPhf1RQ2lSmW0zOxFIo-rv8snT7FOLJF?key=Yrtm75ZzgcMcjAeui5ZPpzJb" alt="" loading="lazy" width="444" height="553"></figure><p>On their Y Combinator profile, Baid and Mohta outline who gets what out of installing micromanaging AI surveillance on assembly lines. Owners gets “accurate real-time factory, line, and worker productivity metrics,” production heads get “line-wise and worker-wise metrics,” shopfloor supervisors get to “identify who/what is causing inefficiency in the line and fix the problem on the go.” For the workers? They get the tantalizing benefit of being “held accountable for good or bad performance.”&nbsp;</p><p>Worker surveillance is already happening across industries. After the rise of remote work, companies started tracking workers’ productivity based on mouse movements, so <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/mouse-mover-jiggler-app-keep-screen-on-active/?ref=404media.co"><u>workers started using “mouse jigglers”</u></a> so they could walk away from their computers and use the bathroom in peace. In Amazon warehouses, workers <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/internal-documents-show-amazons-dystopian-system-for-tracking-workers-every-minute-of-their-shifts/?ref=404media.co"><u>are tracked and punished</u></a> for not meeting grueling expectations and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64384287?ref=404media.co"><u>bathroom breaks are timed</u></a>, resulting in <a href="https://www.oxfamamerica.org/press/press-releases/amazon-and-walmarts-excessive-warehouse-surveillance-erodes-workers-rights-seriously-harms-worker-health-and-safety/?ref=404media.co"><u>more injuries and less safe working conditions</u></a>. Optifye.ai’s approach and pitch, however, stands out because of the way its founders seem to embrace cruelty to workers in the name of productivity.</p><p>Optifye.ai and Y Combinator did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">A demo from Optifye.ai, a member of Y Combinator’s current cohort, sparked a social media backlash that ended up with YC deleting it off its socials.</p>

<p>Optifye says it’s building software to help factory owners know who’s working — and who isn’t — in “real-time” thanks to AI-powered security cameras it places on assembly lines, according to <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/MsF-optifye-ai-ai-performance-monitoring-for-factory-workers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">its YC profile</a>.</p>







<p>On Monday, YC posted an <a href="https://www.optifye.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Optifye</a> demo video <a href="https://x.com/ycombinator/status/1894115085087297921" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on X</a> (and on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7300050840852086786/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>), according to a snapshot saved by TechCrunch.</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfTMq-ODhXLtY2JDWikMdXdp6o4jlLkHg5xXTYDREiRWqkcSWBGIgLdQCgQYjZKd2V8GcrW3of_qFAGFUa2We8LRxxKuHu6YHhDqkFZGVPf-Ff3qR5gg3rk4cpOeip04-U_WOMuMA?key=C-bSOu1zTaIchlPR-5L0iKfx" alt=""></figure>

<p><a href="https://x.com/AdamLerman5/status/1894215433366245457" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The video</a> shows Optifye co-founder Kushal Mohta acting as the boss of a garment factory, calling a supervisor — in reality his co-founder Vivaan Baid — about a low-performing worker known only as “Number 17.”</p>

<p>“Hey Number 17, what’s going on man? You’re in the red,” Baid asks the worker, who responds that he’s been working all day.</p>

<p>“Working all day? You haven’t hit your hourly output even once and you had 11.4% efficiency. This is really bad,” Baid retorts.</p>

<p>After checking Optifye’s dashboard, the supervisor looks at the output of “Number 17” for 15 days, decides that the worker has been underperforming and calls the worker out on it.&nbsp;</p>


<p>“Rough day? More like a rough month,” he says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The clip was heavily criticized on X, where @VCBrags <a href="https://x.com/vcbrags/status/1894454286370709858?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">called it</a> “sweatshops-as-a-service” and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/miranda_nover/status/1894197679447838954">another</a> deemed it “computer vision sweatshop software.” It also <a href="https://x.com/miranda_nover/status/1894197679447838954" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sparked criticism</a> on Y Combinator’s own link sharing site Hacker News.</p>

<p>Not everyone was critical, though. Eoghan McCabe, the CEO of customer support startup Intercom, <a href="https://x.com/eoghan/status/1894412092415017270" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted that</a> anyone complaining better stop buying products made in China and India.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Indeed, it’s not too difficult to find tech companies in China <a href="https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1816116508256549836&amp;wfr=spider&amp;for=pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">touting</a> a “sleep detection” camera that uses computer vision to spot sleeping workers, for example.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Either way, YC ended up deleting the demo video from its socials, but not before it was <a href="https://x.com/archiexzzz/status/1894285551064285449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">saved</a> by <a href="https://x.com/cdolan92/status/1894216778126959027" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">several</a> accounts.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Neither YC nor Optifye.ai responded to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The video’s likely unintended virality showcases growing anxieties over the rise of AI, especially in the workplace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most Americans oppose using AI to track workers’ desk time, movements, and computer use, a Pew poll <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/04/20/americans-views-on-use-of-ai-to-monitor-and-evaluate-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">found in 2023</a>. This is a segment of surveillance products sometimes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/20/ai-mistakes-bossware/">called “bossware.”</a></p>

<p>That hasn’t stopped VCs from funding the space, though. Invisible AI, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/28/invisible-ai-raises-15m-to-stick-worker-monitoring-cameras-in-factories/">raised $15 million in 2022</a> to stick worker-monitoring cameras in factories, too. </p>

<p>Protests at Tesla stores are gaining momentum across the US as people are fighting back against Elon Musk’s government takeover, and the hate is spreading to owners.</p>



<p>Last week, we reported on a new effort to organize protests at Tesla stores worldwide, but primarily in North America.</p>



<p>There were significant turnouts to disrupt Tesla operations by picketing in front of dozens of stores.</p>



<p>But the movement is ongoing, and there were protests against this weekend and <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/event_campaigns/teslatakedown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more planned for the coming weeks</a>:</p>

<p>Many of the protests from this weekend appeared to be bigger than the last ones.</p>



<p>There was a big turnout at a Tesla store in Seattle that reportedly ended up closing the location:</p>

<p>There were reportedly as many as 200 people who gathered to protest Elon Musk at the Fort Lauderdale store in Florida:</p>

<p>There are dozens of similar examples at Tesla stores all around the US and Canada, and the movement is now spreading to Europe.</p>



<p>These protests have been peaceful, and people are justifying going after Tesla for being Elon Musk’s piggy bank.</p>



<p>However, the growing negative sentiment against Tesla also attracts criminal activities like vandalism, and sometimes against Tesla owners rather the company itself.</p>



<p>Tesla owners, especially Cybertruck owners, have been increasingly reporting animosity from other road users, and in some cases, Tesla vehicles are getting tagged by anti-fascism graffiti.</p>



<p>In one case in California, a vandal put isolating foam into the charge connectors of a few charging stalls, rendering them useless.</p>

	<p>A couple of Supercharger stalls in Utah were graffitied—pictured above. Tesla said that it would remove the graffiti today and that it will “press charges for vandalism at Superchargers.”</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>The blowback is more significant than I thought it would be. I thought things would end last weekend, but not only was this weekend’s protest bigger, but it sounds like now there are more being planned.</p>



<p>I couldn’t confirm if they were indeed able to close the store in Seattle, but if that’s true, that’s also a direct impact on Tesla’s operation.</p>



<p>It’s just sad that some vandals are going after Tesla owners. That’s just stupid to me. A</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">DeepGEMM</h2><a id="user-content-deepgemm" aria-label="Permalink: DeepGEMM" href="#deepgemm"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">DeepGEMM is a library designed for clean and efficient FP8 General Matrix Multiplications (GEMMs) with fine-grained scaling, as proposed in <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3">DeepSeek-V3</a>. It supports both normal and Mix-of-Experts (MoE) grouped GEMMs. Written in CUDA, the library has no compilation need during installation, by compiling all kernels at runtime using a lightweight Just-In-Time (JIT) module.</p>
<p dir="auto">Currently, DeepGEMM exclusively supports NVIDIA Hopper tensor cores. To address the imprecise FP8 tensor core accumulation, it employs CUDA-core two-level accumulation (promotion). While it leverages some concepts from <a href="https://github.com/nvidia/cutlass">CUTLASS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/tree/main/include/cute">CuTe</a>, it avoids heavy reliance on their templates or algebras. Instead, the library is designed for simplicity, with only one core kernel function comprising around <strong>~300 lines of code</strong>. This makes it a clean and accessible resource for learning Hopper FP8 matrix multiplication and optimization techniques.</p>
<p dir="auto">Despite its lightweight design, DeepGEMM's performance matches or exceeds expert-tuned libraries across various matrix shapes.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Performance</h2><a id="user-content-performance" aria-label="Permalink: Performance" href="#performance"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We test all shapes potentially used in DeepSeek-V3/R1 inference (including both prefilling and decoding, but without tensor parallelism) on H800 with NVCC 12.8. All speedup metrics are calculated in comparison to our internally and carefully optimized implementation based on CUTLASS 3.6.</p>
<p dir="auto">DeepGEMM does not behavior very well on some shapes, optimization PRs are welcomed if you are interested.</p>

<p dir="auto">This library exclusively contains GEMM kernels. It requires the LHS scaling factor to be TMA-aligned and transposed, and it only supports the NT format (non-transposed LHS and transposed RHS). For transposition or other FP8 casting operations, please implement or fuse them into prior kernels independently. While the library provides some simple PyTorch utility functions, these may result in slower performance, but our primary focus is on optimizing the GEMM kernels themselves.</p>

<p dir="auto">To perform a basic non-grouped FP8 GEMM, call the <code>deep_gemm.gemm_fp8_fp8_bf16_nt</code> function. For more details, please refer to the function documentation.</p>

<p dir="auto">Unlike traditional grouped GEMMs in CUTLASS, DeepGEMM groups only the M-axis, while N and K must remain fixed. This design is tailored for scenarios where experts in an MoE model share the same shape.</p>
<p dir="auto">For training forward passes or inference prefilling, where each expert may process a varying number of tokens, we concatenate these tokens into a single tensor, referred to as the "contiguous" layout. Note that each expert segment must be aligned to the GEMM M block size (<code>get_m_alignment_for_contiguous_layout()</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto">For more information, please refer to the <code>m_grouped_gemm_fp8_fp8_bf16_nt_contiguous</code> function documentation.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Grouped GEMMs (masked layout)</h4><a id="user-content-grouped-gemms-masked-layout" aria-label="Permalink: Grouped GEMMs (masked layout)" href="#grouped-gemms-masked-layout"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">During the inference decoding phase, when CUDA graph is enabled and the CPU is unaware of the number of tokens each expert receives, we support masked grouped GEMMs. By providing a mask tensor, the kernel computes only the valid portions.</p>
<p dir="auto">Use <code>m_grouped_gemm_fp8_fp8_bf16_nt_masked</code> for this purpose and consult the relevant documentation. An example usage is to use the output of low-latency kernels from <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepEP">DeepEP</a> as input.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Utilities</h4><a id="user-content-utilities" aria-label="Permalink: Utilities" href="#utilities"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The library provides some utility functions besides the above kernels:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>deep_gemm.set_num_sms</code>: set the maximum SM count to use</li>
<li><code>deep_gemm.get_num_sms</code>: get the current SM maximum count</li>

<li><code>deep_gemm.get_col_major_tma_aligned_tensor</code>: get a column-major TMA-aligned tensor</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The library also provides some environment variables, which may be useful:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>DG_CACHE_DIR</code>: string, the cache directory to store compiled kernels, <code>$HOME/.deep_gemm</code> by default</li>
<li><code>DG_NVCC_COMPILER</code>: string, specified NVCC compiler path; will find in <code>from torch.utils.cpp_extension.CUDA_HOME</code> by default</li>

All kernels are compiled at runtime using a lightweight JIT implementation. This approach offers several advantages:</p>

<p dir="auto">For certain shapes, block sizes aligned to powers of 2 can lead to underutilized SMs. For instance, with <code>M=256, N=7168</code>, a typical block size assignment of <code>BLOCK_M=128, BLOCK_N=128</code> results in only <code>(256 / 128) * (7168 / 128) = 112</code> out of 132 SMs being utilized. To address this, we support unaligned block sizes like 112, enabling <code>(256 / 128) * (7168 / 112) = 128</code> SMs to work in such scenarios. Implementing this technique alongside fine-grained scaling requires careful optimization but ultimately delivers performance gains.</p>

<p dir="auto">We observe a performance improvement in <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/tree/main/examples/54_hopper_fp8_warp_specialized_gemm">the CUTLASS FP8 kernel</a> between NVCC 12.2 and 12.3. By comparing the compiled SASS, we discover that one bit in <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/blob/eefa171318b79cbe2e78514d4cce5cd0fe919d0c/include/cutlass/gemm/collective/fp8_accumulation.hpp#L73">a series of <code>FADD</code> instructions</a> is flipped in an interleaving pattern.
After referencing some open-source <a href="https://github.com/cloudcores/CuAssembler/blob/master/CuAsm/CuControlCode.py#L46">CUDA assembler</a> implementations, we identified that this bit controls <code>yield</code>, which may enhance warp-level parallelism (just a guess, yielding the current warp and let other warps work).</p>
<p dir="auto">To leverage this, we develop <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepGEMM/blob/main/deep_gemm/jit/interleave_ffma.py">a similar script</a> to modify the <code>FFMA</code> instructions in the compiled binary. Besides simply modifying the <code>yield</code> bit, we also flip the <code>reuse</code> bit (registers cannot be reused if the warp is yielded). This adjustment improves performance (10%+ in some cases) for fine-grained scaling FP8 GEMMs by creating more opportunities to overlap MMA instructions with promotion <code>FFMA</code> instructions.</p>
