<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Ever since I built my first NixOS system (I started by building a custom image to upload on DigitalOcean), I’ve been bothered by one thing:
the default installation size is large.
To give you an idea, this simple system (using flakes):</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
    system = "x86_64-linux";
    modules = [
        (nixpkgs.outPath + "/nixos/modules/profiles/minimal.nix")
        (nixpkgs.outPath + "/nixos/modules/profiles/headless.nix")
        {
            fileSystems."/".device = "/dev/sda1";
            boot.loader.systemd-boot.enable = true;
        }
    ];
}
</code></pre><p>ends up taking ~900MB of disk size on my system<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>!
Minimal and headless!</p>
<p>When I started working on improving this, I expected the eventual blog post to be very different than what it became, but you can’t win everything in life.
There’s a bit of pain ahead.</p>
<h2 id="the-context">The context</h2>
<p>I really like Nix and NixOS (I wouldn’t be spending time <a href="https://sidhion.com/blog/posts/joining-nix-documentation/">helping with their documentation</a> otherwise).
After spending some time managing NixOS servers, I really can’t see myself going back to other systems unless required by some external factor.
I’m also working on a system that has worker machines which will spin up a bunch of microVMs.</p>
<p>Naturally, I wanted to use NixOS both for the worker machines and the microVMs themselves.
Currently, the system on the microVMs is taking ~210MB (including kernel) of disk space, but it’s based on <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/">Alpine</a>.
The worker machines are already using NixOS, but I’d like them to be as lean as possible.</p>
<p>NixOS makes it very simple to manage a server from the outside.
You can push an entirely new system configuration without the server changing its behaviour, and then almost atomically switch the server to the new configuration.
You can easily configure the whole thing deterministically, deploy the same configuration to multiple servers, and even deploy the same configuration under a VM so you can locally test things if you wish to.</p>
<p>I envisioned a world where all my worker machines ran the bare minimum software required for things to work, which would be an amazing help to lock the system down, prevent any escalations in case some piece of software was broken into, and would also make deployments and tests faster.</p>
<p>And if I could achieve something like that on those machines, why not extend this to the OS running on the microVMs and keep things really lean?
This would be super helpful to cut boot times as much as possible, short of using a unikernel.</p>
<p>I knew from my previous experience with NixOS that it didn’t generate lean images by default, so a couple days ago I started looking into this to see if I could fix things, or at least significantly improve them.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> what follows is an analysis of NixOS specifically for the purposes stated here.
I don’t really care about having some runtime-flexible server OS which lets me install packages and configure things ad-hoc, I want a thin, locked-down server with the single purpose of running the software I declare, and not a single extra tool in it.
(yes, I know I essentially want containers without containers.
I comment on this at the end.)</p>
<h2 id="figuring-out-package-dependencies-and-their-sizes">Figuring out package dependencies and their sizes</h2>
<p>A curious thing about the Nix ecosystem is that it has some pretty powerful tools, but they’re severely underdocumented, sometimes functionality is hidden by their naming, and/or some tools have some really specific assumptions, which makes it harder to use them more generally.</p>
<p>One such tool is <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/nix-store/query"><code>nix-store --query</code></a> (to be honest, it is way more known than some other more “obscure” tools).
More specifically, <code>nix-store --query --tree</code> will give you a tree of packages<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, starting from a package you specify, and show you the dependencies of that package, and their dependencies, and so on…
Running it will give you some output like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>/nix/store/g4ppw7x76dyykj33x99xzf30zq5ym29z-nixos-system-nixos-24.05.20240323.44d0940

</code></pre><p>To complement that, <code>nix-store --query --size</code> gives you (roughly) the size that a specific package takes on disk.
It’s slightly more complicated than this, but for our purposes it will be enough to understand how much disk is used.</p>
<p>There are some tools which help visualise all this information in cool ways.
Two of my favorites are <a href="https://github.com/utdemir/nix-tree">nix-tree</a> and <a href="https://github.com/craigmbooth/nix-visualize">nix-visualize</a>.
However, ideally I wanted an interactive graph so I could see each node in the graph by their size on disk, and inspect their dependencies, search things, and so on.
nix-visualize was the closest of the tools to give me a graph, but it wasn’t interactive and the node sizes weren’t based on disk usage, so I decided to write my own.</p>
<p>It took me some hours to come up with code that generated a <a href="https://graphviz.org/">graphviz</a> file, with node sizes based on disk usage.
Coupled with <a href="https://github.com/tintinweb/vscode-interactive-graphviz">vscode-interactive-graphviz</a>, I felt like I had a good approach to interactively working with the graph, but the visualisations turned out to be too crowded.
I tried to add some more space into things, but it was kind of a hack because graphviz likes to be the one to position elements.
In the end, I gave up on that idea and decided to just generate a CSV, which worked way better than I expected.
No wonder we still use spreadsheets for a lot of things!</p>
<p>The repository with the code and the final config of the NixOS system from this post is <a href="https://github.com/DanielSidhion/nixos-investigation">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="an-investigation-of-a-minimal-headless-nixos-system">An investigation of a minimal, headless NixOS system</h2>
<p>With a way to see each package, its disk usage, and all its dependencies, let’s look at the minimal, headless system I mentioned in the beginning of the post.
The one that takes ~900MB.</p>
<figure><img src="https://sidhion.com/nixos_bare_starting.png" alt="A list of the heaviest packages by disk usage, viewed with the Edit csv extension for VSCode"><figcaption>
<p>A list of the heaviest packages by disk usage, viewed with the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=janisdd.vscode-edit-csv">Edit csv</a> extension for VSCode</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Each subsection below will be a small report of me investigating some items in this CSV<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.
It starts “easy” and gets progressively more complicated.
Feel free to skim and skip any part if you don’t feel like it.</p>
<h2 id="getting-rid-of-nix-179mb-reduction">Getting rid of Nix (~179MB reduction)</h2>
<p>The heaviest item in that list is a mysterious “source” package.
A quick look into what the heck could be taking 170MB of disk space shows it’s actually a complete copy of Nixpkgs!</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>❯ ls /nix/store/amxd2p02wx78nyaa4bkb0hjvgwhz1dq7-source
CONTRIBUTING.md  README.md    doc        lib          nixos
COPYING          default.nix  flake.nix  maintainers  pkgs
</code></pre><p>Searching for that package’s <code>pos</code> (just an identifier I used in the code that generates the CSV and the graphviz files) shows that it’s only used by this other package:</p>
<p><img src="https://sidhion.com/etc_nix_registry.png" alt="etc-nix-registry.json using that package"></p>
<p>That package is a single file which doesn’t have a lot in it other than a link to the “source” package.
A search through Nixpkgs shows the file coming from <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/05677341df3102d5387629b7855afeff6069a6f3/nixos/modules/config/nix-flakes.nix#L90">here</a>, the actual content of <code>registry</code> coming from <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/6f414604e2a627ae3d8bc8f58573d8b50fb16829/nixos/modules/misc/nixpkgs-flake.nix#L91-L94">here</a>, and the <code>source</code> attribute being set <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/6f414604e2a627ae3d8bc8f58573d8b50fb16829/flake.nix#L39">here</a>.</p>
<p>I’m building this system with flakes and I’m using that <code>nixosSystem</code> function from Nixpkgs’s <code>flake.nix</code>, which means by default I get this extra 170MB in the system.
I <em>think</em> it would’ve been easy to just undo what Nixpkgs’s <code>flake.nix</code> is doing, but if you look at the list of the heaviest packages again, you’ll see that Nix itself is the 10th heaviest package in the system.</p>
<p>Nix also pulls a lot of dependencies, each one taking quite some space as well (for example, <code>aws-sdk-cpp-1.11.207</code> eats another 5.7MB by itself, and is <strong>only</strong> used by Nix).</p>
<p>After some thinking, I realised that I don’t need Nix in any of these systems.
I definitely don’t need it in a microVM, but I also don’t need it in my servers, because I’m building their configurations in an external machine and deploying the built bits directly.
So let’s add this to the system configuration:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>nix.enable = false;
</code></pre><p>After rebuilding the system, we’re at ~733MB.</p>
<h2 id="getting-rid-of-perl-python-242mb-reduction">Getting rid of Perl, Python (~242MB reduction)</h2>
<p>After removing Nix, the 2nd heaviest package is Python3, and 3rd is Perl.</p>
<p>Python only comes in because of <code>install-systemd-boot.sh</code> (truly a shame, why waste so much disk space like this!), and Perl comes in through a bunch of perl-envs (search for <code>perl-5.38.2-env</code> in the CSV and you’ll see them).
Those perl-envs are all used in the top-level package, so let’s figure out where they’re being used there:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>❯ grep -nr 'perl-5.38.2-env' /nix/store/7z0y5sscnpx4hczzkjh3jvjgn2mq3106-nixos-system-nixos-24.05.20240323.44d0940

</code></pre><p>To make it easier to parse this bunch of text:
Perl is used in the <code>dry-activate</code>, <code>activate</code>, and <code>bin/switch-to-configuration</code> scripts.
<code>dry-activate</code> only needs Perl to run the <code>update-users-groups.pl</code> script, while the <code>activate</code> script runs the same script and also <code>setup-etc.pl</code>, and <code>bin/switch-to-configuration</code> is a Perl script from the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> the minimal profile disables man pages and most other documentation bits, but the perl man pages are the only thing that still get included in the system because of the perl-envs!</p>
<p>I thought Perl was going to be hard to remove, but I was determined to at least take a look.
After all, judging only by the naming, <code>update-users-groups.pl</code> doesn’t seem like the kind of thing I need - I don’t expect my servers to create any extra users or groups dynamically, so there’s nothing to update.</p>
<p>(note that I have no idea what <code>update-users-groups.pl</code> actually does, this was just my thinking from reading its name)</p>
<p>I decided to search Nixpkgs for that script name to get an idea of how it was being added to the system.
It was through this search that I stumbled upon a Nixpkgs tracking issue called <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/267982">Perlless Activation - Tracking Issue</a>.</p>
<p>Someone decided it wasn’t a good idea to have Perl in the base NixOS system for slightly different reasons, and they did a lot of work to get rid of it!
Luckily for me, I could piggyback off their work and include the following module in my system configuration:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>modules = [
    ...
    (nixpkgs.outPath + "/nixos/modules/profiles/perlless.nix")
];
</code></pre><p>After rebuilding the system, we’re at ~491MB.
As a bonus, Python is now gone as well!</p>
<h2 id="deduplicating-systemd-14mb-reduction">Deduplicating systemd (~14MB reduction)</h2>
<p>systemd is now the 2nd heaviest package.
It has some stuff inside that I think could be removed, but since it’s an integral part of the system, let’s overlook it for now.
Going through the list of packages, what’s this in 5th place?</p>
<p><img src="https://sidhion.com/systemd_minimal.png" alt="systemd-minimal is also in the list of packages!"></p>
<p>For some reason, our NixOS system has both systemd <strong>and</strong> systemd-minimal!
A look through which packages use systemd-minimal show that only dbus uses it.
It comes from <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/71c7097220cf92a2b005d82904afc590e05b3a5a/pkgs/development/libraries/dbus/default.nix#L7">here</a>.</p>
<p>Nixpkgs has a lot of packages, and sometimes due to circular dependencies or to keep the size of dependencies smaller, it introduces variants of packages/functions that have reduced functionality.
If you contribute to Nixpkgs, chances are that at some point, someone will give some feedback on ways you can use variants that have a smaller dependency chain, or smaller size (a common example is using <code>stdenvNoCC</code> instead of <code>stdenv</code>).
systemd-minimal probably exists to avoid certain circular dependencies, but I’m not sure.
It’s defined <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/2726f127c15a4cc9810843b96cad73c7eb39e443/pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix#L28207-L28251">here</a>.</p>
<p>In any case, I’d like to get rid of systemd-minimal, since we already have the full systemd in our system anyway.
There is no easy way to override the package used by the NixOS module that brings in dbus, so we’ll have to add a <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#chap-overlays">Nixpkgs overlay</a> to change the dbus package directly:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>nixpkgs.overlays = [
(
    self: super:
    {
        dbus = super.dbus.override {
            systemdMinimal = self.systemd;
        };
    }
)
];
</code></pre><p>After rebuilding the system, we’re now at ~477MB.</p>
<h2 id="removing-udev-lvm-sudo-and-security-wrappers-30mb-reduction">Removing udev, lvm, sudo and security wrappers (~30MB reduction)</h2>
<p>This is where things start to get very messy.
While looking through the list of heaviest packages, I saw an “hwdb.bin” package which seems linked to udev.
I don’t know about udev too much, but it feels like it’s only needed for scenarios that won’t happen on the kind of servers I want to manage.</p>
<p>In case it is actually used for something important and this breaks the system, I have a feeling that a workaround could be hard-coded and wouldn’t require udev anyway.
I’d gladly go into that rabbit hole, but (spoiler alert) you’ll see that I gave up well before that.</p>
<p>There’s an option to disable it:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>services.udev.enable = false;
</code></pre><p>While looking through the stuff adjacent to udev, I noticed that lvm is also enabled by default.
Similar reasoning to udev, I don’t think I’d need lvm for these servers, so I disabled it.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>services.lvm.enable = false;
</code></pre><p>Before proceeding with more of this, I took a break and looked at some more packages in the list.
At that point, it became clear that I’d have to butcher a LOT of NixOS config to remove many packages in there.
I made a decision to continue with this exercise, but make it less about keeping a working system throughout and more about understanding the efforts to just get rid of some of these packages.
To get to a barebones system, I’d need to remove a lot of them.</p>
<p>While looking through the lvm stuff, I noticed fuse2 and fuse3 are hard-coded by default (and changing those gets complicated quickly).
I saw they’re used by some security wrappers, which also set other security wrappers for mount, umount, sudo, and a bunch of other binaries.
This is needed because Nix doesn’t support sid/gid binaries by design, so NixOS has a binary that dynamically sets some capabilities and permissions, and then executes any other binary with the elevated bits.</p>
<p>I don’t like having this functionality.
Instead of a single wrapper binary which receives an argument with the binary to execute with elevated permissions, I’d rather have X wrapper binaries with hardcoded paths and no parametrisation of any kind (one for each of the X things I want to execute), and that’s only IF I actually need this functionality.</p>
<p>For anything I want to run in these servers, I think I can configure the proper permissions through systemd unit configs.</p>
<p>The security wrappers module doesn’t have an <code>enable</code> option to toggle it off, so one way to get rid of it completely is to add it to the <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/unstable/#sec-replace-modules"><code>disabledModules</code> attribute</a>.
This requires me to provide dummy options that were provided by the security wrappers module earlier, because when building a NixOS system, by default <strong>every module</strong> gets evaluated (most of them just won’t do anything because they’re not enabled).
Some of these modules set additional wrappers, so the dummy options are needed to make the module system happy.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>({ lib, pkgs, ... }: {
    disabledModules = [ "security/wrappers/default.nix" ];

    options.security = {
        wrappers = lib.mkOption {
            type = lib.types.attrs;
            default = { };
        };
        wrapperDir = lib.mkOption {
            type = lib.types.path;
            default = "/run/wrappers/bin";
        };
    };

    config = {
        # ...
    };
})
</code></pre><p>I <em>think</em> doing this could break some script that calls mount or umount or fuse (because those are hardcoded in the security wrappers module), but I also think that most scripts that use those are being run directly as root, so I’m not sure.</p>
<p>To finish this section, let’s also disable sudo completely because it’s useless without its security wrapper.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>security.sudo.enable = false;
</code></pre><p>We’re at ~447MB now.</p>
<h2 id="some-other-minimal-shenanigans">Some other minimal shenanigans</h2>
<p>At this point, the 10th and 11st heaviest packages are util-linux and util-linux-minimal, respectively.
Well, this seems similar to that systemd-minimal thing from a while ago!</p>
<p>Let’s look at where these are being used:</p>
<ul>
<li>util-linux
<ul>
<li>system-path, a bunch of systemd services and a “mount-pstore” shell script.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>util-linux-minimal
<ul>
<li>fuse2 and fuse3, and etc-systemd-system.conf</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Removing fuse is very annoying (although to be honest, with all the mess in the config so far, it wouldn’t even look that bad anymore).
But we can at least try to make them use util-linux instead of util-linux-minimal, right?</p>
<p>To get there, let’s look at how these packages <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/6504cbb171517dc371c40b502a55fe4a32aad6d1/pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix#L27345-L27349">are declared in <code>all-packages.nix</code></a>.
We’ll need an overlay, but trying to change <code>fusePackages</code> to use the normal util-linux will hit an infinite recursion error, so I’ll start by overlaying <code>fuse3</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>nixpkgs.overlays = [(
    self: super: {
        fuse3 = (self.lib.dontRecurseIntoAttrs (self.callPackage (nixpkgs.outPath + "/pkgs/os-specific/linux/fuse") { })).fuse_3;
    }
)];
</code></pre><p>This builds nicely, but the moment I try to do this with fuse2, the infinite recursion error is back.
<em>Sigh</em>.
Whatever.</p>
<p>Browsing through the list of packages, I also see systemd-minimal-libs sneaking in there.
It’s being used by a bunch of other packages, and it’s equally difficult to add more overlays to get rid of it.
Infinite recursions all around.</p>
<p>This is where I look at the current system config, look at all the notes I made of things to look into that I haven’t yet (the list is right there in the next section), think about how much worse it’ll get by trying to fix all of this, and give up.</p>
<h2 id="things-i-noted-but-didnt-look-at">Things I noted, but didn’t look at</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>With Nix gone, the heaviest package was the linux kernel at ~136MB.
I know I can get it down to ~50MB easily (the kernel used by default on NixOS has a lot of modules and extra things that a server doesn’t need), so I left that for later because it was easy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One disadvantage of a perlless system is that it can’t switch to a different configuration at runtime, because the script that does this is written in Perl.
This isn’t an issue for most of the servers in my scenario.
MicroVMs don’t need that, and I’d be perfectly ok just killing a bunch of other servers and starting new ones with the updated configuration.</p>
<p>However, I made a note to look into that perl script and figure out how much work it would be to build a replacement.
This is something that needs to happen anyway at some point, and would benefit the NixOS community at large.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bunch of packages build with all locales and some internationalisation content.
Those end up taking some good space, so I made a note to look at how to simplify this and get rid of most of the locales and files I wouldn’t need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system has both libressl and openssl packages.
libressl is only used for netcat, but I don’t really need it in the servers.
In fact, NixOS includes a lot of utilities by default (and marks them as required, making it super annoying to remove them) which aren’t really needed on the servers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bunch of extra default config files that aren’t needed (such as bashrc) could be removed.
This would also remove some packages that they use, such as bash-completion, which won’t ever be needed in the servers.</p>

<p>coreutils and util-linux are both kind of heavy, but it’s very likely that the scripts and things that use them only really need a few binaries from each one.
Perhaps an overlay that filters the binaries only to the list that are used would help free up quite a bunch of disk space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>nix-store</code> has a command to <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/nix-store/optimise">optimise</a> disk space by finding identical files and hard-linking them.
This could be helpful in some cases, but might not be possible in others, depending on how a server is imaged, or how new configuration gets pushed to it.
It could be useful to decrease the disk space used by some of those “-minimal” packages (as long as they share exactly the same file).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="leaving-this-to-the-future">Leaving this to the future</h2>
<p>There is a huge audience that uses NixOS as a personal OS, and a lot of the defaults and modules present in NixOS reflect that.
NixOS can still be used as a server OS, but it requires a very different set of configurations, and it still ends up not being adequate in every situation.</p>
<p>I can (and will) still apply many of the configs I used in this post to my existing servers and make them leaner, which will already be useful, because it cuts ~300MB of stuff I don’t need.
I got some experience and figured out some tools to help me investigate these issues more whenever I feel the need to.</p>
<p>But over the 2 days I spent looking at this, I concluded that trying to mold NixOS into the shape I envisioned just isn’t the way to go, but I also don’t like the other option if I want to stick with it, which is creating a “fork” of NixOS that is <strong>very</strong> opinionated and completely focused on server scenarios.</p>
<p>I was trying to bring NixOS to a bare minimum, which is an exercise similar to building containers with the bare minimum required for the software in the container to run.
I think this is a worthy endeavour.
I think we have all the tools in regular non-docker, non-kubernetes linux to get to a similar outcome, except we won’t need docker or kubernetes or whatever in this new land, thus removing quite a bunch of complexity from the systems we build.</p>
<p>But doing it on top of NixOS currently feels like a bad path to take.</p>

</h2>
<p>Today (September 17th, 2024), we introduce <a rel="nofollow" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11402">NVLM 1.0</a>, a family of frontier-class multimodal large language models (LLMs) that achieve state-of-the-art results on vision-language tasks, rivaling the leading proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-access models (e.g., Llama 3-V 405B and InternVL 2). Remarkably, NVLM 1.0 shows improved text-only performance over its LLM backbone after multimodal training. </p>
<p>In this repo, we are open-sourcing NVLM-1.0-D-72B (decoder-only architecture), the decoder-only model weights and code for the community.</p>

		Benchmark Results

</h2>
<p>We train our model with legacy <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM/tree/main/megatron/legacy">Megatron-LM</a> and adapt the codebase to Huggingface for model hosting, reproducibility, and inference.
We observe numerical differences between the Megatron and Huggingface codebases, which are within the expected range of variation. 
We provide the results from both the Huggingface codebase and the Megatron codebase for reproducibility and comparison with other models.</p>
<p>Results (as of September 17th, 2024) in the multimodal benchmarks are as follows:</p>

Consider it a mirror image of the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Needham#The_Needham_Question" rel="">Needham Question</a><span>: Joseph Needham famously wondered why it was that, despite having a vastly larger population and GDP, Imperial China nevertheless lost out scientifically to the West. (I examined this question at some length in </span><a href="https://www.thepsmiths.com/p/review-science-in-traditional-china" rel="">this review</a><span>.) Well, with the Soviets it all went in the opposite direction: they had a smaller population, a worse starting industrial base, a lower GDP, and a vastly less efficient economic system. How, then, did they maintain military and technological parity</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-149130375" href="https://www.thepsmiths.com/p/review-math-from-three-to-seven-by#footnote-1-149130375" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> with the United States for so long?</span></p><p>The puzzle was partly solved for me, but partly deepened, when those of us who grew up in the ‘90s and ‘00s encountered the vast wave of former Soviet émigrés that washed up in the United States after the fall of communism. Anybody who played competitive chess back then, or who participated in math competitions, knows what I’m talking about: the sinking feeling you got upon seeing that your opponent had a Russian name. These days, the same scenes are dominated by Chinese and Indian kids. But China and India have large populations — the Russians were punching way about their weight, demographically speaking. Today, those same Russians are all over Wall Street and Silicon Valley and Ivy League math departments, still overrepresented in technical fields. What explains it? Are Russians just naturally better at math and physics?</p><p><span>When I related these questions to an Ashkenazi-supremacist friend of mine, he immediately suggested that “maybe it’s because they’re all Jewish.” (I’ve noticed that the most philosemitic people and the most antisemitic people sometimes have curiously similar models of the world, they just disagree on whether it’s a good thing.) My friend’s question wasn’t crazy, since there are definitely times when asking “were they all Jewish?” </span><a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/05/26/the-atomic-bomb-considered-as-hungarian-high-school-science-fair-project/" rel="">yields an affirmative answer</a><span>. But in this case I had to disappoint him with the knowledge that many of these Russian math and chess superstars were gentiles.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-149130375" href="https://www.thepsmiths.com/p/review-math-from-three-to-seven-by#footnote-2-149130375" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> What’s more, by the ‘60s and ‘70s the Soviets had </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.1556" rel="">an entire discriminatory apparatus</a><span> dedicated to keeping Jews out of the scientific establishment, so it would be impressive indeed if they were the foundation of its success.</span></p><p><span>Another possible explanation actually hinges on the relative poverty of the Soviet Union. Assume there are a lot of people out there with natural mathematical talent, but who given their druthers would major in underwater basket-weaving instead. The United States, because it’s so wealthy, can afford to “waste” a huge proportion of our talented population on humanities, arts, and other stuff that doesn’t involve you sitting in the school library until 3am. In other words, </span><em>not</em><span> going into a technical field is a form of luxury, which America can afford to consume. The Soviets, rather like the Chinese today, were forced by their underdog status to allocate human capital more efficiently (and had the authoritarian means to do so by force if necessary). This theory is related to the curious fact that, on average, </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/02/the-more-gender-equality-the-fewer-women-in-stem/553592/" rel="">the more feminist your society, the fewer women there are in math and science</a><span> — which makes total sense if you assume that on average women are good at math but uninterested in it.</span></p><p><span>The thing is, the émigré superstars I encountered didn’t seem at all grudging or resentful about their studies. If anything it was the opposite. I’ve </span><a href="https://www.thepsmiths.com/p/joint-review-who-we-are-and-how-we" rel="">previously complained</a><span> about how much I hate Russian mathematician Edward Frenkel’s</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-149130375" href="https://www.thepsmiths.com/p/review-math-from-three-to-seven-by#footnote-3-149130375" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span><span> book, but one thing it gets across well is just how important </span><em>passion</em><span> is to being a great mathematician, and passion was the thing the émigrés seemed to have a surfeit of. In college, the joke was that seminars by American professors would last an hour, whereas seminars by Russian professors would turn into boisterous debates lasting all night. People have been writing for centuries about Russians having a tendency towards “maximalism” — whether aesthetic or ideological or anything else. Maybe a culture-wide commitment to not doing anything by half-measures explains it?</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca929aa2-a7d2-4837-8156-cd02da28136f_1380x776.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca929aa2-a7d2-4837-8156-cd02da28136f_1380x776.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca929aa2-a7d2-4837-8156-cd02da28136f_1380x776.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca929aa2-a7d2-4837-8156-cd02da28136f_1380x776.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca929aa2-a7d2-4837-8156-cd02da28136f_1380x776.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca929aa2-a7d2-4837-8156-cd02da28136f_1380x776.jpeg" width="1380" height="776" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ca929aa2-a7d2-4837-8156-cd02da28136f_1380x776.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:776,&quot;width&quot;:1380,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Math chalkboard - Clark Butler&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="Math chalkboard - Clark Butler" title="Math chalkboard - Clark Butler" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca929aa2-a7d2-4837-8156-cd02da28136f_1380x776.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca929aa2-a7d2-4837-8156-cd02da28136f_1380x776.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca929aa2-a7d2-4837-8156-cd02da28136f_1380x776.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca929aa2-a7d2-4837-8156-cd02da28136f_1380x776.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>These are all fun theories, but in the interviews I’ve read with Soviet mathematicians and scientists, the things that comes up over and over again are “</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Circles-Russian-Experience-World/dp/0821804308" rel="">mathematical circles</a><span>,” a practice that originated in the pre-revolutionary Russian Empire and then spread far and wide through the Soviet Union. A mathematical circle is an informal group of teenagers and adults who really enjoy math and want to spend a lot of time thinking and talking about it. They’re a little bit like sports teams, in that they develop their own high-intensity internal culture and camaraderie, and often have a “coach” who is especially talented or famous. But they’re also very unlike sports teams, because they don’t compete with each other or play in leagues or anything like that, and usually any given circle will contain members of widely varying skill levels. Maybe a better analogy is a neighborhood musical ensemble that gets together and jams on a regular basis, but for math.</span></p><p><span>The most important thing to understand about mathematical circles is that the math they jam on is completely unlike the math you study in school, and also completely unlike the “competition” math that bright kids in the United States sometimes do. Both school math and competition math are primarily comprised of </span><em>exercises</em><span>. An </span><em>exercise</em><span> is a question concocted by a human being for a didactic purpose. Any bright kid with any amount of genre-savviness can immediately make a few assumptions upon being assigned an </span><em>exercise</em><span>. He or she can guess that the </span><em>exercise</em><span> is solvable in fewer than five minutes with the appropriate techniques, and that it is related to the material in the current chapter of the book. A clever student can often use psychological techniques to reverse-engineer what the teacher or the designer of the standardized test was trying to get at with the </span><em>exercise</em><span>, and answer it through a process of elimination or savvy guessing or pattern matching.</span></p><p><span>Solving an </span><em>exercise</em><span> is like hunting a neutered zoo animal. It may be a low-stress environment for polishing particular aspects of your technique, but it will not help you to survive in the wilderness. For that, you need to see people solving </span><em>problems</em><span>. A </span><em>problem</em><span> is a question of interest that comes up when somebody is trying to do something real. A </span><em>problem</em><span> may not be solvable by you, or by your coach, or by any human being. Even if the </span><em>problem</em><span> is solvable, it may require weeks or months of dedicated, painful pursuit. It may not be obvious what techniques are required to solve a </span><em>problem</em><span>, they may not be techniques that you know, or it may require a surprising combination of techniques. The </span><em>problem</em><span> is mathematical nature red in tooth and claw. There are no guardrails. There are no hints or answers at the back of the book. There is no book. It may eat you.</span></p><p><span>(For more on exercises vs. problems, read my review of </span><em>The Education of Cyrus</em><span>.)</span></p><p><span>The bread and butter of the mathematical circle is solving </span><em>problems</em><span> together, as a team. There is no time here for </span><em>exercises</em><span>; you can do that lame stuff at school. Sometimes the coach picks a </span><em>problem</em><span> for you, something just beyond your ability, just the thing you need to hone your edge. But sometimes the whole circle works together on a </span><em>problem</em><span> that nobody has the answer to and that challenges the very best members. These </span><em>problems</em><span> are the most important, because with them you see great minds, men older and more talented than you, stretched to the breaking point and occasionally beaten. You see them grind and grind and try every possible attack on a </span><em>problem </em><span>and sometimes lose anyway. And you see them not run from being defeated, but cheerfully charge in again, because losing is </span><em>good for you</em><span>, losing is how you know you’ve picked an opponent worthy of a man. You learn to love things that are hard. And occasionally you win, and when you win it feels like you all win, like humanity wins, because you’re all in it together, all doing something beautiful and </span><a href="https://www.thepsmiths.com/p/review-when-we-cease-to-understand" rel="">dangerous</a><span> and exemplary of the best qualities that human beings have.</span></p><p><span>There are also times when everybody is too tired to work on a </span><em>problem</em><span>, and in those moments of recuperation, it’s the coach’s job to tell stories of legendary </span><em>problems</em><span> of the past and of the mathematicians who slew them. These stories often contain lessons, inspiration, or perspective on how mathematics evolved and got to be the way it is. Human history would look very different, after all, without the </span><em><a href="https://www.thepsmiths.com/p/review-the-variational-principles" rel="">brachistochrone problem</a><span> </span></em><span>or the </span><em><a href="https://www.thepsmiths.com/p/review-galois-theory-by-david-cox" rel="">roots of a quintic polynomial problem</a><span> </span></em><span>or the </span><em><a href="https://www.thepsmiths.com/p/review-lectures-on-the-icosahedron" rel="">icosahedron problem</a><span> </span></em><span>or the </span><em><a href="https://www.thepsmiths.com/p/review-einsteins-unification-by-jeroen" rel="">precession of Mercury’s perihelion problem</a></em><span>. But other times there’s no hidden lesson, no grand perspective on the human story. They’re just ripping good yarns, and hearing them is a process of initiation into mathematical </span><em>folklore</em><span>, because every culture (and mathematics is surely a culture) has shared stories and references and inside jokes, even when they’re purely for fun.</span></p><p>This book is the story of one such mathematical circle. But it’s an unusual one because…it’s for preschoolers.</p><p><span>The “coach” of this circle is Alexander Zvonkin, a professional mathematician frustrated that his kids are having all the wonder and life and joy crushed out of them by the grey functionaries at their school. So he starts a circle for his son Dmitry and a few of the neighbors’ kids, most of whom are around three or four years old. That’s young enough that </span><a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/piaget.html" rel="">according to Piaget’s experiments</a><span> there are cognitive modules related to number and volume that simply haven’t come online yet. Fortunately, Zvonkin is familiar with the latest research on developmental psychology, and turns lemons into lemonade by using the kids’ lack of numerical intuition to introduce them to some pretty deep ideas about when two sets have equal cardinality. (If you’re curious, he talks more about these experiments in </span><a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ453566" rel="">this journal article</a><span>.)</span></p><p><span>At this point I expect you are rolling your eyes, especially if you have experience with three-year-olds. It can be difficult enough to get them to sit still, never mind ponder deep questions about the cardinalities of sets. And what exactly does it look like to pit somebody against a </span><em>problem</em><span> who is barely potty-trained? This is where the genius of Zvonkin’s format kicks in — it’s not really a book, it’s a journal, and one that is barely edited. So it’s full of failure after failure, entries like, “today I had a cool idea for a puzzle but everybody just screamed instead and then one of the kids vomited.” And yet, slowly, wondrously, over the four years of the circle’s existence, his patience pays off and the kids start doing really incredible things.</span></p><p><span>His initial goal, when the kids are at their youngest and are least prepared to match wits against a </span><em>problem</em><span>, is just to counter-program their schoolwork a little bit. Zvonkin hates the fact that their school presents math as a set of formulas to be obeyed, and DESPISES the fact that the kids’ midwit teacher deducts marks for failing to write answers in a designated format.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-149130375" href="https://www.thepsmiths.com/p/review-math-from-three-to-seven-by#footnote-4-149130375" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span><span> Worst of all, the teacher docks points when the kids use techniques that they “aren’t supposed to know yet.” So Zvonkin throws himself full-bore into discomfiting and unsettling the pat answers they’re bringing home from school, emulating Socrates both in his methods and in his singular focus on corrupting the youth.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5-149130375" href="https://www.thepsmiths.com/p/review-math-from-three-to-seven-by#footnote-5-149130375" target="_self" rel="">5</a></span></p><p><span>About a year into this, Zvonkin decides that the kids are ready for their first real </span><em>problem</em><span>, and asks them the following simple question: how many ways are there to select two items from a collection of five items, if the order in which they’re chosen doesn’t matter? This is a question from the field of combinatorics, which Zvonkin notes with a sneer used to be taught to advanced high-schoolers, until the authorities decided it was too hard. And here he’s going to teach it to preschoolers, or, even harder, he’s going to make them figure it out for themselves with very few hints.</span></p><p><span>He does this, maddeningly, by showing them the </span><em>problem</em><span> over and over again, in many different guises and disguises, over a period of months. He does it inductively, because four-year-olds are tactile creatures who have not yet assembled the cognitive tools required to reason formally and symbolically (more on that in </span><a href="https://www.thepsmiths.com/p/review-mindstorms-by-seymour-papert" rel="">my review of </a><em><a href="https://www.thepsmiths.com/p/review-mindstorms-by-seymour-papert" rel="">Mindstorms</a></em><span>). First he gets beads and asks them to make chains of two red and three blue and asks them how many possible such chains there are. A boisterous debate follows: if you take a chain and rotate it 180 degrees, does it count as the same chain or a different one? This is a good mathematical question, and Zvonkin gives the mathematician’s answer: “We can make up the rules, we can decide whether it counts, so now we have two </span><em>problems</em><span> instead of one, but it turns out that one of them is both easier to solve and more interesting.”</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00deefd5-8a57-461f-a784-9f5bc1c74470_756x508.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00deefd5-8a57-461f-a784-9f5bc1c74470_756x508.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00deefd5-8a57-461f-a784-9f5bc1c74470_756x508.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00deefd5-8a57-461f-a784-9f5bc1c74470_756x508.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00deefd5-8a57-461f-a784-9f5bc1c74470_756x508.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00deefd5-8a57-461f-a784-9f5bc1c74470_756x508.png" width="756" height="508" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/00deefd5-8a57-461f-a784-9f5bc1c74470_756x508.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:508,&quot;width&quot;:756,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:95988,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00deefd5-8a57-461f-a784-9f5bc1c74470_756x508.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00deefd5-8a57-461f-a784-9f5bc1c74470_756x508.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00deefd5-8a57-461f-a784-9f5bc1c74470_756x508.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00deefd5-8a57-461f-a784-9f5bc1c74470_756x508.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>The kids have fun with their beads, but they are still nowhere near ready for the theory of how to count ways of choosing </span><em>k</em><span> items from an </span><em>n</em><span> item set.

Are they, as Piaget says, neurologically incapable of certain kinds of thought? Or are they, as Zvonkin believes, capable of solving challenging problems that many adults would struggle with? I think the answer is “both.” There’s a persistently wrong belief that many people, even many teachers, implicitly or explicitly hold, which says that children are basically like adults, only they’re dumber and know less stuff. Call this the “homunculus theory” of childhood cognition. But the truth is that kids are more like artificial neural networks — they’re at a subtly different point in mind-space, they’re good and bad at different things than adults are good and bad at. </p><p><span>For example: young children are much more concrete thinkers than adults, whether that’s for neurological reasons or because they haven’t built the cognitive tools for abstraction yet.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-149130375" href="https://www.thepsmiths.com/p/review-math-from-three-to-seven-by#footnote-6-149130375" target="_self" rel="">6</a></span><span> When you meet an adult who can’t reason symbolically or propositionally, they’re often (though not always!) pretty dumb and bad at thinking in general. What a mistake it is to apply the homunculus theory and assume the same of a child. You’ll underestimate and condescend to them and cheat them of opportunities to figure things out for themselves, while simultaneously getting frustrated at their inability to grasp incredibly simple ideas. They aren’t homunculi, they aren’t tiny adults, they’re an intelligence that is differently shaped from yours. This is an unintuitive and uncomfortable idea for us, and we don’t have the mirror neurons to really grok it, but consider it good practice for all the very strangely shaped intelligences we will be encountering in the coming decades.</span></p><p><span>One thing Zvonkin does that works about equally well on kids and adults is repeating things over and over again, and letting a long time go by between the repetitions. The reason this works is the same reason that when I’m trying to figure something out for myself, I’ll think about it really hard for a while and then go for a walk or take a shower. You’re hijacking the interplay between the focused-mode and the diffuse-mode of cognition (which I discussed in a </span><a href="https://www.thepsmiths.com/p/review-the-cruise-of-the-nona-by" rel="">review of a book by Hillaire Belloc</a><span>, of all people). It works even better if on each repetition you come at the problem from a different angle, so your subconscious has new material to chew on. Using this technique I was once able to get a five- or six-year old to figure out why summing the numbers in any row of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle" rel="">Pascal’s triangle</a><span> must give a power of two.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7-149130375" href="https://www.thepsmiths.com/p/review-math-from-three-to-seven-by#footnote-7-149130375" target="_self" rel="">7</a></span></p><p><span>The most important lesson of Zvonkin’s book, though, and also the realest and the rawest, comes at the end. He’s been running his little circle for four years, has racked up triumphs and failures, formed all sorts of theories about how best to teach math to little kids, and recorded it all in gory detail. That last is important, because his daughter Evgenia is now a little older than his son Dmitry was when he started the original circle, so naturally he decides to do it all over again with Evgenia and with the neighborhood kids who are </span><em>her</em><span> age. But this time, he’s armed! He already knows what works and doesn’t, he has handwritten journals full of hard-won lessons, he’ll be able to save a ton of time and run everything much more smoothly.</span></p><p><span>As if. In the second iteration of the circle, all of his notes are completely useless, and all of his initial attempts to teach anything fail, because these are different kids with different aptitudes and different interests. Zvonkin, raised in a communist society and a believer in the absolute malleability of human nature, is fairly bowled over by this, especially by how young all these differences are manifesting. Reading between the lines, it sounds like he got quite lucky with his first set of children, and that the second group were much more challenging to teach.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-8-149130375" href="https://www.thepsmiths.com/p/review-math-from-three-to-seven-by#footnote-8-149130375" target="_self" rel="">8</a></span><span> The most eloquent testimony to this is that after about a year he gives up, and the journal ends abruptly.</span></p><p><span>This is just an extreme version of the universal experience of being the parent of more than one child. The moment your second kid is born, or sometimes even before they’re born, they begin teaching you how little impact you actually had over the life trajectory of your first kid.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, generates vast amounts of data from experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). CERN’s Storage and Data Management Group at the IT department is responsible for managing this data, including its long-term archival on tape, distribution across the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG), as well as providing secure and convenient forms of data access to more than 30000 users that need it.</p>
<p>In this talk we will give an overview of the open source projects leveraged by CERN to satisfy the storage needs of the&nbsp; organization, such as CERNBox and EOS, and discuss some of the unique challenges faced by the high-energy physics community in data storage and management. Additionally, we discuss how FUSE is used to allow users to access data securely from anywhere in the world.</p>

While traditional wisdom suggests a 21-day timeline for habit formation, research indicates it could take anywhere from 18 to 254 days. The key is consistency and the habit becoming almost automatic.</p><h3 id="understanding-limbic-friction" onclick="

Factors like fatigue or stress can increase this friction, making habit formation more challenging.

    <img src="https://christianselig.com/2024/10/juno-removed/hero.jpeg" alt="Screenshot from App Store Connect showing Juno as 'Removed from App Store'" loading="lazy">

<p>For those not aware, a few months ago after reaching out to me, <a href="https://christianselig.com/2024/06/announcing-juno-2/">YouTube contacted the App Store</a> stating that Juno does not adhere to YouTube guidelines and modifies the website in a way they don’t approve of, and alludes to their trademarks and iconography.</p>
<p>I don’t personally agree with this, as Juno is just a web view, and acts as little more than a browser extension that modifies CSS to make the website and video player look more “visionOS” like. No logos are placed other than those already on the website, and the “for YouTube” suffix is <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/branding-guidelines">permitted in their branding guidelines</a>. Juno also doesn’t block ads in any capacity, for the curious.</p>
<p>I stated as much to YouTube, they wouldn’t really clarify or budge any, and as a result of both parties not being able to come to a conclusion I received an email a few minutes ago from Apple that Juno has been removed from the App Store.</p>
<p>Juno was a fun hobby project for me to build. As a developer I wanted to get some experience building for the Vision Pro, and as a user I wanted a nice way to watch YouTube on this cool new device. As a result, I really enjoyed building Juno, but it was always something I saw as fundamentally a little app I built for fun.</p>
<p>Because of that, I have zero desire to spin this into a massive fight akin to what happened with Reddit years ago (more than I’ve fought in emails over the last few months). That’s kind of the opposite of fun. I hope that’s understandable.</p>
<p>For those who have Juno, to my knowledge it should continue to work fine until/unless YouTube updates in some fashion that breaks stuff. Sorry it had to end this way, I had some really cool stuff planned for it that I think would have been a lot of fun! It’s been genuinely awesome hearing all the kind words from Vision Pro users who have loved the app.</p>

<h2><a href="https://wumpus-cave.net/post/2024/10/2024-10-01-death-of-cobol/index.html">Cobol Has Been "Dead" For So Long, My Grandpa Wrote About It</a></h2>
<h2>2024-10-01</h2>
<hr>
<p>
<a href="https://wumpus-cave.net/post/2024/10/death_of_cobol1.jpg">  <img src="https://wumpus-cave.net/post/2024/10/death_of_cobol1.jpg" alt="Cobol is Dead">
</a></p>
<p>
In June of 1992, my grandfather had an article published in Technical Support 
magazine proclaiming the death of Cobol. It naturally contains some of the 
buzzwords of the time, such as fourth-generation programming language (4GL). If 
you’re not familiar with that term, suffice it to say that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth-generation_programming_language#Examples">Wikipedia 
page</a>
lists several examples, and Cobol has outlasted most of them.</p>
<p>
There’s a text version of the article available in archives of the 
NaSPA: <a href="http://www.naspa.net/magazine/1992/t9206003.txt">http://www.naspa.net/magazine/1992/t9206003.txt</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
The word <em>dead</em> would seem to have shades of meaning. Perhaps Cobol is not dead; it may be a Zombie. So, something can be dead and yet not gone? Right! Cobol is an excellent example of that phenomenon. COBOL is probably not alone; there are, I suspect, even some vestiges of Autocoder still extant. Autocoder, for those under 45 who may have never heard the term, was a precursor of COBOL. It is unlikely anyone would argue very forcefully that Autocoder is not dead, yet some
remnants of it are probably still with us.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As you might notice, he had a dry wit. There was one time I was able to 
reflect one of his retorts right back at him, and my grandma was so proud; the 
student had become the master.</p>
<p>
There was one thing that kept the Cobol zombie shambling along, and that’s the 
Y2K problem. Make no mistake: as much as it was hyped in the news at the time, 
and as much of a nothingburger it seemed to be, Y2K was a gigantic problem. 
It necessitated training up a new generation of Cobol programmers. That may 
have kept Cobol going for a while longer.</p>
<p>
These days, I avoid the term “dead” for programming languages at all. If 
they ever had a large installed base, then they never die. They have long 
tails where they trail off into obscurity with no junior programmers learning it.</p>
<p>
My grandpa died on Sept 1, 2024 at 91 years of age. Officially, he died of 
pneumonia. My grandma had died the previous April, and he had asked not to 
receive any treatment.</p>

<p>In the past couple of months a couple of big social media sites have changed their terms or introduced suspicious paid plans and it has caught content creators off guard.</p>



<p>For instance, last week Twitch introduced a new “Boost” program where streamers can pay to get more viewers to see their stream. </p>



<p>Read here</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/twitch-adds-new-boost-stream-feature-but-it-comes-at-a-price-1686346/">Twitch Adds New Boost Stream Feature </a></li><li><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-10-29-twitch-tests-paid-boost-feature-despite-negative-feedback-from-streamers">Twitch Tests Paid Boost Feature</a> </li></ul>



<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/25/onlyfans-says-it-will-no-longer-ban-porn-after-backlash-from-users.html">OnlyFans ALMOST banned porn which would have left content creators out of hundreds of thousands of dollars</a>. Only Fans (under heavy pressure) reversed the plan… for now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every single year one social network or another pulls a stunt like this. Somehow people are still shocked when it happens. </p>



<p>Don’t be. </p>



<p>It isn’t a matter of if, it is a matter of when. They don’t care about you. You must market your game as if the platform you are using will go away tomorrow and you will lose access to some or most of your followers.</p>



<p>My basic point: DON’T BUILD YOUR CASTLE IN LAND YOU DON’T OWN!</p>



<p>I got the pixelart itch again and have a blog to write so I thought I would combine the two. This week I created a little metaphorical fable about building your castle in other people’s kingdoms. <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/overworld-tileset-123120">I am using the amazing RPG tileset from Pita Madgwick to do it.</a></p>



<p>Here goes:</p>



<p>Your game studio is basically your land. You are the king. You can do whatever you want on this plot of land and kick out who you want, charge what you want. Set the rules.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Goal here: You want to grow from this little tiny hamlet to a giant castle. You also want a bunch of people in your kingdom living there (aka playing your games), and paying you taxes (buying your games) and telling you how brilliant of a leader you are (fan mail, fan art) and enjoying the company of your kingdom’s fellow citizens (community engagement).&nbsp;</p>



<p>That is your goal but for now you have no one in your kingdom. Your castle is tiny. But how do you get people to come to your crappy little kingdom?</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/B342AzyiJq1j8CzQ_LW12n61PhoLR8q6Xe8DDEZ6x1tkiB_1M36nK393uUKN9fsTV6ZBn1qS6d2preSjyU0wxoww9T5cHjzRu7a3q1Cz6_D0CjBT24MvSB27ZcAyN4tOFRzAlPqr" alt=""></figure>



<p>You look across the sea and you see another country run by another King. They have thousands of people. Everyone is rich. The king is giving away land for anyone to build their castle. </p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/WsxJUTU3z8Hg9jPPdPsXIUkTtxjOMXcF0z8BvQZRso8TxVVqfBHZlyiO-Nvo_rWacyzd1BN2lTg9DreOYTcf6mcVfeLyyk4t39Y_RAhj4HoyPBOCwkzV5HOth4ltulZpWM_kWKmu" alt=""></figure>



<p>Let’s call it Myspacia&nbsp;</p>



<p>So you cross the sea and build a castle in their land. The King doesn’t even charge you for it. So you decide to spend a whole lot of time building a big beautiful castle. Everyone is there. Thousands of people come into your castle built on their land. Your home Kingdom is neglected but why worry?&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GmeyWq6DjDyui5ZbRiMPcwSmyN4JYVMG9_DhRSfsZQ_ecktVmi5pL94VS2YIt5kL5FKZAHznUbqCZGA4ZIax193WVMB1cRTQUOyOqfooyyVouSdME8zSybyRbFHYcTUbwRHsj-Ge" alt=""></figure>



<p>Then one day the rain dries up and the land isn’t fertile, and the king doesn’t do anything like invest in irrigation, and the infrastructure sucks. </p>



<p>People move away and that castle that you spent so much time building is empty. Nobody is around to visit. It sucks. Your castle looks awesome but it sits empty not because of anything you did but because the landlord messed up and everyone left.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uc4dtpx3baqH8KgU5jG_JQYjbiEB1YzZqxpPdbcdgp48lMTcwYygGaUW88q0BlX9txL_jpI6HyxNpWyhP9pMIDCK4zkkbOaFwvIAJlQ-vGiH3VMsalKKmOzZ3AmTIlCShEpOOqGP" alt=""></figure>



<p>So you say, no matter. Let’s go over to this kingdom where everyone is setting up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s call it Facebookia&nbsp;</p>



<p>Again, just like Myspacia once was, it is bustling. It’s just like the good old days.</p>



<p>You start a new castle! Sure you have to start all over but look at all the people! So you build and build and build.&nbsp;Your home Kingdom is still neglected but who cares! Facebookia is awesome!</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/fPhcFgwmQLqWvsyoJdXWWn2yRYybxUKclXZCTU-P1cwDWBPzeCvHsv0vlSYj7VB9hzFRwgBuOQXXq4bkWb8xTAuq6sQOf-i_lr46QKnq0DoDGsQtpVrILGoZKYIF3BelBfvswQEj" alt=""></figure>



<p>Then one day. The King of that land puts a giant wall around their kingdom. Even though you helped make his kingdom worth living in, you are not allowed to enter your castle. In fact, the King starts charging you a toll just to enter your own castle to talk to the people who are there! Why oh why did you spend so much time and money on this castle?!?</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/XgM75Xpnd9EAT_WipX5qhbAhri4i4eWtTzU1wxbByzqaDackayNLcBo42roM4nVo503HOIwGQZW0uMb_A4D_T1MYVgpf6SWxorADt-ca3ltWFFgWNB1LkDymtpewcKJRiENB-VnW" alt=""></figure>



<p>This happens every single day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there are thousands of variations</p>



<p><strong>A hoard of racist barbarians invade</strong> and nobody wants to visit your castle anymore because the king turns out to be a total creep and everyone is scared off because he just lets the racists hang out. (See Twitter and Facebook)</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/rrA_fTBIm_iRpjXs4tFDREVbewDkNmjQTOmU8CwG_i_dC6HvGb5AQtg4s4DNr4EzTBiaT8m-CXBbW0zEqhER-KUboFH_9NMsMG4MVsUZVI3WTcIlDvcDuvYhi9anIEytq8YuIyXO" alt=""></figure>



<p><strong>The kingdom gets absorbed</strong> by another neighboring King that has no idea why people where there in the first place and starts changing the laws and everyone leaves. Example: Tumblr</p>



<p>There are countless tales of this happening. EVERY SINGLE EXTERNAL KINGDOM will do this to you. No matter how “cool” or “hip” they are right now. They will let you down.</p>



<p>So what do you do? How do you possibly fix this? Here are the rules.</p>



<h2>Rule #1: Build your castle on land you own&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Your kingdom is a platform that you own:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>A website on a domain you own</li><li>Your blog hosted on your site (not on medium or Patreon)</li><li>A mailing list</li><li>Your Intellectual Property that you own and can license out</li><li>Merch that you sell on your site</li><li>Your own reputation</li></ul>



<p>But wait! Your mailing list is hosted by Mailchimp which is another company, and your website is hosted by GoDaddy or Squarespace? Aren’t they evil kingdoms too?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not really. They are just hosting platforms that are invisible to your followers. </p>



<p>The general public doesn’t have to go to Mailchimp.com to read your newsletter or squarespace to view your blog. Your readers go to your domain.</p>



<p>If any of those companies changes their terms in a way that you don’t like, you can migrate to a new hosting platform and your followers will never have to change their behavior. They will still go to the same URL to get to your site, they will still receive your newsletter from your email address.&nbsp;It is completely transparent to them.</p>



<p>Spend more resources on the castles on your land.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JNGGv26YNconZhLlROTMOHEeDhFql44h9V8mObSz2oCAj8lKNlcbSRZQfT-QpCb8iqXjK2263xG3BQ-8k-2IPlMIFUuJLzdqvcaNCiVFqUBtHh1alkzoSTVJyEhyaosB84JxWWrN" alt=""></figure>



<h2>Rule #2: SHAMELESSLY USE THE OTHER KINGDOMS JUST LIKE THEY ARE USING YOU!&nbsp;</h2>



<p>I know Tiktok is the hot social media platform right now. It is so pleasant! It’s not like that last kingdom twitterlandia! All the cool kids are here! It is fun! There is dancing! And the traffic is huge!</p>



<p>But just like Facebookia and Myspacia something will change with them. It will.<a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/10/966584204/biden-administration-pauses-trumps-tiktok-ban-backs-off-pressure-for-tiktok-to-s"> It almost did already</a>.</p>



<p>Your solution? Use them so hard. Don’t fall in love. Try to get every last follower off of their kingdom and back to your kingdom. Be shameless about it.</p>



<p>It is true, you cannot get visibility without them, but don’t rely on them as your home base. Instead build the minimum following necessary. You are basically building a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potemkin_village">Potemkin Castle</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Don’t feel guilty posting a Call to Action of “Join me on my mailing list.” You have every right to get people who want to hear from you out of their kingdom and into your kingdom. Don’t let people shame you that you are being to “salesy.” F**k em. You need to get people out of enemy territory and you gotta be clear. <em><a href="https://youtu.be/EMGTcgsEN68?t=561">ALWAYS HAVE A CALL TO ACTION</a></em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Basically build a big tall temporary tower in that foreign kingdom that is loud and garish and attracts a lot of attention. When anyone enters you say “oh to really follow me, go across the sea and join my real kingdom.”</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/gXjiI78Axux6a5B4aCaDYgKi16xThuhfPwVZLmuklckfcjCC1Cxj51zxoRUENf9NeO9oib4KLWER1wUtdzS_3tPklNiVEn7FF-PhudvV4i3w1o8KGFX5YAS8MZoYvyInTbzuQUNg" alt=""></figure>



<p>Always try to build this bridge from a rival Kingdom back to your home Kingdom. Basically, when using any social media platform always ask yourself “How can I enrich my own kingdom with the people of this other land?”</p>



<p>When constructing your path see my next rule…</p>



<h2>Rule #3: Always move people back to your kingdom, never to another kingdom.</h2>



<p>It always kills me when I see a trailer on youtube go viral and the call to action at the end is “follow us on Discord!” or “Follow us on Twitter.”</p>



<p>UGH! You went from Youtuberia to Discordia! Neither of which are owned by you.</p>



<p>You are just sacrificing a bunch of traffic that could have been your own and you are giving it to another King who can take it from you.</p>



<p>Always try to get people to follow you back to your kingdom.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/hCjcUgpNcksuG7SlC27853Ep_sCmnpDHSTu-_7sYMG_E2JCC83S52gd7OzANwJK8u4HhcvG6Wenw6Dl5I1o37D6Bp1Z4qE9qQKEc6GFj0BhMpFtrmT4Ss94odbKQkUetLPk7hvVp" alt=""></figure>



<p>Why oh why are you spending time and money on a bridge that helps these two kings while neglecting your own land? </p>



<h2>Rule #4: Operate like your castle can get shutdown tomorrow</h2>



<p>Do you have a huge following on Twitter? Is everyone who would buy something from you following you only on Youtube? What would happen if tomorrow Twitter didn’t exist? Or Youtube? How would you communicate to them? Do not over-invest in one platform. Always try to get them back to your kingdom.</p>



<p>Don’t wait until it is too late. From the first day you start in that rival kingdom you should be pushing followers back to your home kingdom. </p>



<p>Yes you can still build a little castle in their land, but build a cheap one that you can afford to lose. Then you should stand on the top of that cheap castle and say “follow me over there!” as you gesture wildly to platforms owned by you.</p>



<h2>Rule #5: Be suspicious of new kingdoms that give away easy visibility</h2>



<p>Just about every 2 years there is some new “hot” social media site where you get tons of “engagement” and followers come easy?</p>



<p>Remember Snapchat?</p>



<p>The new guys are most definitely going to let you down soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is why. Social media platforms are capitalist enterprises and they are trying to steal market share away from rival social media sites. They are giving away so much free visibility, free engagement, cheap paid advertising to screw their rival social network.</p>



<p>This is temporary. The party won’t last. They will eventually decide to stop giving away traffic and decide to monetize their subscribers (meaning charge you to reach your fans).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Right now I see there are 2 platforms that are new and very risky.</p>



<h4><strong>TikTok</strong></h4>



<p>I have to be honest, they are giving away a LOT of free traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/l_J22g4CaDs">And it seems to be pretty good traffic</a>.  It is attractive! I also hear their paid ad rates are very good. However this is because they are trying to grow as fast as they can. They are giving away free traffic right now to steal from other social networks. The good times will end. </p>



<p>My recommendation is yes, try to go viral on TikTok then make a CTA to follow you on your mailing list. Also don’t set your profile link to a LinkTree (that is another platform you don’t own!) Instead, link to your own URL that is designed to quickly shuffle them to where you want them to.</p>



<h4><strong>Discord</strong></h4>



<p>Yes everyone is on Discord right now but the company is still privately held and doesn’t have a solid business model yet. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/01/983159051/why-does-discord-not-use-ads-and-why-is-microsoft-interested-we-asked-discords-c">Also concerning is that they are explicitly anti-ads.</a> I know it sounds good to be anti ad but that means they have no clear way to monetize. That means they could stagnate without any clear growth model and a more aggressive rival will take market share from them (this is what happened to Myspace when Facebook showed up.)</p>



<p>Discord is also run by a small company relative to the amount of mindshare they have. This means they are ripe to be purchased by a bigger company. And when a big company takes over, we will always get screwed by the changes they make (Just look at Tumblr and Instagram and WhatsApp and Twitch for examples of this).</p>



<h2>Rule #6: Give good reasons to go back to the Castle in your Kingdom. And be persistent!</h2>



<p>It is hard to make people leave a social media site. But you need to work hard at it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With every single person who enters your castle in a foreign land, tell them “welcome, yes my castle is nice here, but did you know I do better stuff over there in that Kingdom across the sea?”</p>



<p>Always be working to get people over to your land.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Use lead magnets to entice people to follow you back to your kingdom. For example</p>



<ul><li>Yes you went viral on TikTok but you should use that visibility to tell them that to learn more they should join your mailing list.&nbsp;</li><li>Announce you are holding a contest on all the social media platforms but to enter the contest they have to join your mailing list.</li><li>Hold a beta but instead of running it on Discord (another kingdom) tell them to sign up for the beta on your mailing list.&nbsp;</li><li>Tease major reveals and exclusive news about your game on Social media but tell them that the announcement will be made on your website and mailing list first.</li><li>Give exclusive codes out to your mailing list.</li></ul>



<p>You also need to be persistent. This isn’t a one time thing. Every week you should be telling them to follow you back to your kingdom. It will be slow, but building a TRUE following takes time.</p>



<p>I am not the first one to point this out:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-content="" data-astro-cid-onuac4el=""> <p>I just got back from a travel sabbatical.
While the trip turned out great, the planning process was decidedly… less so.
Figuring out six months of travel is a daunting task, and I quickly became dissatisfied with existing tools.</p>
<p>True to myself, I yak shaved the problem.
Introducing <a href="https://waypoint.jakelazaroff.com/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Waypoint</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://waypoint.jakelazaroff.com/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">    <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://waypoint.jakelazaroff.com/favicon.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">waypoint.jakelazaroff.com</span> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"> <use href="/icons.svg#share"></use> </svg> </span> </a>: a local-first web app for planning trips!</p>

In fact, Embark is even more ambitious — pulling in data like weather forecasts, embedding arbitrary views like calendars and introducing a new formula language for live calculations.
I highly recommend reading their writeup!
But Ink &amp; Switch didn’t make Embark public, and I needed to plan a long trip, so here we are.</p>
<p>I want to talk about three things: the big ideas behind Waypoint, how I actually built it and what I learned.</p>
<p>(Quick disclaimer: Waypoint is not — and probably will never be — production-ready software.
I built it to fit my exact needs while planning this trip.
There are rough edges, missing features and bugs. There’s no authentication.
I’m sharing it because I think it’s a useful case study in building an actual local-first app, not because I’m trying to dethrone Google Maps.)</p>
<h3 id="why-i-built-waypoint">Why I Built Waypoint</h3>
<p>I tried a few existing tools before deciding to build my own.
Apple Notes was too spartan, Notion and Google Maps were too clunky and Wanderlog was much too structured to use for research and exploration.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-wanderlog" id="user-content-fnref-wanderlog" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">1</a></sup>:
In every tool, it was either difficult to enter rough, unstructured ideas, or difficult to take those ideas and create a more formal plan.</p>
<p>Waypoint addresses three important shortcomings of other tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data entry should be quick</li>
<li>Comparisons should be easy</li>
<li>Unstructured data is just as important as structured data</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, I wanted an app where I could jot down loose notes about places I was interested in visiting, visualize different routes and gradually narrow it all down into an actual itinerary.</p>
<p>The interface I landed on has two panels: a text editor on the left and a map on the right.</p>
<img src="https://jakelazaroff.com/words/a-local-first-case-study/waypoint.png" alt="A screenshot of an app called Waypoint, with two panels side by side. On the left, an outline of a trip to New Zealand. On the right, a map of New Zealand and Australia with pins in various cities, and routes between them highlighted.">
<p>One common task when planning a trip is gathering a list of locations you’re interested in visiting.</p>
<p>The simplest solution is using a normal text editor.
Data entry is quick; the only real limiting factor is how fast you can type.
The obvious drawback is that locations are displayed textually rather than plotted on a map, obscuring any spatial relationship between them.</p>
<p>The only <em>dedicated</em> tool for this that I really know of is Google’s <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/about/mymaps/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">My Maps</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://www.google.com/maps/about/mymaps/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://www.google.com//www.google.com/images/branding/product/2x/maps_96in128dp.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">About - Google Maps</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Discover the world with Google Maps. Experience Street View, 3D Mapping, turn-by-turn directions, indoor maps and more across your devices.</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://www.google.com/images/branding/product/ico/maps_32dp.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">www.google.com/maps/about/mymaps/</span> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"> <use href="/icons.svg#share"></use> </svg> </span> </a> (the neglected stepchild of Google Maps).
It nails the spatial visualization criterion.
But data entry is awkward and slow; tasks like organizing places into groups require a lot of clicking.</p>
<p>In Waypoint, the main interactive component is a rich text editor.
You use it just as you would Google Docs or Microsoft Word — type notes, add some formatting, cut and paste lines to rearrange your thoughts.
Adding a location is as easy as typing its name, using an <code>@mention</code>-style autocomplete inspired by Embark.
Characters show up as quickly as you can type them, and any changes are reflected instantly on the map view beside the document.</p>
<video controls="" muted="true"><source src="https://jakelazaroff.com/words/a-local-first-case-study/texteditor.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Even when apps make data entry easy, that data is often transient, making it difficult to see comparisons.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to see where two locations are relative to each other in Apple or Google Maps, you’re forced to use the navigation feature to create a route between them.
And only one route is visible at a time — to see a different set of locations, you need to clear the route you’re currently looking at.
This makes it very difficult to, say, determine which of a group of locations are near each other in order to cluster them on different days of an itinerary.</p>
<p>In Waypoint, every location is plotted on a map, so you always have a bird’s eye view of your trip.
To show routes, you can create a “route list” by beginning a line with <code>~</code> (just as you would with <code>-</code> for a bulleted list, or <code>1.</code> for a numbered list).
Every location in the list has a route drawn between its marker on the map and the next one.
By default, the routes are the driving directions between the two locations, but you can toggle between that and a straight line by clicking on the location name and unchecking “Navigate”.</p>
<p>It’s easy to add, remove and rearrange locations in the route: just use the text editing commands you already know to edit the list, and the map automatically updates!
To compare two routes, you can just copy and paste the whole list and rearrange as you see fit.</p>
<video controls="" muted="true"><source src="https://jakelazaroff.com/words/a-local-first-case-study/routelist.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>A bird’s eye view is nice, but sometimes you want to “zoom in” on a subset of your work.
To accommodate this, Waypoint also includes a focus mode — <a href="https://ia.net/writer/support/editor/focus-mode" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">inspired by iA Writer</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://ia.net/writer/support/editor/focus-mode" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/focus-1024x576.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Focus Mode – iA</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Shut down distractions. Focus on the sentence or paragraph you're currently working on.</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://ia.net/wp-content/themes/iA-library/assets/favicons/favicon.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">ia.net/writer/support/editor/focus-mode</span> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"> <use href="/icons.svg#share"></use> </svg> </span> </a> — which dims all paragraphs other than the one under your text cursor.
On the map, Waypoint only shows the locations and routes in that paragraph.</p>
<video controls="" muted="true"><source src="https://jakelazaroff.com/words/a-local-first-case-study/focusmode.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Together, these features enable a powerful workflow: make a route list, copy and paste it below, alter the second list, enable focus mode and move your cursor between the two to quickly see the difference between them.
No other tool I tried made this nearly as quick or as easy.</p>
<h3 id="under-the-hood">Under the Hood</h3>
<p>At a glance, Waypoint isn’t too different from your average single-page app:</p>

<p>Hold up — that last one seems kinda weird?</p>
<p>It’s actually the key difference between Waypoint and a traditional single-page app.
Rather than storing data on a server using a database like MySQL or Postgres, Waypoint is a <em>local-first</em> app that stores its data on the client using a CRDT.</p>
<p>(Some brief exposition: CRDTs are data structures that can be stored on different computers and are guaranteed to eventually converge upon the same state.
For a fuller explanation, check out my article <a href="https://jakelazaroff.com/words/an-interactive-intro-to-crdts/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">An Interactive Intro to CRDTs</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://jakelazaroff.com/words/an-interactive-intro-to-crdts/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://jakelazaroff.com/og/an-interactive-intro-to-crdts.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">An Interactive Intro to CRDTs | jakelazaroff.com</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">CRDTs don't have to be all academic papers and math jargon. Learn what CRDTs are and how they work through interactive visualizations and code samples.</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://jakelazaroff.com/favicon.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">jakelazaroff.com/words/an-interactive-intro-to-crdts/</span> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"> <use href="/icons.svg#share"></use> </svg> </span> </a>, which breaks down the fundamental ideas behind CRDTs and how they work.)</p>
<p>CRDTs are often used to build collaborative experiences like you might see in Google Docs or Figma — except rather than requiring a centralized server to resolve conflicts, the clients can do it themselves.
That decentralized sync allows the clients to store the canonical state of the data, rather than a copy fetched from a web server.</p>
<p>This approach confers some important benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Editing is instantaneous and synchronous.
There are no loading spinners, no optimistic updates to roll back if a request fails and no “go online to save your changes”.
The app is faster and more reliable to use, <em>and</em> much easier to develop.</li>
<li>If I decide to stop hosting Waypoint, you’ll still have the file with your data.
That file will work in any copy of Waypoint, without the need to set up special infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s why this kind of app is called local-first.
If you have the app and you have your data, you can still work on it — even if you’re not connected to the Internet or the developer has gone out of business.</p>
<p>All of this might seem like overkill for a personal app with a single user.
But I was planning this trip with my wife, Sarah, so Waypoint quickly needed realtime collaboration.
To address that, Waypoint uses a library called <a href="https://y-sweet.cloud/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Y-Sweet</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://y-sweet.cloud/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://y-sweet.cloud/og-image.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Y-Sweet Cloud: the WebSocket sync backend you’ll love</span>  <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://y-sweet.cloud/favicon.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">y-sweet.cloud</span> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"> <use href="/icons.svg#share"></use> </svg> </span> </a> by <a href="https://jamsocket.com/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Jamsocket</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://jamsocket.com/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://jamsocket.com/api/og" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Jamsocket</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Give each user session its own dedicated backend.</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://jamsocket.com/favicon.svg" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">jamsocket.com</span> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"> <use href="/icons.svg#share"></use> </svg> </span> </a>.</p>
<p>There are two parts to Y-Sweet:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>@y-sweet/client</code>: an npm package that gets included in the client-side bundle. This package is a Yjs “provider” — a plugin that syncs a Yjs document somewhere.</li>
<li>The Y-Sweet server: a websocket server that syncs documents between clients and persists them to S3.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-self-hosted" id="user-content-fnref-self-hosted" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Architecturally, Y-Sweet acts as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">bus</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">    <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">  <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)</span> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"> <use href="/icons.svg#share"></use> </svg> </span> </a>: clients connect to the Y-Sweet server rather than directly to each other.
Whenever a client connects or makes changes, it syncs its local document with the Y-Sweet server.
Y-Sweet merges the client’s document into its own copy, saves it to S3 and broadcasts updates to other clients.
Since CRDTs are guaranteed to eventually converge on the same state, at the end of this process all clients have the same document.</p>
<p>This also makes it easy to share documents.
Each Waypoint document is identified by a UUID.
When a user opens a link with a given document’s UUID, their Waypoint client connects to Y-Sweet and tries to sync their local copy with Y-Sweet’s copy.
If that user has <em>never</em> opened that document, they have no local copy, and the sync operation results in them just getting Y-Sweet’s copy in its entirety.</p>
<p>Here’s a diagram of Waypoint’s architecture after introducing Y-Sweet:</p>
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 720 360"><use href="./architecture.svg#diagram"></use><title><p>Two boxes labeled “Client”, each with internal boxes labeled “Yjs”, and a third box in the middle labeled “Y-Sweet” also with an internal box labeled “Yjs”. There are double-ended arrows pointing between each client’s Yjs box and Y-Sweet’s Yjs box. Below the Y-Sweet box is another box labeled “S3”, with another double-ended arrow between that and Y-Sweet’s Yjs box.</p></title></svg>
<p>One reasonable objection here is that it looks an awful lot like a traditional client-server app — just replace Y-Sweet with a normal application server and S3 with a database.
Doesn’t that defeat the whole purpose of local-first?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thus, in addition to local data storage on each device, the cross-device data synchronisation mechanism should also depend on servers to the least degree possible, and servers should avoid taking unnecessary responsibilities. Where servers are used, we want them to be as simple, generic, and fungible as possible, so that one unavailable server can easily be replaced by another. Further, these servers should ideally not be centralised: any user or organisation should be able to provide servers to serve their needs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can think of Y-Sweet as a “cloud peer”.
Under the hood, it runs plain old stock Yjs — the exact same code that runs on the client.
If you connected Waypoint to your own Y-Sweet server, there would be no discernible difference.
To borrow Ink &amp; Switch’s parlance: it’s “simple, generic, and fungible”.</p>
<p>Y-Sweet is one of two Yjs providers that Waypoint uses.
The other, called <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/getting-started/allowing-offline-editing" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><code>y-indexeddb</code></a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://docs.yjs.dev/getting-started/allowing-offline-editing" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://docs.yjs.dev/~gitbook/ogimage/-MArc8ifvSI58_ypgRvF" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Offline Support | Yjs Docs</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Adding offline support with y-indexeddb.</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://3672631625-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-files/o/spaces%2F-MAkuXEU862fGj2p9idv%2Favatar-1593180022379.png?generation=1593180022641517&amp;alt=media" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">docs.yjs.dev/getting-started/allowing-offline-editing</span> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"> <use href="/icons.svg#share"></use> </svg> </span> </a>, takes care of offline editing: it persists the Yjs document to the browser’s local IndexedDB storage.
Even if a user gets disconnected from the Internet, edits a document and then closes their browser, none of their work will be lost.</p>

Let’s see how Waypoint stacks up:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No spinners: your work at your fingertips.</strong> While Waypoint’s location autocomplete and map are subject to network latency, editing the document itself happens instantly. Verdict: yes.</li>
<li><strong>Your work is not trapped on one device.</strong> By simply visiting a link, you can load a Waypoint document written anywhere. Plus, you can download your data and open it in any given Waypoint instance. Verdict: yes.</li>
<li><strong>The network is optional.</strong> Again, other than the autocomplete and map, Waypoint is fully functional offline. Verdict: yes.</li>
<li><strong>Seamless collaboration with your colleagues.</strong> Waypoint supports both realtime and asynchronous collaboration, using a CRDT to resolve conflicts. Verdict: yes.</li>
<li><strong>The long now.</strong> Although Y-Sweet is a generic server, autocomplete and maps use a proprietary service called StadiaMaps. However, documents can still be viewed without requiring outside infrastructure. Verdict: sorta.</li>
<li><strong>Security and privacy by default.</strong> Y-Sweet stores copies of documents unencrypted in an S3 bucket. Verdict: no.</li>
<li><strong>You retain ultimate ownership and control.</strong> The canonical copies of data are stored on the client, with no limitations enforced by the server. Verdict: yes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Five “yes”, one “sorta” and one “no”.
Keep in mind that all the relevant technologies are off-the-shelf; most of these capabilities came for free by choosing Yjs (although any given CRDT library would have worked similarly) and Y-Sweet.
Not bad!</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>Okay, so what did I learn?</p>
<p>Most importantly, local-first is not some pie-in-the-sky dream architecture.
Although there are still problems to be worked out,<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-auth" id="user-content-fnref-auth" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">4</a></sup> <strong>it’s very possible to build a useful local-first app, today, with existing tools</strong>.</p>
<p>It helps a lot that various libraries in the ecosystem compose well.
Just snapping together ProseMirror, Yjs and Y-Sweet gave me a collaborative rich text editor with shared cursors.
Adding in <code>yjs-indexeddb</code> made it work offline.
This was all mostly out of the box, with very little setup; the degree to which everything Just Works is impressive.</p>
<p>That said, I think this is a best-case scenario — text editors seem to be the most “plug and play” genre of local-first app.
But in general, the building blocks all fit together nicely.</p>
<p>The same can’t be said of Svelte — or, presumably, frontend JavaScript frameworks in general — which needed some massaging to work with Yjs.</p>
<p>To determine when to re-render, “reactive” frameworks like Svelte and Solid track property access using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Proxies</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.cd6c4a5a.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Proxy - JavaScript | MDN</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">The Proxy object enables you to create a proxy for another object, which can intercept and redefine fundamental operations for that object.</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.cbbd161b.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy</span> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"> <use href="/icons.svg#share"></use> </svg> </span> </a>, whereas “immutable” frameworks like React rely on object identity.
A Yjs document is a class instance that mutates its internal state, which doesn’t play well with either paradigm.
To have Svelte re-render when the document changed, I had to trick it into invalidating its state:</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>let</span> ydoc <span>=</span> <span>$state</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>YDoc</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>// HACK: the yjs doc is mutated internally, so we need to manually invalidate the reactive variable</span>
<span>let</span> outline <span>=</span> <span>$state</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span>ydoc<span>.</span><span>getXmlFragment</span><span>(</span><span>"outline"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

ydoc<span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>"update"</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  outline <span>=</span> <span>undefined</span><span>;</span>
  outline <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>ydoc<span>.</span><span>getXmlFragment</span><span>(</span><span>"outline"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>Even so, in a lot of ways the developer experience was <em>still</em> much better than in a traditional single-page app.
Here’s (roughly) the code to update the document title:</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>let</span> title <span>=</span> <span>$state</span><span>(</span><span>""</span> <span>+</span> ydoc<span>.</span><span>getText</span><span>(</span><span>"title"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>function</span> <span>setTitle</span><span>(</span><span><span>next</span><span>:</span> string</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> text <span>=</span> ydoc<span>.</span><span>getText</span><span>(</span><span>"title"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  text<span>.</span><span>delete</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> text<span>.</span>length<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  text<span>.</span><span>insert</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> next<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  title <span>=</span> next<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Sure, there’s some weird CRDT-related boilerplate, but still: no async function, no <code>try…catch</code>, no worrying about the server.
I just set the title and move on with my life; Yjs will worry about syncing it in the background.</p>
<p>That might sound like magic, but I think it’s just a natural consequence of a fundamentally better abstraction.
Using a local-first architecture rather than client-server promises to dramatically simplify single-page apps.</p>
<p>I was dreading adding offline support, but it turned out to be surprisingly easy.
SvelteKit supports service workers out of the box, and the documentation even provides some <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/service-workers" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">example code</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/service-workers" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://kit.svelte.dev/images/twitter-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Service workers • Docs • SvelteKit</span>  <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://kit.svelte.dev/favicon.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">kit.svelte.dev/docs/service-workers</span> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"> <use href="/icons.svg#share"></use> </svg> </span> </a> as a starting point.
It wasn’t perfect, but it got me probably 95% of the way there — I could load any document I’d already opened, even without an Internet connection.
And as far as saving edits made offline, integrating <code>y-indexeddb</code> took one single line of code.</p>

I had a lot of fun building Waypoint.
This was my first hands-on foray into the local-first ecosystem, and it turned out to be a lot smoother than I anticipated.</p>

			</span>n the old</span>  chapel of a former Christian Science church in San Francisco, late-afternoon sun pours orange through the windows and several giant servers are hard at work. The tall, black towers fill two large alcoves and their cooling fans emit a serene, industrial hum as blue lights blink. Each flicker, says the man in charge of this operation, Brewster Kahle, is a virtual patron of the enormous digital library called the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/internet-archive/" id="auto-tag_internet-archive" data-tag="internet-archive">Internet Archive</a>.</p>



<p>
	Across the room, near where the pulpit would be, sits a sculpture of chunky, red, antiquated computer monitors flashing bygone web pages — a snapshot of the World Wide Web in 1997, and the earliest entry to the Internet Archive’s enormous digital collection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	But it’s the statues — lined up against the walls and in the pews — that grab your attention. Hundreds of miniature replicas of past and present Internet Archive employees. Three more just arrived yesterday, Kahle, 63, tells me last fall as he points out his own. The statue’s wire-frame glasses match his; the white hair, however, is more tight and curled than the tufts that halo his actual head, making him look a bit like Doc Brown from <em>Back to the Future</em>. Kahle’s statue carries a book in one hand and a computer mouse in the other, the latter held out like an offering.&nbsp;

	</p>




<p>
	“Nobody makes any money here, right?” says Kahle. “So you do this for some other reason. Why do you do it? Because you want to be proud of what you do.”

</p>



<p>
	I ask what you have to do to earn a statue.</p>



<p>
	“You have to work at the Archive for three years,” replies Kahle, who founded the Archive as a nonprofit in 1996. “You have to spend your time doing a public service. Oh, did I tell you?” he adds as a casual aside. “The major record labels are trying to destroy us.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	To many, the Internet Archive is its own kind of sanctuary — a vestige of a bygone internet built on openness and access, a Silicon Valley standout interested not in series funding or shareholder value, but the preservation of any piece of the cultural record it can get. But to the corporations and people that own the copyrights to large swaths of that record, the Internet Archive is like a pirate ship stuffed with digital plunder. Two lawsuits have brought these long-simmering tensions to the courts and public consciousness, with financial repercussions in the hundreds of millions that could bring down the internet’s greatest library.</p>



	<h2>
		<strong>“The</strong> <strong>Library of Alexandria for the Digital Age”</strong>	</h2>



<p>
	Before founding the Internet Archive, Kahle worked as a computer scientist, making major contributions to personal computing and the early internet during the Eighties and Nineties.

<p>
	With the Archive, he says, “The whole idea was to build the Library of Alexandria for the digital age. To build universal access to all knowledge.”</p>



<p>
	The Archive is best known for its preservation of the ephemeral expanses of the World Wide Web, available through its one-of-a-kind archive/search engine, the Wayback Machine. But this is just one facet of its collection: Working with museums, libraries, and individual donors and contributors, the Archive has amassed more than 145 petabytes of material (if <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/terabytes-gigabytes-amp-petabytes-how-big-are-they-4125169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">you took more than</a> 4,000 digital photos every day for the rest of your life, you might end up with 1 petabyte). Much of this material is obsolete or out of print — books, microfilm and microfiche, old software, video games, obscure VHS tapes, TV news programs, historic radio shows, and hundreds of thousands of concert recordings.&nbsp;

<p>
	“It’s a research library. It’s there to record and make available an accurate version of the past,” Kahle says. “Otherwise, we’ll end up with a George Orwell world where the past can be manipulated and erased.”

	</p>




<p>
	But this work has long rankled one of the most powerful forces in the United States — rights holders — and the threat of copyright lawsuits has always loomed over the Archive. Lawrence Lessig, the legal scholar and Archive ally, even predicted Kahle would wind up in court in a 2001 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/29/business/new-economy-library-web-pages-that-warms-cockles-wired-heart-beats-library.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><em>New York Times</em></a> interview, days after the Wayback Machine launched.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	It took nearly two decades — during which the Archive occasionally faced smaller legal challenges — but Lessig was right. In June 2020, several book publishers sued the Internet Archive following the launch of its pandemic-era National Emergency Library, which made its collection of scanned books available to borrow freely and without restrictions amid school, university, and library closures. The publishers claimed mass, willful copyright infringement and <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/internet-archive-copyright-infringement-lawsuit-1234703776/">won a summary judgment</a> in the lower courts last March. (The Archive appealed, but <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/internet-archive-loses-appeal-book-publishers-copyright-case-1235095174/">lost again</a> earlier this month.)</p>

<p>
	The same day the district court settlement was announced in August 2023, a set of music-industry clients — led by major record labels Universal Music Group and Sony Music — <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/record-labels-sue-internet-archive-412-million-copyright-infringement-lawsuit-1234806058/">filed their own copyright-infringement lawsuit</a> over another Archive endeavor, <a href="https://great78.archive.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Great 78 Project</a>: an unprecedented effort to digitize 78 rpm records, the obsolete shellac discs that emerged in the 1890s and remained the dominant format for audio recordings until vinyl surpassed them in the 1940s and 1950s.</p>



<p>
	The Great 78 Project bills itself as a “community project for the preservation, research and discovery of 78 rpm records”; the labels, in their <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/lawsuit/" id="auto-tag_lawsuit" data-tag="lawsuit">lawsuit</a>, call it an “illegal record store.” They claim the availability of these digitized 78s constitutes “wholesale theft of generations of music,” with “preservation and research” used as a “smokescreen.” They further argue that the project “undermines the value” of the original recordings, and “displace[s]” authorized streams that actually generate royalties and revenue.</p>



<p>
	Attorneys for the labels forwarded interview requests to the Recording Industry Association of America, which declined to comment for this article. Ken Doroshow, chief legal officer for the RIAA, previously said that the suit was meant to address “the industrial-scale infringement of some of the most iconic recordings ever made.”&nbsp;

	</p>




<p>
	If you want to explore the old, weird expanses of recorded-sound history, there’s no better resource than the Great 78 Project. To build it, the Internet Archive contracted the services of expert audio preservationist George Blood, whose team has digitized and uploaded (with detailed metadata) more than 400,000 recordings since 2017. Click around, filter by year, genre, language, and you’ll find an infinite scroll of discs — most issued by long-defunct labels like Victor, Vocalion, Edison, Oriole, Okeh, and Brunswick — their front labels photographed and laid out in a grid, each one leading to a web page with a straight rip of the crackly recording. A folk, blues, or country tune, a lost jazz gem or minor big-band hit, a Yiddish comedy bit, Hungarian opera, Argentine tango, polka, foxtrot, gospel, hymns, or even just the sound of a person laughing because that’s what people wanted to hear when it became possible to record a human voice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Blood, who is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit, calls this “preservation of the cultural record” one of the “great accomplishments” of the Great 78 Project. “Probably 95 percent or more of this content is not available anywhere,” he tells <em>Rolling Stone.</em> “Whether they were small labels, or obscure pressings, they have been lost to time.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	Of these hundreds of thousands of recordings, the record labels sued over the uploading of 4,142 (an amended complaint from earlier this year added 1,393 recordings to the initial 2,749). Most are by recognizable legacy acts whose music is still widely available: Billie Holiday, Louis Armstrong, Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, Hank Williams, Frank Sinatra, Benny Goodman, Ernest Tubb, and Peggy Lee. (These recordings are now no longer available on the Great 78 Project, per Kahle.) The potential damages are staggering — $150,000 per recording (the statutory maximum for an infringing incident), with a possible total of more than $621 million. If the labels win, with a broad enough judgment, it could end the Internet Archive.&nbsp;(The most recent action in the case was a private mediation session between the parties earlier this week. As it stands, the case is moving forward with the discovery phase scheduled to last through most of 2025.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Above the doorway to Kahle’s office is a street sign: Librarian Place. With a self-deprecating drone, Kahle ticks off some of the achievements hanging on his wall: “I’m in the Internet Hall of Fame, American Academy of Arts and Sciences, American Antiquarian Society.” Not missing a beat, he marvels at the new distinction these lawsuits seem to have foisted upon him: “And suddenly we are bringing down capitalism.”&nbsp;

	</p>




	<h2>
		<strong>“Openness Is the Way to Go”</strong>	</h2>



<p>
	Kahle grew up in Scarsdale, New York, the son of a mechanical engineer who instilled in him a post-WWII ethos — “You can <em>build things</em>, you can try to make things better” — that later cross-pollinated with hippie idealism as Kahle studied engineering and computer science at MIT in the late Seventies and early Eighties. Kahle bolstered his studies with courses in history, Buddhism, and library science, even as many of his MIT peers treated the humanities like gym class.</p>



<p>
	Kahle was enamored with libraries, and they informed his two major contributions to the early internet era. In the Eighties, he joined the supercomputer company Thinking Machines, where he helped develop the Wide Area Information Server (WAIS), an early online publishing system and search engine modeled after the way people asked questions of librarians. His next company, Alexa Internet, founded in 1996, was named for the Library of Alexandria and crawled the web for information to create a quasi-card catalog for the internet.&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>



<p>
	During our conversations, Kahle name-checks a variety of 20th century texts such as “As We May Think,” <em>Computer Lib/Dream Machines,</em> <em>Practical Digital Libraries,</em> all of which conjure similar visions of a future where information, and people, are liberated through technology and libraries. Kahle believed the internet could replace the world he grew up in, where information was confined to a few TV channels, textbooks, and newspapers. That was a “game of very few winners,” he likes to say. He wanted to make a game with many.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	When WAIS spun off into its own company in the early Nineties, Kahle had the chance to develop it further with Steve Jobs at NeXT. He declined. Jobs, says Kahle, “was not interested” in building out WAIS with search tools that were fully open to the public.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	“Openness is the way to go,” Kahle says, “even though I won’t become as rich, because who cares about getting rich? How do we make it so there’s lots of writers, publishers, booksellers, and libraries that have their own niches? How do we make it so it’s many-to-many-to-many, without any central points of control?”

	</p>




<p>
	Kahle still got rich. WAIS sold to AOL for $15 million in 1995. And Amazon, enchanted by Alexa’s web-crawling capabilities, bought it for a reported $250 million in stock in 1999. (As part of the deal, Amazon agreed to keep donating those web crawls to the Internet Archive for preservation.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Though Kahle’s ideals have never wavered, his creations were subsumed by a Silicon Valley behemoth feeding off all things antithetical to his vision of an open internet: advertising models, insane capital markets, and the ultimate “poison” (as he calls it), monopoly power. This was how you got tight controls on information, locked up behind towering paywalls. A game of few winners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	“We’ve taken the promise of the internet and shafted it,” Kahle says. “We convinced people — I was one of them — to turn to their screens to answer questions.”</p>

<p>
	So, as the internet zagged, Kahle took his millions and brilliance and built his bastion. And though he spurned Silicon Valley’s hypercapitalist bloodlust, he continued to embrace its swashbuckling, sometimes heedless pursuit of a goal. To grow the Internet Archive, that meant dancing around and prodding the limits of copyright law. Though to the Archive’s detractors, this often looked like blatant disregard.</p>



<p>
	In their lawsuit, the labels hit the Archive for its “long history of opposing, fighting, and ignoring copyright law, proclaiming that their zealotry serves the public good. In reality, Defendants are nothing more than mass infringers.”</p>



<p>
	Still, “serving the public good” seemed to earn the Archive some leeway. Jessica Litman, a University of Michigan Law School professor and copyright expert, notes that the Wayback Machine was able to skirt major challenges because it “became a really well-accepted resource,” and no one else (including the Library of Congress) was willing to put up the money, or take the copyright risk, to index the web.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	When rights holders did demand something be taken down, the Internet Archive obliged: “Always with respect and in conversation,” Kahle says. Sometimes, a compromise was reached, like in 2005, when the Internet Archive and the Grateful Dead found a solution to keep the band’s myriad concert recordings available on the “Live Music Archive.”

	</p>




<p>
	Kahle shared a kind of copyright philosophy at a 2019 conference. “Try not to cause other people to feel like they’re being taken advantage of,” he told the crowd. “If that doesn’t happen, they won’t come after you. If they feel like they’re being taken advantage of, they’ll throw things at you, like lawyers… I think we just need to proceed and do the right thing. Don’t do things that smell bad.”&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Autumn In New York" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r9PYx9T80J4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
</div></figure>



<p>
	But to many, the Internet Archive always smelled bad. “That’s the issue with Brewster,” says Neil Turkewitz, a former executive vice president, international of the RIAA. “It’s the hubris that flows out of Silicon Valley, and he’s got it in spades: That you can make your own laws that determine your norms of conduct if you have a higher ideal.”</p>



<p>
	Dennis Spragg, director of the Glenn Miller archives and the estate’s licensing coordinator, colorfully says he’ll refrain from using the word “thief” to describe the Archive’s activities, because “that’s a judgmental term.” Instead, he settles on a fictional Latin legal descriptor: “<em>Habeas grabus</em>. In other words: I have it, I grab it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	“They’ve really gotten under the skin of a lot of people,” he adds. “And there are movements among rights holders to get tough on them.”</p>



<p>
	A $621 million lawsuit is tough, and both Turkewitz and Christiane Kinney, a music-industry lawyer and copyright specialist, think the labels have an open-and-shut case. There’s barely a “factual dispute,” Turkewitz argues. “It’s a straightforward reproduction-distribution copyright case … focused on records that are in the [labels’] catalog, being distributed, and available commercially.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Kinney agrees: “They talk a great game. But the reality is, Bing Crosby’s ‘White Christmas’ — when do we not hear that?”</p>



<p>
	For the Internet Archive, the notion of fair use — legal carve-outs that allow people to use copyrighted works if the purpose is deemed sufficiently “transformative” or “educational” — is on the table; but that argument failed to sway the lower courts in the book-publishers’ case. The Copyright Act also gives libraries and archives some leeway to reproduce and distribute protected works, but there are debates over whether the Internet Archive, despite its assertions, is a library or just an online distribution hub. (In the book-publishers’ case, the appeals court held that the “IA does not perform the traditional functions of a library.”)

	</p>




<p>
	Litman does suggest the labels will have to prove the recordings the Internet Archive is hosting are the same ones labels are currently selling. “I think that’s a hard argument to make,” she says. “I would be shocked if they hadn’t gotten new copyright registrations for those recordings. What they’re exploiting is a remastered version of the older recordings. And what the Internet Archive is streaming are the original, very low-fi recordings.” For instance, the registration for a 1995 Count Basie compilation, <em>On the Upbeat,</em> contains two songs in the suit (“Every Tub” and “One O’Clock Jump”) and states the claim is for “New matter: compilation &amp; remix.”</p>



<p>
	Jennie Rose Halperin, a librarian and director of the advocacy group Library Futures (which <a href="https://www.libraryfutures.net/post/library-futures-files" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">filed an amicus brief</a> on behalf of the Archive in the book-publishers’ case), echoes this sentiment: “To make the assumption that listening to a 78 online with all the scratches and crackles is the same as going to Spotify and listening to a Frank Sinatra song is, frankly, a specious argument.”&nbsp;</p>



	<h2>
		<strong>“Too Important to Be Left to These Corporations”</strong>	</h2>



<p>
	In the Internet Archive’s lobby, a display case exhibits the history of the written word on one side (cuneiform tablets to laptops) and the history of recorded sound on the other (Edison cylinders to MP3s). A Victor Talking Machine from 1927 sits in between. Kahle asks if I’ve ever heard a 78 played on a mechanical phonograph before. I haven’t, so he grabs a disc from a small stack, places it on the turntable, and fixes a fresh needle to the stylus. I’m instructed to turn the crank on the side until it starts to resist. When it does, Kahle flips a switch, the turntable spins, and the little arrow on the rpm speedometer inches toward 78. The needle hits the shellac and starts to dance back and forth in the groove, pushing air through a diaphragm to amplify the sound.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	The record, 1947’s “Concerto Boogie” by the Tommy Edwards Trio, is a jazzy take on Edvard Grieg’s 1868 Piano Concerto in A minor. After a stern piano intro, the bass and guitar swing into a lush, goofy, gimlet-drunk groove. Standing in front of the Victor Talking Machine’s iconic, blooming horn, I flash a delighted, stupefied smile. Not because “Concerto Boogie” is the greatest song I’ve never heard (no offense to the Tommy Edwards Trio); I’ve just never listened to music this way, where each crackly note hits your face with a puff of air. I’ve stood in front of subwoofers as they huff and puff; I’ve felt bass vibrating through my body. But this is different, a breath out of the past.&nbsp;

	</p>




<p>
	Seventy-eights have long been essential, if not invaluable, to the preservation of early-20th-century sound. Under the best circumstances, an audio restoration or preservation project uses a master recording — the original tape, digital file, or, as was often the case in the early 1900s, metal plate — onto which the song was first cut. But few of those metal plates survive today. (Paramount Records, the prominent jazz and blues label that released music by Ma Rainey, Blind Lemon Jefferson, and Charley Patton, folded during the Depression and sold many of its masters as scrap metal.)</p>



<p>
	<strong>Tommy Edwards Trio – “Concerto Boogie”</strong></p>

<p>
	New 78s were manufactured through the Fifties, but the work of preserving those older discs was often eschewed by labels and taken up by individuals. When Columbia Records released the landmark 1961 Robert Johnson collection, <em>King of the Delta Blues Singers,</em> it didn’t pull the recordings from its own meticulously-kept vault: A few metal master plates were found in a factory, but most of the songs were sourced from 78s in the personal collections of two Columbia employees.</p>



<p>
	Individual collectors were essential to the growth of the Great 78 Project, too, from the 70,000 discs donated by the Danish collector Leif Druedahl to additional discs gifted from various institutions and libraries.</p>



<p>
	David Leonard, president of the Boston Public Library, which donated a large swath of its long-out-of-circulation sound collection, remembers the “praise and comments” from music lovers and nostalgic listeners that poured in when the collection went live.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	The labels do take care of plenty of old music, especially if it’s still profitable, like the 4,000-odd recordings over which they’re suing the Archive. But Nathan Georgitis, executive director of the Association for Recorded Sound Collections, a nonprofit committed to studying and preserving sound recordings, argues that record companies also have a way of letting “content go.” He alludes to the infamous 2008 fire at Universal Studios (a “big mishap with its vault”), which destroyed a warehouse filled with archival audiovisual material. And he notes that ARSC and some labels have occasionally found themselves at odds over “how to properly manage sound-recording collections — whether for the benefit of history and the enlightenment of mankind, or for, you know, economic profit.”&nbsp;

	</p>




<p>
	Lew Tucker, a computer scientist and peer of Kahle’s, understands the repercussions of those considerations. His father, Tommy Tucker, was a successful big-band leader in the Thirties and Forties, who mostly made his living on the road, but recorded hundreds of songs and even notched a few minor radio hits. Most of those recordings are now likely owned by Universal and Sony, but you won’t readily find them on CD or streaming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	“There’s no commercial interest,” Tucker admits of his dad’s music. “But then it’s all locked up, nobody can hear it.”</p>



<p>
	You will find hundreds of Tommy Tucker recordings on the Great 78 Project, but none of them are part of the lawsuit. “That’s why preservation and archiving is too important to be left to these corporations that don’t see a way to monetize it,” Tucker says. “Brewster’s not monetizing it.”&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="1941 HITS ARCHIVE: I Don’t Want To Set The World On Fire - Tommy Tucker (Amy Arnell, vocal)" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MzyCBSTZD8I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
</div></figure>



<p>
	The Great 78 Project was ultimately designed for the Tommy Tuckers and the “Concerto Boogie”s. While 78 collectors helped build it, it’s a fundamental counter to their frequent pursuit of the rarest discs in the world. “It’s the long tail that people wanted,” says Kahle. “They wanted to know, ‘What did America sound like?’ We’re looking for not only the things people listened to, but the way they listened to it.”</p>



<p>
	And the Internet Archive probably could’ve done exactly this and never faced a $621 million lawsuit. That’s because the 2018 Music Modernization Act set up rules to allow people to share the plethora of recordings made before 1972 that aren’t available, for streaming or sale, through official channels. Rules that, say, a nonprofit internet library could follow if it wanted to digitize 78s containing tracks you’d never find on Spotify. They wouldn’t be allowed to monetize those recordings, and would have to conduct a “good faith, reasonable search” to ensure the original rights holder wasn’t making money off them. But, if they did that, then filed notice with the Copyright Office, waited 90 days, and no one objected, they’d be free to share.

	</p>




<p>
	The Internet Archive actually leapt to use these rules to add a slew of out-of-print vinyl LPs to its library. Its “Unlocked Recordings” collection now boasts more than 23,000 items, and prominently states that a “reasonable search” was conducted to determine they weren’t commercially available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	But the labels, in their suit, argue no similar search was conducted for the Great 78 Project — proof, in their minds, that the Internet Archive knew the rules and willfully ignored them. (They also rebuffed the Archive’s claim about the “Unlocked Collection,” saying it never filed notice with the Copyright Office for any recording, and even hosted recordings by Paul McCartney, Jimi Hendrix, and Nina Simone at one time; if those recordings were available, they appear to have been taken down.)</p>



<p>
	Kahle insists that if the labels had said, “Hey, it’s so important that nobody be able to get that Benny Goodman 78,” the Internet Archive “would’ve worked with them.” The RIAA even contacted him in 2020 about possible infringement on the Great 78 Project, and while Kahle defended the endeavor in response, he also said they’d remove any specific titles if the labels asked. No such request came, just the lawsuit three years later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	But the labels argue, this time, it wasn’t their responsibility to serve the Archive with such a list or copyright takedown notices. Even Litman, a great admirer of the Internet Archive, thinks it may have been “negligent” in failing to follow these rules. The Music Modernization Act “required [the Archive] to go through some hoops, and it didn’t,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	I broach this with Kahle for the first time in the Archive’s lobby, across the room from the Victor Talking Machine, where he’s dropping a coin into a 1940s-era red electric jukebox. I punch a button for a Benny Goodman tune, but the machine’s finicky and brings up Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald’s “The Frim Fram Sauce” instead — one of the allegedly infringed-upon recordings on the Great 78 Project.

	</p>




<figure><div>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Frim Fram Sauce / Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong with Bob Haggart's Orchestra" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M3pxFP-rJIw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
</div></figure>



<p>
	I mention a presentation where Kahle discussed how the Archive checked if the VHS tapes it was preserving were commercially available on DVD. Were similar steps taken for the 78s?</p>



<p>
	“For LPs and CDs, that’s exactly what we do,” he says. “Seventy-eights, we asked around, we dealt with a lot of collectors, they just said it’s not a problem.” (In an email, Kahle further notes that the Great 78 Project “predates the MMA” and that the “record labels knew about it.”)</p>



<p>
	But there’s an even more blunt, obvious way of asking this question that doesn’t require knowledge of byzantine U.S. copyright law. Why didn’t the Internet Archive just think twice before making a song like “The Frim Fram Sauce” or Bing Crosby’s “White Christmas” — the most popular single of all time — available online for free? There wasn’t any concern about even a Frank Sinatra hit on 78?</p>



<p>
	For a few moments, it’s just the hearty horns of Bob Haggart and His Orchestra. “It wasn’t a problem,” Kahle says after a beat. “We talked to people, it wasn’t a problem.”</p>



<p>
	When I bring it up again later, Kahle argues that 78s are “obsolete” and that they made “faithful transcriptions of 78 rpm records that haven’t been for sale for 50 to 70 years… They’re so unrelated to what you would get on Spotify. People go to Spotify to find things that they enjoy [listening to]. When I want to listen to 78s, I listen to the wonderful work of Jack White—” and now he’s up from his recliner, out of his office, rooting around, and returning with Third Man’s luxurious<em> Rise and Fall of Paramount Records</em> box set, with its meticulously remastered tracks from the Paramount catalog newly pressed onto vinyl.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	“If you want to enjoy [the sound of] 78s, get this,” he insists.&nbsp;

	</p>




<p>
	Kahle says he believes the MMA exemptions have more to do with vinyl LPs released before 1972, which “still kinda sound like the music you’d listen to” on streaming or CD.</p>



<p>
	But to the labels, I point out, it doesn’t matter if it’s a straight transfer of “White Christmas” from an old shellac disc — it’s still “White Christmas,” and it’s available for people to stream for free.</p>



<p>
	“Well, do people?” Kahle retorts.</p>

<p>
	This question feels pertinent in a $621 million lawsuit. And the complaint does throw out some statistics — estimated play counts and downloads — for a few recordings. “White Christmas” allegedly has “tens of thousands” of downloads or streams on the Great 78 Project; Frank Sinatra’s “Young at Heart” has 2,300; Thelonious Monk’s “Monk’s Dream” has “hundreds.” For comparison, on Spotify, “Young at Heart” and “Monk’s Dream” have over 20 million plays each; and the two versions of “White Christmas” you’ll find on there have more than 1 billion cumulative listens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Kahle answers his own rhetorical question with the sharp, incredulous laugh that often carries his exasperation: “We’ve now run the experiment, and the answer is, they don’t!”&nbsp;</p>



	<h2>
		<strong>“They Failed to Ask the … Rights Holders for Permission”</strong>	</h2>



<p>
	Like Lew Tucker, John Mills II is also the son of a musician. His father, Donald Mills, was one of the founding members of the Mills Brothers, the pioneering Black vocal group with decades of hits going back to the 1920s. Mills grew up steeped in the world of the Mills Brothers, and it was only natural for him to become a musician. He’s always pursued his own projects, but he started singing with his dad in 1982, and after Donald’s death in 1999, he continued to carry on the Mills Brothers legacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	“I always revered his artistry, his beautiful voice, the rapport that he had with his audiences,” Mills says. “I’m not gonna say no to that — I tried not to mess it up!”</p>



<p>
	The Mills Brothers made more than 2,000 recordings and, unlike the Tommy Tucker catalog, the vast majority of them are widely available. They’re still regularly licensed for video games, movies, and TV shows, too. “People are more aware of it than they know,” says Mills.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	The Great 78 Project lawsuit includes 39 Mills Brothers recordings — including collaborations with Armstrong and Fitzgerald, and hits of their own, like “Nevertheless (I’m in Love With You)” and “You Always Hurt the One You Love” — all owned by Universal Music.

	</p>

<p>
	Mills, like other estate reps I spoke to, stands firmly with the labels. “It is a treasure trove, in essence,” Mills acknowledges of the Great 78 Project. “But they failed to ask the artists, creators, publishers, writers, master rights holders for permission to distribute our work for free.”</p>



<p>
	The estates’ frustrations speak to a tension that’s long confounded Turkewitz, the former RIAA executive, about the Internet Archive’s activities. “How can you take an action that’s so antithetical to the interests of the creator, while claiming a love of the product of the creator?”</p>



<p>
	But the same could arguably be said of record labels. Fundamentally, copyright exists to protect creators and incentivize them to create; but in America, as Litman notes, it’s easy to sign away those rights and much harder to reclaim them. That allows “publishers and other intermediaries to step in, often to the disadvantage of the original author,” Litman adds. This is how the record industry has functioned since forever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Doug Holloway, a representative for the Thelonious Monk estate, is unequivocal in his support for the labels’ lawsuit precisely because Monk, like so many Black artists of his era, was gravely underpaid for his work when he was alive. “Thelonious Monk was ripped off,” Holloway says. “Let me be frank about it. Anything that reduces the income to the estate is wrong. Period.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	In their lawsuit, the labels point out that neither they “nor their artists see a dime” from the Internet Archive’s alleged infringement. But for many, this artist-friendly flourish rings hollow as the music industry rakes in obscene amounts of money and the vast majority of artists, or their estates, see very little of it. Halperin calls it a “bad faith” argument that “takes the mantle of creators’ rights and perverts it in order to persecute a nonprofit digital library.”</p>



<p>
	The labels, Litman also notes, still own most of these older recordings outright and are able to keep profiting off their original exploitation with the backing of federal law. Starting in the Seventies, artists were granted a termination of transfer right that allowed them to eventually reclaim their copyrights; the Music Modernization Act did not extend that same right to legacy artists (or their estates) when pre-1972 recordings were finally granted federal copyright protection.

<p>
	“This country owes the recording artists of the mid-20th century not only an apology, but a ton of money,” Litman says. “I don’t see the Great 78 Project taking any of that money out of any performer’s pocket.”</p>



<p>
	For someone like Mills, these contradictions are deeply personal. “These guys worked,” he says of the Mills Brothers. “They fulfilled every job they were asked to do, and they were so good.… For me, it’s all about getting a return on sweat equity.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	But Mills also recognizes that those returns have been stymied by forces far greater than the Internet Archive. He’s part of ongoing litigation against Universal accusing the label of withholding royalties for legacy artists and their estates. (Universal has denied the claims and settled with some of the plaintiffs.) He’s also keenly aware that, as Black artists, the Mills Brothers were not afforded the same financial and investment opportunities as their white counterparts. In the 1930s, Mills says, his dad moved out to Los Angeles to make movies and was unable to buy a house in the affluent, all-white Hancock Park neighborhood, even though he probably could have afforded three.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	I remember what Lew Tucker told me about his father’s one big radio hit: “I think that paid for our house.”</p>



<p>
	Mills talks with passion and reverence about his family, but it’s tangled up in years of frustration. Universal still owns much of the Mills Brothers’ catalog, leaving the estate beholden to the label, whether it’s working on their behalf in the case of the Great 78 Project lawsuit, or against them in the allegations of withheld royalties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	“My parents, uncles, [and] grandfather probably put thousands of record company executives’ children through college while they were hoping to take care of their own,” Mills says.&nbsp;

	</p>




<p>
	And with years of frustration comes years of pain. There are so many things Mills would rather focus on — the Mills Brothers’ upcoming centennial (they formed in 1925), the concerts he continues to perform under the family banner, and his own new band, <a href="https://orchidsinzoom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Orchids in Zoom</a>. “It’s like pulling scabs all the time,” he says. “And I don’t want to hurt like that.”&nbsp;</p>



	<h2>
		<strong> “Why Are They Trying to Erase Us?”</strong>	</h2>



<p>
	In Kahle’s office, as our conversation and afternoon together draw to a close, I read to him something from a book he recommended to me called <em>The Library: A Fragile History.</em> Its prologue states, “Even if libraries are cherished, the contents of these collections require constant curation, and often painful decisions about what has continuing value and what must be disposed of.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	How has the Internet Archive — with its ever-growing collection — contended with this question? Ever the evangelist, Kahle replies that technology has made it moot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	“We’ve been able to build a library not only of famous people, but little people,” he says. “That’s what’s going to be destroyed by these corporations — the history of much more common people. It’s obvious they’re not doing any harm! Why are they doing this?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Kahle often returns to this question of <em>why?</em> — searching for an answer that’ll explain the potential destruction of not only a digital trove of 78 rpm recordings, but everything else the Archive has preserved, its very mission: universal access to all knowledge. “Without us, people wouldn’t have a record,” Kahle says. “So why are they trying to erase us?”</p>



<p>
	The answer to his <em>why? </em>is evident in the actions of those aligned against him: long-frustrated rights holders and corporations who see little difference between the Internet Archive and illegal torrent sites like the Pirate Bay, and haven’t spent millions lobbying for a copyright system that favors their interests over the public domain for nothing.</p>



<p>
	“You would hope that there might be some balancing act, or that everybody could play nice in the sandbox, and come up with solutions that benefit all,” Kinney, the lawyer and copyright expert, says. Shen then adds with a perceptive laugh: “But that’s not really how business is done.”

	</p>




<figure><div>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Monk's Dream (Take 8)" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mgqYJa5hMQY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
</div></figure>



<p>
	And really, it’s business all the way down. For instance, both Turkewitz and Halperin independently suggest these lawsuits could be laying the groundwork for a more pressing copyright fight against artificial-intelligence companies using licensed work without permission to train large-language models for artificial intelligence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	“A part of litigation is about establishing precedent and letting the universe understand that you can’t go out and create an undertaking that relies on our product without coming to us to negotiate,” says Turkewitz.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	But even if the labels prevail in protecting their products from the Internet Archive, there’s no guarantee that the actual creators (or their estates) will see any benefits. The labels don’t automatically get $621 million if they win, and how damages shake out is an open question. Sam Trust, a music-publishing vet who oversees the Doris Day estate, supports the suit, but calls the potential damages “absolutely absurd,” adding, “I would be surprised if it’s $41,000 worth of damages.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	And then there’s recent precedent: When the book publishers announced their summary judgment settlement with the Internet Archive last year, the Association of American Publishers said only that the “confidential” damages were enough to cover “significant attorney fees and costs.” No mention was made of how much money — if <em>any</em> — authors would see. (When asked if authors would see any of the settlement following the publishers’ victory on appeal, a rep for the AAP simply said, “The terms of the monetary payment are confidential.”)</p>



<p>
	Maybe, if the labels walk away with a fat check, they’ll do more than pay lawyers, pad bonuses, or boost shareholder value. Maybe they’ll set up a fund that goes directly to all the legacy artists and estates mentioned in the suit — effectively letting a nonprofit pay back the musicians and families those same labels have been accused of exploiting for decades.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	The day Kahle shows me around the Internet Archive’s offices, the existential threat of all this litigation looms heavy, but his enthusiasm remains irrepressible. He’s still optimistic about the internet and the technology behind it, just “not the controlling entities leveraging the internet and the rise of what those monopolies have done to keep people ignorant.”

	</p>




<p>
	At the Internet Archive, Kahle and others are still trying to build the future he always envisioned. He excitedly introduces me to a group of people in the basement working on decentralized web projects — a new open-internet dream of a web that runs on direct connections between individuals, not moderated through dominant, centralized platforms. “This place is kind of the soul of the internet,” says one team member.</p>



<p>
	In the lobby, in the cheesy afterglow of “Concerto Boogie,” Kahle begins to muse: “One of the things about 78s that’s really wonderful, is this is the first time people <em>heard</em> themselves.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	There’s still plenty of awe in his voice, and it sticks as he picks from a small stack a postcard flyer for the Great 78 Project encouraging people to donate discs and join this new endeavor to preserve the past.&nbsp;

<p>
	“The Great 78 Project was a community project; it is a very crowd-sourced, internet-style thing,” Kahle says. “It’s not the Internet Archive — it’s hundreds of collectors and institutions, all working together.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	And then we’re off again, whisked into another room in this cathedral, where a small team is inventing a new way to digitize microfiche.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Durk Kingma, one of the lesser-known co-founders of OpenAI, today <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/dpkingma/status/1841134573595312344">announced</a> that he’ll be joining Anthropic.</p>

<p>In a series of posts on X, Kingma revealed that he’ll be working mostly remotely, from the Netherlands (where he’s based), but didn’t say which Anthropic org he’ll be joining — or leading. </p>

	
	


<p>Reached for comment, an Anthropic spokesperson pointed to Kingma’s posts.</p>

<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'll be working (mostly) from the Netherlands, but will visit the SF bay area as frequently as I can!</p>— Durk Kingma (@dpkingma) <a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/dpkingma/status/1841150126544601448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p>“Anthropic’s approach to AI development resonates significantly with my own beliefs,” Kingma wrote. “[L]ooking forward to contributing to Anthropic’s mission of developing powerful AI systems responsibly. Can’t wait to work with their talented team, including a number of great ex-colleagues from OpenAI and Google, and tackle the challenges ahead!”</p>

<p>Kingma, who has a Ph.D. in machine learning from the University of Amsterdam, spent several years as a doctoral fellow at Google before joining OpenAI’s founding team as a research scientist. At OpenAI, Kingma focused on basic research, leading the algorithms team to develop techniques and methods primarily for generative AI models, including image generators (e.g. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/20/openai-unveils-dall-e-3-allows-artists-to-opt-out-of-training/">DALL-E 3</a>) and large language models (e.g. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a>).</p>

<p>In 2018, Kingma left to become a part-time angel investor and advisor for AI startups. He rejoined Google in July of that year, and started at Google Brain, which became one of the tech giant’s premiere AI R&amp;D labs before it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/20/google-consolidates-ai-research-divisions-into-google-deepmind/">merged with DeepMind</a> in 2023.</p>

<p>Kingma’s hiring is yet another talent coup for Anthropic, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/28/anthropic-hires-former-openai-safety-lead-to-head-up-new-team/">recruited</a> OpenAI’s former safety lead, Jan Leike, in May, and another OpenAI co-founder, John Schulman, in August. The company made an additional splashy hire in May, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/15/anthropic-hires-instagram-co-founder-as-head-of-product/">appointing</a> Instagram and Artifact co-founder Mike Krieger as its first head of product.</p>

	
	



<p>Anthropic’s CEO, Dario Amodei, was once the VP of research at OpenAI, and reportedly split with the firm after a disagreement over OpenAI’s roadmap — namely its growing commercial focus. Amodei brought with him a number of ex-OpenAI employees to launch Anthropic, including OpenAI’s former policy lead Jack Clark.</p>

	
	


<p>Anthropic has often attempted to position itself as more safety-focused than OpenAI.<a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2024%2F05%2F28%2Fanthropic-hires-former-openai-safety-lead-to-head-up-new-team%2F&amp;text=Anthropic+hires+former+OpenAI+safety+lead+to+head+up+new+team&amp;via=techcrunch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2024%2F05%2F28%2Fanthropic-hires-former-openai-safety-lead-to-head-up-new-team%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2024%2F05%2F28%2Fanthropic-hires-former-openai-safety-lead-to-head-up-new-team%2F&amp;title=Anthropic+hires+former+OpenAI+safety+lead+to+head+up+new+team&amp;summary=Jan+Leike%2C+a+leading+AI+researcher+who+earlier+this+month+resigned+from+OpenAI+before+publicly+criticizing+the+company%E2%80%99s+approach+to+AI+safety%2C+has+joined+OpenAI+rival+Anthropic+to+lead+a+new+%E2%80%9Csuperalignment%E2%80%9D+team.+In+a+post+on+X%2C+Leike+said+that+his+team+at+Anthropic+will+focus+on+various+aspects+of+AI+safety+and+security%2C+%5B%E2%80%A6%5D&amp;mini=1&amp;source=TechCrunch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2024%2F05%2F28%2Fanthropic-hires-former-openai-safety-lead-to-head-up-new-team%2F&amp;title=Anthropic+hires+former+OpenAI+safety+lead+to+head+up+new+team" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><a href="mailto:?subject=Anthropic+hires+former+OpenAI+safety+lead+to+head+up+new+team&amp;body=Article%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2024%2F05%2F28%2Fanthropic-hires-former-openai-safety-lead-to-head-up-new-team%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/28/anthropic-hires-former-openai-safety-lead-to-head-up-new-team/"></a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>I’m at <a href="https://openai.com/devday/">OpenAI DevDay</a> in San Francisco, and I’m trying something new: a live blog, where this entry will be updated with new notes during the event.</p><div id="live-updates">

<p><strong>10:19</strong> The <strong>keynote</strong> is starting with a review of o1, and some examples of applications that use it.</p>

<p><strong>10:30</strong> They started with some demos of o1 being used in applications, and announced that the rate limit for o1 doubled to 10000 RPM (from 5000 RPM) - same as GPT-4 now.</p>

<p><strong>10:31</strong> The first big announcement: a realtime API, providing the ability to use WebSockets to implement voice input and output against their models.</p>

<p><strong>10:33</strong> What can you build with the new realtime API? The demonstrated an updated version of their Wanderlust travel agent demo. The demo uses voice as both input and output.</p>

<div data-update-id="5">
  <p><strong>10:37</strong> </p><p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/wanderlust.jpg" alt="The image shows a large display screen mounted on a wall, showcasing a map application called Wanderlust. The screen has a pink background with a map of San Francisco on the right side.

The left side of the screen displays a conversation:

</div>

<p><strong>10:39</strong> ... and a demo of an AI assistant making a phone call to order food (thankfully to an OpenAI staff member on stage, not to an actual business!)</p>

<p><strong>10:41</strong> And a demo of the <a href="https://www.speak.com/">Speak</a> language learning app using the new Realtime API. The API is rolling out generally today.</p>

<p><strong>10:41</strong> Next up: model customization. They have fine-tuning for GPT-4o and 4o-mini now. Today they're announcing fine-tuning support for their vision models.</p>

<p><strong>10:42</strong> Now you can use images to fine-tune the model. They suggest this can be used for product recommendations, medical imaging, or even things like traffic sign detection or lane detection (Grab have been using it for that).</p>

<p><strong>10:42</strong> Fine-tuning with vision is available to every developer for GPT-4 (presumably they mean GPT-4o? Not clear.)</p>

<p><strong>10:43</strong> Next: price drops. Cost-per-token is already 99% cheaper than two years ago.</p>

<p><strong>10:44</strong> And today they're adding prompt caching - as seen previously in <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/prompt-caching">Claude</a> and <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/caching">Gemini</a>.</p>

<p><strong>10:44</strong> Their version of prompt caching is automatic! A 50% discount on tokens the model has seen before.</p>

<p><strong>10:45</strong> Model distillation: where a smaller model is taught by a larger model. Today they're announcing tools for model distillation - so you can fine-tune a 4o-mini model based on output from the larger models.</p>

<p><strong>10:46</strong> Two new tools: stored completions, which lets you store your interactions with the models permanently in the OpenAI platform, to use for fine-tuning and model distillation. That tool ships to all developers today.</p>

<p><strong>10:46</strong> Plus new evaluation tools, also shipping today.</p>

<p><strong>10:47</strong> Sam Altman will be here for the fireside chat in the afternoon, but won't be presenting keynotes before then.</p>

<p><strong>10:51</strong> And now a break. The schedule for the rest of the event has been updated - previously it said "to be announced during the keynote", now we are seeing that 11-11:45am is "Structured Outputs for reliable applications" and 12-12:45pm is "Powerful small models with distillation.</p>

<p><strong>10:52</strong> Then at 2-2:45pm "Multimodel apps with the realtime API.</p>

<p><strong>11:05</strong> Next up: <strong>Structured outputs for reliable applications</strong>. I've done a bunch of work with the OpenAI tools mechanism in the past for this, most notably my <a href="https://www.datasette.cloud/blog/2024/datasette-extract/">datasette-extract plugin</a> for loading unstructured text and images into structured SQLite database tables.</p>

<p><strong>11:06</strong> Atty Eleti and Michelle Pokrass are talking about <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs">structured outputs</a>, the most recent evolution of that mechanism.</p>

<p><strong>11:07</strong> Atty starts with a review of GPT-4 apps like Duolingo, Klarna and Cursor, which "connect to the outside world" - and hence need structured outputs, typically using JSON.</p>

<p><strong>11:08</strong> Classic example of how asking for JSON in the past has often been unreliable - resulting in responses that start "Here is the JSON you asked for...". Developers end up begging for "Just the JSON please!".</p>

<p><strong>11:09</strong> Function calling launched in June 2023, and which helped a bit. In November - last year's DevDay - they released JSON mode that ensured valid data - but this could still hallucinate parameters or output the wrong type.</p>

<p><strong>11:10</strong> Structured Outputs, released in August this year, ensures that the output will exactly match a specified JSON schema. Michelle will explain how this works under the hood. The challenge was making sure the solution was performant for inference at scale.</p>

<p><strong>11:12</strong> Function calling continues to work the same way: you provide a tool with a type of function, then describe that function's parameters using JSON schema. Add <code>"strict": true</code> to that JSON to turn on the new structured output mode for those functions.</p>

<p><strong>11:14</strong> And now a demo, with a function that describes data tables, their columns and operations that can be executed against them. Adding <code>"strict": true</code> fixed a bug where the model used an operator that wasn't defined in the set of operators.</p>

<p><strong>11:15</strong> <code>"response_format": {"type": "json_schema"}</code> enables specifying a full JSON schema that's guaranteed to be followed by the structured outputs mode.</p>

<p><strong>11:17</strong> The demo imagines AI-enhanced glasses, using a neat <code>{"voice_over": "This is what the glasses say to you", "display": "4 feet tall"}</code> output format which updates a display with a short string and specifies a longer string to be spoken out loud.</p>

<p><strong>11:18</strong> Next demo imagines a resume reviewing application, where you can drop a PDF resume directly onto a web form which then uses structured outputs to pull out the fields needed by the resume application.</p>

<p><strong>11:20</strong> The OpenAI library for JavaScript supports <a href="https://zod.dev/">Zod</a> for defining these schemas, and the Python library supports <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/">Pydantic</a>.</p>

<p><strong>11:21</strong> I'm presuming that previous demo converted the PDF to images automatically - I don't think any of the OpenAI APIs accept PDF directly.</p>

<p><strong>11:23</strong> This next demo is much more interesting: defining a schema for a full dashboard interface, where different cards can represent charts or tables or rows - so now the tool can output a custom answer to a question with embedded charts and data. Hopefully the code will be published on GitHub after the talk.</p>

<p><strong>11:24</strong> Overall this is a pretty sophisticated demo of a custom chat UI with a whole assortment of custom tools built on top of function calling and structured output.</p>

<p><strong>11:25</strong> Atty emphasizes that prior to structured outputs reliability was a really big problem - any of these steps failing could break the entire application.</p>

<p><strong>11:25</strong> Next, Michelle is talking about the underlying implementation of structured outputs.</p>

<p><strong>11:26</strong> "We took an approach that combined both research and engineering". It's more than just prompting - they used a technique called "constrained decoding". (Sounds to me like the <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/llama-cpp-python-grammars">Llama.cpp grammars trick</a>).</p>

<p><strong>11:27</strong> As an example, consider handwritten number recognition - where there are only ten possible output labels, from 0 to 9. This is a classic machine learning image recognition task.</p>



<p><strong>11:30</strong> For structured outputs, the trick is to limit which tokens can be produced next. The technique used here is called "token masking". The LLM still generates probabilities for likely next tokens, but they then mask out any tokens that would not match the desired schema.</p>

<p><strong>11:31</strong> These masks have to be updated on every single inference step, so the operation has to be lightning fast to keep inference as fast as possible. Token sampling happens on a GPU in batches - which means the CPU can calculate the masks for the next step in parallel while the GPU is calculating probabilities.</p>

<p><strong>11:32</strong> These masks need to be calculated within 10ms. "We wanted to pre-compute as much work as possible" - to make mask computation more of a lookup. They build an index, derived from the JSON schema, to make fetching those masks as fast as possible.</p>

<p><strong>11:33</strong> JSON Schema is converted into a grammar, then a parser, then they iterate over ALL tokens and parse states and use that to create the index.</p>

<p><strong>11:33</strong> The indexs is a trie - a prefix-based data structure allowing for O1 lookups.</p>

<p><strong>11:34</strong> Generating the index is computationally expensive due to the need to go over all of the possible states. They do that just once and cache the index - which is why the first query to structured inputs can take a little time - sometimes up to 10 seconds - but following prompts are fast.</p>

<p><strong>11:35</strong> The open source community has used tricks to implement masks by turning a schema into a regular expression. But regular expressions don't cover recursive or deeply nested schemas - so they can't cover all of the features of JSON Schema.</p>

<p><strong>11:35</strong> Generative UI is a good example of a use-case that needs nested schemas - each component can have a list of children that might include more components. These cannot be converted to a regular expression due to that limit in terms of recursive nesting.</p>

<p><strong>11:37</strong> OpenAI wanted recursive JSON schema support, so they added a stack. They call this the CFG - Context Free Grammar - approach, which combines regular expressions and a stack. This is why it takes a little bit of time to build up the trie for inference.</p>

<p><strong>11:38</strong> So the trade-off here is the short delay when the schema is first encountered, which OpenAI think is worthwhile for the improved reliability.</p>

<p><strong>11:38</strong> Atty is now talking about the research side: how can we get the model to follow the schema in the most useful way possible?</p>

<p><strong>11:39</strong> If you force a model to output JSON fitting the grammar, you might end up with <code>{\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</code> until it hits the maximum of tokens.</p>

<p><strong>11:40</strong> OpenAI's internal evals showed that gpt-4o-2024-08-06 with Structured Outputs was far more accurate than prompting alone against the older models. They now get to 100% on that eval (not sure what that's measuring though).</p>

<p><strong>11:42</strong> One of the controversial API design decisions made was around <code>additionalProperties: true</code> - which is usually a default in JSON Schema. OpenAI have disallowed additional properties by default in their API, which differs from developer expectations.</p>

<p><strong>11:42</strong> OpenAI say explicit is better, so developers have to pass <code>additionalProperties: false</code> in their schemas.</p>

<p><strong>11:43</strong> All properties are required by default - no support for optional parameters (although they can be made nullable). Developers need to follow this rule in the JSON Schemas they send over as well.</p>

<p><strong>11:43</strong> Fields are generated in the same order that you defined them in the schema, even though JSON is supposed to ignore key order. This ensures you can implement things like chain-of-thought by adding those keys in the correct order in your schema design.</p>



<p><strong>11:46</strong> This session didn't present any new features - they were all in the documentation already - but the insight into how the Structured Output works under the hood was new.</p>

<p><strong>12:01</strong> Next up: <strong>Powerful small models with distillation</strong>, with John Allard and Steven Heidel.</p>

<p><strong>12:02</strong> Distillation "allows you to create powerful, small models". They'll talk about why it matters, how it works and best practices and use cases - plus demos of the two new API platform features they are launching today.</p>

<p><strong>12:02</strong> Once you get an AI app working, the next step is figuring out how to get it to work at scale. You care about uptime, rate limits, latency and cost.</p>

<p><strong>12:04</strong> GPT-4o is 15x more expensive than GPT-4o mini, but it brings a large amount of additional "knowledge" - graduate level physics etc. It excels at the toughest knowledge benchmarks. Do you need that type of intelligence for your application?</p>

<p><strong>12:06</strong> Distillation: you fine-tune the small output on the outputs of the large model. You're compressing some of the capabilities of the large model into that smaller model.</p>

<p><strong>12:07</strong> Distillation involves three steps. The first and most important is to build task-specific evals for your application. You can't skip this step, because you can't improve what you can't measure.</p>

<p><strong>12:07</strong> The second step is to capture examples of what good performance looks like. Store example completions from a large model like GPT-4o and create a dataset.</p>

<p><strong>12:08</strong> The final step is the fine-tuning. Teach the small model how to replicate the responses from the large model by showing it many of those captured examples. We're trying to "compress the intelligence" of the large model into that small model.</p>

<p><strong>12:09</strong> A lot of people have done distillation on the OpenAI platform before, using the existing <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning">fine-tuning mechanism</a>. Doing it that way is a lot of work though.</p>

<p><strong>12:10</strong> The two new features they are launching today will make distillation easier. The first is stored completions: a new parameter to the chat completions API that will let you opt-in to storing the full input and output to the model. You can apply tags as well, to help filter those later to create datasets for fine-tuning. <code>{"store:" true}</code></p>

<p><strong>12:11</strong> The second feature is a beta of an Evals product. This should allow you to do distillation end-to-end on the OpenAI platform.</p>

<p><strong>12:11</strong> Real-world use-case based on the Superhuman email app. That app has a "quick reply" feature that suggests options for a reply based on reading through the existing thread. How would you scale that feature to hundreds of millions of emails?</p>



<p><strong>12:14</strong> Using the Python client library for <code>client.chat.completions.create()</code> you can add <code>store=True, metadata={"tag": "test-set"}</code> to store a prompt/response and add it to a tag.</p>



<p><strong>12:15</strong> Then in the new <a href="https://platform.openai.com/evalutions/create">/evalutions/create</a> interface you can add testing criteria and use that to create a new evaluation. (I don't have access to that page yet.)</p>

<p><strong>12:17</strong> Having created an eval it's easy to run that against other models - try it against GPT-4o mini and compare that with GPT-4o for example.</p>

<div data-update-id="76">
  <p><strong>12:20</strong> </p><p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/eval.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a web interface showing evaluation results for an AI model named 'quick-reply-2-4o'. The interface displays a table with columns for messages, output, and three evaluation metrics: 'repliesToRightPerson', 'repliesToMostPressingIssue', and 'repliesMakeSense'. The table shows 8 rows of data, each representing a different conversation. Overall metrics at the top indicate 95%, 91%, and 97% success rates for the three evaluation criteria respectively. The interface appears to be part of a platform called 'Distillation Test' in a 'DevDay Demo' project."></p>
</div>

<p><strong>12:21</strong> ... and now a demonstration of the fine-tuning UI, showing how a fine-tuned GPT-4o mini model on that data performs much better than 4o-mini on its own.</p>

<p><strong>12:23</strong> Is distillation right for your use-cases? That comes down to task generality against required precision. Great use-cases for distillation are tasks that cover a relatively narrow domain and have a relatively low precision requirement - a great fit for small models.</p>

<p><strong>12:23</strong> Tasks that have high precision needs but narrow generality work well too - that's a lot of forms of categorization. You may need a larger and more diverse data set to get that to work well. Same for broad generality and low precision.</p>

<p><strong>12:24</strong> Tasks with a broad generality and high need for precision are a poor fit for distillation - they need a full-powered large model.</p>

<p><strong>12:25</strong> Things to watch out for: Unevenly distributed or biased data points. Your training data should match the patterns of your production data. Also sparse examples which may result in blind spots in your data. A great example is fraud - if it's rare you might find that 1,000 samples have no instances of fraud at all!</p>

<p><strong>12:26</strong> Part of the value of distillation is you don't necessarily need human generated data or responses - but that doesn't mean you don't need to actively curate your distillation dataset. "We tend to see distillation work best with the order of thousands rather than millions of examples."</p>

<p><strong>12:27</strong> Finally, take an iterative approach. Fine-tuning might not work on your first try - there are many variables to consider. It's important to start small with a few hundred examples and scale up once you know it's working based on your evals. Don't jump straight to millions of data points.</p>

<p><strong>12:28</strong> It strikes me that fine-tuning and distillation are strategically a great way of keeping people locked to one platform - if you build an application purely on top of prompt engineering it's much easier to swap between different LLM vendors than if you have fine-tuned a model.</p>

<p><strong>12:29</strong> They expect that it will become common for applications to be built using a collection of many different distilled small models, with a few large models for tasks that don't work well for distillation.</p>

<p><strong>12:30</strong> ... and now lunch - sessions resume at 2pm.</p>

<p><strong>12:32</strong> The system I built for this live blog is very simple - just <code>fetch()</code> calls polling an endpoint and updating a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> using <code>innerHTML</code> - but the endpoint itself sets a 10s cache so Cloudflare should only let a hit through to the underlying app every 10s no matter how many people are viewing the page.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My wife and I have pledged $300,000<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> to the
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ziglang.org/zsf/">Zig Software Foundation</a> (ZSF).</p>
<p>The ZSF has <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ziglang.org/news/300k-from-mitchellh/">posted their own announcement</a>
which clearly explains their mission and specifically what the money will be
used for. Instead, I want to talk more broadly about why we've decided to
support ZSF.</p>
<p>I've been following the Zig project since sometime in 2019. I
publicly <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://x.com/mitchellh/status/1435670230215192579">shared my excitement about the project in 2021</a>.
I started using Zig later that year and by early 2022, I began
<a href="https://mitchellh.com/zig">writing about Zig</a> plus
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/10751">contributing to the compiler</a>, and
I've continued to make <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Amitchellh">a few dozen code contributions</a>
since then. In 2023, I publicly shared my <a href="https://mitchellh.com/ghostty">terminal project Ghostty</a>
which is written in Zig. Today, I spend most of my coding time in Zig.</p>
<p>My family enjoys supporting causes we believe in<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>. As part of this, we want to
support independent software projects that we believe can be transformative
and impactful, both as a way to give back to the community that gave me so
much but more importantly as a way to highlight and encourage a culture of
building for the love of building. Zig is one of those projects.</p>
<p>Zig was started as and continues to be a huge passion project. It is well
managed, the community is strong, and the funding model is transparent and
sustainable. As a technology, it is ambitious and innovative, but still
practical and pragmatic. It has a long way to go to reach stability and
broader industry adoption, but I believe it has a clear path and opportunity
to get there.</p>
<p>We're proud to support Zig and the Zig Software Foundation and are excited to see
what the future holds for the project. As a reminder, around
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ziglang.org/news/2024-financials/">a third of the funding for ZSF</a>
comes from individual donations.
Please consider <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ziglang.org/zsf/">donating</a> if you can. Thanks
Andrew for starting an amazing project and to the entire Zig community for
making it what it is today!</p>

<div><p>Tanner Green is concerned about the tiny aluminum plugs left behind when you cut 30 holes in the seat rail of a wheelchair. The cutting is done by an enormous robotic laser controlled by a computer model. A tech feeds a 20-foot aluminum tube into the machine, makes a few clicks on the computer, and the machine gets to work, cutting the tube to length, 30 holes for the axle adjustment, two channels for clamping in the footplate tubes and two etchings to help line up the tube on the bending machine. Running at full speed, the cutting takes just a couple of minutes.</p><p>It’s mesmerizing to watch. When the laser is done cutting, sometimes the leftover material just falls out, but sometimes it stays in place. “Then, you have to grab a screwdriver or some other tool and get them out yourself,” Green says as he starts whacking and prodding at the just-cut seat rail. Some plugs come out immediately, some are more stubborn. In all, it takes as long to get all the plugs out as it took for the laser to make the cuts.</p><p>For Green, the chief engineer at <a href="https://notawheelchair.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Not a Wheelchair</a>, this is one of the thousand complications standing between his team and a rather lofty goal: upending the manual wheelchair marketplace. If you’ve heard of Not a Wheelchair, it’s likely because of its owners, Zack Nelson, the star of the 8.8-million-subscriber YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JerryRigEverything" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JerryRigEverything</a>, and his wife Cambry, a para and manual wheelchair user. The Nelsons got into the mobility equipment business a few years ago when they released The Rig, an electric, adaptive off-road device with a simple yet robust and functional design priced significantly lower than anything else on the market. Now, they’re bringing that same ethos to manual wheelchairs.</p><p>Not a Wheelchair aims to offer a base-model, custom manual wheelchair at a similar or better quality than most of the insurance-approved wheelchairs in the U.S. for $999. Yes, that’s just under $1,000 for everything — wheels, handrims, tires, side guards and rigid, angle-adjustable backrest included. And the company plans to have a turnaround time of weeks, rather than the monthslong slog that it typically takes from order to delivery.</p><p>When I first heard about this, it sounded awesome and a bit far-fetched. It’s hard to find a pair of quality wheelchair wheels for less than $500. Same with a rigid backrest. How were they going to offer both, plus a custom wheelchair frame without compromising on quality? I drove to their headquarters in Utah to find out.</p></div>

<h2>Inside the Paradox</h2>



<div><p>When you turn into the neighborhood where Not a Wheelchair’s manufacturing facility is, you’re greeted by about a dozen cows chewing grass in a smallish, triangular field. There’s a busy road to one side and brand new, multistory apartment complexes on the other two sides. There’s no indication of how the cows got there — as if a city suddenly sprung up around them. Past the cows and the apartments are rows of warehouses. Then you turn the corner and the buildings go from huge to enormous. Not a Wheelchair is housed in one of the largest buildings I’ve ever seen.</p><p>I roll inside and am greeted by Nelson and Green. Nelson looks familiar because he’s exactly as he appears on YouTube — tall, muscular and shiny bald, with a soft, measured voice. The office space is still spartan — just a row of computers and a kitchen. “None of this was here even a few weeks ago,” Green says. “We took over an empty building about five weeks ago, and it’s been non-stop ever since.”</p></div>



<div><p>The Not a Wheelchair name started to differentiate The Rig — an electric offroad vehicle capable of going places that a wheelchair could not. Nelson is famous for building and modifying all sorts of things — from converting a Humvee to electric power to digging an enormous bunker in the couple’s backyard, but Not a Wheelchair has quickly taken on an identity of its own. “We’ve always seen ourselves as an outdoor mobility company,” says Nelson. “We want to make it easier for people to move around outside and in their communities.” Now though, Nelson finds himself about to release a manual wheelchair under the Not a Wheelchair name. “We started calling it The Paradox Project,” he says. “But if you have a better idea for a name, we’re open to suggestions.”</p><p>When I roll out to the manufacturing floor, there are huge machines scattered across the 26,000-square-foot space. There’s an apartment-sized laser cutter that looks like it should be stationed on a spaceship, a computer-controlled tubing bender, a welding station, powder coating and curing cabinets, an assembly area and a half dozen other prototyping and testing machines scattered along the perimeter. The machines are set up as a series of production pods that snake in a sequential line from start (cutting tubes) to the end (assembly) of the wheelchair-making process.</p></div>

<div><p>“The culture I grew up in in terms of my career was very much around process improvement,” says Green, who’s worked with semi-conductors at Intel, missiles at Raytheon and medical devices at a smaller consulting firm. He first connected with Nelson after watching a YouTube video about The Rig and thinking it was a cool project. He cold-emailed Nelson, volunteering his engineering services for anything Nelson needed help with. Just a year or so later, Nelson convinced Green to move to Utah and work full time with Not a Wheelchair. Green has been working on the manual wheelchair project for almost two years and for him, having a good design is only the first stage in the process. Turning that design into a quality product, quickly, inexpensively and consistently takes a dozen interdependent steps.</p><p>The first step in the manufacturing process is to cut the frame tubing, and you can’t move to the next step without removing those annoying aluminum plugs. Green says they’ve been messing with the settings on the cutter to get more of the plugs to release on their own. It might only save a minute per chair — but when you’re trying to change the wheelchair industry, every minute counts.</p><p>At the next stage of the process — bending — Nelson is watching the process as a tech slowly puts the machine through its process at about 10% of its capability. “Are we running at 100%? Why is this so slow?” Nelson asks. “Come on, let’s get it moving. We can go faster than this.”</p><p>Speed is part of the culture at Not a Wheelchair. “The whole goal is to get from idea to drawing to actual physical product that we can test as fast as possible,” Nelson says. With their current setup, the team can build an entire chair in a few hours, and that time is coming down quickly as the company’s 15 employees get more comfortable with the process.</p><p>Everybody I talked to was on the same page. Why go fast? Because it matters how long it takes for someone to get a new wheelchair. “The time it takes means that somebody is being impacted by not being able to get that chair sooner,” says Green. “If they’re waiting six, eight, 12 months for a chair, that’s six, eight, 12 months that they’re going without. They’re having to make do with what they have, whether it’s something that doesn’t fit them, it’s broken, or some other issue. I don’t want to make anybody wait that long for something that’s an important part of their life.”</p></div>

<h2>YouTube $</h2>



<div><p>If you’re looking at the reasons that Not a Wheelchair is able to make a $1,000 wheelchair, hyper-efficient manufacturing techniques and state-of-the-art equipment are near the top of the list. But factories and enormous fancy machines cost a lot of money, and in any normal business model, those costs are passed on to the consumer. But what if the owners aren’t dependent on — or even interested in — making money from the business? Meet Zack and Cambry, YouTube stars.</p><p>Nelson started his YouTube channel 12 years ago. He was in college and had no career path. He just knew he wanted to be his own boss. He had a jeep with a busted gear inside the transfer case. “Instead of taking it to the shop and fixing it for $1,000, I followed this YouTube video and fixed it for like 60 bucks instead,” he says. “So I emailed the guy who made the video and I was like, ‘Why did you make this video for people? It’s such a nice thing to do.’ He said, ‘To decrease world suck, to make the world a better place, and also I make money for the ads that appear when the videos are playing.’ That was an epiphany for me, like, ‘Oh, I could be my own boss. I could do the projects that I’m already doing anyway, film them and make money on the internet.’ That satisfied every little box I was looking for in a career.”</p><p>Nelson started with videos of himself repairing his jeep and quickly moved onto durability and repair videos for smart phones, which turned into the bread and butter of his growing YouTube presence. Nelson didn’t have any knowledge of mobility products, or any personal experience with disability, until he met Cambry.</p></div>

<div><p>Cambry is slight and blond. She got hurt doing equestrian vaulting — basically gymnastics on horseback and yes, it’s as wild as it sounds. Zack and Cambry met via an online dating app and Cambry was upfront about her disability. “Before our first date, Zack asked me if there was anything he needed to do to pick me up,” Cambry says. “I really wanted to make up a big story about how he would have to go to DMV to get a special license to be able to take me anywhere, but I chickened out and told him, ‘You know, usually I just meet someone at a restaurant.’”</p><p>Like all wheelchair users on a first date, Cambry was worried Zack was going to be weird about her disability. “But his first disability-related question was to ask if I’d done any cool upgrades to my wheelchair.” She had not. But this was someone she could hang out with.</p><p>Not long after they started dating, Nelson surprised her with a DIY off-road wheelchair — two electric bikes with a welded seat in the middle, “chariot-style” as Nelson puts it in the video where Cambry tries it out for the first time. That video was also Cambry’s first appearance on the YouTube channel. She’s clearly nervous about being on camera and freezes for a second when Zack asks her a question. Once she’s on the bike, she quickly settles in, blasting around grassy fields and almost flipping herself as she climbs a curb at full speed.</p><p>That video has 11 million views and counting. A year later, when Zack and Cambry released a video debuting The Rig, Cambry looks like a pro. Zack and Cambry got married in 2019 and now have two kids. Cambry remains a regular presence on the YouTube channel. She explains the challenges of living with a disability in a straightforward, relatable way and is fun and adventurous when trying out the new gear. It’s a hard needle to thread when you’re living off YouTube views, but Cambry passes the realness test and does a good job of normalizing disability for the channel’s audience, the vast majority of whom aren’t disabled.</p><p>Videos with Cambry and accessibility projects consistently get millions of views. “The internet loves Cambry,” Zack says. “I’ve tested videos where I’ll do two versions of the exact same video, one with a photo of me as the thumbnail and the other with Cambry, and the one with Cambry will get like twice as many views.”</p><p>In the world of YouTube, putting out multimillion-view videos translates to millions in revenue in the form of ads, partnerships and affiliate sales. It’s that income stream that has allowed the Nelsons to fund a wheelchair production factory, along with the staff to go along with it, without incurring massive amounts of debt.</p></div>

<div><p>While I’m rolling around the Not a Wheelchair facility, marveling at the scale of it, I can’t help but wonder why they decided to do it. I mean, it’s one thing to build cool, one-off mobility devices. It’s another thing entirely to self-fund and spend years developing the capacity to mass produce affordable wheelchairs. For Zack and Cambry, it was pretty simple: There is clearly a need. And with Zack’s background and connections, combined with the income from JerryRigEverything, they were in a unique position to do something about it.</p><p>“Jumping through many levels worth of hoops just to get a wheelchair was incredibly frustrating for me,” says Cambry. “I got engaged to Zack in 2019 and wanted to buy a new wheelchair before my wedding, which was six months away at the time, and my new chair almost didn’t even arrive in time for our wedding day. It was stressful knowing that my current wheelchair could break at any time and leave me stranded for weeks or months. I know I’m not the only one who had that stress in the back of my mind. So hopefully, now with our own wheelchair factory, we are able to fix some of those problems.”</p></div>



<h2>The Wheelchair Business</h2>



<p>Not a Wheelchair will sell its manual wheelchairs directly to consumers. That means if you want a wheelchair, you can go to the website, click through to an online configurator and spec out your wheelchair in real time. You enter your measurements, and a 3D model of your chair adjusts to your tweaks. You can see the difference that seat depths, backrest heights and frame angles make on the finished product.</p>



<div><p>Once the company opens to the public, Not a Wheelchair expects to have a custom, manual wheelchair shipped four weeks after you hit the order button. Ramped up to full speed, they hope to have that time down to two weeks. Compared to the typical wheelchair buying process, that is — to borrow a phrase from <em>Space Balls</em> — ludicrous speed. Not a Wheelchair aims to do it not only by automating as much of the process as possible, but also by eliminating the middlemen. That means no seating clinic, no insurance company, no DME supplier. This has pros and cons.</p><p>Let’s start with the seating clinic. The main purpose of the seating clinic or a physical therapist wheelchair evaluation is to provide you with expert advice about what equipment — from wheelchair type to components and wheelchair measurements — is best for your body and for your needs, and to make sure, using pressure mapping, that the equipment you ordered fits you properly and protects you from pressure sores. I’ll let you judge how often that process results in perfectly fitting equipment. Not a Wheelchair is making consumers supply their own measurements. That can be from the chair you’re already sitting in, from a seating clinic or conjured up after comparing specs from your friends at happy hour. That gives you the power to order what you want. But it also means that if the chair doesn’t fit, it’s on you.</p></div>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="748" height="924" src="https://newmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/notawheelchair-redtape-829x1024.jpg" alt="man kneeling next to woman in wheelchair symbolically cutting through red tape over a wheelchair" srcset="https://newmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/notawheelchair-redtape.jpg 748w, https://newmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/notawheelchair-redtape-243x300.jpg 243w, https://newmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/notawheelchair-redtape-768x948.jpg 749w, https://newmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/notawheelchair-redtape-50x62.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px"><figcaption>One of the company’s goals is to cut through the red tape associated with buying a wheelchair.</figcaption></figure></div>


<div><p>Next up, insurance companies. They’re supposed to pay for your equipment. But they also require you to use other middlemen, which increases costs. In today’s broken system of U.S. healthcare, most insurance, even private, will pay a bare minimum for manual wheelchairs and components. Copays for that basic equipment often cost more than $1,000. For wheelchair users with specific needs (most of us) who go through the runaround of denials, only to be “approved” and still owe four figures, it can feel like a shell game.</p><p>Lastly, DME suppliers. Two helpful services that DME suppliers are supposed to provide are wheelchair setup and repair. In Not a Wheelchair’s model, you do the adjustment and repair yourself, get a friend or family member to help, or find a local bike shop willing to work on your chair.</p></div>



<div><p>“The whole point of my YouTube channel is durability and repairability. I’ve been preaching that for 12 years, so we’re bringing that into the chair as well. We’re using standard hardware, and we’re consolidating as many of the bolts as possible to as few sizes as possible so that there are fewer tools needed. We want to be able to make it simple enough that people can do the adjustments and the repairs by themselves, and if they need a caster replaced, something binds up or the bearing inside the caster seizes, they can pop the caster off and put a new one on and we’ll sell those replacement parts. Or, if they’re under warranty, we’ll just give them those replacement parts.”</p><p>Nelson says that they’re pitching the chair as a secondary option for wheelchairs users, something to have around for traveling or getting dirty or as a backup chair. For $1,000, that seems reasonable. But for that price and ease of ordering, it’s reasonable to assume that no matter how the chairs are being pitched, a lot of wheelchair users will choose to order one as their primary chair. How the easy order process and results will work at scale is a big unknown. Another big question: How exactly are they going to make a profit charging that little for a wheelchair?</p><p>They’re not. Same as with The Rig and any other products they develop, Zack and Cambry won’t be taking any profit from Not a Wheelchair, and they aren’t taking any salary from the company, which operates separately from the YouTube channel. “It’s a passion project for us,” says Nelson. To be clear, Not a Wheelchair isn’t a nonprofit — it’s currently licensed as a benefit company, a newer designation of a for-profit company that provides a public service. “Once it’s established, it’s going to become an employee-owned company. I want my employees to be extremely well taken care of, but as owners, we have other ways of making money,” says Nelson.</p><p>Second, they’re offering the base model chair at low margins. If you order a chair with no upgrades from Not a Wheelchair, your costs won’t be much more than it costs the company to get it to you. Margins are higher for upgrades — things like a carbon fiber seat pan, wooden handrims and more complicated frame bends. “As people change the options on their wheelchair and get a more premium version, we make more profit on that,” says Nelson. “We’ll happily take money from people who want to upgrade their machines, but we don’t want to take money from people who just need the basics.”</p></div>



<h2>Testing, Testing</h2>



<div><p>So how does Not a Wheelchair’s base model chair stack up to other options on the market? I hate to sound like a preacher, but … it’s totally reasonable! It hits the mark of being at least as good, if not better, than the majority of insurance-approved wheelchairs in the U.S.</p><p>Not a Wheelchair made me a base model chair to try for this article. They didn’t ask me to write good things about it, and they’re not paying for advertising. (The other benefit of having a huge YouTube channel, is you also have a built-in marketing channel with a worldwide reach.) The chair they gave me is basic. I’ve been using it on and off for a couple of weeks since I visited the factory. It rolls straight and smooth. It doesn’t weigh that much more than my fully-fixed, titanium-framed chair. Its backrest is comfortable and angle-adjustable. The rear seat height is adjustable, along with the front caster height and angle, and the center of gravity. It feels solid, not all janky and rattly, like old-school adjustable chairs did.</p></div>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="785" height="924" src="https://newmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cambry-minature-horses-870x1024.jpg" alt="woman in wheelchair feeding miniature horses" srcset="https://newmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cambry-minature-horses.jpg 785w, https://newmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cambry-minature-horses-255x300.jpg 255w, https://newmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cambry-minature-horses-768x904.jpg 768w, https://newmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cambry-minature-horses-50x59.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 785px) 100vw, 785px"><figcaption>The Nelsons keep miniature horses on their property, and Cambry wanted a wheelchair that could handle the rigors of an active lifestyle.</figcaption></figure>



<div><p>The wheels, which Not a Wheelchair commissioned from <a href="https://vaporwheels.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vapors Wheels</a>, are great. I liked them so much that I stole them to replace the $900, fiber-spoked wheels that keep going out of true on my titanium chair. I put the old wheels with some fatter tires on the Not a Wheelchair and lowered the rear seat height so I could use it as an off-road chair for pushing around the dirt and grass around my house. I’ll keep pushing <a href="https://newmobility.com/finding-the-right-wheelchair/" data-type="post" data-id="44071" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my titanium chair </a>for everyday life because I like how titanium rides, and my chair is fitted with ergo seating and other frame customizations that Not a Wheelchair isn’t yet offering.</p><p>But the Not a Wheelchair won’t sit in my garage getting dusty. It’ll be getting dirty in the summer and snowy in the winter. And if my other chair breaks, I know I have a comfy, perfectly acceptable option to use while I’m fixing it. And that’s kind of the point: Wheelchairs shouldn’t be so expensive that you can’t afford to have a backup or one with an alternate seating position for specific activities. Not a Wheelchair might finally be the company with the means and the will to change that.</p><p>Touring the factory, I saw other prototypes scattered all around the facility. There’s a beefier, four-wheel drive version of The Rig that the company just launched. There’s a track wheelchair that’s still in development. It’s clear that Not a Wheelchair doesn’t intend to stop at a simple, manual wheelchair. Inexpensive components, more advanced electric off-road devices, power assist, it’s all on the table. “We’re just really excited to see where this leads,” says Green.</p></div>

We’ve been building AI video models for ‘digital twins’ or ‘avatars’ since 2020.</p><p>We’re sharing some of the challenges we faced building an AI video interface that has realistic conversations with a human, including getting it to under 1 second of latency.</p><p>To try it, talk to Hassaan’s digital twin: <a href="https://www.hassaanraza.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.hassaanraza.com</a>, or to our "demo twin" Carter: <a href="https://www.tavus.io/">https://www.tavus.io</a></p><p>We built this because until now, we've had to adapt communication to the limits of technology. But what if we could interact naturally with a computer? Conversational video makes it possible – we think it'll eventually be a key human-computer interface.</p><p>To make conversational video effective, it has to have really low latency and conversational awareness. A fast-paced conversation between friends has ~250 ms between utterances, but if you’re talking about something more complex or with someone new, there is additional “thinking” time. So, less than 1000 ms latency makes the conversation feel pretty realistic, and that became our target.</p><p>Our architecture decisions had to balance 3 things: latency, scale, &amp; cost. Getting all of these was a huge challenge.</p><p>The first lesson learned was to make it low-latency, we had to build it from the ground up. We went from a team that cared about seconds to a team that counts every millisecond. We also had to support thousands of conversations happening all at once, without getting destroyed on compute costs.</p><p>For example, during early development, each conversation had to run on an individual H100 in order to fit all components and model weights into GPU memory just to run our Phoenix-1 model faster than 30fps. This was unscalable &amp; expensive.</p><p>We developed a new model, Phoenix-2, with a number of improvements, including inference speed. We switched from a NeRF based backbone to  Gaussian Splatting for a multitude of reasons, one being the requirement that we could generate frames faster than realtime, at 70+ fps on lower-end hardware. 
We exceeded this and focused on optimizing memory and core usage on GPU to allow for lower-end hardware to run it all. We did other things to save on time and cost like using streaming vs batching, parallelizing processes, etc. But those are stories for another day.</p><p>We still had to lower the utterance-to-utterance time to hit our goal of under a second of latency. This meant each component (vision, ASR, LLM, TTS, video generation) had to be hyper-optimized.</p><p>The worst offender was the LLM. It didn’t matter how fast the tokens per second (t/s) were, it was the time-to-first token (tfft) that really made the difference. That meant services like Groq were actually too slow – they had high t/s, but slow ttft. Most providers were too slow.</p><p>The next worst offender was actually detecting when someone stopped speaking. This is  hard. Basic solutions use time after silence to ‘determine’ when someone has stopped talking. But it adds latency. If you tune it to be too short, the AI agent will talk over you. Too long, and it’ll take a while to respond. The model had to be dedicated to accurately detecting end-of-turn based on conversation signals, and speculating on inputs to get a head start.</p><p>We went from 3-5 to &lt;1 second (&amp; as fast as 600 ms) with these architectural optimizations while running on lower-end hardware.</p><p>All this allowed us to ship with a less than 1 second of latency, which we believe is the fastest out there. We have a bunch of customers, including Delphi, a professional coach and expert cloning platform. They have users that have conversations with digital twins that span from minutes, to one hour, to even four hours (!) - which is mind blowing, even to us.</p><p>Thanks for reading! let us know what you think and what you would build.

  <p><em>[Note that this article is a transcript of the video embedded above.]</em></p><p>If you have to know the answer right away, it’s no; or at least, my goal with this video is to convince you that the world is not running out of sand. But if it were that simple, I wouldn’t be here (right?) and you probably wouldn’t be either. In fact, I was really surprised by some of the things I didn’t know as I dug deeper into the topic further, and how some of the most widely spread sand “facts” are dead wrong.</p><p>The wide world of sand is complicated, and not in a boring, pedantic kind of way. This simple material touches nearly every part of our lives, and the science and engineering behind it is rich and deep, and to me at least, hard not to become obsessed with. There’s a good chance you’ve seen articles or videos over the past few years with essentially the same story about sand. The “Sand Wars” documentary kind of kicked off the modern discussion, and then Vince Beiser wrote an excellent book on the topic, “The World in a Grain.” Of course, a lot of the book’s best reviews focus on the fact that sand is kind of a topic that’s “taken for granted” or “neglected.” But, at least in civil engineering, it is one of the most glected materials out there. And I’d like to give you a peek behind the curtain and show you how we think about this seemingly unlimited resource and why it’s worth knowing a little more about it. But first, I need to head out to the garage and put some sand in a rock tumbler, because I want to do a material property shootout, and this is going to take a little while. I have something really cool in the other barrel, and I’ll show it to you later on in the video. I’m Grady, and this is Practical Engineering.</p><p>What the heck is sand anyway? It’s kind of a “know it when you see it”-type material. If we use the US Department of Agriculture’s soil textural triangle, sand is any granular material that is at least 85% sand… So, what the heck is sand? For a better answer, we have the Unified Soil Classification System. Geotechnical engineers sometimes say that “dirt” is a four-letter word. Maybe because it undermines the importance of soil (which is also a four-letter word, by the way), but I like to think it’s because we have better names for all the dirts around the world, and here they are. In fact, there are four specific kinds of sand, but they all fit this one criterion, and it’s all about the size of the particles. At least half of those particles have to make it through a Number 4 sieve (about 5 millimeters), but no more than half can go through a Number 200 sieve (less than a tenth of a millimeter, or about 75 microns). That is a pretty wide range of materials, but I think when you picture sand in your mind, you probably imagine what the USCS would call “clean sand” where less than 12% pass the 200 sieve. So, just to make it simple, let’s say that sand is a material where the particles fit through this, but they don’t fit through this. But still, that encompasses a huge range of different dirts. And I hope, at this point, you’re asking, “Who Cares?” because I would love to answer that question.</p><p>In his book, Beiser calls sand “the most important solid substance on earth…the literal foundation of modern civilization…” We use it to make glass, semiconductors, fiber optics, filters, and abrasives, use it to texture surfaces, to play in, for beauty, and more. But, probably more than anything else, sand is an essential ingredient in concrete. And, you know, I’m a civil engineer; this is a channel about the built environment; so I wanna talk about concrete. And, in fact, if this video sparks your curiosity about one of my favorite materials, I have a whole playlist of topics I’ve covered in the past so you can learn more after this. You can’t really overstate how important concrete is and how much of it we use. There’s a bigger conversation to be had about its environmental impacts, but when compared to alternative building materials, it just has so much going for it. It is an extremely low-cost, durable substance that can be made into just about any shape you can imagine. Concrete has enabled us to build structures that last for generations from some very simple ingredients that are (mostly) available across the world: water, cement, gravel, and sand.</p><p>Most of those ingredients are mined and used directly as raw materials. And they’re usually mined close by. Transportation makes up a big part of the cost associated with sands used for construction, so the distance between where they’re found and where they need to go is highly correlated with how economical they can be. And that often leads to environmental impacts, some worse than others, depending on local regulations. It turns out that the best sand for concrete often comes from rivers, and mining in rivers can be particularly destructive because the impacts can spread upstream and downstream through changes in the nature of the channel. (I have a series of videos on that topic, too, by the way). Sand isn’t spread evenly throughout the world, and it’s a non-renewable resource. Geologic processes produce it a lot slower than we can use it. So, it makes some intuitive sense to say that we could eventually run out. But here’s a fact that is often overlooked in the discussion: we can make sand.</p><p>And it’s not that complicated, either. I talked about the definition of sand a little earlier, but here’s another one: it’s just very small rocks. And we have engineered machines that can transform big rocks into small ones. In fact, I have such a machine in my garage. It’s called a hammer. Some might argue that this isn’t the best use of my time, but I spent about an hour to artisanally manufacture a batch of sand just to hammer this point home. First, you crush the rocks. Then you put them through the sieves to remove the stuff that’s too big or too small. It takes a little extra processing, but this is not grain surgery. And this has a lot of benefits compared to sourcing natural sand. Hard rock quarries and crushing operations are already out there producing coarse aggregates like gravel, so sometimes the smaller stuff is a waste product anyway. It opens up possibilities when natural deposits aren’t available and can move mining operations upland, away from rivers, where the environmental impacts are less severe. And, it can make the concrete stronger. Let me show you what I mean.</p><p>I took some sand out of my kids’ sandbox and put it in a rock tumbler for a week to try and simulate the erosion it might see over years in windswept dunes of a desert. Obviously, this erosion reduced the overall size of the particles. So, I classified both materials with the sieves to make them a closer match for a fair comparison. And both batches are within the spec for concrete sand in the US. Looking in the microscope, you can clearly see the differences. The tumbled sand is rounded with roughly spherical, smooth grains. The manufactured sand is jagged with sharp, angular corners. And watch what happens when I pile them up. I filled up two pieces of pipe with the same amount of sand, and then pulled the pipe away. It’s not a huge difference, but you can see the rounded sand spreads out a little further because the particles have less friction. It makes intuitive sense that concrete made from this sand would be weaker than with this sand. Let’s see if that’s true.</p><p>I mixed up a simple batch of concrete from the crushed sand, and the tumbled sand keeping the weights of all the ingredients equal. Here’s my recipe if you want to try this experiment yourself. Then I molded some concrete cylinders and let them cure for a week. Most concrete mixes are meant to reach their design strength after 28 days, but concrete strength gain is fairly predictable, so the relative difference between the samples should be consistent in time. Most importantly, my little benchtop hydraulic press would not be able to break these samples if I waited that long. And this load cell is not calibrated, so I’m doing this test in arbitrary Practical Engineering units of force. The tumbled sand cylinder broke at around 2500 units. And the manufactured sand concrete broke at 7500 units. You can easily see the difference in the results. “Goodnight!” It was 3 times as strong. Of course, this is my garage, not a testing lab, and I only did one sample because my arm got tired of hammering rocks. Luckily, people much smarter than me have tested this out, and the results are pretty conclusive that, if you keep everything the same, the angularity of fine aggregate increases the strength of concrete. And that’s the story you probably know if you’ve read anything on this topic. It’s the common explanation for why we don’t use dune sand, the most visible of earth’s sand resources, in concrete. It’s intuitive. Rounded grains don’t lock together. Beiser makes the claim not once but three times in his book. But it turns out it’s not that simple, because strength isn’t the only property of concrete that we care about.</p><p>Before concrete has to be strong, it has to be placed. Ask anyone who’s done this kind of work, and they’ll tell you it’s hard. Well, it’s liquid at first, but it’s hard to work with. Concrete is about two-and-a-half times the density of water. It’s heavy stuff, and to get it into the forms often can require a lot of different tools: wheelbarrows, buggies, chutes, pumps, hoses, and more. The better the concrete flows, the easier it is to do a good job of placing it. And that matters. If a mix is too stiff, it can clog up hoses, trap air bubbles, and ultimately lead to poor quality in the installed product. This property of concrete is usually called workability. It’s often measured using a slump test. Fill up a cone of concrete, pull the cone away, and see how far the concrete slumps. But the problem with workability is that, in one big way, it works against strength. And it all has to do with water.</p><p>What happens when the concrete truck shows up to your job site and the mix is too stiff? Depends on if the engineer is there or not, but in a lot of cases, you just tell the driver to add a few gallons of water to the mix. More water; better flow; easier to place. It’s pretty straightforward, but there’s a reason you don’t want the engineer to know: water decreases concrete strength. I’ve done a whole video about this with some garage demos, so again, check that out if you want to learn more. The gist is that the ratio of water to cement is one of the most important factors determining concrete's strength when it cures. Cement isn’t like some types of glue that harden as the water or solvent evaporates. It goes through a chemical reaction, incorporating the water into the final product. That’s why we say concrete “cures” instead of “dries”. But, cement can only react with around 35 percent of its weight in water, so any more than that is just taking up volume in the mix that could be used by the stronger ingredients. More water; less strong. And here’s where the shape of the sand grains comes into play.</p><p>I did a little garage slump test to gauge the workability of those two mixes I made for the earlier demonstration. Here’s the rounded sand mix… and here’s the manufactured sand. “Haha, no slump at all.” Honestly I expected this to be a subtle difference, but it was like night and day. They weren’t even close. So I wondered, what would happen if, instead of holding ingredient ratios constant, I used the workability as the controlled variable? Let’s find out. First I used the manufactured sand with enough water to get it to a workable level. 100 milliliters got it to here, which is a bit better than the first one. Then I did a second mix with the tumbled sand, slowly adding water and running the slump test until it was pretty close. It took only 70 ml of water to make them match, 30% less than the first batch. After a week, I tested the samples. The tumbled sand sample broke at 4,800 units. And the manufactured sand broke at only 4,300 units. The tumbled sand with the rounder grains was stronger this time (by about ten percent), and it’s all due to the lower water content in the mix.</p><p>So yes, if you use the same amount of water, more angular sand like you might find from a river or manufactured sand is better, but that’s not what happens in real construction. I say this with many, many caveats, but very generally, you only add as much water as you need for workability. Rounded sand gives you better workability, so you can add less water, and thus get stronger concrete. This idea that we can’t use wind-blown sands in concrete because of their shape is a myth. In fact, the American Concrete Institute has a bulletin that says it better than I can:</p><p>“The influence of fine aggregate shape and texture on the strength of hardened concrete is almost entirely related to the resulting water-to-cement ratio of the concrete…”</p><p>I tried to track down the original source of this idea that we can’t use rounded grains in concrete, but got nowhere. Beiser cites an article from the UN, which itself cites a 2006 paper about using two types of desert sand from China in concrete. But that paper doesn’t mention the roundness of the particles at all. They didn’t include any measure of the shape of the grains in their study, and they didn’t make any suggestions about how that particular property of the desert sand may have affected the results of their tests. In fact, the conclusion of that paper includes saying that desert sand is a feasible alternative to other types of fine aggregates used in concrete. And the whole reason it was a subject of scientific study at all has to do with size, not shape. This is a widely used specification for the distribution of particle sizes of fine aggregate for concrete. Any sand in this area meets the spec. And here’s the soil used in that paper. Even if the conclusion was that it doesn’t work, I think this would have a lot more to do with the results than the shape of the particles.</p><p>And that really gets to the heart of this whole discussion. Fine aggregates are found throughout the world. We can even make our own. And concrete is like baking; different ingredients can change the end results. But just like regional bread recipes evolved based on the availability of local ingredients, the construction industry has developed a lot of ways to use different local materials to achieve good structural properties. The real challenge, like many things in engineering, is cost.</p><p>It can be more expensive to manufacture sand compared to mining raw materials that can be put directly in a mix, especially when you factor in the other ingredients, like chemical admixtures, that might be required to make it more workable without adding too much water. It’s expensive to transport better quality sand from far away, rather than finding it close to a job site or batch plant. It’s expensive to mine sand in adherence to environmental regulations that are becoming stricter worldwide. It’s catchy to say there’s a scarcity of fine aggregates on earth, but I think it’s misleading. “Sand is getting a lot more expensive than it used to be” just doesn’t make as nice of a headline. And the tricky part is that, in many ways, those costs have always been there; we’ve just externalized them onto the environment and our future.</p><p>All the ingredients in concrete are mined or harvested just like other natural resources. It’s just that concrete is made on a scale that blows most other materials out of the water. It’s a huge business, and there’s lots of money flowing, which means a lot of potential environmental harm and social conflict as a result. That’s especially true in places that don’t have robust oversight and enforcement of how sand is extracted. And I think it’s important to point out that the low-cost of sand, because of its simplicity as a material and its abundance, is a big part of why we use so much concrete in the first place, even in situations where it’s not necessarily the best material choice in other respects. Everything in engineering is a tradeoff, and if the economics around sand change, the engineering and construction industries can change with them. Look at other examples of this. </p><p>Diamond used to be exclusively a mined material, but now we can make it in a lab. Synthetic diamond gemstones used in jewelry are now less expensive than mined diamonds, but, admittedly, there’s a lot more to that economy than the costs to make them. What I think is more interesting is that 99 percent of diamond used in the world for industrial purposes is synthetic. It used to be a rare mineral, but now you can pick up a diamond drill bit or saw blade from the hardware store for a fairly small premium.</p><p>Timber is another example. Natural forests used to be the only source, but now plantations, trees planted specifically for harvest, now make up more than a third of the wood we use globally. And engineered lumber like plywood, OSB, and structural composites can make more efficient use of raw materials. I’m pointing out these examples, not to say they’re good or bad - there are pros and cons in both cases - but just to illustrate how our demand for materials in the construction industry changes with the supply, and how technology can have a huge impact on that. And there’s another parallel between timber and sand: they both can be renewable.</p><p>I had another barrel in the rock tumbler not going to use, so I broke up some chunks of concrete and threw them in. I ran these through the grits, just like you would with any other rock in a tumbler. Concrete is pretty soft compared to most natural rocks, so it didn’t polish up that nicely, but the result is still pretty cool. You can really see the constituent materials of the concrete after it spent so long rolling around in there: the small and large aggregates and the cement paste locking them together. But the point of this demo is that concrete is pretty much just rock, that’s mostly what it’s made of in the first place. And just like the rocks I crushed to create manufactured sand, concrete can be recycled into aggregates that get reused in the construction industry, either in new concrete or other materials, reducing demand for virgin sources.</p><p>There’s a lot changing in the construction industry, and a lot of growth in the need for materials like sand and gravel. But I don’t think it’s fair to say the world is running out of those materials. We’re just more aware of all the costs involved in procuring them, and hopefully taking more account for how they affect our future and the environment.</p>

  Email: stephan dot fassmann at gmail</p><p>You need a Technical Writer. You have developers that have trained extensively to talk to computers often in multiple languages. And it is hard enough to write documentation for other developers. Asking them to create documentation talking to users, system administrators, DevOps and management are even more dialects because they speak in their own jargon, and it costs a lot of their very expensive time. 
I know technology, hardware, software, firmware and more. In tech, medical, aerospace, automotive and IT industries. I can do the translating for developers so they can concentrate on making the hard stuff. 
I also know user experience (UX) I can guide you to make better user interfaces and keep you from making those mistakes that cripple many products.</p></div></td></tr>

I've been programming for nearly two decades and have a lot of experience in various technologies. Lately I've been learning game development in Elixir - a very weird task.</p><p>I think that's where my value is, though. I love working on weird, unknown projects. Basically everyone I talked to in the Elixir community about game development said it was a waste of time, but I've been showing that it's not only possible, it's quite nice!</p><p>I'm always looking for interesting and challenging problems. My wide range of experience (both with and without computers) helps me figure out tasks that don't have prior art. I'm very capable when it comes to R&amp;D type projects.</p><p>Honestly, if you just need someone to churn out CRUD apps, you probably don't want to hire me. But if you have some weird ideas that you don't have someone on your team to figure out, I'm your man.</p></div></td></tr>

I can help you gather data, preprocess it, design models, train models, etc etc. My ideal job would be doing generative AI stuff with images/audio/video, but I'm open to anywhere there's gradients to descend. Recently I've been working on a project building a text-to-image model that learns solely with unlabeled image data, relying on CLIP for the link between captions and images[1]. I think it's a) cool and b) demonstrative of strong abilities. At a higher level of abstraction you can think of this as embedding guided content synthesis. The model learns to generate images conditioned on their CLIP embedding being within an input spherical cap. If you center the cap on the CLIP embedding of some text you get images that look like they'd have that caption, if you center it on the embedding of another image you get semantically similar images. The radius of the cap determines how similar the outputs are.</p><p>[1]: <a href="https://www.echonolan.net/posts/2024-03-09-is-it-possible-to-train-a-text-to-image-model-without-any-text.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.echonolan.net/posts/2024-03-09-is-it-possible-to...</a> new model that generates better samples coming soon</p></div></td></tr>

Computers are an incredibly powerful tool, and I am always looking for ways to help others take advantage of that power.

I enjoy the challenge of making complex functionality work in a performance-constrained environment. But I also know that code doesn't live in a vacuum, and I care a lot about making sure what I'm building actually solves problems for the business and the customer. I am always looking for opportunities to work more closely with stakeholders to ensure me and my team are on the right track.</p><p>I have lots of experience supporting interns and junior engineers, and always love opportunities to be a teacher or mentor.

I'm pretty much always working on something I've never done before in the context of one of a handful of long-running side-projects I have.</p><p>My most recent professional experience has been about a year at a semiconductor startup where I wrote a functional simulator and a compiler.</p><p>One of my side-projects of ~8 years is a 3D game engine. Working on it has taught me a great deal about systems and graphics programming. It runs on Windows, Linux and Web (WASM/WebGL). I chose to build it without any libraries (barring the CRT for startup), which began as a learning exercise, but has taught me the value of simplicity.</p><p>In more recent history I've been working on a metaprogramming system for C. Think C++ templates/constexpr, but somewhat more flexible, and with intelligible error messages. It turns out I have a small passion for compilers. I was also recently contributing to Oil, a new bash runtime and POSIX compliant shell.</p><p>That's the cliff-notes on my technical background. As a person I'm friendly and easy to get along with. I like the phrase "Have strong opinions, weakly held". Outside of work I enjoy surfing, backcountry skiing, snowmobiling, rock-climbing and beer! I split my time between Canada, Costa Rica, and Mexico.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Jesse</p><p><a href="https://scallywag.software/" rel="nofollow">https://scallywag.software</a></p><p><a href="https://scallywag.software/resume.html" rel="nofollow">https://scallywag.software/resume.html</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/scallyw4g">https://github.com/scallyw4g</a></p><p>jesse@scallywag.software</p></div></td></tr>

As a one-man army, I have a proven track record of taking projects from concept to launch across desktop, mobile, and web.</p><p>Here’s a summary of what I’ve been working on over the past 5 years:
www.linkedin.com/posts/manofspirit_opentowork-activity-7237722209241214977-U3ZG</p><p>As a versatile designer and developer, I’ve created UI-based 2D games and applications with multiplayer features, ranging from XR-based Metaverse app WeDream to the NASBA-accredited educational app Earmark CPE, to Scrabble-inspired UGC-based Word Game, and even Ludo and Bonza-inspired puzzle games across various platforms.</p><p>Starting with GameSparks (RIP) in 2014, I’ve since worked with BrainCloud, PlayFab with Azure Scripting, Epic Online Services, and most recently started exploring Xsolla Backend (AcceleratXR). I’ve built fully integrated BAAS games and apps that often include async multiplayer, user-generated content (UGC), social integration (friends, messaging, etc.), tournaments, achievements, leaderboards, and monetization strategies (in-app purchases, subscriptions, virtual currencies, sales, ad mediation, etc.). Additionally, I’ve developed Unity-based admin tools for seamless management of users, content, and reporting.</p><p>On the UI/UX side, I started with Adobe Photoshop 8 and CorelDraw 9 almost 20 years ago; today I design beautiful applications and 2D games while utilizing my development skills to automate design tools for bulk art generation, variations, and solving repetitive tasks. I also leverage AI tools like MidJourney to push beyond creative limits.</p><p>Even though my focus is on the design and development of backend-driven Unity-based apps/games, my diverse skill set and ability to wear multiple hats allow me to seamlessly contribute to every stage of a project—from initial concept and UX design to backend integration, multiplayer systems, and final launch. This versatility enables me to adapt to different roles and challenges, delivering comprehensive solutions that align with the project’s goals.</p><p>If you have any openings that align with these diverse skills, I’d love to connect and explore how I can contribute.</p></div></td></tr>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      <h2 id="first-a-small-detour">
  First a small detour
  
</h2>
<p>I program in Objective-C and Swift daily, because those are the languages that Apple requires developers to use to build software for their platform. It’s not a strict requirement to use any of these two languages if you go cross-platform, but for good integration you would eventually have to write platform code in them.</p>
<p>After using Swift for more than 5 years I can confidently say that it’s getting worse with each addition, very similar to how C++ ended up being the monster it is. In comparison, Objective-C is simpler, somewhat minimalistic, and yet it did a great job for many Mac developers for a long time. I’ve heard that Swift code leads to less crashes and better performance, but that’s not what I’ve experienced. Well written Objective-C code can be easy to understand as much as well written Swift code. But overly complex Swift code is much more difficult to maintain and understand than similar Objective-C code.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-common-lisp-have-to-do-with-any-of-this">
  What does Common Lisp have to do with any of this?
  
</h2>
<p>I started developing in <a href="https://lisp-lang.org/">Common Lisp</a> around 12 years ago and was always fascinated by it. The developer experience, for such an old language with old tools (Emacs + Slime for example), compared to Visual Studio Code and a modern language is still unmatched. You really have to get into it for a few months of writing code, debugging and inspecting to understand the full power of the environment. It feels like you are <a href="https://jackrusher.com/strange-loop-2022/">evolving a living organism</a>, adding ADN to it, watching it take shape while it’s going around doing stuff, inspecting its internals. It is a fun, fulfilling and liberating experience.</p>
<p>Often developers say how you can make a mess of a Common Lisp codebase because of such freedom it provides. But isn’t that the same with any language? The world is full of horrible, inscrutable messes made in C++, Java, Swift and Rust. Any language in the hands of the wrong developer will provide enough (or not enough) power to create such messes. What Common Lisp gives you is great abstraction tools to build software in the simplest way, without having to create odd contortions to fit a type system and satisfy the compiler.</p>
<p>I can probably hear the rustacean over there saying how a properly constructed Rust program, once it compiles will work without bugs, to which I’ll laugh loudly thinking of all the bugs that I had to fix in statically typed languages that were not caught by the compiler. The reality is that you need unit tests anyway, for any program written in any language.</p>
<p>But the easy with which you can inspect a running Common Lisp program to see what’s wrong with it, by calling functions on the REPL, makes for a faster interaction than compiling in an IDE, running the program and setting a breakpoint where the stuff you intend to debug is being called. It cannot be overestimated how much this helps in building stuff faster.</p>
<h2 id="does-any-of-this-really-matter">
  Does any of this really matter?
  
</h2>
<p>Any day to day programming job can be difficult, challenging and also boring. Common Lisp, at least, takes the boring out of it. I really don’t understand how Go developers can build software without feeling soulless with such a dumb language. There are practicalities built into the language for sure, but overall it feels very bland. One consequence of it being such an easy and simple language is that it gathered a strong community and lots of libraries. It was designed so you can toss N amount of developers + Go and software comes at the other end.</p>
<p>But for the love of God (the one you prefer), it makes programming such a repetitive task. How long before Copilot is able to write all the code any Go developer now writes by hand?</p>
<p>Perhaps this rant is because I see programming as a creative activity, such as writing a novel, more than as an engineering discipline. That doesn’t mean that I don’t write unit tests, documentation or use CI.</p>
<p>So every single day, after work, I reach out to Common Lisp for writing my personal project (next business). It feels like I have superpowers, as if I’m understood by some very old wise man that’s there for me when I shape my program. It also helps that the language specification is set in stone and won’t change at the whim <a href="https://www.swift.org/swift-evolution/">of the community</a>. Just take a look, as an example, at that list. Never ending changes that will make your code constantly obsolete. The same is happening with C++, except modern C++ changes are probably welcome by most codebases. But still, there’s a ton of crap added to every version of the standard library. More gotchas to be aware of, more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior">UBs</a>.</p>
<p>Life is limited to keep thinking about ever changing stuff. Language designers making the same mistakes other designers made in the past, and the community always pressuring for more bells and whistles <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0">(If you are into PL design, watch this video)</a>, more syntatic sugar, exerting its power over original designers of the languages. So turning to Common Lisp is always a breath of fresh air, and that’s why my next project is being built with it.</p>

            <guid>41708837</guid>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://wakatime.com/blog/67-bots-so-many-bots">https://wakatime.com/blog/67-bots-so-many-bots</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41708837">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
    <p>ProductHunt has over 1 million user signups.
More than 60% of those are bots.</p>

<h2>How it started</h2>

<p>I’ve used <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.producthunt.com/">ProductHunt</a> since early 2014.
Besides <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, it was a good way to see the latest product launches in tech.
Using the comments on products, I could discover similar tools or collect feedback on my own products.
Lately though, I’ve noticed most of the comments seem to be generated by ChatGPT.</p>

<h2>A simple test</h2>

<p>To test my theory, I launched my own product on ProductHunt but with a simple LLM prompt injection in the product’s description.
Sure enough, almost all the comments were automated.</p>

<p><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/ph/comments.png" alt="Comments screenshot" title="Comments screenshot"></p>

<p>Can you spot the bots?</p>

<p>Now we see that it’s a waste of time for people launching on ProductHunt to reply to comments.
Is launching on ProductHunt even worth it?
If so many bots are commenting, they must be upvoting too right?
Based on all the emails I receive offering votes for money, some people must be purchasing upvotes.</p>

<h2>The data</h2>

<p>To analyze upvotes, I found a dump of all ProductHunt users, launches, upvotes, and comments.
ProductHunt has over 1 million user sign ups, over 300 thousand launches, 2.5 million comments, and 20 million upvotes.
Each launch also came with the daily rank, which is the rank of the launch after 24 hours from midnight PDT when each new launch day starts.</p>

<h2>Detecting bot accounts</h2>

<p>Detecting bots is difficult, especially with only public data.
At first, I tried analyzing the times of day of user comments to find trends.
For example, here’s one user who signed up 677 days ago, commented 2,009 times and upvoted 4,649 launches.
Definitely a power user and using some automation, but probably not a bot (and wasn’t categorized as one).</p>

<p><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/ph/user-comment-hours-hist-real.png" alt="Comments by hour histogram real" title="Comments by hour histogram real"></p>

<p>Now look at a bot user’s comments.
This user signed up 140 days ago, commented 173 times and upvoted 246 launches.</p>

<p><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/ph/user-comment-hours-hist-bot.png" alt="Comments by hour histogram bot" title="Comments by hour histogram bot"></p>

<p>Notice how the bot comments at regular intervals and the chart looks boxy instead of smooth?</p>

<p>However, this wasn’t enough to detect bot accounts alone.
I assigned each user a risk score based on many different criteria, like account activity duration, upvote patterns over time, and content of comments.
Did you know ChatGPT generated comments have a higher frequency of words like <code>game-changer</code>?
Bot comments also contained characters not easily typeable, like <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash#Em_dash">em-dash</a>.
They also commonly included the name and bio word for word from a real person’s LinkedIn profile, but those people said they never created any ProductHunt account.
In the end, I detected over 60% of user signups to be automated bot accounts.
That’s a conservative number, because I didn’t detect all the bots.
It would be a lot easier for ProductHunt themselves to detect bot activity more accurately using insider data.</p>

<h2>Bot activity over time</h2>

<h3>User signups</h3>

<p>Since 2018, there have been more bot users created than real users.</p>

<p><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/ph/Bot%20vs%20Real%20Signups%20(Line%20Chart).png" alt="Bot User Signups" title="Bot User Signups"></p>

<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>In late 2022, bot comments really took off... around the same time ChatGPT was first widely available.
The spike in 2024 is because over time bot accounts are deleted, I’m not sure if by ProductHunt or by the account owner.
Newer accounts are more likely to not have been deleted, so we still have access to their comments.</p>

<p><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/ph/Bot%20vs%20Real%20Comments%20(Line%20Chart).png" alt="Bot Comments" title="Bot Comments"></p>

<h3>Upvotes</h3>

<p>Also in 2022, bot upvotes surpassed real votes.</p>

<p><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/ph/Bot%20vs%20Real%20Votes%20(Line%20Chart).png" alt="Bot Votes" title="Bot Votes"></p>

<p>These bots form voting rings where makers pay for upvotes to increase their chances of getting into the ProductHunt newsletter.</p>

<h3>Rankings</h3>

<p>Most launches get only a few real upvotes.
Since bots vote randomly to blend in, the bot trend line is smoother than the real user upvotes.</p>

<p><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/ph/Posts%20By%20Votes%20(Line%20Chart).png" alt="Count of launches grouped by number of votes" title="Count of launches grouped by number of votes"></p>

<h2>Daily rank</h2>

<p>First place launches get featured in the daily and weekly ProductHunt newsletter, so let’s see how many bot upvotes the top launches receive.</p>

<p><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/ph/Posts%20in%20First%20Place%20by%20Bot%20Votes.png" alt="Launches in first place by number of bot votes" title="Launches in first place by number of bot votes"></p>

<p>Looks like 15% bot votes is a safe amount to get your product in first place for the day.
Anything over 60% bot votes doesn’t seem to make it to first place for some reason.
Here’s the same chart limited to launches after 2020, showing bots are accounting for more of the upvotes in top posts lately.</p>

<p><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/ph/Posts%20in%20First%20Place%20by%20Bot%20Votes%20since%202020.png" alt="Launches in first place by number of bot votes since 2020" title="Launches in first place by number of bot votes since 2020"></p>

<p>Launches paying for upvotes probably aren’t high quality products, so they often rank top 5 instead of first place:</p>

<p><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/ph/Posts%20in%20Top%205%20by%20Bot%20Votes%20since%202020.png" alt="Launches in top 5 by number of bot votes since 2020" title="Launches in top 5 by number of bot votes since 2020"></p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I wanted to create a list of launches without the bot votes, to see if the top launch of the day changes with the bot votes are removed.
However, I don’t want to call out launches that didn’t really pay for votes but just happen to have many upvotes from bots, and I don’t want more publicity for the launches that did pay.
Either way, I’ve spent too much time on this already so that will have to wait for a possible future blog post.</p>

        <p>The Dutch government has sent 288 artifacts stolen from Indonesia during the archipelago’s colonial era, among them weapons, coins, jewelry and textiles, back to their home country.</p>

<p>“These objects should never have been here,” says <a href="https://www.government.nl/government/members-of-cabinet/eppo-bruins">Eppo Bruins</a>, the Dutch minister of education, culture and science, per <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2024/09/nl-returns-indonesian-art-which-should-never-have-been-here/"><em>Dutch News</em></a>. “There was looting and pillaging going on in the colonial period and other types of involuntary loss of cultural objects. It is a matter of material justice to return them.”</p>

<p>The September 20 ceremony at the <a href="https://amsterdam.wereldmuseum.nl/en?_gl=1%2A1iotms3%2A_gcl_au%2AMTcwODAyODEzNy4xNzI3NDQ3Mjgy%2A_ga%2AMTkzNjEzNzE1Mi4xNzI3NDQ3Mjgy%2A_ga_96W70H259F%2AMTcyNzQ0NzI4MS4xLjAuMTcyNzQ0NzI4Mi4wLjAuMA..%2A_ga_TPGM95SP38%2AMTcyNzQ0NzI4Mi4xLjEuMTcyNzQ0NzI4Mi42MC4wLjA.">World Museum</a> in Amsterdam marked the second time that the Netherlands has returned stolen artifacts to its former colonies since 2020, when the independent <a href="https://committee.kolonialecollecties.nl/">Colonial Collections Committee</a> issued a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/09/arts/design/dutch-restitution-report.html">report</a> advising the country to do so. The <a href="https://www.government.nl/latest/news/2023/07/06/colonial-collections-to-be-returned-to-indonesia-and-sri-lanka">first repatriation</a> took place in July 2023, when the Dutch government returned 478 objects to Indonesia and Sri Lanka.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.government.nl/latest/news/2024/09/20/for-second-time-cultural-artefacts-to-be-returned-to-indonesia">statement</a>, the trove of newly returned artifacts includes four Hindu-Buddhist sculptures. One of the works, a likeness of the god <a href="https://committee.kolonialecollecties.nl/binaries/commissioncolonialcollections/documenten/advisory-reports/2024/08/28/indonesia/Recommendation+Ganesha.pdf">Ganesha</a>, was shipped to the Netherlands from East Java in 1843 on the orders of a colonial administrator. The <a href="https://committee.kolonialecollecties.nl/binaries/commissioncolonialcollections/documenten/advisory-reports/2024/08/28/indonesia/Recommendation+Brahma.pdf">other three</a>, depicting the gods Bhairava, Nandi and Brahma, were taken from Singasari, a late 13th-century temple complex in East Java, in the mid-19th century.</p>

<p>But the bulk of the repatriated items came to the Netherlands in the aftermath of a 1906 <a href="https://amsterdam.wereldmuseum.nl/en/whats-on/exhibitions/bali-behind-scenes/tourism-and-colonialism">war in southern Bali</a>, in which the Dutch military attacked the kingdoms of Badung and Tabanan.</p>

<p>“Around 1,000 Balinese were killed, while the Dutch lost four men,” writes the <a href="https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2024/09/20/netherlands-to-return-288-items-looted-in-colonial-era-to-indonesia"><em>Art Newspaper</em></a>’s<em> </em>Catherine Hickley. “A week later, in the kingdom of Tabanan, the Dutch army attacked the palace and arrested the king, who together with the crown prince, [died by] suicide that night.”</p>

<p>An <a href="https://committee.kolonialecollecties.nl/binaries/commissioncolonialcollections/documenten/advisory-reports/2024/08/28/indonesia/Recommendation+Puputan+Badung.pdf">advisory report</a> issued by the Colonial Collections Committee divides the objects into several categories: “official loot” like the belongings of deposed Balinese kings, confiscated coins and weapons, and artifacts from the personal holdings of a <a href="https://wojnieuwenkamp.nl/en/the-artist/">Dutch artist</a> who purchased or otherwise acquired items linked to the 1906 conflict. The Indonesian government officially requested the return of these culturally significant objects, collectively known as the Puputan Badung Collection, last September.</p>

<p>Per the statement, the committee is currently preparing recommendations for additional repatriation requests from Nigeria, Sri Lanka, India and Indonesia. While some critics of repatriation have raised concerns over how poorer countries will care for their returned artifacts, <a href="https://leiden.wereldmuseum.nl/en/about-volkenkunde/press/marieke-van-bommel-new-managing-director">Marieke van Bommel</a>, director general of the National Museum of World Cultures, tells the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/world/europe/netherlands-indonesia-artifacts.html"><em>New York Times</em></a>’ Lynsey Chutel that “the thief cannot tell the rightful owners what to do with their property.”</p>

  <time datetime="2024-10-01">October 1, 2024</time>
	
<p>GitHub Issues has been how the world’s best software teams collaborate since it first launched in <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/the-library/github-issue-tracker/">2009</a>. Today we are excited to unveil a major evolution of issues and projects, featuring a range of highly requested enhancements including sub-issues, issue types and advanced search for issues. Together, these additions make it easier than ever to break down work, visualize progress, categorize and find just the right issue in GitHub.</p>
<p>These new features are now available in public preview for you to try. To gain access for your organization, please sign up <a href="https://github.com/features/issues/signup">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="break-down-and-nest-issues-with-sub-issues">🔗 Break down and nest issues with sub-issues<a href="#break-down-and-nest-issues-with-sub-issues" aria-label="🔗 Break down and nest issues with sub-issues"></a></h2>
<p>Sub-issues allow you to break down and organize issues within a parent-child hierarchy. You can create sub-issues from any issue and use their nested structure to track progress and understand remaining work. You can also easily track sub-issues progress within your projects.</p>

<p>All these new features are based upon an update to the issues front end, designed to be fast and familiar. This means there are no new UI patterns to slow you down, but we did include a few tweaks to speed you up, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The issues index page has a new filter bar with autocomplete and syntax highlighting.</li>
<li>Creating multiple issues is faster with a ‘create more’ option to quickly get back to the creation screen.</li>
<li>Issue form and templates are now presented in alphabetical order based on file name, making it easier for you to set just the right order.</li>
<li>Easily share the URL to an issue with a new ‘copy link’ button.</li>
<li>On long issues, selecting ‘load more’ will now fetch 150 events instead of 50.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>Software developers who publish their products on third-party stores face all kinds of problems sometimes. From rejected apps or extensions to removed products or unjustified claims about them.</p>
<p>Raymond "gorhill" Hill, maker of the world's most popular content blocker uBlock Origin received two emails from Mozilla recently about his Firefox add-on <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2022/09/09/ublock-origin-minus-an-experimental-manifest-v3-compatible-extension/" data-wpel-link="internal">uBlock Origin Lite</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Good to know:</strong> uBlock Origin Lite is a Manifest V3-compatible version of the content blocker. It is less powerful, but since Google is disabling Manifest V2 support in Chrome, it is what will remain from uBlock Origin for Chromium-based browsers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ublock-origin-lite-firefox.png" alt="uBlock Origin Lite Firefox" width="1587" height="1203" srcset="https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ublock-origin-lite-firefox.png 1587w, https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ublock-origin-lite-firefox-768x582.png 768w, https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ublock-origin-lite-firefox-1536x1164.png 1536w, https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ublock-origin-lite-firefox-1200x910.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1587px) 100vw, 1587px"></p>
<p>Mozilla <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home/issues/197" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">says</a> that it has reviewed the extension and found violations. The following claims were made:</p>
<ul>
<li>The extension is not asking for consent for data collecting.</li>
<li>The extension contains "minified, concatenated or otherwise machine-generated code".</li>
<li>There is no privacy policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a consequence, Mozilla disabled the extension on the Firefox Add-ons Store.</p>
<p>Hill refuted all three claims that Mozilla made on the GitHub repository stating that the extension is not collecting any data, that there is no minified code in uBlock Origin Lite, and that there is a privacy policy.</p>
<p>He admitted further that he does not "have the time or motivation to spend time on this nonsense" and won't react to the allegations made or appeal the decision.</p>
<p>In a follow-up, Hill criticized the "nonsensical and hostile review process" that put added burden on developers. Mozilla disabled all versions of the extension except for the very first one. It still flagged the extension for the very same reasons, but nevertheless decided to keep the outdated version up.</p>
<p><strong>Does it affect uBlock Origin?</strong> The core extension remains available for Firefox. Unlike Google Chrome, Firefox will continue to support Manifest V2 extensions. Mozilla has not flagged this extensions or disabled it.</p>
<p>Hill is now self-hosting the extension uBlock Origin Lite for Firefox on the GitHub repository. Interested users find it <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home/releases" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">on the releases page</a> as a direct download.</p>
<h2>Mozilla realizes its blunder, but it seems too late</h2>
<p>Mozilla contacted Hill a few days later, likely after the thing blew up everywhere, stating that the "previous decision was incorrect" and that the extension has been restored.</p>
<p>The organization issued an apology for the "mistake"&nbsp; and recommended to Hill to reach out whenever he has questions or concerns about a review.</p>
<p>Hill decided to go ahead with the plan to self-host the extension. He removed the extension from Mozilla's Add-ons repository as a consequence.</p>
<p>When you search for uBlock Origin Lite, you won't get the extension returned anymore.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if the two parties will come closer together again or if this breakup will be permanent.</p>
<h3>Closing Words</h3>
<p>Most mistakes in review processes are made by machines. Google, for example, uses automated reviews for the most part, but may also manually review extensions.</p>
<p>The process does not keep all malicious extensions out, of which <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2023/06/05/75-million-chrome-users-have-installed-these-malicious-extensions/" data-wpel-link="internal">plenty</a> <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2021/05/18/dont-download-this-microsoft-authenticator-extension-for-chrome-it-is-fake/" data-wpel-link="internal">are</a> <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2023/12/23/google-removes-3-fake-vpn-extensions-with-1-5-million-users-from-chrome-web-store/" data-wpel-link="internal">regularly</a> discovered,&nbsp; but it may also <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2021/03/25/the-curious-case-of-clearurls-removal-from-the-google-chrome-webstore/" data-wpel-link="internal">block legitimate extensions</a> or updates.</p>
<p>In the case of uBlock Origin Lite, it is unclear how the reviewer came to the conclusion that the extension was in violation of policies. Especially the claim that the extension had no privacy policy, when it clearly had one, sheds no good light on the reviewer and process.</p>
<p>Mozilla might want to look at the review process to find out what went wrong exactly to avoid another disaster like it in the future.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">A Y Combinator startup named PearAI launched <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/CodeFryingPan/status/1840203597478539477">with an X post thread </a>and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18cHBU05zK0">YouTube video</a> on Saturday and created immediate controversy. And some of that is splashing onto YC itself.</p>

<p>PearAI offers an AI coding editor. The startup’s founder Duke Pan has openly said that it’s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/trypear/pearai-app">a cloned copy</a> of another AI editor called Continue, which was covered under the Apache open source license. But PearAI made a major misstep: PearAI originally slapped its own made-up closed license on it, called the Pear Enterprise License, which Pan admitted was written by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/ns123abc/status/1840481220188111076/photo/1">ChatGPT.</a></p>

	
	


<p>Changing a license like this is a big deal in the open source world. Not only are there legalities involved in violating a software license, but it defeats the whole purpose of open source, which is about community building, sharing, and contributing. In an apology PearAI’s Pan posted <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/CodeFryingPan/status/1840831339337302204">on Monday</a>, he said that the project has now been released under the same Apache open source license as the original project.</p>

<p>The launch thread went viral with thousands of comments by Sunday. Some were congratulatory, but others were vicious in pointing out the licensing and the fact that PearAI wasn’t so much a fork with new stuff added, but a replica with a new name. Pan admitted as much in his apology.</p>

<p>So many angry comments were made on Pan’s launch thread that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/dejavucoder/status/1840445397002543442?t=Tn--wZgbxhMe-db1Dmcxvg&amp;s=19"> X put a community note</a> on it that read: “Pear is a fork of Continue.dev, an open-source AI code editor. PearAI used Continue.dev’s code and mass-replaced all references to ‘Continue’ to ‘PearAI’ to mislead people into believing that they built this product on their own.”</p>

<p>This note wasn’t accurate, either. PearAI did say in some of its materials that the project was a clone (also known as a fork) of Continue as well as the original project that Continued used, VSCode. X subsequently removed that note.</p>

<p>Pan apologized for how hard it was to find that information, too. He said that one way he and his cofounder, Nang Ang, “screwed up, critically, was not being clear enough about this … doing so upon a fork of others’ work without many new features, and talking about it so publicly online, made it look like we were stealing the work of others as our own.”</p>


	
	


<p>On Sunday, Continue jumped in with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/continuedev/status/1840601490827989368">by posting</a> a subtle threat that it was “ecstatic to see the ecosystem that has formed around us. But open source can’t be taken for granted—it is a movement built on trust, and on respect for contributions, licenses, and intellectual property.”</p>

	
	


<p>Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan got involved, too. He defended PearAI with several <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/garrytan/status/1840490867280498873">tweets</a>. “Don’t understand why people are dragging a new project when literally it’s open source Apache license and that’s *the reason* why open source is awesome” one read. As you might imagine, people pointed out that it was changed to an Apache license after the uproar.</p>

<p>There were other reasons this project caught ire. Pan boasted how he “just quit my 270 000$ job at Coinbase” to do this startup, even though this was about as far from an original idea as a startup can get. In addition to Continue, another big competitor is Cursor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On top of that, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies?query=AI%20code%20editor">YC has funded two other AI code editors already, Void and Melty</a>, as the mob was quick to point out. To which Tan <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/garrytan/status/1840490996528029942">replied on X</a>, “More choice is good, people building is good, if you don’t like it don’t use it.”</p>

<p>Others criticized YC for selecting PearAI into its cohort at all. Blogger Sven Schnieders <a rel="nofollow" href="https://unfashionable.blog/p/yc/">wrote</a> that PearAI is an example of the “the decline of YC” because it accepted a company that is “nothing more than a codebase copied from another YC-backed company.”</p>

<p>On <a rel="nofollow" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41701265">Hacker News,</a> the site for programmers owned by YC, a commenter wrote that the debacle “says more about YC than this particular founder (lots of these types nowadays): i.e. their process, their due diligence.” Another wrote, “Is it typical for VC to just throw money at projects without any sort of oversight/auditing of, oh jeez, IDK, Licensing/Legal issues?”</p>

	
	


<p>YC’s plans to double from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/13/y-combinator-expanding-to-four-cohorts-a-year-in-2025/#:~:text=Silicon%20Valley%20startup%20accelerator%20Y,Thursday%2C%20and%20TechCrunch%20confirmed%20today.">two cohorts a year to four</a> isn’t likely to ease this perception, or this risk. </p>

<p>The whole uproar probably says as much about how eager all VCs are to fund AI startups as it does about YC’s love of this particular ilk of them.</p>

<p>If you use Firefox and the uBlock Origin Lite content blocker from the Firefox Add-ons Store, be aware that the extension is no longer supported. Raymond Hill, the maker of the extension, pulled support and moved uBlock Origin Lite to self-hosting after multiple encounters with a "nonsensical and hostile" review process from the store review team.</p>

<p>It all started in early September when Mozilla flagged every version of the uBlock Origin Lite extension as violating its policies. Reviewers then claimed the extension apparently collected user data and contained "minified, concatenated or otherwise machine-generated code." The developer seemingly debunked those allegations, saying that "it takes only a few seconds for anyone who has even basic understanding of JavaScript to see the raised issues make no sense."</p>

<p>Raymond Hill <span>decided to drop the extension from the store and move it to a self-hosted version. This means that </span><span>those who want to continue using uBlock Origin Lite on Firefox should download the latest version <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home">from GitHub</a> (it can auto-update itself).</span></p>

                            <!-- PLACE THIS SECTION INSIDE OF YOUR BODY WHERE YOU WANT THE VIDEO PLAYER TO RENDER -->
            <p>The last message from the developer in a <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home/issues/197#issuecomment-2377395301">now-closed GitHub issue</a> shows an email from Mozilla admitting its fault and apologizing for the mistake. However, Raymond still pulled the extension from the Mozilla Add-ons Store, which means you can no longer find it on <a href="http://addons.mozilla.org/">addons.mozilla.org</a>.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that the original uBlock Origin for Firefox is still available and supported. The Lite version is a Manifest V3-based extension with a lighter and more efficient load on resources, such as processor and memory. Hill recently <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/ublock-origin-developer-recommends-switching-to-ublock-lite-as-chrome-flags-the-extension/">recommended switching to uBlockOrigin Lite</a> after Chrome started flagging the extension as unsupported (<a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/official-windows-registry-hack-extends-ublock-origin-support-on-google-chrome-edge/">there is a way to circumvent that</a>). Contrary to Chrome, Mozilla does not plan to drop the Manifest V2-based extensions in the near future, so uBlock Origin will continue to exist and work on Firefox and other browsers with MV2 support.</p>
