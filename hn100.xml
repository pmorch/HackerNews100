            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/claude-code-via-acp">https://zed.dev/blog/claude-code-via-acp</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45116688">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>You asked for it. A lot.</p>

<p>So we built it: our Claude Code integration is now available in public beta, running natively in Zed through our new <a href="https://agentclientprotocol.com/">Agent Client Protocol (ACP)</a>.</p>
<p>For months, developers have been asking us to bring Claude Code into Zed. We didn’t just want to bolt on a one-off integration; we wanted to build something better. ACP is our new open standard that lets any agent connect to Zed (and other editors, too). Claude Code is a perfect example of what’s possible.</p>
<p>Now you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Run Claude Code as a first-class citizen</strong> in Zed's high-performance editor, not just a terminal interface</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://zed.dev/docs/ai/agent-panel#following-the-agent">Follow along</a> in real-time</strong> as it edits across multiple files, with full syntax highlighting and language server support</li>
<li><strong>Review and approve granular changes</strong> in a <a href="https://zed.dev/docs/multibuffers">multibuffer</a> - accept or reject individual code hunks</li>
<li><strong>Keep Claude Code's task list anchored</strong> in your sidebar, so you always see what the agent is working on</li>
<li><strong>Define custom workflows</strong> with <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands#custom-slash-commands">Claude Code's custom slash commands</a> for your most common development tasks</li>
</ul>

<p><figure><video src="https://customer-snccc0j9v3kfzkif.cloudflarestream.com/8ce40c0885f8f0ac5c740be1d268592f/downloads/default.mp4" width="3840" height="2160" poster="https://zed.dev/img/post/claude-code-zed/video-poster.webp" controls=""></video><figcaption>A walkthrough of Claude Code in Zed.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Claude Code has gained broad popularity among developers thanks to its powerful code generation and finely tuned tools. While the command-line interface is powerful, when Claude Code is making changes across multiple files or refactoring complex logic, you may want to see the bigger picture and have more control on what code you accept or reject. With Zed, you get the best of both worlds: Claude Code's intelligence, freed from the terminal and deeply integrated into a highly performant editor.</p>
<p>You can now run Claude Code directly in Zed and use it side-by-side with Zed's first-party agent, Gemini CLI, and any other ACP-compatible agent. Make sure you’re on <a href="https://zed.dev/releases/stable">the latest version of Zed</a> and find your available agents in the Plus menu in the Agent Panel.</p>
<h2 id="built-with-acp"><a href="#built-with-acp" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Built with ACP</span></a></h2>
<p>Rather than creating a tightly-coupled integration specific to Claude Code, we built this integration using the <a href="https://agentclientprotocol.com/">Agent Client Protocol</a>. We <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/bring-your-own-agent-to-zed">launched ACP</a> as our open standard for connecting any AI agent with any compatible editor.</p>
<p>We built an adapter that wraps Claude Code's SDK and translates its interactions into ACP's JSON RPC format. This adapter bridges between Claude Code and ACP's standardized interface, allowing Claude Code to run as an independent process while Zed provides the user interface.</p>
<p>We are open sourcing the Claude Code adapter under the Apache license, making it freely available for any editor that’s adopted ACP to use; you can find <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/claude-code-acp">the source code here</a>. Since the popular <a href="https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim">CodeCompanion plugin</a> for Neovim has already adopted ACP, Claude Code will <em>also</em> be available in Neovim.</p>
<p>We want to thank <a href="https://github.com/Xuanwo">GitHub user Xuanwo</a> for all his work since the ACP launch in building an ACP implementation for Claude Code - your speed to solution inspired us to work hard to keep up! We appreciate you for your contribution to the protocol's adoption. Give him a follow on <a href="https://github.com/Xuanwo">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://x.com/OnlyXuanwo">Twitter/X</a>.</p>

<p>We want every agent usable in Zed. Gemini CLI and Claude Code are a great start, and we have more on the way, but there are new agents released every week and many great existing ones not yet speaking the protocol. ACP makes it simple to bring any agent into Zed's, Neovim's, or any other ACP-adapted editor's interface!</p>
<p>This beta delivers as much core Claude Code functionality as possible via the SDK. We're adding features like Plan mode in the coming days, and more advanced capabilities as Anthropic expands SDK support; for example, many built-in slash commands are not yet supported by the SDK. From here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Building an agent?</strong> We want to help you integrate with Zed - <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed">reach out</a> with questions.</li>
<li><strong>Want more Claude Code features?</strong> Join us in asking Anthropic to bring the SDK to parity with Claude Code or <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/6686">adopt ACP directly</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Ready to contribute?</strong> Contribute <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/agent-client-protocol">to or discuss ACP</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/claude-code-acp">the Claude Code adapter</a> repos.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're always looking for <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/agent-client-protocol">feedback on ACP</a>, and welcome contributions from other agent (and client) builders. The more agents that work in Zed, the more choice you have as a developer.</p><hr><div><h3 id="looking-for-a-better-editor">Looking for a better editor?</h3>

I managed to break the washing machine door's closing mechanism some time in 2006, so for a few weeks, whenever we did the washing, we had to lean a chair against the door so it wouldn't open. At the time, we were both students and living on a small budget.</p><p>Eventually, later in the same year, we bought an Electrolux machine that has accompanied us ever since. First on our move to Hamburg, then there through three apartments, and finally back to Spain, where we live now in the Catalonian countryside. Anyway, the washing machine had a motor damage last week, so after almost 20 years, it was time for a new one. I ordered it online (another Electrolux, <em>without</em> Internet nor WiFi), it was delivered swiftly, and I installed it hopefully correctly.</p><p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://blog.tomayac.com/images/EbIHWbW6Cy-368.avif 368w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/EbIHWbW6Cy-700.avif 700w" sizes="auto"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://blog.tomayac.com/images/EbIHWbW6Cy-368.webp 368w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/EbIHWbW6Cy-700.webp 700w" sizes="auto"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.tomayac.com/images/EbIHWbW6Cy-368.png" alt="Our new Electrolux washing machine." width="700" height="700" srcset="https://blog.tomayac.com/images/EbIHWbW6Cy-368.png 368w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/EbIHWbW6Cy-700.png 700w" sizes="auto"></picture></p><p>The washing machine came with a voluntary 10 year warranty if you registered it. The brochure where this offer was announced featured a free telephone number and a QR code that pointed at the number (in plain text, not making use of the <code>tel:</code> protocol). I called the number, and to my <em>absolute surprise</em> there were currently more callers than usual. After about 20 minutes, I had an agent on the phone, but after saying what I wanted, they just hung up on me (or the connection cut, whatever). Fine, I called again, but now, the call center was over capacity and they didn't even let me enter in the wait loop.</p><p>They did offer to send me a link to a chat service on their website via SMS, though, so I went for that option. The SMS literally pointed me at something like <code>https://www.</code> broken up by a space and then <code>example.com/gc/</code>. When I clicked the linkified <code>example.com/gc/</code>, I ended up on a broken site whose certificate wasn't trusted. After fixing the link manually and prepending the <code>https://www.</code> part, the page didn't load.</p><p>At this point I was close to giving up, but I had one last card that I wanted to play: I searched Google for "electrolux warranty register", and it pointed me at a site <code>https://www.example.com/mypages/register-a-product/</code> as the first result. This looked promising. The <code>mypages</code> already suggested that this was gated behind a login, so I created an account, which was painless. (Turns out, after having an account and being logged in, the chat URL also worked—what an oversight on their part.) On the page, they had a field where you could enter the washing machine's product number from the identification plate on the door of the washing machine, together with helpful information where to find the data.</p><p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://blog.tomayac.com/images/Wzdh1DWJWS-368.avif 368w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/Wzdh1DWJWS-736.avif 736w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/Wzdh1DWJWS-1459.avif 1459w" sizes="auto"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.tomayac.com/images/Wzdh1DWJWS-368.webp" alt="Annotated Electrolux identification plate." width="1459" height="468" srcset="https://blog.tomayac.com/images/Wzdh1DWJWS-368.webp 368w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/Wzdh1DWJWS-736.webp 736w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/Wzdh1DWJWS-1459.webp 1459w" sizes="auto"></picture></p><p>But even better, they offered a service where you could just upload a picture of the identification plate, and some AI on their server then extracted the product number and let you register the product with two clicks. What a fantastic experience compared to the crappy (and likely for the operator way more expensive) call center experience.</p><p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://blog.tomayac.com/images/VBXS4UENEL-368.avif 368w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/VBXS4UENEL-736.avif 736w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/VBXS4UENEL-4080.avif 4080w" sizes="auto"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://blog.tomayac.com/images/VBXS4UENEL-368.webp 368w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/VBXS4UENEL-736.webp 736w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/VBXS4UENEL-4080.webp 4080w" sizes="auto"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.tomayac.com/images/VBXS4UENEL-368.jpeg" alt="Electrolux identification plate cell phone photo." width="4080" height="3072" srcset="https://blog.tomayac.com/images/VBXS4UENEL-368.jpeg 368w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/VBXS4UENEL-736.jpeg 736w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/VBXS4UENEL-4080.jpeg 4080w" sizes="auto"></picture></p><p>Why they didn't just put this URL on the brochure and the QR code is beyond me. As the title suggests: <strong>For all that's holy, can you just leverage the Web, please?</strong> Don't make me talk to people! They could still offer to register the machine by telephone as an alternative, but in 2025, the default for such things should just be the Web.</p><h2 id="bonus" tabindex="-1">Bonus </h2><p>Since I work on <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/built-in">built-in AI</a> as my day job in the Chrome team at Google, I could not <em>not</em> notice this <em>"extract the product number from this identification plate"</em> use case for client-side AI. I coded up a quick <a href="https://tomayac.github.io/blogccasion-demos/built-in-ai-product-number-ocr/">demo</a> using the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/prompt-api">Prompt API</a> embedded below that shows this in action. Here's a quick walkthrough of the code:</p><ol><li>Create a session with the <code>LanguageModel</code>, informing the user of download progress if the model needs to be downloaded, and telling the model about the to-be-expected inputs (English texts and images) and outputs (English texts). In the system prompt, I tell the model what its overall task is (identify product numbers from photos of identification plates).</li><li>Prompt the model using the <code>promptStreaming()</code> method with a multimodal prompt, one textual and one image. The Prompt API supports <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/structured-output-for-prompt-api?hl=en">structured output</a> in the form of a JSON Schema or regular expression. Product numbers have nine digits, so I pass the regular expression <code>/\d{9}/</code> as the <code>responseConstraint</code> option.</li><li>Iterate over the chunks of the response. Since I'm just expecting nine digits, this is probably a bit overkill, but, hey…</li><li>(Not shown) On the server, verify that the recognized product number actually exist. Companies typically have some sort of verification rules like checksums, or washing machine product numbers always start with <code>91</code> or something. If you know those rules, you can of course make them part of the <code>responseConstraint</code>, but you always need to verify untrusted user input (which the output of an LLM counts as) on the server.</li></ol><pre><code><span>const</span> session <span>=</span> <span>await</span> LanguageModel<span>.</span><span>create</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>

</p><h4>JOHN COLTRANE’S TONE CIRCLE</h4>







<p>My music is the spiritual expression of what I am: my faith, my knowledge, my being.<br>– John Coltrane</p>







<h5>FOREWORD</h5>



<p>I do like to mention that I am <strong>no</strong> “authority” or “expert” when it comes to Coltrane’s work, or the music theory behind it and the compositions themselves. And as sax player, well, I’m still miles away from even standing in the giant shadow he cast … not to mention his giant footsteps. Anyway, as admirer&nbsp;of Coltrane’s work I could not resist to&nbsp;write this article. I wrote this article because I am fascinated by his music and have an interest in the relationship between music and math / geometry.</p>



<p>For an expert opinion on Coltrane you should listen to what musicians who played with him or extensively studied his work have/had to say about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p><span>This blog article is an addition to the article “<a href="https://roelsworld.eu/en/blog-music/music-geometry/">Music and Geometry</a>” and contains only the information about the Coltrane Tone Circle and the relationship between some of his music and geometry. Do read the mentioned article for general information about the relationship between music and geometry.</span></p>



<p><span>Thelonious Monk once said&nbsp;“<strong>All musicians are subconsciously mathematicians</strong>“. Musicians like John Coltrane though have been very much aware of the mathematics of music and consciously applied it to their works. The “Coltrane Circle” is (to me) proof of it in Coltrane’s case …</span></p>

<div>
<p>A Tone Circle is&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<a title="Geometry" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">geometrical</a>&nbsp;representation of relationships among the <span>12</span>&nbsp;<a title="Pitch class" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_class" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pitch classes</a>&nbsp;(or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_interval" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pitch intervals</a>) of the chromatic scale in&nbsp;<a title="Pitch class space" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_class_space" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pitch class space</a>&nbsp;(circle). The most common tone circles in Western music are the “<strong>Chromatic Circle</strong>” and the&nbsp;“<strong>Circle of Fifths / Fourths</strong>“.</p>



<p>In Western music theory there are&nbsp;<span>13</span>&nbsp;intervals from Tonic (unison) to Octave. These intervals are the:&nbsp;<a title="Perfect unison" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_unison" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unison</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Minor second" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_second" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minor Second</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Major second" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_second" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Major Second</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Minor third" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_third" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minor Third</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Major third" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_third" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Major Third</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Perfect fourth" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_fourth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fourth</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Tritone" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tritone</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Perfect fifth" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_fifth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fifth</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Minor sixth" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_sixth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minor Sixth</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Major sixth" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_sixth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Major Sixth</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Minor seventh" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_seventh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minor Seventh</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Major seventh" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_seventh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Major Seventh</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Octave" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Octave</a>.&nbsp;When we look at these intervals (or pitch classes) and how they relate to one another in the musical tone circles, some nice geometric shapes appear.</p>



<p>Note: If you are interested in a more esoteric-philosophical perspective on the intervals, then read the article: “<strong><a href="https://roelsworld.eu/en/blog-music/the-function-of-the-intervals/">The Function of the Intervals</a></strong>” on Roel’s World.</p>

<h4>COLTRANE’S TONE CIRCLE</h4>



<p>An interesting variant to the ‘Circle of Fourths / Fifths’ is the ‘Coltrane Circle’, created by saxophonist <a href="http://www.johncoltrane.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Coltrane</a> (perhaps influenced and based on&nbsp;the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schillinger_System" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joseph Schillinger System of Musical Composition</a> and/or Nicolas Slominksy’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/thesaurus-of-scales-and-melodic-patterns/oclc/000947300" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thesaurus of scales and musical patterns</a>?) and was used by <a href="http://yuseflateef.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yusef Lateef</a> for his work “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Repository-Scales-Melodic-Patterns-Lateef/dp/B000O9TN46" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Repository of Scales and Melodic Patterns</a>” (1981).</p>



<p><a target="_blank" href="https://stephonalexander.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephon Alexander</a> wrote in his book “<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465093574/ref=as_li_tl?tag=roelsworld-20" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Jazz of Physics: The Secret Link Between Music and the Structure of the Universe</a>” that he tried calling Yusef Lateef and asked when he was told that Yusef Lateef was not  availabe: “<i><strong>Could I leave him a message about the diagram that John Coltrane gave him as a birthday gift in ’61?</strong></i>“</p>



<p> The year <strong>1961</strong> would “date” the Coltrane tone circle <b>one year after the release of the groundbreaking album “Giant Steps” (1960)</b>, but in the <b>same year as the release of the albums: “Coltrane Jazz”, “My Favorite Things”, “Olé Coltrane” and “Africa/Brass”</b> and <b>several years before unique albums like for example “A Love Supreme” (1965) and “Ascension” (1966)</b>.</p>



<p>According to <a href="http://gonze.com/rel-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lucas Gonze</a> Yusef Lateef mentioned: “<strong><i>Coltrane was always drawing things like this. This particular drawing was something Coltrane did between set breaks at a gig they did together. Coltrane gave it to Lateef at that gig.</i></strong>” This is an intriguing thought, if Coltrane was always drawing “things like that”, could that mean that there might be more versions of this tone circle (or other) somewhere in a box or folder in a museum, at the residence of one of his relatives or in the archive of musicians John Coltrane worked with as well?</p>



<p>Did John Coltrane drew it to work out a particular composition? Did he try to find a new approach for his solos in that period? I haven’t been able to find any clear sources that can provide a clear answer to those questions.</p>

<h5>CIRCLE VERSIONS</h5>



<p>There are two versions of the circle shared online. A “detailed” version and a “clean” version with only the circled tones. What is good to point out is that these are two are separately drawn circles, as you can see in the “overlay” in the middle below. I have aligned the letter “C” of both drawings. The blue-overlay is the “clean” version (first one displayed below):</p>







<p>When you look closer, you can see two more differences:</p>

<p>(img.1): In both versions the <strong>[A]</strong> (tone center) has been “squared”. In the “clean” version <strong>A♭</strong> is notated, in the “detailed” version <strong>G♯</strong> is notated. The “detailed” version also shows a mistake. Instead of circling both tones siding the [A] chromatically, the tones siding the G♯ chromatically have been circled.</p>
</div>



<div><div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="350" height="160" src="https://roelsworld.eu/wp-content/uploads/Coltrane-Tone-Circle-E.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://roelsworld.eu/wp-content/uploads/Coltrane-Tone-Circle-E.jpg 350w, https://roelsworld.eu/wp-content/uploads/Coltrane-Tone-Circle-E-300x137.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" data-mwl-img-id="8299"><figcaption>(img.2) On the left a cut from the “clean” version, on the right a cut from the “detailed version”.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>(img.2): In both versions the <strong>[E]</strong> has been “squared”. In the “clean” version <strong>E♭</strong> is notated, in the “detailed” version <strong>D♯</strong> is notated.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p><strong>You might wonder, which circle was drawn first?</strong><br>Well, most logically is to presume the more “detailed” version was draw first. Why? It contains a mistake in the circling of the neighboring tones of tone center <strong>[A]</strong> and it seems logical that this mistake would have been corrected in a next version, thus the “clean” version (without the mistake) would have come second, only displaying the most important aspect of the circle, the 12 “tone centers” and circled neighbor tones. But, I am guessing here.</p>



<p><strong>What about those numbers and lines?</strong><br>There has been some speculating going on about if the lines and numbers drawn in the Coltrane Circle “detailed” version were drawn by Coltrane himself or perhaps if they were added later by someone else?. We could compare the numbers drawn in the Coltrane Circle with those from copies of his scores. For this comparison I have used the score of Love Supreme and several scores displayed at&nbsp;<a href="https://recordmecca.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recordmecca.com</a></p>



<p>Below you see the numbers found in various scores side by side with the numbers of the Coltrane Circle image:</p>

<p>Now, I’m no expert in graphoanalysis<span>, so I will just describe what I noticed:</span><br>In all scores as well in the tone circle we see a certain inconsistency in the writing of the numbers. The “1” is sometimes written as a single line, sometimes with additional horizontal lines. The 7 is sometimes written with a horizontal line in the center, sometimes without. The “4” is open sometimes and closed at the top at other times. The “2” has a little “loop” in some cases but others not. It seems though that the writing in the scores was done quicker, more like scribbling then seems to be the case with the Coltrane Circle. This is not a surprise though, specially with last minutes arrangements scores often look like scribbles. </p>

<div><p>One thought shared among musicians online is that the writing of the numbers (and lines) in the “detailed” version of the tone circle could perhaps have been drawn by someone else. Yusef Lateef seems to be the #1 “suspect”, after all, he shared the drawing in his book “<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1562242946/ref=as_li_tl?tag=roelsworld-20" rel="noopener noreferrer">Repository of Scales and Melodic Patterns</a>“. I have not been able though to find any handwritten music sheets by Yusef Lateef to compare his handwriting. 
</p><p>
In my search for answers I send a message to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/yuseflateef.music/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yusef Lateef Facebook page</a>, hoping someone could shed some light on it. I am grateful I got a reply, <strong>Ayesha Lateef</strong> wrote:</p></div>



<p>“<i><strong>Brother John gifted the “circle” to Yusef Lateef while the content of both repositories is the result of Yusef’s own research.</strong></i>“</p>



<p>When I specifically asked if the numbers and lines in the circle might have been drawn by Yusef Lateef, she replied:</p>



<p>“<i><strong>From what I understand the whole thing is from Brother John.</strong></i>“</p>



<p>More about the numbers and their possible meaning/function later on in this article.</p>

<p>Below on the left you see a scanned copy of an original drawing of the “Coltrane Circle”.&nbsp;On the right an better readable (by Roel modified) image by&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.coreymwamba.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Corey Mwamba</a></strong>&nbsp;from his article “<strong><a href="http://www.coreymwamba.co.uk/rambles/1388150764" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coltrane’s Way Of Seeing</a></strong>“:<br></p>







<p>In the drawing (on the left) there are a couple of sharps notated, they have been replaced by Corey Mwamba with their&nbsp;<span>enharmonic equivalents&nbsp;(C♯ = D<strong><strong><strong><span>♭</span></strong></strong></strong> and F♯ = G<strong><strong><strong><span>♭</span></strong></strong></strong>) in his drawings.</span></p>



<p><span>The circles above might seem a bit odd, but if we “simplify” the circle things become a lot clearer.</span></p>

<div>
<p>What we see is a circle with two concentric&nbsp;rings.</p>



<p>The <strong>outer ring</strong> displays the “<span><strong>Hexatonic</strong></span>” (<span>6</span>-Tone) or <span><span><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_tone_scale?cms_action=manage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>“Whole Tone” Scale</span></a></strong></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong>of C</span>&nbsp;(<strong><span>C</span> – <span>D</span> – <span>E</span> – <span>G♭</span> – <span>A♭</span> – <span>B♭</span> – <span>C</span></strong>).</p>



<p>The <strong>inner ring</strong> displays the <span><strong>Hexatonic scale of B</strong></span>&nbsp;<br>(<strong><span>B</span> – <span>D♭</span> – <span>E♭</span> – <span>F</span> – <span>G</span> – <span>A</span> – <span>B</span></strong>).</p>



<p>When you “<span><strong>zig-zag</strong></span>” <strong>clockwise</strong> <strong>between the tones of these Hexatonic scales</strong>&nbsp;of the concentric rings (the 12 “Tone Centers”) it turns out to be the “<strong>Circle of Fourths</strong>” <span>(and thus&nbsp;</span><strong>counterclockwise</strong><span>&nbsp;the “</span><strong>Circle of Fifths</strong><span>“).</span>:&nbsp;</p>



<p><span><strong><span>C</span> – <strong><span>F</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<strong><span>B♭</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<strong><span>E♭</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<strong><span>A♭</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<strong><span>D♭</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<strong><span>G♭</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<strong><span>B</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<strong><span>E</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<strong><span>A&nbsp;</span>–&nbsp;<strong><span>D</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong><span>G</span> – <span>C</span></strong>&nbsp;</span></p>

<div>
<h5><span><strong>WHAT ABOUT ALL THOSE TONES IN BETWEEN?</strong></span></h5>



<p><span>The smaller spaces (<span>light grey</span>) between the larger (“main”) “Tone Center” spaces (<span>darker grey</span>) of the <strong>Hexatonic scale</strong> of <strong>C&nbsp;</strong></span>(outer ring):&nbsp;<strong>C–D–E–G♭–A♭–B♭–C</strong>) and <strong>B</strong> (inner ring): <strong>B–D♭–E♭–F–G-A-B</strong>&nbsp;contain <span>4</span> tones that – when combined with the “Tone Center” spaces (pitch classes) –&nbsp;form&nbsp;<span>6</span>x the same Hexatonic scale within the same ring, just each shifting a tone.</p>



<p>All Hexatonic scales within the same ring use exactly the same <span>6</span> tones but any of these tones could be used as the tonic of a hexatonic scale.</p>

<h4 id="doublepower">“Double Power”</h4>



<p>We know Coltrane had an investigative mind and a deep interest in mathematics, philosophy, the occult and religion.</p>



<p>Earlier in this article you probably noticed the Pentagram Coltrane drew in his circle. Now we have looked at the Hexatonic nature of the tone circle, we can also draw a Hexagram between the tones of the Hexatonic scale of the outer ring.</p>







<p>What appears when we combine the <strong>Pentagram and Hexagram</strong>, is the symbol of “<strong>Double Power</strong>“. As symbol of ‘double power’ or the unity of the Pentagram and Hexagram, it symbolizes the “<strong>mystical marriage</strong>” of the <strong>micro and macrocosms</strong>. The <strong>Inner and Outer Worlds</strong>. “<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_above,_so_below" target="_blank" aria-label="As Above, So Below (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">As Above, So Below</a></strong>“.</p>



<p>Below you see on the left the Coltrane Circle. In this case instead of single tones I approach it as chords. Those of you familiar with Coltrane’s music will directly notice that the colored sections of the circle form the chord progressions of <a aria-label="Giant Steps (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Steps_(composition)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Giant Steps</a> (in “<a aria-label="concert pitch (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_pitch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concert pitch</a>“).</p>



<p>When you merge the triangles formed with the <span><strong>Minor <span>7</span>th</strong></span> and <span><strong>Dominant <span>7</span>th</strong></span> chords (the <strong><span>II</span></strong>‘s and <span><strong><span>V</span></strong></span>‘s), a Hexagram is formed. The Hexagram can be seen as a <strong>2D</strong> version of the <strong>3D</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellated_octahedron" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Star Tetrahedron</a>, also known as “<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkabah_mysticism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Merkaba</a></strong>“.</p>

<p>“Mer-ka-ba” means “light-spirit-body”. The Merkaba represent the innermost law of the physical world:  the inseparable relationship between the two complementary halves – the positive and negative, the manifest and the unmanifest – which form a perfect equilibrium. In creation they rule as two opposite laws: the law of spirit and the law of matter. The Merkaba is also been called the “divine light vehicle” allegedly used by ascended masters to connect with and reach those in tune with the higher realms, the spirit/body surrounded by counter-rotating fields of light, (wheels within wheels).</p>



<p>I understand for those of you reading this with no interest in mathematics, philosophy, the occult and religion this might all seem a bit far-fetched. But, if you look at some of the titles of his compositions (“<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascension_(John_Coltrane_album)" target="_blank">Ascension</a>“, “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Ship" target="_blank">Ascent</a>“, “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Ship" target="_blank">Sun Ship</a>“, “Cosmos”, “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_Space" target="_blank">Interstellar Space</a>“, “Spiritual”, et cetera) then is seems more then clear that music, the occult / religion and geometry / math were all connected for Coltrane. </p>



<p>More about Giant Steps you can read in the article “<a href="https://roelsworld.eu/en/blog-saxophone/coltrane-geometry/" target="_blank" aria-label="The Geometry of John Coltrane's Music (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Geometry of John Coltrane’s Music</a>“.</p>



<h4><hr><br>WHY HAVE TONES BEEN CIRCLED?</h4>



<div><p>It’s not completely clear why Coltrane circled those tones, he never made note of it. The tones that have been circled are the <span><strong>Major 7th</strong></span> or “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading-tone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leading Tone</a>“, the <span><strong>Tonic</strong></span> and the <span><strong>Minor 2nd</strong></span> or “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supertonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supertonic</a>” (see image below).
</p><p>
Perhaps Coltrane wanted to visualize how chromatic neighbor tones lead to adjacent neighbor tones / Tone Centers?
</p><p>
Every <span><strong>Major 7th</strong></span> (mentioned above) is the <strong>Major Third</strong> of the key (tone center) a Fifth higher (next tone center counterclockwise) as well. [suggestion by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mark.rossi.739/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Rossi</a>]</p></div>



<p>Example: the <span><strong>B</strong></span> circled along with the <span><strong>C</strong></span> (tone center) is the <strong>Major Third</strong> of <strong>G</strong> (next tone center counterclockwise in the Coltrane Circle).</p>



<p>Every <span><strong>Minor 2nd</strong></span> is also the <strong>Major Third</strong> of the <strong>parallel Major</strong> of the <strong>Relative Minor</strong> key of the by circle connected tone center. [suggestion by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mark.rossi.739/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Rossi</a>]</p>



<p>Example: the <span><strong>D♭</strong></span> circled along with the <span><strong>C</strong></span> (tone center) is the <strong>Major Third of A Major</strong>, the <strong>parallel Major key of A Minor</strong>, the <strong>relative minor key</strong> of <span><strong>C</strong></span> Major (tone center). &lt;- You might need to read that twice. 😉

</div>



<div><p>Perhaps the circled tones outline the relationship between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminished_seventh_chord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diminished <span>7</span>th Chords</a> within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octatonic_scale" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diminished Scale</a>? An example:</p><p>The <strong>C Diminished <span>7</span>th Chord</strong> is <strong><span>C</span> – <span>E♭</span> – <span>G♭</span> – <span>A</span>.</strong> To turn this into a Diminished scale, you need to add another Diminished <span>7</span>th Chord a semitone higher: <strong><span>D♭</span> – <span>E</span> – <span>G</span> – <span>B♭</span></strong> or lower: <strong><span>B</span> – <span>D</span> – <span>F</span> – <span>A♭</span></strong>. <strong>Results:</strong></p><p><strong><span>C</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;</strong><strong><span>D♭</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;</strong><strong><span>E♭</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;</strong><strong><span>E</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;</strong><strong><span>G♭</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;</strong><strong><span>G</span></strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;–&nbsp;<span>A</span></strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;–&nbsp;<span>B♭</span></strong><strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;</strong><strong><span>C&nbsp;<br></span></strong>&amp; &nbsp;<br><strong><span>C</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;</strong><strong><span>D</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;</strong><strong><span>E♭</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;</strong><strong><span>F</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;</strong><strong><span>G♭</span></strong><strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<span>A♭</span></strong><strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<span>A</span></strong><strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;</strong><strong><span>B</span></strong><strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;</strong><strong><span>C</span></strong></p></div>
</div>



<p>It is commonly known that Coltrane did like using the Diminished Scale (or “<span>Double Diminished” as it was called because it is build from two Diminished <span>7</span>th Chords)</span>. An example of that is his solo in&nbsp;<span>“Moment’s Notice” (<span>in measure <span>74</span> where he plays a Bb<span>7</span> diminished scale pattern). Another example is his solo in “Epistrophy” during the&nbsp;<span>live perfomance at Carnegie Hall with Thelonious Monk.</span></span></span><br></p>



<h5>ALTERED DOMINANT (ALT DOM) CHORDS</h5>



<p>Jazz guitarist, composer and music theorist <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mark.rossi.739/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Rossi</a> shared another way of looking at the circled tones.&nbsp;</p>



<p><span>An Alt Dom chord is a dominant chord (centered around the <span>5</span>th of the key) but with a minor <span>7</span>th on top (hereby creating a Dominant <span>7</span>th) and the <span>5</span>th and <span>9</span>th of the chord either lowered or raised by one half step. This in turn gives us either a <span><sup>b</sup></span><span>5</span> or a <span><sup>#</sup></span><span>5</span> instead of a natural <span>5</span> as well as a <span><sup>b</sup></span><span>9</span> and <span><sup>#</sup></span><span>9</span>. </span></p>



<p><span>When you add the <span>3</span> Diminished <span>7</span>th Chords to a table you get the following result:</span></p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><span><strong>G</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>A♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>A</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>B♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>B</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>C</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>D♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>D</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>E<sup>b</sup></strong></span></td><td><span><strong>E</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>F</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>G♭</strong></span></td></tr><tr><td><span><strong>B♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>B</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>C</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>D♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>D</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>E♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>E</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>F</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>G♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>G</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>A♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>A</strong></span></td></tr><tr><td><span><strong>D♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>D</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>E♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>E</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>F</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>G♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>G</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>A♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>A</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>B♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>B</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>C</strong></span></td></tr><tr><td><span><strong>E</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>F</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>G♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>G</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>A♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>A</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>B♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>B</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>C</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>D♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>D</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>E♭</strong></span></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<h5>NATABHAIRAVI-CHARUKESI (NATURAL MINOR + MELODIC MAJOR) “COMPOUND” SCALE</h5>



<p>Corey Mwamba shared an alternative interpretation about the meaning of the circled tones, he thinks they might form what he calls a “compound scale”. This compound scale is formed my combining the “Natural Minor” scale (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natabhairavi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Natabhairavi</a>) and the “Melodic Major” scale (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charukesi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charukesi</a>) a semitone lower, characteristic for North Indian music (something Coltrane developed an interest for in the <span>60</span>s (see “<a href="http://indiamusicweek.org/files/coltrane.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Coltrane and the integration of Indian concepts in Jazz improvisation</a>” by Carl Clements).</p>



<p><span><span>Corey writes: “<em>We can see that the two scales have two enharmonic points; one at the third degree of each scale, and one at the sixth. If we transliterate Natabhairavi to d<abbr title="flat">♭</abbr>&nbsp;and combine it with Charukesi mapped from c, we can see an intersection that contains&nbsp;e&nbsp;and&nbsp;a<abbr title="flat">♭</abbr></em><span><em>. Natabhairavi is the top line, circled in blue; Charukesi is circled in red.</em>“</span></span></span></p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://roelsworld.eu/wp-content/uploads/manual/Music-Geometry/linked-natural-minor-and-melodic-major-scales-by-coreymwamba.jpg" alt=""></figure>







<p><span>He continues: “<em>Arranged in chromatic order, the first, fourth and seventh degrees of Natabhairavi are aligned with the degrees from Charukesi in a way that matches the segment <span>3–4</span> on the original diagram.</em>” With the “original diagram” Corey referes to the Coltrane Circle with the Pentagram drawn into it. In that version the Circle the 5 segments are numbered.</span></p>

<h6>ALL-INTERVAL TETRACHORD</h6>



<p><a target="_blank" href="https://stephonalexander.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephon Alexander</a> wrote in his book “<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465093574/ref=as_li_tl?tag=roelsworld-20" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Jazz of Physics: The Secret Link Between Music and the Structure of the Universe</a>  that it has been argued by Australian pianist <a href="https://www.seanwayland.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sean Wayland</a> that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-interval_tetrachord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">All-Interval Tetrachord</a> can be used as a method to play through the chord changes of “Giant Steps” (see video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQGWAnYd7Iw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQGWAnYd7Iw</a> by <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marc Hannaford</a>).</p>



<p>An all-interval tetrachord is a tetrachord, a collection of four pitch classes, containing all six interval classes.
There are only two possible all-interval tetrachords when expressed in prime form. 
In set theory notation, these are {0146} and {0137} (their inversions: {0256} and {0467}).</p>



<p>From the Tonic C we would get: C-Db-E-Gb {0146} and C-Db-Eb-G {0137} (their inversions: C-D-F-Gb {0256} and C-E-Gb-G {0467}).
As you can see, the {<strong>0146</strong>} sets contain only tones circled on the Coltrane Circle (<strong>C-Db-E-Gb</strong>) if you follow the Circle clockwise from C.</p>



<h6>ALL-TRICHORD HEXACHORD</h6>



<p>
This though made me wonder if another “tone-series” would align better with or include more tones of the series of circled tones: the All-Trichord Hexachord.</p>







<p>The all-trichord hexachord is a unique hexachord that contains all twelve trichords, or from which all twelve possible trichords may be derived. The prime form of this set class is {<strong>012478</strong>}</p>



<p>From the Tonic C we would get: <strong>C-Db-D-E-F-Gb</strong>. All but the 2nd pitch class (D) used in this All-Trichord Hexachord are circled at the Coltrane Circle if you follow the Circle clockwise from C.</p>

<h5>WHAT DO THE NUMBERS IN THE DRAWING MEAN?</h5>



<div>
<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://roelsworld.eu/wp-content/uploads/John-Coltrane-Tone-Circle-Pentagram.png" alt="" title="Coltrane Circles Pentagram"></figure>
</div>



<div>
<p>“What do those numbers mean?” is a question I have received via mail several times.</p>



<p>Well, the 5 numbers outside the circle 1-5 are the easiest to explain. They mark the 5 octaves this tone circle covers.</p>



<div><p>Not per say related or intended, but 5 octaves = <b>5</b> x <b>12</b> tones = <b>60</b> tones. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes&nbsp;in an hour. </p><p>Perhaps that’s why some would refer to this circle as a “clock”.&nbsp;There is nothing in this drawing though that suggests this to be one of the&nbsp;reasons for the design of this circle.</p></div>
</div>
</div>



<p>Inside the circle you notice a sequence of numbers 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-2-3-4-5-6-7 and&nbsp;reversed 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-6-5-4-3-2-1, apparently showing you the chromatic (semitone) relationship between the tones listed in both inner and outer ring when combined in one. The 1’s (C) and 7’s (F#) are a Tritone (six “spaces” between the lines) apart from each other. This might suggest a so called “<strong>Tritone Substitution</strong>“.</p>



<p>A Tritone substitution is one of the most common <a title="Chord substitution" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_substitution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chord substitutions</a> used in Jazz and is the foundation for&nbsp;more complex substitution patterns like <a title="Coltrane changes" href="https://roelsworld.eu/en/blog-saxophone/Coltrane-Geometry/">Coltrane changes</a>. Other examples of the tritone substitution (known in the classical world as an <a title="Augmented sixth chord" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_sixth_chord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">augmented sixth chord</a>)&nbsp;can be found in classical music since the <a title="Renaissance music" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_music" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Renaissance</a> period.&nbsp;The Tritone substitution can be performed by exchanging a dominant seven chord for another dominant seven chord which is a Tritone away from it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the Coltrane Circle you see a sequence from 1-7 starting from C (top of the Circle) to&nbsp;F# both clockwise and counterclockwise. Could that suggest a substitution of C<sup>7</sup> by&nbsp;F#<sup>7</sup>?</p>



<p>If you have another (perhaps better) idea about this sequence, please do <a href="https://roelsworld.eu/en/contact-social-media/">contact me</a>.</p>







<h4>FLOWER OF LIFE (61)</h4>



<p>As mentioned above, the Coltrane Circle covers 5 octaves = <strong>5</strong> x <strong>12</strong> tones = <strong>60</strong> tones within <strong>1</strong> circle. That number reminded met of (an extended version of) the Flower of Life, that contains <strong>60</strong> circles drawn around/over <strong>1</strong> circle in the center (61 in total). </p>



<p>The Flower of Life is a geometric pattern grid of&nbsp;repeating, overlapping&nbsp;circles&nbsp;of an equal&nbsp;radius&nbsp;in&nbsp;two-dimensional space. Commonly, designs are based on circles centered on&nbsp;triangles&nbsp;(with the simple, two circle form named&nbsp;<em>vesica piscis</em>) or on the&nbsp;square lattice&nbsp;pattern of points. The&nbsp;Flower Of Life symbol&nbsp;is one of the most known and recognized&nbsp;geometric&nbsp;Sacred&nbsp;Geometry symbols. This special symbol represents the cycle of life. It visualizes that all consciousness arises from one source (the first, center circle). The <strong>5</strong> platonic solids are found within Flower Of Life, as well as many others including the Seed Of Life, Tree Of Life, and Metatron’s Cube just to name a few. These shapes act as building blocks for all living things, starting with the very first circle. There are many variations of the Flower Of Life, some having as little as only seven circles. </p>



<p>When you place the Flower of Life over the Coltrane Circle you can see the fit nicely together. The outer circles and crossings of circles align with the trigons C-E-Ab &amp; D-Db-Gb, als well as with the trigons G-B-Eb &amp; F-A-Db, <strong>12</strong> tones that together form 2 Hexagons.</p>











<p>Perhaps it is “coincidence” that the <strong>60</strong> around <strong>1</strong> circle (61 circles) <strong>Flower of Life</strong> aligns with Coltrane’s tone circle with <strong>5</strong> x <strong>12</strong> = <strong>60</strong> tones within <strong>1</strong> circle (61 circles), but as mentioned before, Coltrane’s interest in mathematics, philosophy and the occult might have played a role here too … perhaps not, we will never know for sure. </p>



<p>Another funny coincidence is that Coltrane drew his tone circle in 19<strong>61</strong> as mentioned earlier in this article.</p>

<h4>JOHN COLTRANE’S MUSIC &amp; GEOMETRY</h4>



<p>If you find this article interesting, you might like to read the Roel’s World article “<strong><a href="https://roelhollander.eu/en/blog-saxophone/Coltrane-Geometry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Coltrane’s Music &amp; Geometry</a></strong>” as well. In this article I write a bit more about the relationship between Coltrane’s music and it’s mathematical / geometrical interpretation.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p>To finish this article with I like to share a “music video” of Coltrane’s piece “11383” with the Coltrane Tone Circle used as base/inspiration for the visualization. Note: the visualization of the Coltrane Circle does not accurately follows the music – as becomes obvious later on in the video – but is nonetheless a nice ‘work of art’.</p>

<p>A new MIT study titled, <strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08872" rel="noopener">Your Brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of Cognitive Debt when Using an AI Assistant for Essay Writing Task</a>,</strong> has found that using ChatGPT to help write essays leads to long-term cognitive harm—measurable through EEG brain scans. Students who repeatedly relied on ChatGPT showed <strong>weakened neural connectivity, impaired memory recall, and diminished sense of ownership</strong> <strong>over their own writing</strong>. While the AI-generated content often scored well, the brains behind it were shutting down.</p>

<p>The findings are clear: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Grok don’t just help students write—they train the brain to disengage. Here’s what the researchers found:</p>

<h4><strong>Brain Connectivity Declines with AI Use</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>EEG scans revealed a systematic scaling down of neural connectivity in the brain with increasing reliance on external tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Brain-only group:</strong> strongest, most widespread connectivity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Search Engine group:</strong> intermediate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>LLM group:</strong> weakest connectivity across alpha, beta, delta, and theta bands.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>LLM use resulted in under-engagement of critical attention and visual processing networks, especially in Session 4 when participants tried to write without AI.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>LLM Users Forget What They Just Wrote</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In post-task interviews:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>83.3% of LLM users were unable to quote even one sentence from the essay they had just written.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In contrast, 88.9% of Search and Brain-only users <em>could</em> quote accurately.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>0% of LLM users could produce a <em>correct quote</em>, while most Brain-only and Search users could.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>AI Use Disrupts Memory and Learning Pathways</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Participants previously using LLMs (then writing without it in Session 4) showed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Weaker memory recall</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lower alpha and beta neural engagement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Signs of <em>cognitive adaptation</em> toward passivity and “efficiency” at the cost of effortful learning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>LLM Users Felt Detached From Their Work</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When asked about authorship:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>LLM users gave responses like “50/50” or “70% mine.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some claimed no ownership at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brain-only group participants almost universally reported full ownership.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Switching from LLM to Brain Use Doesn’t Fully Restore Function</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Session 4: LLM-to-Brain participants showed lingering cognitive deficiency, failing to return to their original (Session 1) brain activity patterns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their neural activity remained below baseline, even after AI use was stopped.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Search Engine Users Showed Healthier Brain Engagement</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Search users maintained stronger executive function, memory activation, and quote recall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EEG data showed more robust occipital and parietal activation supporting visual processing and cognitive effort.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>AI Dependency Leads to “Cognitive Offloading”</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Researchers noted a trend toward neural efficiency adaptation: the brain essentially “lets go” of the effort required for synthesis and memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This adaptation led to passivity, minimal editing, and low integration of concepts.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Short-Term Gains, Long-Term Cognitive Debt</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Despite receiving decent scores from judges, the LLM group’s writing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lacked strategic integration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Used fewer diverse structures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was shorter and more robotic.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over time, the group showed a <strong>consistent decline in engagement, performance, and self-reported satisfaction</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on this study, as more of the global population begins to rely on artificial intelligence to complete complex tasks, our cognitive abilities and creative capacities appear poised to take a nosedive into oblivion.</p>
<p>One thing is clear: if you currently use AI, take regular breaks—and give your own mind the chance to do the work. Otherwise, you may face severe cognitive harm and dependence.</p>
<p>The machines aren’t just taking over our work—they’re taking over our minds.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Architecture</h3><a id="user-content-architecture" aria-label="Permalink: Architecture" href="#architecture"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Voyager consists of two key components:</p>
<p dir="auto">(1) World-Consistent Video Diffusion: A unified architecture that jointly generates aligned RGB and depth video sequences, conditioned on existing world observation to ensure global coherence.</p>
<p dir="auto">(2) Long-Range World Exploration: An efficient world cache with point culling and an auto-regressive inference with smooth video sampling for iterative scene extension with context-aware consistency.</p>
<p dir="auto">To train Voyager, we propose a scalable data engine, i.e., a video reconstruction pipeline that automates camera pose estimation and metric depth prediction for arbitrary videos, enabling large-scale, diverse training data curation without manual 3D annotations. Using this pipeline, we compile a dataset of over 100,000 video clips, combining real-world captures and synthetic Unreal Engine renders.</p>

      <p>
        VibeVoice is a novel framework designed for generating <b>expressive, long-form, multi-speaker </b>conversational audio, such as podcasts, from text. It addresses significant challenges in traditional Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems, particularly in scalability, speaker consistency, and natural turn-taking.
A core innovation of VibeVoice is its use of continuous speech tokenizers (Acoustic and Semantic) operating at an ultra-low frame rate of 7.5 Hz. These tokenizers efficiently preserve audio fidelity while significantly boosting computational efficiency for processing long sequences. VibeVoice employs a next-token diffusion framework, leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) to understand textual context and dialogue flow, and a diffusion head to generate high-fidelity acoustic details.
The model can synthesize speech up to 90 minutes long with up to 4 distinct speakers, surpassing the typical 1-2 speaker limits of many prior models.

            <p>Hey there <em><strong>ROM</strong></em> readers! I've got an absolute whopper of a story this issue with a genuine longform dive into the emulation of the LaserActive, <em>plus</em> a bit of backstory on the new fan translation of the Cowboy Bebop game for PS2, <em>plus</em> your usual quick hits on emulator improvements, FPGA happenings and other fan translation progress. That means there's absolutely no more time or space to waste on this intro.</p><p>LET'S GET TO IT.</p><hr><h2 id="the-big-two">The Big Two</h2><h3 id="1-the-laseractive-might-be-the-last-vintage-home-console-of-note-which-hadnt-been-emulated-but-no-longer">1. The LaserActive "might be the last vintage home console of note which hadn't been emulated," but no longer</h3><figure><img src="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/2025/08/pioneer-laseractive-header.jpg" alt="Ad scan via @VGArtAndTidbits" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="400" srcset="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/08/pioneer-laseractive-header.jpg 600w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/08/pioneer-laseractive-header.jpg 1000w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/08/pioneer-laseractive-header.jpg 1600w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/2025/08/pioneer-laseractive-header.jpg 2372w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The story behind the birth of any new emulator has some common ingredients. Fearsome programming skills; hundreds or thousands of hours of thankless work; the drive to understand <em>exactly</em> how and why a piece of technology works. None of these things come without patience. But lifelong Sega fan Nemesis, who released <a href="https://ares-emu.net/news/ares-v146-released?ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">the first-ever emulator</a> for the Pioneer LaserActive this week — 16 <em>years </em>after first pondering the idea — had no choice but to be patient. Because for most of the last decade, emulating the LaserActive was simply impossible.</p><p>"All along the way, the video made things difficult," he says. "The hardware to capture the signal properly didn’t exist. The software to decode the captured signal properly didn’t exist. And finally, a format to store the decoded video in a form suitable for emulation, also didn’t exist."</p><p>There's no other game console quite like the Pioneer LaserActive, which was released in 1993, sold abysmally and was dead in the ground by 1996. That's not a unique story for a '90s game system, but the LaserActive kinda... wasn't one. It was a LaserDisc player with an expansion bay that owners could slot different modules into. One transformed the LaserActive into a karaoke machine. Another would give it the guts of a PC Engine. And a third added the brains of a Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, able to play Sega CD games as well as about two dozen made for the short-lived Mega LD.</p><p>The Mega LD format represented a technological leap over early LaserDisc-based arcade games like Dragon's Lair. The mid-'90s promise of FULL MOTION VIDEO GAMEPLAY may be quaint as hell today, but it's the reason the LaserActive has been impossible to emulate for 30 years. And it still would be today, if Nemesis hadn't spent much of the 21st century proactively collecting Sega hardware and Mega LD games with the goal of one day preserving them. </p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WQvkTN3Vvlc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="The LaserActive: Wonders of the Retro Gaming World"></iframe></figure><p>Nemesis's history with both games and emulation started with the Genesis (which I will refer to as the Mega Drive for the rest of this issue, out of respect for his native Australia). After owning a Mega Drive, 32X and Mega CD growing up, he played his first emulator, the Nesticle successor Genecyst, on a Pentium 133 circa 1997. That eventually led to contributing to reverse-engineering and emulation efforts.</p><p>"I did a lot of work on the YM2612 FM chip in the Mega Drive back in 2008 in particular, and a lot of Mega Drive emulators finally had decent FM sound after that as a result," he says. "Sharing that research, seeing the results made use of, and finally hearing the games I remembered from my childhood sound right for the first time, was a really good feeling."</p><p>In 2004, when buying loads of retro consoles was not yet a universal pasttime for nostalgic millenials and Gen Xers, he paid about $200 for one of the approximately 10,000 LaserActives that Pioneer manufactured in its short life, along with the Mega LD "PAC" module. Throughout the rest of the decade he scooped up every bit of Sega hardware he could get his hands on with an eye towards future reverse-engineering projects, but it wasn't until 2009 when he started thinking: <em>Why isn't there an emulator for the LaserActive?</em></p><p>So he did what any retro game fan would do in 2009: started a forum thread about it.</p><p>"This system keeps popping into my mind," he wrote in the thread, which is <a href="https://gendev.spritesmind.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=563&amp;ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">still online today</a>. "I don't think anyone's had a serious crack at emulating it yet, and I really don't think it would be very hard to do."</p><p>Well. About that.</p><p>"I honestly feel like I've nearly 'solved' this system half a dozen times over by now," Nemesis says here in 2025.</p><p>"The <em>digital</em> side of the system was actually pretty straightforward. When you break it down, the LaserActive is really more like a big oversized add-on to the console hardware. What that add-on provides is a different drive control interface, another audio source, and another video source, with mixing features to combine that video/audio with the console video/audio. That's really about it. On paper, it's pretty simple. In reality though, the LaserActive hardware did present a lot of challenges, mostly due to its inherent unreliability."</p><figure><div><p><img src="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-2.jpg" width="1800" height="2400" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-2.jpg 600w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-2.jpg 1000w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-2.jpg 1600w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-2.jpg 1800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-6.jpg" width="2000" height="2667" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-6.jpg 600w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-6.jpg 1000w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-6.jpg 1600w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w2400/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-6.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div><figcaption><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>1:</strong></b><span> "Some of the internal mods to the player.

This bootstraps the hardware from a flashcart, and allows me to edit the LaserActive registers live using a control pad.

But the problem started to pile up immediately. First there were the almost 100 capacitors in the Sega PAC that were guaranteed to fail at some point, causing many to have to be replaced on even a mint condition system. Pioneer's cost-cutting inside the LaserDisc player caused other parts to break, too. Learning to fix the LaserActive was a necessary step to figuring out how it worked.</p><p>2011 was a year of progress. Nemesis: </p><ul><li>Coded a program to load onto a Mega Drive flash cart that allowed him to "probe" the LaserActive hardware</li><li>Disassembled the system BIOS to identify that "ll the interaction with the LaserActive hardware happened over a custom register block"</li><li>Coded another program that allowed direct read/write access to those registers using a controller</li><li>With the help of other forumites, mapped most of the registers by comparing the system's actions to the code in the disassembldd BIOS and documented what it was doing</li></ul><p>The next two years were focused on figuring out how to rip the LaserActive's games. This involved writing multiple more custom programs and using a special <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521053653/http://krikzz.com/link-unit.html" rel="noreferrer">USB-to-MD link cable</a> to copy the digital data from the disc, which contained the game code as well as audio tracks. When that didn't prove to be enough to capture the TOC (or table of contents) data that essentially acted as a guide to how all the data on the disc was organized, he had to go deeper.</p><p>"I soldered a bunch of physical tapping wires into my Sega PAC-S10 module, and used a Saleae logic analyzer clone to do a streaming capture of the data lines when the TOC region was being read, which the hardware didn't make directly available. I wrote a program to parse the bus trace and extract the data from the raw capture and reconstruct the lead-in. At this point, I had everything I needed to rip a full bin/cue image of the digital data from a LaserDisc."</p><p>In 2014, Nemesis started soliciting other members of the forum where he chronicled the project to send him Mega LD games to dump (shout out to doc eggfan, who acquired most of the library including two Myst prototypes; "if he hadn't done that, there's a good chance they would have been lost forever). With a pile of games in hand, he bought a PC video capture card to rip the audio and video from the discs. And this is where the 2-3 people reading this who have an intimate understanding of the LaserActive will probably reflexively say "uh oh."</p><p>LaserDisc, despite looking like a jumbo DVD, is an analog video medium. No big deal if you're just capturing a movie. But for a <em>game</em>? Big big deal. Here's the long-form breakdown — skip ahead if you don't want to get <em>way</em> deep into analog-to-digital misery.</p><blockquote>"No analog capture cards of the day were actually up to the task of what we were trying to do. ... The LaserActive has one of the fastest, most powerful control systems for LaserDisc playback ever made, and the game has direct, immediate control over it. Rarely is the player just playing back a video normally. Games will often have completely different video footage per field, with only one shown, or skip over every second frame, to mix four or more video streams in the same area of the disc. Many games use this for seamless 'branching' such as whether you go left or right, and this can change constantly and seamlessly during playback. The unit can play faster or slower, even playing in reverse, such as in Rocket Coaster as you speed up, or slide backwards down a slope. The unit can perform rapid nearly instant seeks with seamless looping, and does for games like Myst. In fact, the entire Myst title is basically using the LaserDisc as a set of random, short transitions, and still images, and other titles do this as well to differing degrees. ...<p>Games used the skip play features to further interleave different video streams at half the framerate between each other. Analog capture cards of the day didn't deal with this well. None of them could compress lossless video, everything was encoded to lossy formats. Most of them would assume a 480i image. This would cause the separate video streams in each field to 'bleed into' each other, destroying the image. The same problem occurred between frames when they had separate video streams interleaved together, where inter-frame compression would cause artifacts from the two streams to bleed together.</p><p>A high end Canopus capture card I had was the only one that was capable of compressing into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffyuv?ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">huffyuv</a>, not in a lossless form, but at least in a format that prevented this bleeding problem. Unfortunately, this card still had a limitation, in that it couldn't capture the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_blanking_interval?ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">VBI</a> data. It was common in the day for special 'control codes' to be encoded into lines normally hidden on a normal TV, which contained information. In the case of LaserDiscs, it contained frame numbers, timecodes, picture stop codes, video TOC information in the lead-in, and other such data. None of that could be captured by capture cards of the day. For cards that had VBI capture features, they didn't work on LaserDiscs, since LaserDiscs used different lines/formats than other sources, and no capture cards in the world expected to be capturing LaserDisc video.</p><p>At this point, I felt like I'd hit a bit of a dead end. It could, perhaps, have been possible to cobble something together at this point in 2014, but I felt the result would be poor, and the discs would not have been properly preserved. I decided a different approach was needed for the analog video content, but the technology to do what I needed to do at this point, didn't seem to exist."</p></blockquote><p>With an increasingly busy home life thanks to two young kids, a long commute and demanding workload at the office, Nemesis did the only thing that made sense at that point. He put the LaserActive on the shelf.</p><p>Two years later, he took another stab at it by trying to build his own hardware capture setup. By tapping into the LaserActive directly, he was able to capture a full, raw composite video signal — but it was useless unless he could decode it. Back on the shelf it went for another two years.</p><p>A house move, shorter commute and more balanced work-life, er, balance, later, Nemesis decided to dust off the LaserActive. Enter the Domesday Duplicator — an open source, community-driven hardware project dedicated to ripping LaserDiscs.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QDlbwl3f39Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Domesday Duplicator - Ultimate LaserDisc Preservation"></iframe></figure><p><em>Surely</em> this was the capture solution he'd been waiting for. Turns out it was... but not in 2018. A key companion to the Domesday Duplicator, <a href="https://www.readonlymemo.com/playdate-crankboy-emulator-interview/" rel="noreferrer">ld-decode</a>, was then still "in its infancy." At the time there was no publicly available software solution to decoding composite video; by the time computers were fast enough to do it without dedicated hardware, analog was donezo. Nemesis went down the path of trying to write his own decoder to mixed results, but when he found out kid #4 was on the way, he decided to wait for the broader community effort to mature.</p><p>And it did mature by a <em>lot, </em>with both the Duplicator and ld-decode improving process of ripping LaserDiscs in the higest possible quality. But there was still a problem when it came to LaserActive discs — they were interactive games, not static films. In 2020 Nemesis started chipping in to ld-decode:</p><blockquote>"I started pushing for the need to add extra features into the decode process. Until then, focus had been entirely around the requirements of capturing movies on LaserDiscs, as you'd expect. LaserActive games needed more though. I needed a way to capture the full lead-in, which stored the TOC data for both the analog video and the digital data. If you're just ripping a LaserDisc to an mp4, you don't need this info, but we do for emulation. I also needed the full 525 lines of NTSC video, with VBI data. That was stripped by ld-decode, they just cared about the visible region you'd see on a TV. I needed to deal with mixed-mode 'CD' images in the digital data track. They just needed audio tracks to work. I needed to be able to play through picture stop codes seamlessly without corrupting the audio data, they didn't need to worry about that. All kinds of things like this added up, to mean that ld-decode increasingly worked great for regular LaserDiscs, but still wasn't checking all the boxes for LaserActive games."</blockquote><p>Before he could fully commit to adding those features himself, COVID upended everything and the LaserActive went back into storage.</p><figure><img src="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-1.jpg 600w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-1.jpg 1600w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w2400/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-1.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>"This is from 2019, showing the old digital ripping process where I stream the data over the second control port."</span></figcaption></figure><p>2024: 15 years after he'd first suggested emulating the LaserActive didn't seem like it'd be <em>that</em> tricky, set up in a new house with a new workspace, Nemesis finally vowed to finish what he'd started.</p><p>It was a year of whirlwind activity: </p><ul><li>Using the LaserActive's test mode and a custom firmware mod he developed to properly capture the lead-in and lead-out from every disc</li><li>Rewriting the flaky USB capture code for the Domesday Duplicator's capture program to ensure error-free rips</li><li>Expanding the program's capabilities to record more data about the disc itself, the player, and the signal quality</li><li>Rewriting ld-decode's digital audio decoding, which had issues with drifting out of sync with the video, and finally making it possible to parse the TOC data</li><li>Improving the video decoding to output full frame data, with all 525 lines of NTSC video and the VBI data</li></ul><p>"With all these bits in place, I was now able to rip discs and extract the actual contents in a form suitable for emulation," Nemesis says. 2024 ticked over to 2025, and he began removing LaserActive games from the sleeves they'd rested within for decades undisturbed. Most of them had been bought new and never opened; for years he'd resisted the urge, not wanting to risk even a tiny accidental scratch until everything was ready.</p><p>After so many years and so many obstacles, the final mile was, at long last, an easy run:</p><blockquote>"Most of the work reverse engineering the hardware I'd already done and published notes on over 13 years prior. I sat down and implemented the emulation code according to my notes, double checking things on the hardware as I went using the same testing program I'd written all those years ago, and filling the gaps in my notes for parts I hadn't fully mapped out. Space Berserker was quickly running, and after that, as more games finished decoding most of them worked on the first try, with no issues. Since I'd set out to emulate the complete hardware, with all its quirks and unusual features, whatever a game tried to do, it should just work. A few games flushed out some things I'd missed here and there, but mostly it was just fixing bugs in my implementation, until after a few weeks, everything was fully working in the emulator, just the same way it did on the hardware."</blockquote><p>Nemesis decided to write his LaserActive emulation as a component of multi-system emualtor Ares, partially out of respect for its late creator, Near. Its existing Mega Drive support made for an easy starting point, and current Ares maintainer Luke Usher had actually done some ground work to support the Mega LD in the future by creating a "skeleton" that defined it in relation to the Mega Drive and CD.</p><p>"It was all sitting there, just needed the actual code to be written to emulate the LaserActive hardware," Nemesis says. "I'd never touched the Ares code before, but having this delivered to me is what allowed me to get the basics of drive control to have Mega CD games booting in days, from work over a few evenings. Without that, there's a good chance I wouldn't have started when I did."</p><p>There's one final wrinkle to LaserActive emulation, and that's the disc image files themselves. Basically, they're huge, in the dozens of gigabytes range. And that, again, is because the way LaserActive games utvi makes them allergic to compression. They may want to jump to specific frames in an instant, play backwards, or interleave frames, all of which means a specific moment in time needs to be a keyframe, not a compressed, modified frame that only contains the small amount of data that's changed from the frame before it, which is how video files are greatly reduced in size. You could still compress a LaserActive game to about 10GB per size with every frame preserved as a keyframe...</p><p>"That still isn’t suitable though, as heavyweight video codecs are too intensive to decode alongside emulating an entire Mega Drive + MegaCD in realtime without involving hardware decoding," Nemesis says. "In order to keep everything running at 60fps, you have to be able to do everything in under 16ms per frame. Using hardware decoding would take decoding burden off the CPU, but the video mixing with the graphics output from the Mega Drive now becomes more complex, and you also now place specific GPU requirements on any system that’s going to try and play these games."</p><p>So they stuck to a lossless format that preserves quality and takes the pressure off the CPU (and puts none at all on a graphics card). Any system that can currently run Ares should have no trouble with the LaserActive, with the caveat that you'll definitely want to have these mondo files on an SSD rather than an old spinning platter to avoid any issues with read speeds.</p><figure><img src="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-3-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="910" height="525" srcset="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-3-1.png 600w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-3-1.png 910w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>"This is a fully decoded single frame of video from one of the Myst prototypes. Normally for NTSC video, you'd expect two 'fields' each with half the lines of the full frame, which get interleaved together to make the whole image. For LaserActive titles, often two completely different video streams are stored in each field."</span></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://ares-emu.net/news/ares-v146-released?ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">Ares v146</a>, released on August 26, marked the first time a Mega LD game has been playable on another system. And it represents a milestone in game preservation that could've easily been missed — due to indifference, the literal string of inventions it took to make it a reality, or the inexorable march of time. </p><p>"There are other titles I don’t have access to at all, however I’m in discussions with a number of people who have offered to loan discs to help complete the dumping efforts," Nemesis says. "It’s been great to see people step up and offer to help. It’s vital this is done now, because Laserdisc titles don’t last forever. I have one disc in my possession that was a new, sealed copy, pressed in 1994, which is suffering from laser-rot. It’s likely that eventually, all Laserdiscs will be rendered unplayable, so we need to ensure these games are preserved now, while we still can."</p><p>He's now looking into the prospect of preserving the PC Engine PAC, which will — fingers crossed — not be too much more complicated than plugging Ares' existing PC Engine CD code into the new LaserActive code. But that's a story for another day. </p><p>For now, the emulation code being out in the wild represents <em>relief</em> most of all. "It was a long journey, with a lot of false starts and wrong turns getting to that point," Nemesis says. "A lot of it was work and time which nobody else had been able to see. I don't keep a blog. I don't tend to share the various steps I take to make something or get something working, I only tend to reach out when I have something to share or when I'm asking for help from other people.</p><p>"A lot of my time and energy had gone into this system over the years, and it was good to finally be able to show something for all that work."</p><div><p>💸</p><p><i><em>If you enjoy </em></i><i><b><strong>ROM</strong></b></i><i><em>, I'd love it if you'd consider </em></i><a href="https://www.readonlymemo.com/#/portal/support"><i><b><strong>a small tip</strong></b></i></a><i><em> to help me cover my monthly costs.

As I theorized <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/exactly-20-years-after-it-was-released-exclusively-in-japan-the-cowboy-bebop-ps2-game-is-now-playable-in-english/?ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">earlier this week on PC Gamer</a>, Tsuioku no Serenade's developer Bandai merging with Namco right around the time this game was being released may be the culprit — the ensuing corporate chaos of layoffs and reorganizations could easily have killed it in the cradle.</p><p>I haven't had a chance to play Tsuioku no Serenade myself despite being lucky enough to track down a (seemingly somewhat rare, now) copy, but general consensus is it's an <em>okay</em> brawler but quite a nice little Bebop sidestory with some handsome late-era PS2 graphics. And there's original Yoko Kanno music, so, like, what else do you really want?</p><p>I reached out to translator Sonicman69 for a bit of insight into the translation effort, who first watched Bebop around 2014 and learned later that the game had never been released in English. "From that exact moment I felt like I could be the one to do it," he said. "Keep in mind at this time I knew maybe three words in Japanese and was still in high school. Big expectations. I figured someone else would get around to it eventually."</p><p>But they didn't, so after off-and-on attempts to learn Japanese and gaining some translation and editing experience contributing to the Conan patch, he set sights on Bebop with the aim of finishing the patch by the game's 20th anniversary:</p><blockquote>I'd say the most challenging thing that people don't really think about is how often text would be reused at different points in the game. Trying to figure out a translation for a sentence that works in one context that also has to work in another — Conan had this a little bit but it was a lot more annoying with Bebop and frankly I don't think I nailed it. Aside from that the interstitials between scenes are poetic and I'm still a Japanese novice and have no poetic ability at all so I had a tough time at those and I think they came out kind of bad.<p>I am admittedly a little apologetic about the quality of the translation, I've received unanimous praise so far but I know I could have done better if I studied more but if I didn't translate the game now it would have never happened at all. What I'm most proud of aside from the fact we actually got it done and released it in time for the 20th anniversary? People keep telling me I did a good job writing the lines for the characters in a way that stays true to how they talked in the English dub of the show. I'm hesitant to accept that since I'm pretty critical of it myself but if I really was able to capture the characters then I did my job."</p></blockquote><p>Sonicman69 also argues that the game is "not a simple button mashing beat 'em up due to how deep the combat actually is," but some annoying tutorials and the language barrier made it easy to write off. Take it from the person who's beaten it a dozen times: it's worth playing. "As far as how well the story captures the vibe of the show I think they did a pretty admirable job, but obviously it's never going to get anywhere near the best scenes from the show. Any Bebop fan who wishes there was just a little bit more to chew on should at least enjoy the game a little bit. Especially the bonus mode you unlock after completing the game on normal but I don't want to spoil too much."</p><p>You can find the English patch <a href="https://github.com/SONICMAN69/Bebop-PS2-English?tab=readme-ov-file&amp;ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">on Github</a> and throw a few bucks to <a href="https://ko-fi.com/sonicman69?ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">Sonicman69 on Ko-fi</a> if you appreciate getting to spend a little more time in the Bebopverse after all these years.</p><hr><h2 id="patching-in">Patching In</h2><figure><img src="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/2024/01/https-3a-2f-2fsubstack-post-media-s3-amazonaws-com-2fpublic-2fimages-2fac94fc02-b2d1-4e35-b730-79de780d09d7_1200x200.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/https-3a-2f-2fsubstack-post-media-s3-amazonaws-com-2fpublic-2fimages-2fac94fc02-b2d1-4e35-b730-79de780d09d7_1200x200.png 600w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/https-3a-2f-2fsubstack-post-media-s3-amazonaws-com-2fpublic-2fimages-2fac94fc02-b2d1-4e35-b730-79de780d09d7_1200x200.png 1000w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/2024/01/https-3a-2f-2fsubstack-post-media-s3-amazonaws-com-2fpublic-2fimages-2fac94fc02-b2d1-4e35-b730-79de780d09d7_1200x200.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><a href="https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/pull/13142?ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Sometimes emudev is all about fixing a texture issue in Colin McRae Rally 2005</strong></a> – I always try to look into random Github commits with names I don't understand to see what they're all about, and sometimes PCSX2 being update to "Handle texture shuffle with pixel reversals" is just about adding some code to ignore when a game is flipping pixels horizontally and then flipping them back again because it screwed things up.

<p>The rapid deployment of large language models (LLMs) has introduced significant security vulnerabilities due to misconfigurations and inadequate access controls. This paper presents a systematic approach to identifying publicly exposed LLM servers, focusing on instances running the Ollama framework. Utilizing Shodan, a search engine for internet-connected devices, we developed a Python-based tool to detect unsecured LLM endpoints. Our study uncovered over 1,100 exposed Ollama servers, with approximately 20% actively hosting models susceptible to unauthorized access. These findings highlight the urgent need for security baselines in LLM deployments and provide a practical foundation for future research into LLM threat surface monitoring.</p>



<h2 id="h-introduction">Introduction</h2>



<p>The integration of large language models (LLMs) into diverse applications has surged in recent years, driven by their advanced capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. Widely adopted platforms such as ChatGPT, Grok, and DeepSeek have contributed to the mainstream visibility of LLMs, while open-source frameworks like Ollama and Hugging Face have significantly lowered the barrier to entry for deploying these models in custom environments. This has led to widespread adoption by both organizations and individuals of a broad range of tasks, including content generation, customer support, data analysis, and software development.</p>



<p>Despite their growing utility, the pace of LLM adoption has often outstripped the development and implementation of appropriate security practices. Many self-hosted or locally deployed LLM solutions are brought online without adequate hardening, frequently exposing endpoints due to default configurations, weak or absent authentication, and insufficient network isolation. These vulnerabilities are not only a byproduct of poor deployment hygiene but are also symptomatic of an ecosystem that has largely prioritized accessibility and performance over security. As a result, improperly secured LLM instances present an expanding attack surface, opening the door to risks such as:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unauthorized API Access</strong> — Many ML servers operate without authentication, allowing anyone to submit queries.</li>



<li><strong>Model Extraction Attacks</strong> — Attackers can reconstruct model parameters by querying an exposed ML server repeatedly.</li>



<li><strong>Jailbreaking and Content Abuse</strong> — LLMs like GPT-4, LLaMA, and Mistral can by manipulated to generate restricted content, including misinformation, malware code, or harmful outputs.</li>



<li><strong>Resource Hijacking (ML DoS Attacks)</strong> — Open AI models can be exploited for free computation, leading to excessive costs for the host.</li>



<li><strong>Backdoor Injection and Model Poisoning</strong> — Adversaries could exploit unsecured model endpoints to introduce malicious payloads or load untrusted models remotely.</li>
</ul>



<p>This work investigates the prevalence and security posture of publicly accessible LLM servers, with a focus on instances utilizing the Ollama framework, which has gained popularity for its ease of use and local deployment capabilities. While Ollama enables flexible experimentation and local model execution, its deployment defaults and documentation do not explicitly emphasize security best practices, making it a compelling target for analysis.</p>



<p>To assess the real-world implications of these concerns, we leverage the Shodan search engine to identify exposed Ollama servers and evaluate their security configurations. Our investigation is guided by three primary contributions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Development of a proof-of-concept tool, written in Python, to detect exposed Ollama servers through Shodan queries</li>



<li>Analysis of identified instances evaluate authentication enforcement, endpoint exposure, and model accessibility</li>



<li>Recommendations for mitigating common vulnerabilities in LLM deployments, with a focus on practical security improvements</li>
</ul>



<p>Our findings reveal that a significant number of organizations and individuals expose their LLM infrastructure to the internet, often without realizing the implications. This creates avenues for misuse, ranging from resource exploitation to malicious prompt injection and data inference.</p>



<h2 id="h-methodology">Methodology</h2>



<p>The proposed system utilizes Shodan, a search engine that indexes internet-connected devices, to identify potentially vulnerable AI inference servers. This approach was selected with privacy and ethical considerations in mind, specifically to avoid the risks associated with directly scanning remote systems that may already be exposed or improperly secured. By relying on Shodan’s existing database of indexed endpoints, the system circumvents the need for active probing, thereby reducing the likelihood of triggering intrusion detection systems or violating acceptable use policies.</p>



<p>In addition to being more ethical, leveraging Shodan also provides a scalable and efficient mechanism for identifying LLM deployments accessible over the public internet. Manual enumeration or brute-force scanning of IP address ranges would be significantly more resource-intensive and potentially problematic from both legal and operational perspectives.</p>



<p>The system operates in two sequential stages. In the first stage, Shodan is queried to identify publicly accessible Ollama servers based on distinctive network signatures or banners. In the second stage, each identified endpoint is programmatically queried to assess its security posture, with a particular focus on authentication and authorization mechanisms. This includes evaluating whether endpoints require credentials, enforce access control, or expose model metadata and functionality without restriction.</p>



<p>An overview of the system architecture is illustrated in Figure 1, which outlines the workflow from endpoint discovery to vulnerability analysis.</p>

<p>Our approach focuses on identifying deployments of popular LLM hosting tools by scanning for default ports and service banners associated with each implementation. Below we provide a list of LLM platforms examined and their associated default ports, which are used as heuristics for identification:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ollama / Mistral / LLaMA models — Port 11434</li>



<li>vLLM — Port 8000</li>



<li>llama.cpp — Ports 8000, 8080</li>



<li>LM Studio — Port 1234</li>



<li>GPT4All — Port 4891</li>



<li>LangChain — Port 8000</li>
</ul>



<p>Using the Shodan API, the system retrieves metadata for hosts operating on these ports, including IP addresses, open ports, HTTP headers, and service banners. To minimize false positives, such as unrelated applications using the same ports, the developed system performs an additional filtering step based on banner content. For example, Ollama instances are verified using keyword matching against the service banner (e.g., port:11434 “Ollama”), which increases confidence that the endpoint is associated with the targeted LLM tooling rather than an unrelated application using the same port.</p>



<p>During analysis, we identified an additional signature that enhanced the accuracy of fingerprinting Ollama deployments. Specifically, a significant proportion of the discovered Ollama instances were found to be running the Uvicorn ASGI server, a lightweight, Python-based web server commonly employed for serving asynchronous APIs. In such cases, the HTTP response headers included the field Server: “uvicorn”, which functioned as a valuable secondary indicator, particularly when the service banner lacked an explicit reference to the Ollama platform. Conversely, our research also indicates that servers running Uvicorn are more likely to host LLM applications as this Python-based web server appears to be popular among software used for self-hosting LLMs.</p>



<p>This observation strengthens the resilience of our detection methodology by enabling the inference of Ollama deployments even in the absence of direct product identifiers. Given Uvicorn’s widespread use in Python-based microservice architectures and AI inference backends, its presence, especially when correlated with known Ollama-specific ports (e.g., 11434) substantially increases the confidence level that a host is serving an LLM-related application. A layered fingerprinting approach improves the precision of our system and reduces reliance on single-point identifiers that may be obfuscated or omitted.</p>



<p>The banner-based fingerprinting method draws from established principles in network reconnaissance and is a widely accepted approach in both academic research and penetration testing contexts. According to prior work in internet-wide scanning, service banners and default ports provide a reliable mechanism for characterizing software deployments at scale, albeit with limitations in environments employing obfuscation or non-standard configurations.</p>



<p>By combining port-based filtering with banner analysis and keyword validation, our system aims to strike a balance between recall and precision in identifying genuinely exposed LLM servers, thus enabling accurate and responsible vulnerability assessment.</p>

<p>Once a potentially vulnerable Ollama server is identified, we initiate a series of automated API queries to determine whether access controls are in place and whether the server responds deterministically to standardized test inputs. This evaluation specifically assesses the presence or absence of authentication enforcement and the model’s responsiveness to benign prompt injections, thereby providing insight into the system’s exposure to unauthorized use. To minimize operational risk and ensure ethical testing standards, we employ a minimal, non-invasive prompt structure as follows:</p>



<p>A successful HTTP 200 response accompanied by the correct result (e.g., “4”) indicates that the server is accepting and executing prompts without requiring authentication. This represents a high-severity security issue, as it suggests that arbitrary, unauthenticated prompt execution is possible. In such cases, the system is exposed to a broad range of attack vectors, including the deployment and execution of unauthorized models, prompt injection attacks, and the deletion or modification of existing assets.</p>



<p>Moreover, unprotected endpoints may be subjected to automated fuzzing or adversarial testing using tools such as Promptfoo or Garak, which are designed to probe LLMs for unexpected behavior or latent vulnerabilities. These tools, when directed at unsecured instances, can systematically uncover unsafe model responses, prompt leakage, or unintended completions that may compromise the integrity or confidentiality of the system.</p>



<p>Conversely, HTTP status codes 401 (Unauthorized) or 403 (Forbidden) denote that access controls are at least partially enforced, often through default authentication mechanisms. While such configurations do not guarantee full protection, particularly against brute-force or misconfiguration exploits, they substantially reduce the immediate risk of casual or opportunistic exploitation. Nonetheless, even authenticated instances require scrutiny to ensure proper isolation, rate limiting, and audit logging, as part of a comprehensive security posture.</p>



<h2 id="h-findings">Findings</h2>



<p>The results from our scans confirmed the initial hypothesis: a significant number of Ollama servers are publicly exposed and vulnerable to unauthorized prompt injection. Utilizing an automated scanning tool in conjunction with Shodan, we identified 1,139 vulnerable Ollama instances. Notably, the discovery rate was highest in the initial phase of scanning, with over 1,000 instances detected within the first 10 minutes, highlighting the widespread and largely unmitigated nature of this exposure.</p>



<p>Geospatial analysis of the identified servers revealed a concentration of vulnerabilities in several major regions. As depicted in Figure 3, the majority of exposed servers were hosted in the United States (36.6%), followed by China (22.5%) and Germany (8.9%). To protect the integrity and privacy of affected entities, IP addresses have been redacted in all visual documentation of the findings.</p>






<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1640" height="1062" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images-new/ciscoblogs/1/2025/09/tool_findings_exposed_llm_server.webp" alt="Tool findings on expose LLM Server analysis" data-old-src="//blogs.cisco.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images-new/ciscoblogs/1/2025/09/tool_findings_exposed_llm_server.webp"><figcaption>Fig. 3: Tool findings on exposed LLM Server Analysis</figcaption></figure></div>






<p>Out of the 1,139 exposed servers, 214 were found to be actively hosting and responding to requests with live models—accounting for approximately 18.8% of the total scanned population with Mistral and LLaMA representing the most frequently encountered deployments. A review of the least common model names was also conducted, revealing what appeared to be primarily self-trained or otherwise customized LLMs. In some instances, the names alone provided enough information to identify the hosting party. To safeguard their privacy, tha names of these models have been excluded from the findings. These interactions confirm the feasibility of prompt-based interaction without authentication, and thus the risk of exploitation.</p>



<p>Conversely, the remaining 80% of detected servers, while reachable via unauthenticated interfaces, did not have any models instantiated. These “dormant” servers, though not actively serving model responses, remain susceptible to exploitation via unauthorized model uploads or configuration manipulation. Importantly, their exposed interfaces could still be leveraged in attacks involving resource exhaustion, denial of service, or lateral movement.</p>



<p>An additional observation was the widespread adoption of OpenAI-compatible API schemas across disparate model hosting platforms. Among the discovered endpoints, 88.89% adhered to the standardized route structure used by OpenAI (e.g., v1/chat/completions), enabling simplified interoperability but also creating uniformity that could be exploited by automated attack frameworks. This API-level homogeneity facilitates the rapid development and deployment of malicious tooling capable of interacting with multiple LLM providers with minimal modification.</p>



<p>These findings showcase a critical and systemic vulnerability in the deployment of LLM infrastructure. The ease with which these servers can be located, fingerprinted, and interacted with raises urgent concerns regarding operational security, access control defaults, and the potential for widespread misuse in the absence of robust authentication and model access restrictions.</p>



<h2 id="h-limitations">Limitations</h2>



<p>While the proposed system effectively identified a substantial number of exposed Ollama servers, several limitations should be acknowledged that may impact the completeness and accuracy of the results.</p>



<p>First, the detection process is inherently limited by Shodan’s scanning coverage and indexing frequency. Only servers already discovered and cataloged by Shodan can be analyzed, meaning any hosts outside its visibility, due to firewalls, opt-out policies, or geographical constraints remain undetected.</p>



<p>Secondly, the system relies on Shodan’s fingerprinting accuracy. If Ollama instances are configured with custom headers, reverse proxies, or stripped HTTP metadata, they may not be correctly classified by Shodan, leading to potential false negatives.</p>



<p>Third, the approach targets default and commonly used ports (e.g., 11434), which introduces a bias toward standard configurations. Servers running on non-standard or intentionally obfuscated ports are likely to evade detection entirely.</p>



<p>Finally, the analysis focuses exclusively on Ollama deployments and does not extend to other LLM hosting frameworks. While this specialization enhances precision within a narrow scope, it limits generalizability across the broader LLM infrastructure landscape.</p>



<h2 id="h-mitigation-strategies">Mitigation Strategies</h2>



<p>The widespread exposure of unauthenticated Ollama servers highlights the urgent need for standardized, practical, and layered mitigation strategies aimed at securing LLM infrastructure. Below, we propose a set of technical and procedural defenses, grounded in best practices and supported by existing tools and frameworks.</p>



<h3 id="h-enforce-authentication-and-access-control">Enforce Authentication and Access Control</h3>



<p>The most critical step in mitigating unauthorized access is the implementation of robust authentication mechanisms. Ollama instances, and LLM servers in general, should never be publicly exposed without requiring secure API key-based or token-based authentication. Preferably, authentication should be tied to role-based access control (RBAC) systems to limit the scope of what users can do once authenticated.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Enforce API key or <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OAuth2-based authentication</a></li>



<li><strong>Tools/References:</strong> OAuth 2.0 Framework <a href="https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0x11-t10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OWASP API Security Top 10</a></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-network-segmentation-and-firewalling">Network Segmentation and Firewalling</h3>



<p>Publicly exposing inference endpoints over the internet, particularly on default ports, dramatically increases the likelihood of being indexed by services like Shodan. LLM endpoints should be deployed behind network-level access controls, such as firewalls, VPCs, or reverse proxies, and restricted to trusted IP ranges or VPNs.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Use security groups, firewalls, and private subnets to isolate LLM services</li>



<li><strong>Tools/References:</strong> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/whitepapers/latest/aws-security-best-practices/aws-security-best-practices.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AWS Security Best Practices</a>, <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/207/final">Zero Trust Architecture</a></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-rate-limiting-and-abuse-detection">Rate Limiting and Abuse Detection</h3>



<p>To prevent automated abuse and model probing, inference endpoints should implement rate limiting, throttling, and logging mechanisms. This can hinder brute-force attacks, prompt injection attempts, or resource hijacking.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Integrate API gateways (e.g., Kong, Amazon API Gateway) to enforce limits and monitor anomalous behavior</li>



<li><strong>Tools/References:</strong> OWASP <a href="https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2019/en/0xa4-lack-of-resources-and-rate-limiting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rate Limiting Guide</a>, <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana for Monitoring</a></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-disable-default-ports-and-obfuscate-service-banners">Disable Default Ports and Obfuscate Service Banners</h3>



<p>Default ports (e.g., 11434 for Ollama) make fingerprinting trivial. To complicate scanning efforts, operators should consider changing default ports and disabling verbose service banners in HTTP responses or headers (e.g., removing “uvicorn” or “Ollama” identifiers).</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Modify default configurations to suppress identifiable metadata</li>



<li><strong>Tools/References:</strong> Nginx <a href="https://docs.nginx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reverse proxy configuration</a>, <a href="https://systemd.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">systemd hardening</a></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-secure-model-upload-and-execution-pipelines">Secure Model Upload and Execution Pipelines</h3>



<p>Ollama and similar tools support dynamic model uploads, which, if unsecured, present a vector for model poisoning or backdoor injection. Model upload functionality should be restricted, authenticated, and ideally audited. All models should be validated against a hash or verified origin before execution.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Use content whitelisting, digital signatures, or harsh verification for uploaded models</li>



<li><strong>Tools/References:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/model-card-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Model Card Toolkit</a>, <a href="https://slsa.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Secure Supply Chain principles</a> from SLSA</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-continuous-monitoring-and-automated-exposure-audits">Continuous Monitoring and Automated Exposure Audits</h3>



<p>Operators should implement continuous monitoring tools that alert when LLM endpoints become publicly accessible, misconfigured, or lack authentication. Scheduled Shodan queries or custom scanners can help detect regressions in deployment security.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Use automated tools like Project Discovery’s naabu, or write custom Shodan monitoring scripts</li>



<li><strong>Tools/References:</strong> <a href="https://projectdiscovery.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Discovery Tools</a>, <a href="https://developer.shodan.io/api/alert" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shodan Alert API</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>This study reveals a concerning landscape of insecure large language model deployments, with a particular focus on Ollama-based servers exposed to the public internet. Through the use of Shodan and a purpose-built detection tool, we identified over 1,100 unauthenticated LLM servers, a substantial proportion of which were actively hosting vulnerable models. These findings highlight a widespread neglect of fundamental security practices such as access control, authentication, and network isolation in the deployment of AI systems.</p>



<p>The uniform adoption of OpenAI-compatible APIs further exacerbates the issue, enabling attackers to scale exploit attempts across platforms with minimal adaptation. While only a subset of the exposed servers were found to be actively serving models, the broader risk posed by dormant yet accessible endpoints cannot be understated. Such infrastructure remains vulnerable to abuse through unauthorized model execution, prompt injection, and resource hijacking. Our work underscores the urgent need for standardized security baselines, automated auditing tools, and improved deployment guidance for LLM infrastructure.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, future work should explore the integration of multiple data sources, including Censys, ZoomEye, and custom Nmap-based scanners to improve discovery accuracy and reduce dependency on a single platform. Additionally, incorporating adaptive fingerprinting and active probing techniques could enhance detection capabilities in cases where servers use obfuscation or non-standard configurations. Expanding the system to identify deployments across a wider range of LLM hosting frameworks, such as Hugging Face, Triton, and vLLM, would further increase coverage and relevance. Finally, non-standard port detection and adversarial prompt analysis offer promising avenues for refining the system’s ability to detect and characterize hidden or evasive LLM deployments in real-world environments.</p>

    <p>Some memory corruption bugs are much harder to exploit than others. They can involve race conditions, crash the system, and impose limitations that make a researcher's life difficult. Working with such fragile vulnerabilities demands significant time and effort. CVE-2024-50264 in the Linux kernel is one such hard bug, which received the Pwnie Award 2025 as the Best Privilege Escalation. In this article, I introduce my personal project <a href="https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/kernel-hack-drill">kernel-hack-drill</a> and show how it helped me to exploit CVE-2024-50264.</p>

<h2 id="bug-collision-story">Bug collision story</h2>

<p>I first found a bug in <code>AF_VSOCK</code> back in 2021 and published the article <a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2021/02/09/CVE-2021-26708.html">Four Bytes of Power: Exploiting CVE-2021-26708 in the Linux kernel</a>. In April 2024, I was fuzzing this kernel subsystem with a customized syzkaller and found another crash in <code>AF_VSOCK</code>. I minimized the crash reproducer and disabled KASAN. This resulted in an immediate null-ptr-deref in a kernel worker (<code>kworker</code>). Convinced the path forward would be painful, I shelved the bug. This was a wrong decision.</p>

<p>Later, in autumn 2024, I decided to look at this bug again and got promising results. Then, one calm evening, I realized I'd collided with Hyunwoo Kim (<a href="https://x.com/v4bel">@v4bel</a>) and Wongi Lee (<a href="https://x.com/_qwerty_po">@qwerty</a>): they'd already disclosed the bug as CVE-2024-50264 and used it at kernelCTF. <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/net/vmw_vsock?id=6ca575374dd9a507cdd16dfa0e78c2e9e20bd05f">Their patch</a> turned my PoC exploit into a null-ptr-deref:</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/vsock_patch.png" width="90%"></center>


<p>Anyone who has dealt with a bug collision can imagine what I felt. I was wondering whether to keep digging into this vulnerability or just give it up.</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/Vityaz.jpg" width="80%"><br>Viktor Vasnetsov: Vityaz at the Crossroads (1882)</center>


<p>The <a href="https://github.com/google/security-research/pull/145/files">exploit strategy</a> by @v4bel and @qwerty looked very complicated. I had other ideas, so I decided to continue my research. I chose Ubuntu Server 24.04 with a fresh OEM/HWE kernel (v6.11) as the target for my PoC exploit.</p>

<h2 id="cve-2024-50264-analysis">CVE-2024-50264 analysis</h2>

<p>The vulnerability <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50264">CVE-2024-50264</a> was introduced in August 2016 by commit <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/net/vmw_vsock?id=06a8fc78367d070720af960dcecec917d3ae5f3b">06a8fc78367d</a> in Linux v4.8. It is a race condition in <code>AF_VSOCK</code> sockets that happens between the <code>connect()</code> system call and a POSIX signals, resulting in a use-after-free (UAF). An unprivileged user can trigger this bug without user namespaces, which makes it more dangerous.</p>

<p>The kernel uses a freed <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> object. Its size is 80 bytes, which is suitable for the <code>kmalloc-96</code> slab cache. The memory corruption is a UAF write executed by a kernel worker.</p>

<p>However, this vulnerability also brings a bunch of nasty limitations for exploitation. I can say that <strong>it's the worst bug to exploit I've ever seen</strong>. The Pwnie Award is well-deserved. I'll outline those constraints shortly.</p>

<h2 id="reproducing-the-bug-using-an-immortal-signal">Reproducing the bug using an "immortal signal"</h2>

<p>First, an attacker should create a listening virtual socket (server vsock):</p>
<div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>ret</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>int</span> <span>vsock1</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

<span>vsock1</span> <span>=</span> <span>socket</span><span>(</span><span>AF_VSOCK</span><span>,</span> <span>SOCK_STREAM</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>vsock1</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
	<span>err_exit</span><span>(</span><span>"[-] creating vsock"</span><span>);</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>ret</span> <span>!=</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
	<span>err_exit</span><span>(</span><span>"[-] binding vsock"</span><span>);</span>

<span>ret</span> <span>=</span> <span>listen</span><span>(</span><span>vsock1</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span> <span>/* backlog = 0 */</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>ret</span> <span>!=</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
	<span>err_exit</span><span>(</span><span>"[-] listening vsock"</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then the attacker should try to open a connection from a client vsock:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>#define UAF_PORT 0x2712
</span>
<span>int</span> <span>vsock2</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

	<span>.</span><span>svm_cid</span> <span>=</span> <span>VMADDR_CID_LOCAL</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>vsock2</span> <span>=</span> <span>socket</span><span>(</span><span>AF_VSOCK</span><span>,</span> <span>SOCK_STREAM</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>vsock2</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
	<span>err_exit</span><span>(</span><span>"[-] creating vsock"</span><span>);</span>

<span>ret</span> <span>=</span> <span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>vsock2</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>struct</span> <span>sockaddr</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>&amp;</span><span>addr</span><span>,</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>struct</span> <span>sockaddr_vm</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>To trigger the bug, the attacker should interrupt this <code>connect()</code> system call with a POSIX signal. @v4bel &amp; @qwerty used <code>SIGKILL</code>, but that kills the exploit process. My fuzzer stumbled on a cleaner trick that surprised me:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>sigevent</span> <span>sev</span> <span>=</span> <span>{};</span>
<span>timer_t</span> <span>race_timer</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

<span>sev</span><span>.</span><span>sigev_notify</span> <span>=</span> <span>SIGEV_SIGNAL</span><span>;</span>
<span>sev</span><span>.</span><span>sigev_signo</span> <span>=</span> <span>33</span><span>;</span>
<span>ret</span> <span>=</span> <span>timer_create</span><span>(</span><span>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>sev</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>race_timer</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>My fuzzer discovered that a timer can fire signal 33 and interrupt <code>connect()</code>. Signal 33 is special. The Native POSIX Threads Library (NPTL) keeps it for internal work and the operating system quietly shields applications from it. As <code>man 7 nptl</code> explains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NPTL makes internal use of the first two real-time signals (signal numbers 32 and 33).
One of these signals is used to support thread cancellation and POSIX timers (see <code>timer_create(2)</code>);
the other is used as part of a mechanism that ensures all threads in a process always have
the same UIDs and GIDs, as required by POSIX. These signals cannot be used in applications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>True, these signals cannot be used in applications, but they are perfect for my exploit 😉</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/secret.jpeg" width="50%"></center>


<p>I use <code>timer_settime()</code> for <code>race_timer</code>, which lets me choose the exact moment signal 33 interrupts <code>connect()</code>. Moreover, the signal is invisible to the exploit process and doesn't kill it.</p>

<h2 id="about-memory-corruption">About memory corruption</h2>

<p>The race condition succeeds when a signal interrupts the <code>connect()</code> system call while the vulnerable socket is in the <code>TCP_ESTABLISHED</code> state. The socket then <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.11.7/source/net/vmw_vsock/af_vsock.c#L1475">drops into</a> the <code>TCP_CLOSING</code> state:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>signal_pending</span><span>(</span><span>current</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>

	<span>goto</span> <span>out_wait</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The second attempt to connect the vulnerable vsock to the server vsock using a different <code>svm_cid</code> (<code>VMADDR_CID_HYPERVISOR</code>) provokes memory corruption.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>sockaddr_vm</span> <span>addr</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>.</span><span>svm_family</span> <span>=</span> <span>AF_VSOCK</span><span>,</span>

	<span>.</span><span>svm_cid</span> <span>=</span> <span>VMADDR_CID_HYPERVISOR</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>/* this connect will schedule the kernel worker performing UAF */</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Under the hood, the <code>connect()</code> system call <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.11.7/source/net/vmw_vsock/af_vsock.c#L439">executes</a> <code>vsock_assign_transport()</code>. This function switches the virtual socket to the new <code>svm_cid</code> transport and frees the resources tied to the previous vsock transport:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>vsk</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>transport</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<h2 id="not-so-fast-cve-2024-50264-has-limitations">Not so fast. CVE-2024-50264 has limitations</h2>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, this vulnerability has a lot of nasty limitations for the exploitation:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The vulnerable <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> client object is allocated together with the server object from the same slab cache. That disturbs cross-cache attacks.</li>
  <li>Reproducing this race condition is very unstable.</li>
  <li>The UAF write occurs in a kworker a few microseconds after <code>kfree()</code>, too quickly for typical cross-cache attacks.</li>
  <li>A null-ptr-deref in the kworker follows the UAF write. That's why I shelved the bug at first.</li>
  <li>Even if that kernel oops is avoided, another null-ptr-deref occurs in the kworker after <code>VSOCK_CLOSE_TIMEOUT</code> (eight seconds).</li>
  <li>The kworker hangs in <code>spin_lock_bh()</code> if <code>virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock</code> is not zero, as noted above.</li>
</ol>

<p>I uncovered each obstacle one by one while developing the PoC exploit for CVE-2024-50264. It remains the worst bug to exploit I've ever seen. I guess that's why it received the Pwnie Award 2025 as the Best Privilege Escalation.</p>

<h2 id="first-thoughts-on-exploit-strategy">First thoughts on exploit strategy</h2>

<p>The exploit strategy by @v4bel and @qwerty was complex:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A large-scale BPF JIT spray that filled a significant portion of physical memory</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://github.com/IAIK/SLUBStick">SLUBStick technique</a> from Graz University of Technology, which allowed to:
    <ul>
      <li>Determine the number of objects in the active slab using a timing side channel</li>
      <li>Then, place the client and server <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> objects in different slabs, landing one at the end of its slab and the other at the start of the next slab</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250226150503/https://yanglingxi1993.github.io/dirty_pagetable/dirty_pagetable.html">Dirty Pagetable</a> technique, which allowed to use the UAF object for overwriting a page table entry (PTE)</li>
  <li>Modifying a PTE to make it possibly point to a BPF JIT region</li>

  <li>Communicating via a socket to execute the privilege-escalation payload.</li>

<p>I felt I could make the PoC exploit for CVE-2024-50264 much simpler. My first thought was to steer the UAF write into some victim object and build a useful exploit primitive around it.</p>

<p>I decided not to search victim objects inside the <code>kmalloc-96</code> slab cache. Ubuntu Server 24.04 ships with <code>kconfig</code> options that neutralize naive heap spraying for UAF exploitation:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>CONFIG_SLAB_BUCKETS=y</code>, which creates a set of separate slab caches for allocations with user-controlled data</li>
  <li><code>CONFIG_RANDOM_KMALLOC_CACHES=y</code>. Here's a quote from the kernel documentation about it:
    <blockquote>
      <p>It is a hardening feature that creates multiple copies of slab caches for normal kmalloc allocation and makes kmalloc randomly pick one based on code address, which makes the attackers more difficult to spray vulnerable memory objects on the heap for the purpose of exploiting memory vulnerabilities.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>That's why I decided to perform the cross-cache attack anyway.</p>

<p>The first victim object I decided to try was <code>struct cred</code>. Its size is 184 bytes, and the kernel allocates these objects in slabs of size 192 bytes. That would allow only two possible offsets of the UAF in the victim <code>cred</code>, because slabs for the vulnerable <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> have size 96 bytes (half of 192). The diagram below shows how two vulnerable <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> objects overlap the <code>cred</code> object. The memory corruption may happen on one of the <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> objects.</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf_write_cred2.png" width="80%"></center>


<p>Unfortunately, <code>struct cred</code> reallocated at the place of the freed <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> objects doesn't provide anything useful for the attacker:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the UAF happened on the first <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code>, the kernel would hang in <code>spin_lock_bh()</code>, because <code>cred</code> has a non-null <code>uid</code> value at the place of <code>virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock</code>.</li>
  <li>If the UAF happened on the second <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code>, writing controlled data to <code>virtio_vsock_sock.peer_buf_alloc</code> would corrupt the <code>cred.request_key_auth</code> pointer. I had no idea how to use it without a prior infoleak.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>cred</code> object didn't work for me, so I started to search for the next candidate. My next victim object for the memory corruption was <code>msg_msg</code>. I like this object: I first used it for heap spraying in 2021 (you can find the details in the article <a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2021/02/09/CVE-2021-26708.html">"Four Bytes of Power: Exploiting CVE-2021-26708 in the Linux kernel"</a>).</p>

<p>It was a novel approach back then. This time, I set out to create something new again.</p>

<p>I chose a 96-byte <code>msg_msg</code> because the slab allocator would use slabs of the same size for this <code>msg_msg</code> and <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code>. That would allow the UAF write to land at a fixed offset in the victim <code>msg_msg</code> object. The following diagram shows what happens with the <code>msg_msg</code> object allocated at the place of the freed <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code>:</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf_write_msg_msg.png" width="90%"></center>


<p>The <code>msg_msg.m_list.prev</code> is the kernelspace pointer to the previous object in the linked list. This pointer is zero when <code>msg_msg</code> is created (see <code>CONFIG_INIT_ON_ALLOC_DEFAULT_ON</code>) and then it is initialized with a non-null value when <code>msg_msg</code> <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.15.5/source/ipc/msg.c#L941">is inserted</a> into the message queue. Unfortunately, this non-null pointer is interpreted as <code>virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock</code>. That makes the <code>virtio_transport_space_update()</code> function hang while executing <code>spin_lock_bh()</code>.</p>

<p>To bypass this restriction, I needed the kernel to initialize <code>msg_msg.m_list.prev</code> after the UAF write. I looked for a way to postpone placing <code>msg_msg</code> in the message queue and eventually found the solution.</p>

<h2 id="msg_msg-spray-allowing-m_list-field-corruption-novel-technique">msg_msg spray allowing m_list field corruption (novel technique)</h2>

<ol>
  <li>I filled the message queue almost completely before sending the target <code>msg_msg</code>.
    <ul>
      <li>The message queue size is <code>MSGMNB=16384</code> bytes.</li>
      <li>I sent 2 clogging messages of 8191 bytes each without calling the <code>msgrcv()</code> syscall.</li>
      <li>Only 2 bytes were left in the queue.</li>
      <li>I used <code>mtype = 1</code> for these messages.</li>

  <li>Then I performed spraying by calling <code>msgsnd()</code> for the target <code>msg_msg</code> objects.
    <ul>
      <li>I called the <code>msgsnd()</code> syscall in separate pthreads and used <code>mtype = 2</code> for these messages to distinguish them from the clogging messages.</li>

<p>Cool! This technique is also useful for blind overwriting of <code>msg_msg</code> using the out-of-bounds write. No kernel infoleak is needed. The kernel restores the corrupted <code>m_list</code> pointers. In my particular case, this approach allowed me to avoid <code>virtio_transport_space_update()</code> hanging in <code>spin_lock_bh()</code>:</p>

<p>To implement the UAF write into an <code>msg_msg</code> object, I needed to perform cross-cache attack turning <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> into <code>msg_msg</code>. On Ubuntu Server 24.04, the <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> objects live in one of 16 <code>kmalloc-rnd-?-96</code> slab caches enabled by <code>CONFIG_RANDOM_KMALLOC_CACHES</code>. The <code>msg_msg</code> objects live in a dedicated <code>msg_msg-96</code> slab cache enabled by <code>CONFIG_SLAB_BUCKETS</code>.</p>

<p>To implement the cross-cache attack, I needed to learn how these attacks work on the latest Ubuntu kernel, but testing exploit primitives together with this crazy race condition was really painful. Then, I got an idea:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If an unstable race condition creates problems, let's use a testing ground for developing the exploit primitives!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Back in 2017, I created a pet project for my students called <a href="https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/kernel-hack-drill">kernel-hack-drill</a>. It provides a test environment for learning and experimenting with Linux kernel exploits. I remembered it and decided to use <code>kernel-hack-drill</code> to develop the exploit primitives for CVE-2024-50264.</p>

<p>Fun fact: when I chose the name <code>kernel-hack-drill</code> for this project, I used the word <code>drill</code> to mean <code>training</code> or <code>workout</code> for Linux kernel security. My friends and students read it differently. They thought I meant something like this:</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/drill_tux.jpg" width="60%"></center>


<p>The <code>kernel-hack-drill</code> project is a bit similar to <a href="https://github.com/hacktivesec/KRWX">KRWX</a>, but much simpler. Moreover, it ships with ready-made PoC exploits:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>drill_uaf_callback.c</code>: a UAF exploit that invokes a callback inside a freed <code>drill_item_t</code> structure. It hijacks control flow and gains LPE.</li>
  <li><code>drill_uaf_w_msg_msg.c</code>: a UAF exploit that writes into a freed <code>drill_item_t</code>. It uses a cross-cache attack and overwrites <code>msg_msg.m_ts</code> enabling out-of-bounds reading of the kernel memory. I wrote this PoC while working on the bug described in this article.</li>
  <li><code>drill_uaf_w_pipe_buffer.c</code>: a UAF exploit that writes into a freed <code>drill_item_t</code>. It performs a cross-cache attack and overwrites <code>pipe_buffer.flags</code> to implement the Dirty Pipe technique and gain LPE. This PoC exploit was also developed during my experiments with CVE-2024-50264.</li>
</ul>

<p>Recent contributions added new variants (kudos to the contributors!):</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>drill_uaf_callback_rop_smep.c</code>: an improved version of <code>drill_uaf_callback.c</code> that adds a ROP chain to bypass SMEP on <code>x86_64</code>.</li>
  <li><code>drill_uaf_w_pte.c</code>: a UAF exploit that writes to a freed <code>drill_item_t</code>. It performs a cross-allocator attack and overwrites a page table entry (PTE) to implement the Dirty Pagetable technique and gain LPE on <code>x86_64</code>.</li>
  <li><code>drill_uaf_w_pud.c</code>: an improved version of <code>__drill_uaf_w_pte.c__</code> that overwrites a page upper directory (PUD) instead of a PTE and implements the Dirty Pagetable attack via huge pages.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I revisited <code>kernel-hack-drill</code> during my CVE-2024-50264 work, this spare-time project hadn't seen an update in years. But now <code>kernel-hack-drill</code> offers a solid set of resources that Linux kernel security researchers can explore.</p>

<h2 id="experimenting-with-cross-cache-attack-using-kernel-hack-drill">Experimenting with cross-cache attack using kernel-hack-drill</h2>

<p>My first step was to learn how cross-cache attacks behave on the latest Ubuntu kernel with slab allocator hardening turned on.</p>

<p>I implemented a standard cross-cache attack in <code>drill_uaf_w_msg_msg.c</code>. You can see <a href="https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/kernel-hack-drill/blob/e3a105cde99912c89c2c1470a29101eb0d9c2d56/drill_uaf_w_msg_msg.c">the full code in the repository</a>, so I'll sketch the flow here. For background, I highly recommend <a href="https://xairy.io/about">Andrey Konovalov</a>'s talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hYzxsWeNcE">SLUB Internals for Exploit Developers</a>.</p>

<p>To plan the attack, I pulled the needed info from <code>/sys/kernel/slab</code>. The slab caches that hold <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> (80 bytes) or <code>drill_item_t</code> (95 bytes) each keep 120 slabs in per-CPU partial lists (<code>cpu_partial=120</code>) and 42 objects in each slab (<code>objs_per_slab=42</code>).</p>

<p>The cross-cache attack algorithm:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Allocate <code>objs_per_slab</code> objects to create a fresh active slab. Active slab is the slab that will be used by the kernel for the next allocation.</li>
  <li>Allocate <code>objs_per_slab * cpu_partial</code> objects. This creates the <code>cpu_partial</code> number of full slabs that will later populate the partial list at step 6.</li>
  <li>Create a slab that contains the UAF object. Allocate <code>objs_per_slab</code> objects and keep a dangling reference to the vulnerable object in that slab.</li>
  <li>Create a new active slab again: allocate <code>objs_per_slab</code> objects. This step is <strong>very important</strong> for keeping the cross-cache attack stable. Otherwise, the slab with the vulnerable object remains active and cannot be reclaimed by the page allocator.</li>
  <li>Completely free the slab that holds the UAF object. To do that, free <code>(objs_per_slab * 2 - 1)</code> of the objects allocated just before the last one. The active slab now contains only the last object, and the slab with the UAF object becomes free and moves to the partial list.</li>
  <li>Fill up the partial list: free one of each <code>objs_per_slab</code> objects in the reserved slabs from step 2. That makes the slab allocator clean up the partial list and move the free slab containing the UAF object to the page allocator.</li>
  <li>Reclaim the page that contained the UAF object for another slab cache: spray the target <code>msg_msg</code> objects. As a result, one <code>msg_msg</code> is allocated where the vulnerable object (<code>drill_item_t</code> in my case) used to be.</li>
  <li>Exploit the UAF! Overwrite <code>msg_msg.m_ts</code> to read kernel memory out of bounds.</li>
</ol>

<p>I've seen plenty of publications that cover cross-cache attack, but none of them explain how to debug it. I'll fill that gap.</p>

<p>Let's examine the <a href="https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/kernel-hack-drill/blob/e3a105cde99912c89c2c1470a29101eb0d9c2d56/drill_uaf_w_msg_msg.c">attack</a> in <code>drill_uaf_w_msg_msg.c</code>. To watch it in action and debug it, make the following tweaks in your kernel sources:</p>

<p>In <code>__put_partials()</code> I print the address of the slab that returns to the page allocator when <code>discard_slab()</code> runs. In <code>alloc_msg()</code> I print the kernel address of each newly allocated <code>msg_msg</code> object.</p>

<p>When the cross-cache attack succeeds, the slab that held <code>drill_item_t</code> objects is handed back to the page allocator and then reused for <code>msg_msg</code> objects. Running the PoC exploit <code>drill_uaf_w_msg_msg</code> makes this visible, as we observe:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the kernel log:
    <div><pre><code>[   32.719582] drill: kmalloc'ed item 5123 (0xffff88800c960660, size 95)

  </li>
  <li>Then in GDB (using with <a href="https://github.com/bata24/gef">bata24/gef</a>):
    <div><pre><code>gef&gt; slab-contains 0xffff88800c960660

<p>We see the <code>drill_item_t</code> object <code>0xffff88800c960660</code> in slab <code>0xffffea0000325800</code> reallocated as <code>msg_msg</code>, which confirms that the cross-cache attack worked.</p>

<p>After experimenting with <code>kernel-hack-drill</code> on Ubuntu Server 24.04, I found that <code>CONFIG_RANDOM_KMALLOC_CACHES</code> and <code>CONFIG_SLAB_BUCKETS</code> block naive UAF exploitation, yet they also make cross-cache attacks absolutely stable. So, in my humble opinion:</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/slab_hardening.jpg" width="60%"></center>


<p>It seems that, without a mitigation such as <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230915105933.495735-15-matteorizzo@google.com/">SLAB_VIRTUAL</a>, the Linux kernel remains wide-open to cross-cache attacks.</p>

<h2 id="adapting-the-cross-cache-attack-to-cve-2024-50264">Adapting the cross-cache attack to CVE-2024-50264</h2>

<p>As noted in the limitations, the vulnerable <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> client object is allocated together with the server object (<strong>Limitation #1</strong>). That hurts the exploit for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>On one hand, leaving the server vsock open stops the slab that holds the UAF object from being freed, which kills the cross-cache attack.</li>
  <li>On the other hand, closing the server vsock disturbs the UAF itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>How to deal with it? @v4bel and @qwerty used the <a href="https://github.com/IAIK/SLUBStick">SLUBStick</a> timing side channel to spot when the allocator switched to a new active slab. I went another way:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What if I hit the <code>connect()</code> syscall with a signal <strong>almost immediately</strong>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, I used <strong>one more race condition</strong> to exploit the main race condition – and it worked:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I sent the "immortal" signal 33 to the vulnerable <code>connect()</code> syscall after a 10000 ns timeout, far earlier than the delay needed to trigger the UAF.</li>
  <li>Then I verified the early race condition:
    <ol>
      <li>The <code>connect()</code> syscall must return "Interrupted system call"</li>
      <li>Another testing client vsock should still connect to the server vsock without trouble</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I discovered that when both checks passed, only a single vulnerable <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> for the client vsock was created. The interrupting signal arrived before the kernel could create the second <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> for the server vsock. This bypassed <strong>Limitation #1</strong> (paired-object creation). After that, I sent signal 33 again – this time after the normal timeout – to interrupt the vulnerable <code>connect()</code> a second time and provoke the UAF. The cross-cache attack against <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> was unlocked!</p>

<p>Looping this early race and checking its result was quick. Once the early race succeeded, the main race that triggers the UAF became more stable; I could now hit the UAF about once per second instead of once every several minutes, solving the instability noted in <strong>Limitation #2</strong>. My race condition "speedrun" also eased <strong>Limitation #5</strong>: I managed roughly five UAF writes before the kworker hit a null-ptr-deref at <code>VSOCK_CLOSE_TIMEOUT</code> (8 seconds).</p>

<p>To address <strong>Limitation #4</strong> (the immediate null-ptr-deref in the kworker after UAF), I tried one more race condition, similarly to @v4bel and @qwerty. Right after the UAF-triggering <code>connect()</code>, I called <code>listen()</code> on the vulnerable vsock. If <code>listen()</code> ran before the kworker, it changed the vsock state to <code>TCP_LISTEN</code>, preventing the crash. Unfortunately, this step remains the most unstable part of the whole exploit; the rest is far more stable.</p>

<p>At that point my list of CVE-2024-50264 limitations looked like this:</p>
<ol>
  <li><del>The vulnerable <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> client object is allocated together with the server object from the same slab cache. That disturbs cross-cache attacks.</del></li>
  <li><del>Reproducing this race condition is very unstable.</del></li>
  <li><strong>The UAF write occurs in a kworker a few microseconds after <code>kfree()</code>, too quickly for typical cross-cache attacks.</strong></li>
  <li><del>A null-ptr-deref in the kworker follows the UAF write. That's why I shelved the bug at first.</del></li>
  <li><del>Even if that kernel oops is avoided, another null-ptr-deref occurs in the kworker after <code>VSOCK_CLOSE_TIMEOUT</code> (eight seconds).</del></li>
  <li><strong>The kworker hangs in <code>spin_lock_bh()</code> if <code>virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock</code> is not zero.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>With the early-signal trick in place, only two limitations were still blocking my exploit.</p>

<h2 id="oh-so-slow-the-cross-cache-attack-shows-up-late-to-the-party">Oh so slow! The cross-cache attack shows up late to the party</h2>

<p>As noted in <strong>Limitation #3</strong>, the UAF write in the kworker fires only a few μs after <code>kfree()</code> for the <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code>. A cross-cache attack needs much more time, so the UAF write lands on the original <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> and never reaches the <code>msg_msg</code>.</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf_and_cross_cache.jpeg" width="50%"></center>


<p>I didn't know how to make cross-cache procedure faster, but I knew how to slow down the attacked kernel code instead. That approach is described in Jann Horn's article <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2022/03/racing-against-clock-hitting-tiny.html">Racing against the clock</a>. It allowed to make my kworker slower than a sluggish cross-cache attack.</p>

<p>The main idea is to hammer the kworker with a <code>timerfd</code> watched by a huge pile of <code>epoll</code> instances. Here is the short recipe (see <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2022/03/racing-against-clock-hitting-tiny.html">Jann's article</a> for full detail):</p>
<ol>
  <li>Call <code>timerfd_create(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, 0)</code>.</li>
  <li>Create 8 forks.</li>
  <li>In each fork, call <code>dup()</code> for the <code>timerfd</code> 100 times.</li>
  <li>In each fork, call <code>epoll_create()</code> 500 times.</li>
  <li>For every <code>epoll</code> instance, use <code>epoll_ctl()</code> to add all duplicated file descriptors to the interest list – each <code>epoll</code> instance now monitors all available <code>timerfd</code> copies.</li>
  <li>Finally, arm the <code>timerfd</code> so the interrupt hits the kworker at just the right moment:
    <div><pre><code><span>timerfd_settime</span><span>(</span><span>timerfd</span><span>,</span> <span>TFD_TIMER_CANCEL_ON_SET</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>retard_tmo</span><span>,</span> <span>NULL</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This procedure made my race-condition window around 80 times longer.</p>

<p>I wanted some more time to complete the cross-cache attack with a guarantee, but ran into a limit not mentioned in the original write-up. If you exceed the limit in <code>/proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_watches</code>, <code>epoll_ctl()</code> fails. From <code>man 7 epoll</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This specifies a limit on the total number of file descriptors that a user can register across all epoll instances on the system. The limit is per real user ID. Each registered file descriptor costs roughly 90 bytes on a 32-bit kernel, and roughly 160 bytes on a 64-bit kernel. Currently, the default value for max_user_watches is 1/25 (4%) of the available low memory, divided by the registration cost in bytes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On Ubuntu Server 24.04 with 2 GiB of RAM, <code>/proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_watches</code> is 431838, which is not huge. I could afford 8 forks × 500 <code>epoll</code> instances × 100 duplicated file descriptors, for a total of 400000 <code>epoll</code> watches.</p>

<p>That was just enough to beat <strong>Limitation #3</strong>, and I finally got <code>msg_msg</code> data size corruption: the vsock UAF changed <code>msg_msg.m_ts</code> from 48 bytes to 8192 (<code>MSGMAX</code>). Now I could do out-of-bounds reading of the kernel memory using the <code>msgrcv()</code> syscall.</p>

<h2 id="sorting-the-loot">Sorting the loot</h2>

<p>The corrupted <code>msg_msg</code> allowed me to read 8 KiB of data from the kernelspace.  I sorted this loot and found a promising infoleak: a kernel address <code>0xffffffff8233cfa0</code> [1]. This infoleak was quite stable and worked with high probability, so I decided to investigate it without doing any additional heap feng shui. GDB showed that it was a pointer to the <code>socket_file_ops()</code> kernel function. I was excited to discover that this function pointer is part of <code>struct file</code>, because the <code>file</code> kernel object also contains the <code>f_cred</code> pointer [2], which leaked as well.</p>

<p>Here's how I examined the memory leaked by <code>msg_msg</code> at <code>0xffff88800e75d600</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code>gef&gt; p *((struct file *)(0xffff88800e75d600 + 96*26 + 64))
$61 = {
  f_count = {
    counter = 0x0
  },
  f_lock = {
    {
      rlock = {
        raw_lock = {
          {
            val = {
              counter = 0x0
            },
            {
              locked = 0x0,
              pending = 0x0
            },
            {
              locked_pending = 0x0,
              tail = 0x0
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  f_mode = 0x82e0003,
  f_op = 0xffffffff8233cfa0 &lt;socket_file_ops&gt;,    [1]
  f_mapping = 0xffff88800ee66f60,
  private_data = 0xffff88800ee66d80,
  f_inode = 0xffff88800ee66e00,
  f_flags = 0x2,
  f_iocb_flags = 0x0,
  f_cred = 0xffff888003b7ad00,                    [2]
  f_path = {
    mnt = 0xffff8880039cec20,
    dentry = 0xffff888005b30b40
  },
  ...
</code></pre></div>

<p>As a result, my PoC exploit obtained a pointer to <code>struct cred</code>, the structure that stores the current process credentials. The last piece needed for privilege escalation was arbitrary address writing. With that, I could overwrite the exploit process credentials and become root. That would be a data-only attack with no control-flow hijack.</p>

<h2 id="in-search-of-arbitrary-address-writing-primitive">In search of arbitrary address writing primitive</h2>

<p>The most interesting and difficult part of the research began here. I was searching for a target kernel object for my UAF write, which could provide an arbitrary address writing exploit primitive. The search was exhausting. I've done the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Looked through dozens of kernel objects,</li>
  <li>Read many kernel exploit write-ups,</li>
  <li>Tried <a href="https://kernelctf-dash.storage.googleapis.com/processed/v6.1.111/index.html#!heap/*/msg_msg/64..128">Kernel Exploitation Dashboard</a> by Eduardo Vela and the KernelCTF team.</li>
</ul>

<p>One idea was to combine my limited UAF write with the Dirty Page Table attack (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250226150503/https://yanglingxi1993.github.io/dirty_pagetable/dirty_pagetable.html">well described</a> by Nicolas Wu). Tweaking page tables can let an attacker read and write data at arbitrary physical address.</p>

<p>I could combine my UAF with a cross-cache attack (or more accurately, cross-allocator attack) to modify page tables. To overwrite kernel text or heap, though, I still needed to know the physical address of the target memory. Two options came to mind:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Bruteforcing physical addresses. Not practical here: I could trigger the UAF only about five times before the kworker crashed, nowhere near enough tries.</li>
  <li>Using the KASLR infoleak from my <code>msg_msg</code> out-of-bounds read. I decided to try that.</li>
</ol>

<p>I ran a quick experiment to see how KASLR behaves on <code>X86_64</code> with <code>CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE</code> and <code>CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_MEMORY</code> enabled. Booting a virtual machine several times, I compared the virtual and physical addresses of kernel <code>_text</code>.</p>

<p>VM run #1:</p>
<div><pre><code>gef&gt; ksymaddr-remote
[+] Wait for memory scan
0xffffffff98400000 T _text

gef&gt; v2p 0xffffffff98400000
Virt: 0xffffffff98400000 -&gt; Phys: 0x57400000
</code></pre></div>

<p>VM run #2:</p>
<div><pre><code>gef&gt; ksymaddr-remote
[+] Wait for memory scan
0xffffffff81800000 T _text

gef&gt; v2p 0xffffffff81800000
Virt: 0xffffffff81800000 -&gt; Phys: 0x18600000
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then I calculated the difference between the virtual and physical addresses:</p>
<ul>
  <li>VM run #1: <code>0xffffffff98400000 − 0x57400000 = 0xffffffff41000000</code></li>
  <li>VM run #2: <code>0xffffffff81800000 − 0x18600000 = 0xffffffff69200000</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Because <code>0xffffffff41000000</code> is not equal to <code>0xffffffff69200000</code>, leaking the virtual KASLR offset doesn't help against physical KASLR.</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/kaslr.jpg" width="60%"></center>


<p>Thereby to perform Dirty Page Table attack, I needed a way to leak a kernel physical address. Ideally I would do this by mixing some page-allocator feng shui with my out-of-bounds read. That felt messy, and I wanted a cleaner solution.</p>

<p>I kept looking for a target kernel object for my UAF write, which could provide an arbitrary address writing and eventually focused on <code>pipe_buffer</code>.</p>

<p>When a pipe is created with the <code>pipe()</code> system call, the kernel allocates an array of <code>pipe_buffer</code> structures. Each <code>pipe_buffer</code> item in this array corresponds to a memory page that holds data written to the pipe. The diagram below shows the internals of this object:</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/pipe_buffer.png" width="50%"></center>


<p>This object looked like a good UAF target. I could make a <code>pipe_buffer</code> array the same size as <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> by changing the capacity of the pipe: <code>fcntl(pipe_fd[1], F_SETPIPE_SZ, PAGE_SIZE * 2)</code>. The kernel changes the array size to <code>2 * sizeof(struct pipe_buffer) = 80 bytes</code>, exactly matching the <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> size.</p>

<p>In addition, 4 attacker-controlled bytes from the vsock UAF write at offset 24 can flip <code>pipe_buffer.flags</code>, just as in Max Kellermann's original <a href="https://dirtypipe.cm4all.com/">Dirty Pipe attack</a>.</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf_write_pipe_buffer0.png" width="90%"></center>


<p>The original Dirty Pipe attack doesn't even need an infoleak and grants privilege escalation with a one-shot write. Impressed, I decided to experiment with <code>pipe_buffer</code> in my <code>kernel-hack-drill</code>.</p>

<h2 id="experimenting-with-the-dirty-pipe-attack">Experimenting with the Dirty Pipe attack</h2>

<p>First, I built a Dirty Pipe prototype in <code>kernel-hack-drill</code>; the PoC exploit <code>drill_uaf_w_pipe_buffer.c</code> is in the <a href="https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/kernel-hack-drill/blob/e3a105cde99912c89c2c1470a29101eb0d9c2d56/drill_uaf_w_pipe_buffer.c">repository</a>. It:</p>
<ol>
  <li>performs a cross-cache attack and reclaims the slab that held <code>drill_item_t</code> objects as a slab for <code>pipe_buffer</code> objects</li>
  <li>exploits the UAF write to <code>drill_item_t</code>; the attacker-controlled bytes written to <code>drill_item_t</code> at offset 24, modify <code>pipe_buffer.flags</code></li>
  <li>implements the Dirty Pipe attack, achieving LPE in one shot without an infoleak, cool!</li>
</ol>

<p>To use this technique in my CVE-2024-50264 PoC exploit, I still had to bypass the last remaining <strong>Limitation #6</strong>: the kworker hangs before the UAF write if <code>virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock</code> is non-zero. I managed to solve that by doing <code>splice()</code> from a regular file to the pipe, starting at offset zero:</p>
<div><pre><code>	<span>loff_t</span> <span>file_offset</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
	<span>ssize_t</span> <span>bytes</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

	<span>/* N.B. splice modifies the file_offset value */</span>
	<span>bytes</span> <span>=</span> <span>splice</span><span>(</span><span>temp_file_fd</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>file_offset</span><span>,</span> <span>pipe_fd</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
	<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>bytes</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
		<span>err_exit</span><span>(</span><span>"[-] splice"</span><span>);</span>
	<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>bytes</span> <span>!=</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
		<span>err_exit</span><span>(</span><span>"[-] splice short"</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In that case, the <code>pipe_buffer.offset</code> field remains zero, so the kworker does not hang while acquiring the spinlock:</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf_write_pipe_buffer2.png" width="90%"></center>


<p>This seemed like a breakthrough – until I noticed that the UAF write also corrupted the <code>pipe_buffer.ops</code> function pointer by four zero bytes of <code>peer_fwd_cnt</code>. That unfortunate side effect provoked kernel crashes on every later operation involving <code>pipe_buffer</code> ☹️:</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf_write_pipe_buffer3.png" width="90%"></center>


<p>This brought me to the following line of reasoning:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Completing the Dirty Pipe attack requires a working <code>pipe_buffer</code> with an unchanged <code>ops</code> pointer value.</li>
  <li>Preserving <code>0xffffffff</code> in the most significant bytes of the <code>pipe_buffer.ops</code> function pointer requires that same value in <code>peer_fwd_cnt</code>.</li>
  <li>Setting <code>peer_fwd_cnt</code> in <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> means sending data through the vsock.</li>
  <li>Sending data through a vsock first needs a successful <code>connect()</code>.</li>
  <li>However, a successful <code>connect()</code> on the vulnerable vsock makes the UAF impossible ⛔.</li>
</ol>

<p>Alas!</p>

<h2 id="pipe-buffer-entertainment">Pipe buffer entertainment</h2>

<p>So the original Dirty Pipe technique wouldn't fit my CVE-2024-50264 PoC exploit. But suddenly an idea struck me:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What if I create a pipe with capacity <code>PAGE_SIZE * 4</code> forcing the kernel to allocate four <code>pipe_buffer</code> objects in <code>kmalloc-192</code>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In that case, the memory object overlapping looked like this: four <code>pipe_buffer</code> objects in one <code>kmalloc-192</code> slab are allocated at the place of two <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> objects in two <code>kmalloc-96</code> slabs. The following diagram illustrates the overlap:</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf_write_pipe_buffer7.png" width="90%"></center>


<p>Here, memory corruption can land on either of the two <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> objects. I'll cover these cases one at a time.</p>

<p>To avoid the kernel hang and crash when the UAF hits <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> <strong>#1</strong>, I used two tricks:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Performed a <code>splice()</code> from a regular file to the pipe with a starting offset of zero. As mentioned earlier, this keeps the <code>offset</code> field of the first <code>pipe_buffer</code> at zero, so the kworker doesn't hang while acquiring the spinlock.</li>
  <li>Discarded that first <code>pipe_buffer</code> <strong>before triggering the UAF</strong>, leaving its <code>offset</code> field untouched:
    <div><pre><code> <span>/* Remove the first pipe_buffer without changing the `pipe_buffer.offset` */</span>
 <span>bytes</span> <span>=</span> <span>splice</span><span>(</span><span>pipe_fd</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span> <span>temp_pipe_fd</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
 <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>bytes</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
 	<span>err_exit</span><span>(</span><span>"[-] splice"</span><span>);</span>
 <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>bytes</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
 	<span>err_exit</span><span>(</span><span>"[-] splice short"</span><span>);</span>

 <span>/*
  * Let's read this byte and empty the first pipe_buffer.
  * So if the UAF writing corrupts the first pipe_buffer,
  * that will not crash the kernel. Cool!
  */</span>
 <span>bytes</span> <span>=</span> <span>read</span><span>(</span><span>temp_pipe_fd</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span> <span>pipe_data_to_read</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span> <span>/* 1 spliced byte */</span>
 <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>bytes</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
 	<span>err_exit</span><span>(</span><span>"[-] pipe read 1"</span><span>);</span>
 <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>bytes</span> <span>!=</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
 	<span>err_exit</span><span>(</span><span>"[-] pipe read 1 short"</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>
    <p>After this sequence of <code>splice()</code> and <code>read()</code>, the first <code>pipe_buffer</code> becomes inactive. Even if the subsequent UAF overwrites its <code>ops</code> pointer, later pipe operations won't dereference that corrupted pointer, so no kernel crash occurs.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I wanted to exploit the UAF on <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> <strong>#2</strong> to overwrite the fourth <code>pipe_buffer</code>. To prevent the kernel hang when the UAF hits this second <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code>, I called the same <code>splice(temp_file_fd, &amp;file_offset, pipe_fd[1], NULL, 1, 0)</code> two more times. These syscalls initialized the second and third <code>pipe_buffer</code> objects, leaving their <code>flags</code> at zero, since this pipe operation doesn't set any <code>PIPE_BUF_FLAG_*</code> bits. Therefore, if the UAF occurs on the second <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code>, the <code>spin_lock_bh()</code> in <code>virtio_transport_space_update()</code> will not hang.</p>

<p>These preparations of the pipe opened a door for corrupting the <code>page</code> pointer of the fourth <code>pipe_buffer</code>:</p>

<p><code>kernel-hack-drill</code> let me experiment with <code>pipe_buffer</code> objects. Without it, crafting this exploit primitive for the tricky CVE-2024-50264 would have been extremely hard.</p>

<h2 id="aarw-and-kaslrs-last-revenge">AARW and KASLR's last revenge</h2>

<p>In a <code>pipe_buffer</code>, the <code>page</code> pointer holds the address of a <code>struct page</code> inside the virtual memory map (<code>vmemmap</code>). <code>vmemmap</code> is an array of these structures that allows the kernel to address physical memory efficiently. It is <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.15.5/source/Documentation/arch/x86/x86_64/mm.rst">mentioned</a> in <code>Documentation/arch/x86/x86_64/mm.rst</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code>____________________________________________________________|___________________________________________________________

</code></pre></div>

<p>Hence, when I managed to perform a UAF write of controlled data to the <code>pipe_buffer.page</code> pointer, I gained arbitrary address reading and writing (AARW) via the pipe. However, I wasn't able to change the AARW target address many times, as I mentioned in <strong>Limitation #5</strong>, so I had to choose the target in <code>vmemmap</code> carefully.</p>

<p>My first thought was to overwrite part of the kernel code. But with KASLR enabled, I didn't know the physical address of kernel <code>_text</code> and therefore couldn't determine its location inside <code>vmemmap</code>.</p>

<p>That's why I decided to use the pipe AARW against <code>struct cred</code> in the kernel heap. As I described earlier, I leaked the virtual address of <code>cred</code> using my <code>msg_msg</code> out-of-bounds read. This virtual address looked like <code>0xffff888003b7ad00</code>, and I understood it was from the direct mapping of all physical memory. So I used the following formula to calculate the offset of the corresponding <code>struct page</code> in <code>vmemmap</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>#define STRUCT_PAGE_SZ 64lu
#define PAGE_ADDR_OFFSET(addr) (((addr &amp; 0x3ffffffflu) &gt;&gt; 12) * STRUCT_PAGE_SZ)
</span><span>uaf_val</span> <span>=</span> <span>PAGE_ADDR_OFFSET</span><span>(</span><span>cred_addr</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The idea behind it is simple:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>addr &amp; 0x3ffffffflu</code> gives the offset of the <code>struct cred</code> from the <code>page_offset_base</code>.</li>
  <li>Right shift by 12 gives the number of the memory page containing <code>struct cred</code>.</li>
  <li>Finally, multiplication by 64 (the size of <code>struct page</code>) gives the offset of the corresponding <code>struct page</code> in the <code>vmemmap</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This formula should be adapted if the system has more than 4 GiB of RAM. In that case, <code>ZONE_NORMAL</code> containing kernel allocations usually starts at address <code>0x100000000</code>. Hence, to calculate the offset of the needed <code>struct page</code>, we should add <code>(0x100000000 &gt;&gt; 12) * STRUCT_PAGE_SZ</code>.</p>

<p>Excellent, the described formula is independent of KASLR for physical addresses, so I could use it to calculate the four lower bytes of the target address for exploiting the pipe AARW against the <code>struct cred</code>. Why I needed only four lower bytes of <code>pipe_buffer.page</code>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>My UAF write to <code>peer_buf_alloc</code> performed partial overwriting of the first half of the <code>pipe_buffer.page</code> pointer, as I showed at the diagram above.</li>
  <li><code>x86_64</code> is little-endian, so the first half of the pointer contains four lower bytes of the address.</li>
</ul>

<p>But when I tried this approach, KASLR carried out its last revenge. It randomized the <code>vmemmap_base</code> address, and the four lower bytes of the <code>struct page</code> pointers carried <strong>two random bits</strong>. Ouch!</p>

<p>However, I decided to brute-force those two bits because I could achieve the UAF write around 5 times before the kworker got a null-ptr-deref after <code>VSOCK_CLOSE_TIMEOUT</code> (8 sec).</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/bruteforce4.jpg" width="60%"></center>


<p>I found that probing different values of <code>pipe_buffer.page</code> from userspace works perfectly well:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In case of fail, reading from the pipe simply returns <code>Bad address</code>.</li>
  <li>In case of success, reading from the pipe gives <code>struct cred</code> contents.</li>
</ul>

<p>Great! I could finally determine a proper AARW target address, write to the pipe, overwrite euid and egid with 0, and get root. See the PoC exploit demo:</p>

<p><em>Support CleanTechnica's work through <a href="https://cleantechnica.substack.com/subscribe" target="_blank">a Substack subscription</a> or <a href="https://cleantechnica.fundjournalism.org/contribute/" target="_blank">on Stripe</a>.</em></p><hr>

<p>There are more ways to store energy than just using batteries. Some are using fire bricks, particularly for process heat for industries that rely on high heat in manufacturing. Others propose an arrangement of <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2024/01/19/gravity-energy-storage-mine-shafts-romania/">massive concrete blocks</a> that move up and down like the weights of a giant grandfather clock, converting kinetic energy to potential energy and back again. In Finland, two intrepid engineers began experimenting with a sand battery a few years ago.</p>
<p>As we reported when the first <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2022/07/05/sand-battery-trials-begin-in-finland/">prototype</a> was unveiled three years ago, the idea of a sand battery began with two Finnish engineers, Markku Ylönen and Tommi Eronen. The concept is simplicity itself. Make a really big pile of sand. Heat it with excess renewable electricity to around 500°C (932°F), then use that heat later to heat homes, factories, even swimming pools. They say the sand can stay hot for 3 months or more. The pair have founded Polar Night Energy, which constructed a prototype consisting of 100 tons of sand inside what looks like a silo in the town of Kankaanpää.</p>
<p>Many Americans are unfamiliar with the concept of district heating, but it is widely used in other counties, especially in Scandinavia where keeping schools, municipal buildings, arenas, factories, and homes warm in winter is a challenge.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.loval.com/en/about-us/news/loviisan-lampo">Loviisan Lämpö</a> is a Finnish district heating company that supplies district heating to customers in Loviisa, Pukkila, Pornainen, and Pyhtää. It has collaborated with Polar Night on a new sand battery — one that is much larger than the prototype — which began operating in the city of Pornainen in southern Finland this month, where it is expected to reduce carbon emissions from district heating by 70 percent.</p>
<p>Previously, the majority of heat needed for the system came from burning oil, but that has now been completely eliminated. The system will continue to burn wood chips to supplement the sand battery. Wood chips are at least carbon neutral, although not an ideal solution since it takes years for trees to grow but only minutes for the chips to burn.</p>
<p>At the commissioning ceremony for the new battery, Mikko Paajanen, CEO of Loviisan Lämpö, said, “A couple of years ago, we started considering how to take district heating in Pornainen to the next level. It would have been easy to simply replace the old wood chip power plant with a new one of the same kind, but that didn’t align with our goals. We evaluated every possible alternative, and the Sand Battery proved to be the best option.”</p>
<p>The battery is a 42 foot tall, 50 foot wide steel cylinder filled with 2,000 tons of crushed stone. According to <em><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91393820/in-finland-this-giant-battery-is-helping-heat-apartments-and-offices-using-sand">Fast Company</a></em>, when extra renewable electricity is available, the system uses it to heat up the crushed stone, where it is stored until needed. Then the heat from the battery travels to other buildings through a system of pipes filled with hot water. Each building has its own equipment to distribute the heat to radiators, floor heaters, or other heating devices.</p>
<p>“We have already learnt that our system has even more potential than we initially calculated. It’s been a positive surprise,” said Ylönen after the prototype was placed in service. “Whenever there’s a high surge of available green electricity, we want to be able to get it into the storage really quickly.” The need to use energy more wisely was driven home for Finns after Russia stopped providing electricity, methane, and oil to Finland when it voted to join NATO. Finland and Russia share a common border.</p>
<h3>Sand Battery Is Simple &amp; Efficient</h3>

<p>The sand battery is simplicity itself. “We just heat air and [circulate it] through sand,” says Liisa Naskali, COO of Polar Night Energy. But materials other than sand can be used. The new battery actually uses crushed soapstone chips from a local fireplace manufacturer. Sand, or other material crushed into sand-size particles, has the ability to store heat for weeks. Unlike some other batteries, the system doesn’t rely on chemicals, doesn’t degrade, and won’t catch on fire. In operation, the sand battery has demonstrated a round trip efficiency of 90 percent.</p>
<p>Inside the steel tank, a heat exchanger and a closed loop system are used to circulate the heat. Software runs heaters when electricity prices are low. So far this summer, the district heating operator has paid only about 10 percent of the average price of electricity because heating the system only occurred at optimal times. That helps make the technology cost competitive, although the initial installation cost is fairly high.</p>
<p>Polar Night is now in talks with other district heating companies and factory owners with a need for high temperature process heat. For the company, the project in Pornainen is a critical proof point. “This is really important for us because now we can show that this really works,” a spokesperson for Polar Night said.</p>
<h3>Investment Opportunities</h3>
<p>Polar Night and its partners see a <a href="https://polarnightenergy.com/news/worlds-largest-sand-battery-inaugurated/">bright financial future</a> for sand batteries because&nbsp;they can participate in electricity reserve markets, reduce dependence on single energy sources in heat production, and serve as an excellent example of sector integration between electricity and heat.</p>
<p>“For us, the sand battery is a great commercial investment, but we also wanted to boldly support an innovative solution that benefits customers, the municipality, and the entire electricity market. This is a concrete example of a cost efficient and sustainable investment. If it works here, it will work anywhere,” said Sauli Antila, the investment director at CapMan Infra, the corporate owner of Loviisan Lämpö.</p>
<p>The profitability of the sand battery is based on charging it according to electricity prices and Fingrid’s reserve markets. Its large storage capacity enables balancing the electricity grid and optimizing consumption over several days or even weeks. The reserve market operations and optimization of the Pornainen Sand Battery are managed by the software unit division of Elisa Industriq.</p>
<p>“The Pornainen plant can be adjusted quickly and precisely, and it also has a remarkably long energy buffer, making it well suited for reserve market optimization. Our AI solution automatically identifies the best times to charge and discharge the Sand Battery and allocates flexibility capacity to the reserve products that need it most. Continuous optimization makes it a genuinely profitable investment,” explained Jukka-Pekka Salmenkaita, vice president of AI and special projects at Elisa Industriq.</p>
<p>Polar Night has a clear vision for the future. Construction of an electricity production pilot will begin in the coming weeks in Valkeakoski, Finland, and the company is in active negotiations for several large-scale thermal storage projects in district heating, hot air, and process steam production. “Industrial applications are particularly promising, especially where heat above 100°C is required, something electric boilers and heat pumps cannot provide,” said Polar Night COO Liisa Naskali.</p>
<p>This technology is never going to replace grid-scale battery storage, but could be useful in many situations where battery storage is not. A comment on the YouTube video below complained, “Not a word about return on investment in the presentation. That means it’ll never pay off. They just wasted taxpayers’ money to stroke their own egos.” MAGAlomaniacs are everywhere these days.</p>

    <h3>September 02, 2025</h3>
    
    


<p><a href="https://ziglang.org/news/2024-financials/">Previous Year</a></p><p>Zig Software Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization which I am proud to say makes <strong>extremely efficient use of monetary resources</strong>. Unlike many of our peers, our primary expense is direct payments to contributors for their enhancements to the Zig project.</p><p>Don’t take my word for it - let’s look at some numbers.</p><h2>2024 Expenditures</h2>


<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Expense Name</th>
<th>2024 Cost</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>Contractors</td>
<td>$306,362.09</td>
<td>Direct compensation to contributors working on Zig at a rate of $60/hour.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Employees</td>
<td>$154,263.32</td>
<td>ZSF has one employee which is yours truly, Andrew Kelley, serving the role of 
Lead Software Engineer. In 2024, I also volunteered my time as President of Zig Software Foundation,
volunteered as Accounting Clerk, and volunteered as Development Director. In the future, it would be
nice to have dedicated staff for these roles so that I could focus more on being Lead Software Engineer.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Accounting</td>
<td>$18,463.62</td>
<td>This is entirely paying our accountant,
<a href="https://www.stradafg.com/">Strada Financial Group</a>, to keep the American
legal system happy and keep our organization tax-exempt. I suspected we were being overcharged,
and in 2025 switched to a different accountant.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>CI &amp; Website</td>
<td>$14,986.73</td>
<td>Zig has great cross-compiling abilities in part
due to investing in testing infrastructure for different systems. Some of these costs were
one-time costs to purchase machines that sit in our homes and offices while others
are market-rate Hetzner bare metal machines that we run GitHub Actions on.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Taxes</td>
<td>$13,089.07</td>
<td>Although ZSF is a tax-exempt organization, employees are still required
to pay income tax.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Travel</td>
<td>$6,955.61</td>
<td>In a 2024 meeting, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RBIB3hY2z-gKLGQyvAO3vtWJzoiS6fVLC5XRF4owPn0/edit?usp=sharing">the board decided</a>
that the previous year's travel budget successfully helped grow Zig adoption,
and retained the same budget of $15,000. In 2024, ZSF spent $6,956
of those allocated funds, increasing Zig's presence in <a href="https://softwareyoucan.love/">Italy</a> and <a href="https://zigtoberfest.de/">Germany</a>.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Sponsorships</td>
<td>$5,846.24</td>
<td>The Zig project is mostly comprised of in-house code, however,
it also relies on third party projects. Today, every Zig
installation includes some source files or ported code from
<a href="http://musl.libc.org/">musl libc</a>,
<a href="https://www.mingw-w64.org/">mingw-w64</a>, and others.
ZSF donates money to these projects as a way to say thanks, give back to the ecosystem,
and increase the sustainability of Zig's dependencies.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Bank Fees</td>
<td>$782.23</td>
<td>This is a tiny slice of the pie, but every time ZSF
wires money, there is a transaction fee. Our contractors graciously bill
infrequently when possible to help reduce this cost.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Total Expenses</td>
<td>$520,748.91</td>
</tr>

<p><strong>Even with a 13% bigger budget, we still managed to spend 92% of our money in 2024 paying contributors for their time.</strong></p><h2>Major Initiatives in 2024</h2><ul><li><a href="https://ziglang.org/download/0.13.0/release-notes.html" target="_blank">Zig 0.13.0 Released</a></li><li><a href="https://ziglang.org/download/0.14.0/release-notes.html" target="_blank">Zig 0.14.0 Released</a><ul><li><a href="https://ziglang.org/download/0.14.0/release-notes.html#Target-Support" target="_blank">Greatly expanded support for more targets</a> that can be correctly cross-compiled and run on.</li><li><a href="https://ziglang.org/download/0.14.0/release-notes.html#Language-Changes" target="_blank">Major language enhancements</a></li><li><a href="https://ziglang.org/download/0.14.0/release-notes.html#Standard-Library" target="_blank">Major standard library enhancements</a></li><li><a href="https://ziglang.org/download/0.14.0/release-notes.html#Build-System" target="_blank">Major build system enhancements</a></li><li>Zig 0.14.1 released with bug fixes only.</li></ul></li></ul><p>So far so good. You can see we’ve been hard at work spending our esteemed donors’ money on advancing the <a href="https://ziglang.org/zsf/#mission-statement" target="_blank">mission statement</a>.</p><p>However, if we look at the trend of donations over time for the year 2024, we see overall a slow decline.

<p>The big spike is <a href="https://ziglang.org/news/300k-from-mitchellh/">half of Mitchell Hashimoto’s pledge</a>.</p><p>More to the point, the second half will buy us another year to raise donations in order to keep our bank balance positive. ZSF neither borrows money nor invests money; we convert donations directly into progress on the Zig project.</p><h2>2024-2025 Cash On Hand</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, <strong>user activity continues to skyrocket</strong>. A rapidly increasing user base is adding Zig to their software stacks, filing issues, sending pull requests, asking for help, and shipping software that depends on Zig.</p><h2>2024 GitHub Issues Per Month</h2>


<p>The top line is Total Issues Opened and the bottom line is Total Issues Closed. The gap is widening -
more users are demanding more attention than Zig core team has time for.</p>

<p>However, with our current level of recurring income, we will not be able to renew everyone’s contracts, nor offer new contracts to Zig core team members.</p><h2>A Plea for Donations</h2><p>We have extremely talented Zig core team members who want to renew their contracts, and others who are interested to start getting paid for their valuable work for the first time.</p><p>In order to do this, <strong>we need more recurring donations</strong>. I for one do not enjoy asking for money, but in the interest of our users and contributors, it would be irresponsible not to.</p><p><strong>Please sign up for a monthly donation</strong> if you can.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="content"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header></header><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>I deal with a lot of servers at work, and one thing everyone wants to know about their servers is how close they are to being at max utilization. It should be easy, right? Just pull up <code>top</code> or another system monitor tool, look at network, memory and CPU utilization, and whichever one is the highest tells you how close you are to the limits.</p><p><img alt="A screenshot of a system monitor app showing 24 cores, half of which are at 100% utitilization and half of which are close to 0%." src="https://www.brendanlong.com/images/cpu-utilization-lie/system-monitor-screenshot.png"></p><p>For example, this machine is at 50% CPU utilization, so it can <a href="#matrix-math">probably do twice as much of whatever it's doing</a>.</p><p>And yet, whenever people actually try to project these numbers, they find that CPU utilization doesn't quite increase linearly. <strong>But how bad could it possibly be?</strong></p><p>To answer this question, I ran a bunch of stress tests and monitored both how much work they did and what the system-reported CPU utilization was, then graphed the results.</p><h2 id="setup"><a href="#setup">Setup</a></h2><p>For my test machine, I used a desktop computer running Ubuntu with a <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/desktops/ryzen/5000-series/amd-ryzen-9-5900x.html">Ryzen 9 5900X</a> (12 core / 24 thread) processor. I also enabled <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/faqs/CPU-PB2.html">Precision Boost Overdrive</a> (i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_Turbo_Core">Turbo</a>).</p><p>I vibe-coded <a href="https://github.com/brendanlong/cpu-utilization-graphs">a script</a> that runs <a href="https://github.com/ColinIanKing/stress-ng">stress-ng</a> in a loop, first using 24 workers and attempting to run them each at different utilizations from 1% to 100%, then using 1 to 24 workers all at 100% utilization. It used different stress testing method and measured the number of operations that could be completed ("Bogo ops<sup id="fnref:jvyu8i00sms"><a href="#fn:jvyu8i00sms">1</a></sup>").</p><p>The reason I did two different methods was that operating systems are smart about how they schedule work, and scheduling a small number of workers at 100% utilization can be done optimally (spoilers) but with 24 workers all at 50% utilization it's hard for the OS to do anything other than spreading the work evenly.</p><h2 id="results"><a href="#results">Results</a></h2><p>You can see <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QKdYa3NIFGTixG_LdnsbwbeLDnE2GNVVsS9-dfkcT20/edit?usp=sharing">the raw CSV results here</a>.</p><h2 id="general-cpu"><a href="#general-cpu">General CPU</a></h2><p>The most basic test just runs all of stress-ng's CPU stress tests in a loop.</p><p><img alt="" src="https://www.brendanlong.com/images/cpu-utilization-lie/cpu_utilization_analysis_cpu.png"></p><p>You can see that when the system is reporting 50% CPU utilization, it's actually doing 60-65% of the actual maximum work it can do.</p><h2 id="64-bit-integer-math"><a href="#64-bit-integer-math">64-bit Integer Math</a></h2><p>But maybe that one was just a fluke. What if we just run some random math on 64-bit integers?</p><p><img alt="" src="https://www.brendanlong.com/images/cpu-utilization-lie/cpu_utilization_analysis_int64.png"></p><p>This one is even worse! At "50% utilization", we're actually doing 65-85% of the max work we can get done. It can't possibly get worse than that though, right?</p><h2 id="matrix-math"><a href="#matrix-math">Matrix Math</a></h2><p><img alt="" src="https://www.brendanlong.com/images/cpu-utilization-lie/cpu_utilization_analysis_matrixprod.png"></p><p>Something is definitely off. <strong>Doing matrix math, "50% utilization" is actually 80% to 100% of the max work that can be done.</strong></p><p>In case you were wondering about the system monitor screenshot from the start of the article, that was a matrix math test running with 12 workers, and you can see that it really did report 50% utilization even though additional workers do absolutely nothing (except make the utilization number go up).</p><h2 id="whats-going-on"><a href="#whats-going-on">What's Going On?</a></h2><h2 id="hyperthreading"><a href="#hyperthreading">Hyperthreading</a></h2><p>You might notice that this the graph keeps changing at 50%, and I've helpfully added piecewise linear regressions showing the fit.</p><p>The main reason this is happening is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-threading">hyperthreading</a>: Half of the "cores" on this machine (and most machines) are sharing resources with other cores. If I run 12 workers on this machine, they each get scheduled on their own physical core with no shared resources, but once I go over that, each additional worker is sharing resources with another. In some cases (general CPU benchmarks), this makes things slightly worse, and in some cases (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data">SIMD</a>-heavy matrix math), there are no useful resources left to share.</p><h2 id="turbo"><a href="#turbo">Turbo</a></h2><p>It's harder to see, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_Turbo_Core">Turbo</a> is also having an effect.

The clock speed "only" drops by 15% on this processor.</p><p>Since CPU utilization is calculated as busy cycles / total cycles, this means the denominator is getting smaller as the numerator gets larger, so we get yet another reason why actual CPU utilization increases faster than linearly.</p><h2 id="does-this-matter"><a href="#does-this-matter">Does This Matter?</a></h2><p><img alt="" src="https://www.brendanlong.com/images/cpu-utilization-lie/cpu_utilization_combined_adjusted.png"></p><p>If you look at CPU utilization and assume it will increase linearly, you're going to have a rough time. If you're using the CPU efficiently (running above "50%" utilization), the reported utilization is an underestimate, sometimes significantly so.</p><p>And keep in mind that I've only shown results for one processor, but hyperthreading performance and Turbo behavior can vary wildly between different processors, especially from different companies (AMD vs Intel).</p><p>The best way I know to work around this is to run benchmarks and monitor actual work done:</p><ol><li>Benchmark how much work your server can do before having errors or unacceptable latency.</li><li>Report how much work your server is currently doing.</li><li>Compare those two metrics instead of CPU utilization.</li></ol></div></article></section></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			<p>If you glance over this blog, you will see that I am an avid Android fan. After setting up numerous Linux <code>proot</code> desktops on phones, I wanted to see if I use a phone as a server and run my blog from an Android phone. Since you are reading this, I was successful.</p>
<p>I was inspired my a few Mastodon posts earlier this week to give it a go. First, I stumbled on a post from <a href="https://sunny.garden/@kaimac/113030644224867695">@kaimac</a> who is running a site from an ESP32 microcontroller. In the comments of that post, I saw <a href="https://post.lurk.org/@computersandblues/112570463568163343">a mention</a> to <a href="https://compost.party/">compost.party</a> created by user <a href="https://post.lurk.org/@computersandblues">@computersandblues</a> that runs completely on an Android device and a solar panel. Last, <a href="https://bladerunner.social/@stevelord">@stevelord</a> who is essentially running <a href="https://thedorkweb.bearblog.dev/my-openwrt-home-server/">a homelab on a TP-Link router</a> with OpenWRT installed.</p>
<p>I think a lot about power consumption of my homelab and I also love using old hardware for random projects to give them new life. I was truly inspired by the above works, so I got right down to business.</p>
<h2 id="the-hardware">The hardware</h2>
<p>I looked through the devices I had laying around and I chose a Google Pixel 5 my brother-in-law gave me after he upgraded. The Pixel 5 is carrier locked to Verizon, which is notorious for making it impossible to also unlock the bootloader and install custom ROMs. At first I wanted a device that I could install PostmarketOS to run a proper Linux server. In the end, I’m glad I didn’t go that route.</p>
<p>Another reason I chose the Pixel 5 is because it supports USB-OTG and can use docks with hard-wired internet. I didn’t want to run the site on wifi and having an ethernet connection was mandatory.</p>
<p>Last, it is the most current phone I have. This device is open to the internet, so I wanted to make sure it is an updated as possible.</p>
<h4 id="solar-powered-blog">Solar powered blog!</h4>
<p>This summer I’ve been testing using a 100w solar panel I got from <a href="https://www.harborfreight.com/100-watt-monocrystalline-solar-panel-57325.html">Harbor Freight Tools</a> so I can learn more about how it all works before diving into larger projects. I have that panel connected to a <a href="https://www.jackery.com/products/explorer-160-portable-power-station">Jackery 160w power station</a> to keep it charged up and we use it to charge our mobile devices. I got the Jackery last year as a power bank I use while on jobsites.</p>
<p>Since I already have this set up, I am now using it to power this blog. I’m happy with this setup as I’ve been getting more into <a href="https://permacomputing.net/">permacomputing</a>. Having a website that is fully offgrid using recycled parts is exciting!</p>
<h2 id="what-i-used-to-create-the-site-termux-is-the-goat">What I used to create the site (Termux is the GOAT)</h2>
<p>While considering what projects I could do with this phone, I was thinking I was going to install a <code>proot</code> desktop and then run from within a Linux environment. Before I started I decided to check out a few packages that are in <a href="https://termux.dev/en/">Termux</a> (the flat out amazing terminal emulator) to see how far I could push it.</p>
<p>I checked for some basics and read about setting up an <code>ssh</code> connection. Then I randomly searched for <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, which is what my blog was already built on. Sure enough, it is right there in the Termux repos! Turns out, it has been in there for a long time. I see a lot of posts from 2018 with people using it.</p>
<h2 id="how-has-it-been-going">How has it been going</h2>
<p>Great! Site is fast and reliable. I ran into a few hiccups on the first day or so, which were mostly around the version of Hugo on my server and the newer version I am using on the phone. The other is related to my solar setup and keeping an eye on the battery levels.</p>
<p>To be honest, I don’t think anyone can tell it is running on an Android phone instead of a x86 Linux box or a hyperscaler VPS.</p>
<p>At the moment I have no plans to change this setup and will leave it as-is until some issue arises. But, there’s really not much to report other than it works fantastic.</p>
<p>Below are my longform notes on how I set it up. But, the short version is it was way simpler than I thought it would be. You can get up and running with a Hugo site by just installing <code>git</code>, <code>screen</code>, your favorite text editor, and <code>hugo</code> straight from the repos.</p>
<p>Not included in this post is how I add new posts to the phone. I can use <code>scp</code> to send a files, but I prefer to use <a href="https://github.com/sigoden/dufs">dufs</a> that is a static file server in that can be accessed in the browser. Using <code>dufs</code> I can upload files and make quick edits straight in the browser from any device. Surprise! <code>dufs</code> is also in the Termux repos and is so easy to get up and running. Again, message me if you’d like to see a write-up about it.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="installs">Installs</h2>
<p>Of course I need some basic utilities. These are the utilities I need to have at a minimum when working with a Linux system:</p>
<ul>
<li>rsync</li>
<li>openssh</li>
<li>git</li>
<li>wget</li>
<li>curl</li>
<li>fish shell</li>
<li>cronie</li>
<li>termux-services</li>
<li>iperf3</li>
<li>speedtest-go</li>
<li>screen</li>
<li>helix</li>
<li>hugo</li>
</ul>
<p>Restart Termux and use <code>sv-enable</code> to run certain items as services. I do this for <code>sshd</code> and <code>cronie</code>. It looks like this:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>$ sv-enable sshd
</span></span><span><span>$ sv-enable cronie
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After running <code>sv-enable</code>, restart Termux.</p>
<h4 id="openssh">openssh</h4>
<p>I could build all of this straight from the phone using either the touchscreen keyboard or connecting a standard keyboard and mouse either with a USB-C dock or bluetooth. But, I want to manage this like all of my other servers, which is to <code>ssh</code> into the device and work from my desk.</p>
<p>There is an <a href="https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Remote_Access#Using_the_SSH_server">official guide</a> for setting up an <code>ssh</code> server. All I will add here is some pointers I learned along the way.</p>
<ol>
<li>Adding an <code>ssh</code> key is simple and should be one of the first steps done. After generating the key and importing with <code>ssh-copy-id</code> from the desktop, edit the <code>sshd</code> file in <code>$PREFIX/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>.</li>
<li>Termux generates its own username and cannot be changed. Run <code>whoami</code> to see what it is.</li>
<li>It is the same for the <code>ssh</code> port. As far as I can tell you cannot change the port, which is automatically set to <strong>8022</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="running-the-site">Running the site</h2>
<p>There are lots of guides out there on how to setup a <code>hugo</code> site. I have an existing site that I migrated from a VM to this phone, so my notes do not include how to get a <code>hugo</code> site running. I also do not need to do any port forwarding as I already have a reverse proxy that I just changed where it points for my blog.</p>
<p><strong>I would like to hear feedback if there is a need to add those notes here. Message me on Mastodon or by email using the links at the bottom of this post.</strong></p>
<p>Below are notes on how I use the package <code>cronie</code> to start the blog using <code>screen</code> and the automatically reload the blog occasionally. <code>cronie</code> is for setting up <code>cron</code> tasks. Once installed and enabled, run <code>crontab -e</code> like usual to setup tasks.</p>
<p>This is how I do it.</p>
<p>First, set a <code>fish</code> alias for the command to reload the blog:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>alias blog_run<span>=</span><span>'cd /data/data/com.termux/files/home/&lt;website_root_dir&gt; &amp;&amp; /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/hugo serve --bind=0.0.0.0 --baseURL=https://blog.ctms.me --appendPort=false --environment=production --disableFastRender --cacheDir /data/data/com.termux/files/home/&lt;website_root_dir&gt;/cache'</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>funcsave blog_run
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now, create a script and place in <code>~/scripts</code> that closes a previous instance of <code>screen</code>, clears the cache, and then starts a new <code>screen</code> session titled “hugo” and execute the alias:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span><span>#! /bin/bash
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>screen -X -S <span>"hugo"</span> quit
</span></span><span><span>rm -rf /data/data/com.termux/files/home/&lt;website_root_dir/cache/&lt;site_name_dir&gt;/filecache/getresource/
</span></span><span><span>screen -S hugo -d -m fish -c <span>'blog_run; exec fish'</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Last, set it to run with <code>cron</code></p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="gdscript3"><span><span><span>*/</span><span>5</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> cd <span>/</span>data<span>/</span>data<span>/</span>com<span>.</span>termux<span>/</span>files<span>/</span>home<span>/</span>scripts <span>&amp;&amp;</span> sh blog_reload<span>.</span>sh
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="backing-up">Backing up</h2>
<p>Since Termux supports <code>ssh</code> connections, I can use it on remote machines to pull the files from the phone using <code>rsync</code>.</p>
<p>First, need to install <code>rsync</code> on the phone with <code>pkg install rsync</code>.</p>
<h4 id="desktop-backup">Desktop backup</h4>
<p>Now we can run it from my desktop to pull the files:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>rsync -aP pixel:~/&lt;website_root_dir&gt; /local/dir/pixel_blog/
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>On my desktop, I have this for <code>cron</code></p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>@reboot sleep <span>30</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> rsync -aP pixel:~/&lt;website_root_dir&gt; /local/dir/pixel_blog/ &gt;&gt; $HOME/logs/pixel-hugo-backup.log 2&gt;&amp;<span>1</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><h4 id="nas-backup">nas backup</h4>
<p>This is the same configuration. The only difference is the backup location and the <code>cron</code> timing.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>rsync -aP pixel:~/&lt;website_root_dir&gt; /local/dir/pixel_blog
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The automation:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span><span>5</span> <span>6</span> * * * rsync -aP pixel:~/&lt;website_root_dir&gt; /local/dir/pixel_blog &gt;&gt; $HOME/logs/pixel-hugo-backup.log 2&gt;&amp;<span>1</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><h4 id="git-backup">git backup</h4>
<p>I have a local self-hosted git instance I push backups to, but you can totally set it up to send them to Github or whatever forge you use. No instructions here because there are plenty of guides out there on how to set this up.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody" id="articleBody">
	

<p>I once had a job interview for a backend position. Their stack was Node.js, MySQL, nothing exotic. The interviewer asked: "If you have an array containing a million entries, how would you sort the data by name?"</p>

<p>My immediate thought was: <em>If you have a JavaScript array with a million entries, you're certainly doing something wrong.</em></p>

<p>The interviewer continued: "There are multiple fields that you should be able to sort by."</p>

<p>This felt like a trick question. Surely the right answer was to explain why you shouldn't be sorting millions of records in JavaScript. Pagination, database indexing, server-side filtering. So I said exactly that.</p>

<p>I was wrong. He wanted me to show him <code>Array.prototype.sort()</code>.</p>

<p>My crime? Prioritizing real-world efficiency over theatrical scale. The interviewer didn't see a practical engineer, he saw a candidate who "lacked vision."</p>

<h2>The Theater of Technical Interviews</h2>

<p>I once read that "a complex system usually reflects an absence of good design." It's brilliant. True. And if you're prepping for a system design interview, forget it immediately.</p>

<p>In real-world engineering, simplicity is king. In interviews, <strong>complexity is currency.</strong></p>

<p>Job interviews aren't assessments. They're auditions for a job title: <strong>The Architect Who Solves Hard Problems™.</strong></p>

<p>You're not being evaluated on whether you can build the described system efficiently. You're being evaluated on whether you can <strong>perform the role</strong> of someone who could theoretically build Google.</p>

<h2>The Unwritten Script</h2>

<p>Every system design interview follows the same theatrical formula:</p>

<p><strong>Act I: Summon the Dragons</strong><br>
First, you assume infinite users and planetary-scale traffic. Multiply every reasonable number by 1,000. Treat a todo app like it's handling the New York Stock Exchange. The interviewer nods approvingly as you describe millions of concurrent users for what is essentially a digital notepad.</p>

<p><strong>Act II: Draw the Arcane Symbols</strong><br>
Next, you cover the whiteboard in boxes, arrows, and at least one redundant Kubernetes cluster. Add a message queue, Kafka obviously, regardless of whether you need one. Sprinkle in some microservices because monoliths are for peasants, and draw load balancers like protective talismans around every component.</p>

<p><strong>Act III: Invoke the Gods of Tech</strong><br>
Finally, you debate consensus algorithms for a blog comment system, mention observability and SLOs for good measure, and whisper "eventual consistency" like an incantation that will ward off all future scaling problems.</p>

<p>The performance has nothing to do with the actual job. It's about proving you know the <strong>vocabulary of scale</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Interview World</strong>: Complexity = Competence</p>

<ul>
<li>Show knowledge of distributed systems patterns</li>
<li>Demonstrate familiarity with enterprise-grade tools</li>
<li>Prove you can architect for theoretical millions</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Real World</strong>: Simplicity = Good Design</p>

<ul>
<li>Start with the simplest solution that works</li>
<li>Add complexity only when genuinely needed</li>
<li>Optimize for maintainability, not theoretical scale</li>
</ul>

<p>I've seen great engineers fail interviews because they suggested using a relational database instead of a distributed NoSQL cluster, for a system that would handle 100 requests per day.</p>

<p>I've also seen mediocre engineers get hired because they could fluently discuss sharding strategies for problems that didn't need sharding.</p>

<h2>Why the Theater Exists</h2>

<p>This isn't malicious. It's structural, driven by several interconnected forces:</p>

<p><strong>Signal vs. Noise</strong>: Complexity is easier to evaluate than judgment. Anyone can memorize CAP theorem and recite the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases. But knowing about when <em>not</em> to use distributed systems? That's harder to assess in a 45-minute conversation. Interviewers gravitate toward what they can measure.</p>

<p><strong>Risk Aversion</strong>: Hiring committees fear false negatives more than false positives. A "simple" answer feels risky. What if this person can't handle complexity when it's genuinely needed? A "complex" answer feels safer, even if it's complete overkill for the actual problem at hand.</p>

<p><strong>The Aspiration Gap</strong>: Companies hire for their <em>aspirational</em> selves, not their current reality. They want "Senior Staff Engineers" who can theoretically scale to millions of users, not "People Who Write Maintainable Code" for their current 10,000 daily active users. The fantasy of future scale drives present hiring decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer Incentives</strong>: Discussing load balancing strategies and distributed consensus is more intellectually stimulating than talking about boring CRUD operations. Even if CRUD is 90% of what the actual job entails. Interviewers are human, and humans prefer interesting conversations over practical ones.</p>

<p>Once you're hired, the script flips entirely. You'll spend your days deleting unused microservices that "future-proofed" against scale that never came, arguing against message queues for problems that cron jobs solve perfectly, and consolidating databases that were split "for scalability" but now just create maintenance overhead. You'll find yourself explaining to eager junior developers why the new feature doesn't need its own Kubernetes namespace, and why sometimes a simple bash script is more reliable than a distributed system.</p>

<p>The very complexity that got you hired becomes the tech debt you'll spend years dismantling. I've worked with engineers who aced system design interviews by proposing elaborate architectures, then spent their first year on the job simplifying systems that previous hires had over-engineered using the exact same interview logic. It's a cycle of complexity creation and subsequent complexity destruction, driven entirely by hiring theater.</p>

<h2>The Cost of Honesty</h2>

<p>What happens when you try to be pragmatic in interviews?</p>

<p><strong>The Backpressure Question</strong>: "How do you handle backpressure in your system?"</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Honest answer</strong>: "We don't generate enough load to need backpressure handling."</li>
<li><strong>Interview answer</strong>: "We implement exponential backoff with circuit breakers and queue depth monitoring."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Database Question</strong>: "SQL or NoSQL for this use case?"</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Honest answer</strong>: "Postgres handles this fine and the team knows SQL."</li>
<li><strong>Interview answer</strong>: "We'll use a polyglot persistence strategy with Redis for caching, Cassandra for time-series data, and Neo4j for the social graph."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Scaling Question</strong>: "How do you handle 10 million users?"</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Honest answer</strong>: "We don't have 10 million users. We have 10,000. Let's solve that first."</li>
<li><strong>Interview answer</strong>: "We'll implement horizontal sharding with consistent hashing and auto-scaling Kubernetes pods."</li>
</ul>

<p>The honest answers demonstrate experience. The interview answers demonstrate vocabulary. Guess which ones get job offers?</p>

<h2>How to Win the Game</h2>

<p>I'm not advocating dishonesty, I'm acknowledging reality. Interviews are a ritual, and rituals have rules. Here's how to navigate them:</p>

<p><strong>Separate Performance from Practice</strong>: Playing the interview game doesn't make you a hypocrite. It makes you pragmatic about a broken system. You can excel at interview theater while still being a principled engineer once you're hired.</p>

<p><strong>Learn the Sacred Texts</strong>: Study distributed systems patterns even if you'll never use them. Memorize the CAP theorem even if it's mostly irrelevant to your daily work. Practice drawing architecture diagrams that look impressive on whiteboards. Think of it as learning a foreign language you'll only speak during interviews.</p>

<p><strong>Embrace the Tropes</strong>: Always start discussions with "At scale, we'd need to consider..." Mention monitoring and observability early and often, even for simple systems. Add redundancy everywhere, even for non-critical components. Use the magic words that signal competence in interview-land.</p>

<p><strong>Then Drop the Act</strong>: Once hired, advocate ruthlessly for simplicity. Be the voice of reason who asks "Do we actually need this complexity?" Use your hard-earned credibility to push back against unnecessary over-engineering. This is where the real engineering work begins.</p>

<p>This system is frustrating but not permanent. Some companies are starting to recognize the disconnect and experiment with better approaches. They're giving candidates real problems the company actually faces rather than theoretical scaling challenges. They're rewarding engineers who question complexity, not just those who can implement it. They're asking candidates to identify over-engineering in existing systems rather than create new complexity from scratch.</p>

<p>But until these practices become widespread, we're stuck with the performance. The theater continues because it serves too many psychological needs: it makes interviewers feel smart, companies feel rigorous, and candidates feel like they're solving important problems.</p>

<hr>

<p>Technical interviews exist in a parallel universe where different rules apply. The stage demands a <strong>performance of complexity</strong>; the job rewards <strong>mastery of simplicity</strong>.</p>

<p>The system is broken, but individual actors can't fix it by martyring themselves. Play your part, get the role, then use your position to advocate for sanity.</p>

<p>Remember: the goal isn't to perpetuate the theater forever. It's to get inside the building where you can help others see that the emperor's distributed microservices architecture has no clothes.</p>

<p>The best revenge against interview theater isn't failing the performance, it's succeeding at it. Then you can spend your career deleting the unnecessary complexity it celebrated.</p>
