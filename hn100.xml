                                <p><em>Editor’s Note: This article contains reference to death.</em></p><p>Questions are surrounding the death of a popular NC State faculty member, whom NC State police found dead in his office on Nov. 20.&nbsp;</p><p>Police found Marshall Brain II, director of the Engineering Entrepreneurs Program, unconscious and nonresponsive in his office at Engineering Building II on Centennial Campus at 7:00 a.m.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>NC State Police Public Information Officer Conner Hartis confirmed police found Brain deceased upon their arrival. The Wake County Simulcast showed Brain’s wife called for a welfare check at 6:40 a.m. No cause of death has been released.&nbsp;</p><p>Hours before Brain’s death, he sent an email to colleagues saying two University department heads retaliated against him after he filed several ethics complaints months before his death.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">University spokesperson, Mick Kulikowski, said the University has no comment on the allegations or Brain’s death. The University has also not issued a public statement on Brain’s death.</p><p>Brain graduated from the University with a master’s in computer science in 1992 and worked at the University since 2012. Brain was an author, entrepreneur and founder of the popular website <a href="http://howstuffworks.com/">HowStuffWorks.com</a>. The award-winning faculty member was an influential figure in the world of science and entrepreneurship on and off campus. His classes, which aimed to combine the worlds of engineering and entrepreneurship, were popular.&nbsp;</p><p>The email shared to Technician and posted online on a website dedicated to Brain’s legacy contains allegations of wrongdoing. Brain claims he was forced into retirement as retaliation for submitting numerous ethics complaints.</p><p>Brain wrote in the email that Stephen Markham, executive director of NC State’s Innovation and Entrepreneurship program, announced Brain’s retirement to the Innovation and Entrepreneurship team on Nov. 6, saying the retirement was effective Dec. 31, 2025. Brain was a member of the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Leadership team, alongside Markham.</p><p>Brain wrote that he was not retiring but instead was fired. Markham did not respond to multiple requests for comment in time for publication.&nbsp;</p><p>“I have just been through one of the most demoralizing, depressing, humiliating, unjust processes possible with the University,” Brain wrote. “The fact is that I am not ‘retiring.’ Instead, NC State terminated me on Oct. 29.”</p><p>Brain wrote that after submitting an ethics complaint concerning Veena Misra, head of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and bringing his concerns to her directly, Misra retaliated against him.&nbsp;</p><p>Brain’s complaint contained allegations of wrongdoing in the form of “untrue statements, incompetence, hiding info, bad faith dealings and unethical behavior” after a disagreement with Misra in August regarding repurposing the Engineering Entrepreneurs Program meeting space to accommodate a new hire.&nbsp;</p><p>“What came back was a sickening nuclear bomb of retaliation the likes of which could not be believed,” Brain wrote. “[Misra] excommunicated me from my department for reporting my concerns to her.”</p><p>Misra did not respond to Technician’s request for comment. Jim Pfaendtner, dean of the College of Engineering, responded on her behalf and referred Technician to Kulikowski.&nbsp;</p><p>Brain wrote he received an email a few weeks later from Srinath Ekkad, head of the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, saying the department would no longer recommend students participate in Brain’s Engineering Entrepreneurs Program.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Brain wrote that, after outlining his concerns to Ekkad about this message, Markham informed Brain he would be taking disciplinary action against him for “unacceptable behavior.”&nbsp;</p><p>Brandon Kashani, Brain’s former student and a startup mentor at NC State’s entrepreneurship clinic, received Brain’s email along with more than 30 others both within and outside of the University. Kashani said he met with Brain on Nov. 15, where Brain detailed the situation and correspondence with the University. Kashani described Brain as “heartbroken.”&nbsp;</p><p>“He felt like his reputation was tarnished, like everything he worked for was ruined, and the root of all that was he didn't get any support from the University, the University that he put all his life — the last 12 years — towards,” Kashani said. “And all he wanted to do was be heard.”</p><p>Brain wrote in the email that he believed the ethics complaint system’s framework was not properly used in addressing his concerns. The complaints were submitted through EthicsPoint, a reporting tool used by employees to report ethical concerns.&nbsp;</p><p>“My career has been destroyed by multiple administrators at NCSU who united together and completely ignored the EthicsPoint System and its promises to employees,” Brain wrote. “I did what the University told me to do, and then these administrators ruined my life for it.”</p><p>Kashani said Brain submitted numerous complaints through the EthicsPoint system and said tensions arose because Brain didn’t “play the political game” through his questioning of higher-ranking administrators.&nbsp;</p><p>“Marshall was caught in an imbalanced group of people with more power than him, and they didn't like him calling them out,” Kashani said. “... He was keeping people accountable. He didn't understand that political aspect of it, and they just wanted to get rid of him.”&nbsp;</p><p>Kevin Barry, Brain’s former student and a member of the Board of Advisors for NC State’s Innovation and Entrepreneurship Leadership program, said Brain was pivotal in the lives of students in this program and beyond.&nbsp;</p><p>“Marshall was a cornerstone of entrepreneurship at NC State, and a very key person who dedicated himself and was a real entrepreneur, and really dedicated himself to the students,” Barry said. “And he, through and through, down to the bone, had that love and desire to help students. So to see what's going on with him is just absolutely devastating and disgusting.”&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Both Barry and Kashani said they are disappointed in the lack of a public statement from the University surrounding Brain’s death.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">“It's been six days now, which is insane,” Kashani said. “And I know a lot of people are reaching out. There’s a lot of pressure, but there hasn't been any acknowledgement of mistakes that were made, systems that failed, no resignations, not even a call to celebrate Marshall's achievements.”&nbsp;</p><p>While Brain’s University <a href="https://entrepreneurship.ncsu.edu/people/mdbrain-2/">biography</a> remains on the Innovation and Entrepreneurship website, his page on the Computer and Electrical Engineering website <a href="https://ece.ncsu.edu/people/mdbrain/">no longer exists</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">This is a developing story.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>If you or someone you know is having difficulty processing grief or having a mental health emergency, the Counseling Center can be reached 24 hours a day at 919-515-2423.

    <div>
                      
                      
          
<p>Lobby groups for Internet service providers claim that ISPs' customer service is so good already that the government shouldn't consider any new regulations to mandate improvements. They also claim ISPs face so much competition that market forces require providers to treat their customers well or lose them to competitors.</p>
<p>Cable lobby group NCTA-The Internet &amp; Television Association told the Federal Communications Commission in a <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1122573117031/1">filing</a> that "providing high-quality products and services and a positive customer experience is a competitive necessity in today's robust communications marketplace. To attract and retain customers, NCTA's cable operator members continuously strive to ensure that the customer support they provide is effective and user-friendly. Given these strong marketplace imperatives, new regulations that would micromanage providers’ customer service operations are unnecessary."</p>
<p>Lobby groups filed comments in response to an FCC review of customer service that was <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-review-customer-support-offered-consumers">announced last month</a>, before the presidential election. While the FCC's current Democratic leadership is interested in regulating customer service practices, the Republicans who will soon take over opposed the inquiry.</p>
<p>USTelecom, which represents telcos such as AT&amp;T and Verizon, <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1122191898118/1">said</a> that "the competitive broadband marketplace leaves providers of broadband and other communications services no choice but to provide their customers with not only high-quality broadband, but also high-quality customer service."</p>
<p>"If a provider fails to efficiently resolve an issue, they risk losing not only that customer—and not just for the one service, but potentially for all of the bundled services offered to that customer—but also any prospective customers that come across a negative review online. Because of this, broadband providers know that their success is dependent upon providing and maintaining excellent customer service," USTelecom wrote.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>While the FCC Notice of Inquiry said that providers should "offer live customer service representative support by phone within a reasonable timeframe," USTelecom's filing touted the customer service abilities of AI chatbots. "AI chat agents will only get better at addressing customers' needs more quickly over time—and if providers fail to provide the customer service and engagement options that their customers expect and fail to resolve their customers' concerns, they may soon find that the consumer is no longer a customer, having switched to another competitive offering," the lobby group said.</p>
<h2>Say what?</h2>
<p>The lobby groups' description may surprise the many Internet users suffering from little competition and poor customer service, such as CenturyLink users who had to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/centurylink-left-users-with-no-service-for-two-months-then-billed-them-239/">go without service</a> for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/centurylink-left-customers-without-internet-for-39-days-until-ars-stepped-in/">over a month</a> because of the ISP's failure to fix outages. The FCC received very different takes on the state of ISP customer service from regulators in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>The Mt. Hood Cable Regulatory Commission in northwest Oregon, where Comcast is the dominant provider, <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1121865526241/1">told the FCC</a> that local residents complain about automated customer service representatives; spending hours on hold while attempting to navigate automated voice systems; billing problems including "getting charged after cancelling service, unexpected price increases, and being charged for equipment that was returned," and service not being restored quickly after outages.</p>
<p>The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/112272893230/1">told the FCC</a> that it performed a recent analysis finding "that only a fraction of California households enjoy access to a highly competitive market for [broadband Internet service], with only 26 percent of households having a choice between two or more broadband providers utilizing either cable modem or fiber optic technologies." The California agency said the result "suggests that competitive forces alone are insufficient to guarantee service quality for customers who depend upon these services."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>CPUC said its current rulemaking efforts for California "will establish standards for service outages, repair response time, and access to live representatives." The agency told the FCC that if it adopts new customer service rules for the whole US, it should "permit state and local governments to set customer service standards that exceed the adopted standards."</p>

<h2>People with disabilities need more help, groups say</h2>
<p>The FCC also received a <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/11221938607468/1">filing</a> from several advocacy groups focused on accessibility for people with disabilities. The groups asked for rules "establishing baseline standards to ensure high-quality DVC [direct video calling for American Sign Language users] across providers, requiring accommodations for consumers returning rental equipment, and ensuring accessible cancellation processes." The groups said that "providers should be required to maintain dedicated, well-trained accessibility teams that are easily reachable via accessible communication channels, including ASL support."</p>
<p>"We strongly caution against relying solely on emerging AI technologies without mandating live customer service support," the groups said.</p>
<p>The FCC's <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-24-110A1.pdf">Notice of Inquiry</a> on customer service was approved 3–2 in a party-line vote on October 10. FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-24-110A2.pdf">said</a> that hundreds of thousands of customers file complaints each year "because they have run into issues cancelling their service, are saddled with unexpected charges, are upset by unexplained outages, and are frustrated with billing issues they have not been able to resolve on their own. Many describe being stuck in 'doom loops' that make it difficult to get a real person on the line to help with service that needs repair or to address charges they believe are a mistake."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>If the FCC leadership wasn't changing hands, the Notice of Inquiry could be the first step toward a rulemaking. "We cannot ignore these complaints, especially not when we know that it is possible to do better... We want to help improve the customer experience, understand what tools we have to do so, and what gaps there may be in the law that prevent consumers from having the ability to resolve routine problems quickly, simply, and easily," Rosenworcel said.</p>
<h2>ISPs have a friend in Trump admin</h2>
<p>But the proceeding won't go any further under incoming Chairman Brendan Carr, a Republican chosen by President-elect Donald Trump. Carr <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-24-110A3.pdf">dissented</a> from the Notice of Inquiry, saying that the potential actions explored by the FCC exceed its authority and that the topic should be handled instead by the Federal Trade Commission.</p>
<p>Carr said the FCC should work instead on "freeing up spectrum and eliminating regulatory barriers to deployment" and that the Notice of Inquiry is part of "the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to deflect attention away from the necessary course correction."</p>
<p>Carr has made it clear that he is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/trumps-fcc-chair-is-brendan-carr-who-wants-to-regulate-everyone-except-isps/">interested in regulating</a> broadcast media and social networks more than the telecom companies the FCC traditionally focuses on. Carr wrote a chapter for the conservative Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 in which he <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/trumps-likely-fcc-chair-wrote-project-2025-chapter-on-how-hed-run-the-agency/">criticized the FCC</a> for "impos[ing] heavy-handed regulation rather than relying on competition and market forces to produce optimal outcomes."</p>
<p>With Carr at the helm, ISPs are likely to get what they're asking for: No new regulations and elimination of at least some current rules. "Rather than saddling communications providers with unnecessary, unlawful, and potentially harmful regulation, the Commission should encourage the pro-consumer benefits of competition by reducing the regulatory burdens and disparities that are currently unfairly skewing the marketplace," the NCTA told the FCC, arguing that cable companies face more onerous regulations than other communications providers.</p>

However, since they have reached end-of-life status (EoL), the company says it will not be releasing any patches, and advises users to replace the endpoints with newer models.</p><p>The news comes shortly after we reported multiple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/d-link-says-it-wont-fix-a-serious-security-flaw-affecting-60-000-older-nas-devices" target="_blank" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/d-link-says-it-wont-fix-a-serious-security-flaw-affecting-60-000-older-nas-devices">D-Link NAS</a> endpoints were found vulnerable to CVE-2024-10914, a command injection flaw with a 9.2 severity score - however the company again said it wouldn’t be issuing a fix, since the affected devices have all reached EoL.</p><p>Now, security researcher Chaio-Lin Yu (Steven Meow) found three bugs plaguing the D-Link DSL6740C modem. One is tracked as CVE-2024-11068, has a severity score of 9.8, and allows threat actors to change passwords through privileged API access. The other two are CVE-2024-11067, and CVE-2024-11066, and are a path traversal flaw and a remote code execution (RCE) flaw, with 7.5 and 7.2 scores, respectively.</p><h2 id="tens-of-thousands-of-vulnerable-endpoints-3">Tens of thousands of vulnerable endpoints</h2><p>Roughly 60,000 vulnerable devices are currently connected to the internet, the majority being located in Taiwan.

With that in mind, D-Link said it wouldn’t be addressing the flaw, and suggests "retiring and replacing D-Link devices that have reached EOL/EOS."</p><p>The same model is also vulnerable to four additional high-severity command injection flaws, the publication states, citing information from the Taiwanese computer and response center (TWCERTCC). These flaws are tracked as CVE-2024-11062, CVE-2024-11063, CVE-2024-11064, and CVE-2024-11065.</p><p>Users who are unable to replace their routers at the moment are advised to at least restrict remote access, and set secure access passwords, to minimize the chance of compromise.

            Three high schoolers and their mentor revisited a century-old theorem to prove that all knots can be found in a fractal called the Menger sponge.        </p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div data-role="selectable">
    <p>In the fall of 2021, <a href="https://malors.com/">Malors Espinosa</a> set out to devise a special type of math problem. As with any good research question, it would have to be thought-provoking, its solution nontrivial — something others would want to study. But an additional constraint stumped him. Malors, then a graduate student in mathematics at the University of Toronto, wanted high school students to be able to prove it.</p>
<p>For years, Malors had been running summer workshops for local high schoolers, teaching them about basic ideas in mathematical research and showing them how to write proofs. But a few of his students seemed ready to do more — to find out what it means to do math when there is no answer key. They just needed the right question to guide them.</p>
<p>Malors finally found one while reading a textbook about chaos. In its pages, he came across a familiar object: a fractal, or self-similar shape, called the Menger sponge, which has a simple but elegant construction. First divide a cube into what looks like a Rubik’s cube. Remove the cube in the very center, along with the center cube of each of the six faces. Then repeat this process for each of the 20 remaining cubes. And repeat. And repeat. You’ll quickly see why the resulting fractal is called a sponge: With each iteration, its pores multiply exponentially.</p>

    <p>Ever since Karl Menger introduced his fractal sponge nearly a century ago, it has captured the imaginations of professional and amateur mathematicians alike. One reason: It looks cool. In 2014, hundreds of math enthusiasts participated in a global effort, called MegaMenger, to build finite, 200-pound versions of the sponge out of business cards. Because of its porous, foam-like structure, the sponge has also been used to model shock absorbers and exotic forms of space-time.</p>
<p>But most important, the fractal possesses various counterintuitive mathematical properties. Continue to pluck out ever smaller pieces, and what started off as a cube becomes something else entirely. After infinitely many iterations, the shape’s volume dwindles to zero, while its surface area grows infinitely large. Such is the weirdness of fractals: hovering somewhere between dimensions, occupying space without truly filling it.</p>

    <p>When he first defined his sponge in 1926, Menger also proved that any conceivable curve — simple lines and circles, structures that look like trees or snowflakes, fractal dusts — can be deformed and then embedded somewhere on the sponge. They can be made to wind their way along the sponge’s convoluted contours without ever leaving its surface, hitting a hole, or intersecting themselves. The sponge, Menger wrote, was therefore a “universal curve.”</p>
<p>But this, Malors later realized, raised a new question. Menger had proved that you could find a circle in his sponge. But what about objects that were equivalent, in a certain sense, to the circle? Consider a mathematical knot: a string that’s been twisted and tied up, its ends then closed to form a loop. From the outside, it might look like a tangled mess. But an ant walking along it would eventually find itself back where it started, just as it would on a circle. In this way, every knot is equivalent, or “homeomorphic,” to a circle.</p>

                            <p>Every knot is “homeomorphic” to the circle, meaning that it’s possible to map the points from one to the other while satisfying a simple set of conditions.</p>

    </figure>
<div data-role="selectable">
    <p>Menger’s statement didn’t distinguish between homeomorphic curves. His proof only guaranteed, for instance, that the circle could be found in his sponge — not that all homeomorphic knots could be, their loops and tangles still intact. Malors wanted to prove that you could find every knot within the sponge.</p>
<p>It seemed like the right mashup to excite young mathematicians. They’d recently had fun learning about knots in his seminar. And who doesn’t love a fractal? The question was whether the problem would be approachable. “I really hoped there was an answer,” Malors said.</p>
<p>There was. After just a few months of weekly Zoom meetings with Malors, three of his high school students — Joshua Broden, Noah Nazareth and Niko Voth — were able to show that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03639">all knots can indeed be found inside the Menger sponge</a>. Moreover, they found that the same can likely be said of another related fractal, too.</p>
<p>“It’s a clever way of putting things together,” said <a href="https://sazdanovic.wordpress.ncsu.edu/">Radmila Sazdanovic<span>,</span></a> a topologist at North Carolina State University who was not involved in the work. In revisiting Menger’s century-old theorem, she added, Malors — who usually does research in the disparate field of number theory — had apparently asked a question that no one thought to ask before. “This is a very, very original idea,” she said.</p>
<h2><strong>A Different Way to See Knots</strong></h2>
<p>Broden, Nazareth and Voth had taken several of Malors’ summer workshops over the years. When he first taught them about knots in an earlier workshop, “it blew 14-year-old me’s mind,” said Voth.</p>
<p>But the Menger problem would be their first time moving beyond school workbooks with answer keys. “It was a little bit nerve-racking, because it was the first time I was doing something where truly nobody has the answer, not even Malors,” said Nazareth. Maybe there was no answer at all.</p>
<p>Their goal was essentially to thread a microscopic sewing needle through a cloud of dust — the material that remained of the sponge after many removals. They would have to stick the pin in the right places, tie the knotted tangles with immaculate precision, and never leave the sponge. If their thread ended up floating in the empty holes of the sponge for any knot, it was game over.</p>
<p>Not an easy task. But there was a way to simplify it. Knots can be depicted on a flat piece of paper as special diagrams called arc presentations. To create one, you start with information about how the strands of your knot pass in front of or behind each other. Then you apply a set of rules to translate this information into a series of points on a grid. Every row and column of the grid will contain exactly two points.</p>

    <p>Every knot can be represented in this gridlike way. Even though an arc presentation can sometimes look more complicated than other ways of drawing the knot, it makes it easier for mathematicians to study some of the knot’s most important properties.</p>
<p>When the students considered the diagrams of crisscrossing lines, they were reminded of the faces of the Menger sponge. It would be straightforward enough to place the horizontal lines of an arc presentation on one face of the sponge and the vertical lines on its opposite face. The difficulty would be in figuring out how to connect the knot — how to stretch it back into three dimensions. At every one of the arc presentation’s corners, the two faces would need to be connected through the interior of the sponge without accidentally hitting a hole.</p>
<p>To make sure that this was always possible, the mathematicians turned to what’s known as the Cantor set, a one-dimensional analog of the Menger sponge. To construct the set, start with a line segment and divide it into thirds. Remove the middle third, then do the same to the remaining two segments, and so on, ad infinitum. You’ll be left with a scattering of points.</p>

        <div>
                            <p><img src="https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Knots_in_Fractals-Fig7-crMarkBelan-Desktop-v2-12.svg" alt="" decoding="async"><img src="https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Knots_in_Fractals-Fig5-crMarkBelan-Desktop-v1.svg" alt="" decoding="async">                </p>

<div data-role="selectable">
    <p>The team considered both a Menger sponge and a Cantor set that have undergone the same number of removal steps. At points on the sponge’s faces whose coordinates are both in the Cantor set, they realized, there shouldn’t be a hole. What’s more, there shouldn’t be holes anywhere directly behind those points either, thanks to the sponge’s repetitive design. A knot would therefore be free and clear to pass through without accidentally jumping off the material of the sponge.</p>
<p>All that was left, then, was for the students to show that they could always compress or stretch a given knot’s arc presentation so that all of its corners would line up with coordinates in the Cantor set. (Such compressing and stretching was allowed because it wouldn’t affect the arc presentation’s overall structure and, therefore, what knot it represents.)</p>
<p>To complete this final step, Broden, Nazareth and Voth took a shortcut. They proved that they could deform any arc presentation so that the points where its vertical and horizontal segments crossed were in the Cantor set. This automatically guaranteed that the larger number of corners would line up with the Cantor set, too. In other words, they could always embed a given knot in some iteration of the Menger sponge.</p>

            <p>Now that they’d answered Malors’ original question, they wanted to push their result further. They’d already started to investigate whether all knots could also be embedded in a tetrahedral version of the Menger sponge:</p>
        </div>

    </figure>
<div data-role="selectable">
    <p>“It was surprisingly annoying,” Broden said. Without the convenience of faces aligned directly opposite one another, their method for pushing knots through the fractal would no longer work.</p>
<h2><strong>Measured by Knots</strong></h2>
<p>It was at this stage, according to Malors, that the students learned the pain of math research — that a large part of the discipline involves struggling with the failure of a promising avenue of attack. “We’re facing math, and math has no mercy,” he said. “With math as presented to high schoolers, they’re usually protected from that.”</p>
<p>Malors, for his part, was convinced that a so-called trefoil knot couldn’t be found in the tetrahedron. During a Zoom call, the three students pushed back. They left the meeting, they recalled, feeling dispirited and frustrated. But they decided to stick to their instincts. A couple weeks later, to Malors’ surprise, they returned with a result: They had figured out a new way to map the trefoil knot’s arc presentation into the tetrahedron. They later proved that this could be done for all “pretzel” knots, the more general class of knots that the trefoil belongs to — although the question remains open for other kinds of knots.</p>
        
        
<p>Malors conjectures that the students’ methods might offer a way to measure the complexity of fractals more broadly. Not all fractals are guaranteed to admit all kinds of knots. Perhaps their structure can be better understood based on what types of knots they can and cannot hold.</p>
<p>At the very least, the work could inspire new art, akin to the 2014 MegaMenger contest. “It would be lovely to see this constructed out of physical materials,” said <a href="https://people.vcu.edu/~moorea14/">Allison Moore</a>, a knot theorist at Virginia Commonwealth University.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Broden, Nazareth and Voth have all graduated high school. Only Broden has decided to continue working on the tetrahedron problem — when he’s not busy with college coursework — but all three are considering math careers. “It feels meaningful that I’m trying to contribute to something bigger than myself, to the nature of truth,” Nazareth said. It all starts with asking the right question.</p>

<p>Large language models (LLMs) like Chat-GPT and Claude.ai are whizzy and cool.
A lot of people think that they are going to be The Future.  Maybe they are —
but that doesn't mean that building them is going to be a profitable business.</p>
<!-- This is the tricky bit about technologies.  Just because your technology gets -->

<!-- adopted, it does not folllow that you make much money.  Web browsers have -->

<!-- nearer 100% adoption than probably any piece of software around.  They are also -->

<!-- genuinely hard to make.  So they must be pretty profitable, right?  No - they -->

<!-- are a huge money loser.  The web browser business is so bad that few would even -->

<!-- count it as a business at all. -->

<p>In the 1960s, airlines were The Future.  That is why old films have so many
swish shots of airports in them.  Airlines though, turned out to be an
unavoidably rubbish business.  I've flown on loads of airlines that have gone
bust: Monarch, WOW Air, Thomas Cook, Flybmi, Zoom.  And those are all busts
from before coronavirus - times change but being an airline is always a bad
idea.</p>
<p>That's odd, because other businesses, even ones which seem really stupid, are
much more profitable.  Selling fizzy drinks is, surprisingly, an amazing
business.  Perhaps the best.  Coca-cola's return on equity has rarely fallen
below 30% in any given year.  That seems very unfair because being an airline
is hard work but making coke is pretty easy.  It's even more galling because
Coca-cola don't actually make the coke themselves - that is outsourced to
"bottling companies".  They literally just sell it.</p>
<h2>Industry structure - what makes a business good</h2>
<p>If you were to believe LinkedIn you would think a great business is made with
efficiency, hard work, innovation or some other intrinsic reason to do with how
hardworking, or clever, the people in the business are.  That simply is not the
case.</p>
<p>What makes a good business is industry structure.</p>
<h3>Airlines - unfavourable industry structure</h3>
<p>To be an airline is to be in an almost uniquely terrible market position.
For starters, there are only two makers of aeroplanes (Airbus and Boeing).  For
reasons of training and staff efficiency, you have to commit to one or the
other, which gives the aeroplane makers very strong pricing power.</p>
<p>And buyers of airline tickets are incredibly fickle and have no loyalty.  They will
switch from one "carrier" to another over even small differences in price.
Annoyingly, there are loads of other airlines and they're all running the same
routes as you!</p>
<p>Worse yet, starting a new airline is surprisingly easy.  Aircraft hold their
value so banks will happily lend against them.  There are loads of staff
available that new entrants can hire.  So randos will continually enter your
market, often selling tickets below cost for quite a while before they go bust.
And to top it off, there are plenty of substitutes for air travel - from
government-subsidised high speed trains to Zoom calls.</p>
<p>Airlines that get more efficient, work harder or come up with innovations
aren't going to be able to "capture" the value of what they've done.  If you
make more than the bare minimum to survive Airbus will notice that you're being
undercharged and you'll find that the next renewal on your service contract
eats up the difference.</p>
<h3>Fizzy-drinks - very favourable industry structure</h3>
<p>Being the Coca-cola company is pretty great though.</p>
<p>Coke is just water, colourant, flavouring, caffeine and sweetner.  Those are
all widely available and really cheap.  And as I said, you don't even have to
combine them yourselves - bottling companies will do that for you for almost
nothing.</p>
<p>Handily, consumers are really picky about what goes in their mouth.  The
unofficial motto of your main competitor is "Is Pepsi ok?".  This is despite
the fact that they are identical in both taste and colour.  And a significant
minority of people actually say no!</p>
<p>And it isn't easy for new competitors to enter the market.  They can't call
their new drink "coke" due to trademarks.  They have to call it something else.
And consumers will generally refuse it because drinking an alternative is
considered some kind of weird statement.</p>
<h2>What is industry structure?</h2>
<p>Classically, there are five basic parts ("forces") to a company's position:</p>
<ol>
<li>The power of their <strong>suppliers</strong> to increase their prices</li>
<li>The power of their <strong>buyers</strong> to reduce your prices</li>
<li>The strength of <strong>direct competitors</strong></li>
<li>The threat of any <strong>new entrants</strong></li>
<li>The threat of <strong>substitutes</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It's industry structure that makes a business profitable or not.  Not
efficiency, not hard work and not innovation.</p>
<p>If none of the forces are very much against you, your business will do ok.  If
they are all against you, you'll be in the position of the airlines.  And if
they're all in your favour: brill, you're Coca-cola.</p>
<h2>The industry structure of LLM makers: OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini/etc</h2>
<p>So is the position of LLM makers any good?  I'm afraid it's not good news.</p>
<p>LLM makers sometimes imply that their suppliers are cloud companies like Amazon
Web Services, Google Cloud, etc.  That wouldn't be so bad because you could
shop around and make them compete to cut the huge cost of model training.</p>
<p>Really though, LLM makers have only one true supplier: NVIDIA.  NVIDIA make the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopper_(microarchitecture)">chips</a> that all
models are trained on - regardless of cloud vendor.  And that gives NVIDIA
colossal, near total pricing power.  NVIDIA are more powerful relative to
Anthropic or OpenAI than Airbus or Boeing could ever dream of being.</p>
<p>How much power do buyers have over LLM token prices?  So far, it seems fairly
high.  Most LLM users seem willing to change from Chat-GPT to Claude, for
example.  It doesn't seem like brand loyalty is being built up.  And companies
that build AI into their businesses are starting to do so via abstraction
layers that allow them to switch model easily.  That makes LLMs
interchangeable - which is bad for those who sell them.</p>
<p>What's the strength of direct competitors?  Again, it is considerable.  There
are loads of LLM vendors and pricing <a href="https://a16z.com/llmflation-llm-inference-cost/">appears
competitive</a>.  Worst of all,
Facebook basically dump their model on the market for no cost.  It's
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars#First_browser_war_(1995%E2%80%932001)">reminiscent of Internet
Explorer</a> -
not exactly a great portent.</p>
<p>And it seems fairly easy for new entrants to build brand new models.  That is
why there are so many LLM makers.  Most of the techniques for making LLMs are
openly published in papers.  Even bad models can gain customers if they are
cheap, which allows new entrants to gain a foothold.</p>
<p>The situation on substitutes is mixed.  Instead of having Chat-GPT write some
text you could pay a person to do it instead.  That is likely to be much more
expensive but also less likely to hallucinate, which might be important for
some usecases (law is the field least likely to use LLMs).  And then there is
the trend that <a href="https://calpaterson.com/metadata.html">metadata tends to displace artificial
intelligence</a> once particular application has been proved out -
so as soon as you find a solid usecase you stand to be replaced.</p>
<p>A single mildly positive point does not make a profitable business.  LLM makers
look a lot more like Netscape - who invented graphical web browsers, then went
bust - than Google, who made something good that ran on top of the the web
browsers.</p>
<h2>How are they raising so much money?</h2>
<p>If LLM makers seem cursed to an airline-style business destiny, how come they
are able to raise so much money?  OpenAI <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-closes-66-billion-funding-haul-valuation-157-billion-with-investment-2024-10-02/">raised $6.6
billion</a>
at a valuation of $157 billion less than two months ago.  That might be the
biggest VC round of all time.</p>
<p>What do they know that I don't?  It is a mystery - but let's consider the
options.</p>
<p>Perhaps they are hoping to develop their own chips to reduce their dependance
on NVIDIA.  $6.6 billion is not enough to build a new fab but it might be
enough to get a new chip designed which allows them to migrate off NVIDIA.
That would save them paying so much money for GPU time.  But, NVIDIA are
actually one of the investors in the round (although only a fairly small
amount) - so it's unlikely "develop an NVIDIA competitor" was on any of the
pitch deck slides.</p>
<p>Perhaps OpenAI are hoping to build a strong brand so that customers won't
switch to competitors so easily.  It's not impossible, there is proof the
<a href="https://calpaterson.com/amazon-premium.html">branding</a> and lock-in can work in technology - but it
seems difficult to manage given that LLMs themselves generically have a textual
interface - meaning that there is no real API as such - you just send text, and
it sends text back.</p>
<p>Can they do anything about new entrants?  Possibly.  If investing $6.6bn allows
them to develop a major improvement in their model then that would raise
everyone else's costs considerably and probably force some of their smaller
competitors out of the market.  The trouble is the money is the most fungible
of all goods (that is the point, after all) and that $6.6bn is not all that
much of it.  So this round wouldn't, by itself, be enough to dissuate others.
I used to work at a bank and I can tell you that individual bond raises can be
a lot more than $6.6bn.</p>
<p>It's worth saying that even companies that raise huge sums of money sometimes
turn out to have no viable business.  WeWork ultimately raised over $10bn at a
valuation of $47bn before it was realised that their business simply did not
make sense.  WeWork were valued at just $0.56bn in their most recent financial
restructuring - having lost well over 95% of what was invested.</p>
<h2>Not all AI companies are doomed</h2>
<p>If LLM makers aren't going to be good businesses, does that bode ill for The
Future?</p>
<p>Firstly, it does not mean the technology will be bad.  Whether the technology
ends up being good or not is mostly unrelated to whether Open
AI/Anthropic/Mistral/whoever makes any money off it.  Container virtualisation
technology is pretty well developed even though Docker made almost nothing on
it.  Web browsers are extremely advanced pieces of software even though making
a browser is such a bad business that most don't usually count it as a business
at all.  And CRMs are terrible despite the fact that Salesforce is tremendously
successful.  Technology success and business success are mostly unrelated.</p>
<p>And then: not all AI businesses are building models.  Ideally, if I were
running an AI business I would avoid building a model at all costs.  Building
your own models looks like a undifferentiated schlep.  Using a tiny bit of some
expensively trained model that Anthropic has produced could be very cost
effective and might make some business idea work that wouldn't have 5 years
ago.</p>
<h2>Beware software companies that aren't software companies</h2>
<p>Software companies are really good businesses.  You have no real suppliers,
your software is often unique (so no competitors) and the substitute is just
users doing the job themselves.  For this reason, software companies tend have
really great margins.</p>
<p>The problem is that not all technology companies are software companies.  If
you have a hugely powerful single supplier like NVIDIA then the economics of
your company are going to less like Microsoft Office and more like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Am">Pan-Am</a>.</p>

<h2>Other notes</h2>
<p>The AI safety movement is a fantastic hypeman for LLMs as a technology.
Implying (pretty dubiously) that we are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Clock">10 minutes from
midnight</a> in some kind of
Ghost-in-The-Shell style AI crisis is in fact an extremely effective form of
product marketing.  Perhaps that is why OpenAI and others employ so many AI
safety specialists.</p>
<p>The Coca-cola company mainly sit back and rake in the megabucks - but they do
spend a little bit of their earnings on research.  And a little bit of a lot is
still significant.  It's interesting that that coke's market research has
discovered that coke works better as a gender segregated product: Coke Zero is
Diet Coke, but for men.</p>
<p>If you want to read more about industry structure and market strategy, the
place to start is with Michael Porter.  He reworked his famous essay <a href="https://hbr.org/2008/01/the-five-competitive-forces-that-shape-strategy">The Five
Forces that Shape Corporate
Strategy</a>
in 2008.  It's not the last word, but it probably should be the first word you
read if you want to learn more.  And if you like it, he has a lot more.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Justice Department has ordered the Drug Enforcement Administration to suspend its longstanding practice of searching passengers at airports — and seizing their cash — after the department’s internal watchdog raised concerns&nbsp;that it was fueling&nbsp;widespread civil rights violations and potential racial profiling.</p><p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://oig.justice.gov/news/doj-oig-releases-management-alert-identifying-concerns-deas-transportation-interdiction" target="_blank">management directive</a>&nbsp;issued&nbsp;on&nbsp;Thursday, the Justice Department’s Office of the Inspector General said it had been hearing complaints about the searches for years — and had recently learned new information that suggested there were significant problems&nbsp;with them, including potential constitutional violations.</p><p>The IG&nbsp;found&nbsp;that&nbsp;the&nbsp;program “creates substantial risks that DEA Special Agents and Task Force Officers will conduct these activities improperly; impose unwarranted burdens on, and violate the legal rights of, innocent travelers.” It&nbsp;also found that the searches “waste law enforcement resources on ineffective interdiction actions.”</p><p>In response, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco ordered that the searches be suspended&nbsp;pending an internal&nbsp;evaluation.</p><p>The DEA concurred with most of the report’s recommendations but declined to comment.</p><p>The inspector general found that DEA agents and their local police partners have been stopping passengers at airports solely because they bought a last-minute ticket — and demanding, without a warrant, to search their bags.&nbsp;</p><p>The searches are supposed to be voluntary, but the report&nbsp;found that the timing of the operations&nbsp;created a&nbsp;de facto&nbsp;threat in that refusing&nbsp;to agree to a search&nbsp;could cause passengers to miss their flights. If the agents found cash, they&nbsp;seized it through civil forfeiture — a legal process that places&nbsp;the onus on the passenger to prove it was not connected to drugs in order to get it back.</p><p>The IG said investigators could not come to any conclusions about whether the searches involved racial profiling because the DEA&nbsp;does not collect&nbsp;data on all the people it stops — only on the cases in which money is seized.</p><p>“The Department has long been concerned — and long received complaints — about potential racial profiling in connection with cold consent encounters in transportation setting,” the report said, adding that the DEA between 2000 and 2003 “collected consensual encounter data on every encounter in certain mass transportation facilities as part of a Department pilot project to examine the use of race in law enforcement operations.”</p><p>But neither the DEA nor the Justice Department “drew any conclusions from the data collected about whether the consensual encounters were being conducted in an unbiased manner, and in 2003 the DEA terminated its data collection efforts,” the report said, and “its consensual encounter activities continued.”&nbsp;</p><h2>A search in Cincinnati</h2><p>The IG report highlighted an incident documented in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XBzV0bDZdQ" target="_blank">video</a>&nbsp;released four months ago by the Institute for Justice,&nbsp;a nonprofit civil liberties law firm&nbsp;which is pursuing a class action lawsuit against the DEA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The passenger,&nbsp;who was in&nbsp;the Cincinnati airport&nbsp;and flying&nbsp;to New York, recorded&nbsp;himself telling a DEA agent that he&nbsp;did&nbsp;not consent to a search of his bags.&nbsp;The&nbsp;agent&nbsp;replied&nbsp;that his consent&nbsp;wasn’t required&nbsp;and used&nbsp;what the institute called “illegal bullying tactics.” The video has been viewed more than 2.6 million times.</p><p>“You don’t have to consent,” the agent&nbsp;was recorded saying. “When you buy a last-minute ticket, we get alerts. … We have a lot of money and drugs going out of every airport to New York.”</p><p>The passenger ultimately agreed to the search after missing his flight.&nbsp;Nothing&nbsp;illegal was found.</p><p>The IG found that the search was based on a tip by an airline employee who passed on the names of passengers who had purchased flights 48 hours before departure.&nbsp;</p><p>That employee was being paid by the DEA a percentage of the cash seized, the IG found, and had received tens of thousands of dollars over several years.&nbsp;That arrangement is problematic, investigators concluded.</p><h2><strong>Lawsuit alleges rights violations</strong></h2><p>In January 2020,&nbsp;the Institute for Justice filed a class action suit against the DEA and the Transportation Security Administration, alleging that the agencies routinely violate airport travelers’ constitutional rights by confiscating their money without probable cause.</p><p>In some cases, the DEA has seized money only to have judges order the government to return it.&nbsp;In 2021, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/new-orleans-shoeshine-man-wins-legal-battle-over-30-000-n1282629" target="_blank">NBC News reported</a> that the DEA seized $30,000 in cash that an unemployed shoeshiner from New Orleans was carrying through the Columbus, Ohio, airport because his purchase of a truck had fallen through.&nbsp;Prosecutors later agreed to return the money after the Institute for Justice got involved.</p><p>In 2020, NBC Los Angeles&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/national-international/like-i-was-mugged-woman-says-agents-took-82k-from-her-at-airport/2293622/?fbclid=IwY2xjawGrH3BleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHQrWe7NLmZ1ZW5SzYTWO8ULicsfRePMX0X6ErCAVPyWO2wBZ1I_TSY3sAQ_aem_BjsZRwZS2mcNBR04r_WByg" target="_blank">reported</a>&nbsp;that&nbsp;$82,000&nbsp;was&nbsp;seized&nbsp;by the DEA&nbsp;from an elderly man and his daughter in Pittsburgh.</p><p>“The government took my dad’s life savings,” the daughter said. “It’s like I was mugged on the street.”&nbsp;</p><p>USA Today <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/08/10/dea-travel-record-airport-seizures/88474282/"

    <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hey HN! I'm Dex, building HumanLayer (<a href="https://humanlayer.dev/">https://humanlayer.dev</a>), an API that lets AI agents contact humans for feedback, input, and approvals. We enable safe deployment of autonomous/headless AI systems in production. You can try it with our Python or TypeScript SDKs and start using it immediately with a free trial. We have a free tier and transparent usage-based pricing. Here’s a demo: <a href="https://youtu.be/5sbN8rh_S5Q?t=51" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/5sbN8rh_S5Q?t=51</a></p><p>What's really exciting is that we're enabling teams to deploy AI systems that would otherwise be too risky. We let you focus on building powerful agents while knowing that critical steps will <i>always</i> get a human-in-the-loop. It's been dope seeing people start to think bigger when they consider dynamic human oversight as a key ingredient in production AI systems.</p><p>This started when we were building AI agents for data teams. We wanted to automate tedious tasks like dropping unused tables, but customers were (rightfully!) opposed to giving AI agents direct access to production systems.</p><p>Getting AI to "production grade" reliability is a function of "how risky is this task the AI is performing". We didn't have the 3+ months it would have taken to sink into evals, fine tuning, and prompt engineering to get to a point where the agent had 99.9+% reliability—and even then, getting decision makers comfortable with flipping the switch on was a challenge. So instead we built some basic approval flows, like "ask in Slack before dropping tables".</p><p>But this communication itself needed guardrails—what if the agent contacted the wrong person? How would the head of data look if a tool he bought sent a nagging Slack message to the CEO? Our buyers wanted the agent to ask stakeholders for approval, but first <i>they</i> wanted to approve the "ask for approval" action itself. And then I started thinking about it... as a product builder + owner, <i>I</i> wanted to approve the "ask for approval to ask for approval" action!</p><p>I hacked together a human-AI interaction that would handle each of these cases across both my and my customers' Slack instances. By this time, I was convinced that any team building AI agents would need this kind of infrastructure and decided to build it as a standalone product. I presented the MVP at an AI meetup in SF and had a ton of incredible conversations, and went all in on building HumanLayer.</p><p>When you integrate the HumanLayer SDK, your AI agent can request human approval at any point in its execution. We handle all the complexity of routing these requests to the right people through their preferred channels (Slack or email, SMS and Teams coming soon), managing state while waiting for responses, and providing a complete audit trail. In addition to "ask for approval", we also support a more generic "human as tool" function that can be exposed to an LLM or agent framework, and will handle collecting a human response to a generic question like "I'm stuck on $PROBLEM, I've tried $THINGS, please advise" (I get messages like this sometimes from in-house agents we rolled out for back-office automations).</p><p>Because it's at the tool-calling layer, HumanLayer's SDK works with any AI framework like CrewAI, LangChain, etc, and any language model that supports tool calling. If you're rolling your own agentic/tools loop, you can use lower level SDK primitives to manage approvals however you want. We're even exploring use cases where HumanLayer is used for human-to-human approval, not just AI-to-human.</p><p>We're already seeing HumanLayer used in some cool ways. One customer built an AI SDR that drafts personalized sales emails but asks for human approval in Slack before sending anything to prospects. Another uses it to power an AI newsletter where subscribers can have email conversations with the content. HumanLayer handles receiving inbound emails and routing them to agents that can respond, and giving those agents tools to do so. One team uses HumanLayer to build a customer-facing DevOps agent—their AI agent reviews PRs, plans and executes db migrations, all while getting human sign-off at critical steps and reaching out to the team for steering if it encounters any issues.</p><p>We have a free tier and flexible credits-based pricing. For teams building customer-facing agents, you get whitelabeling and additional features and priority support.</p><p>If you want to integrate HumanLayer into your systems, check out our docs at <a href="https://humanlayer.dev/docs">https://humanlayer.dev/docs</a> or book a demo at <a href="https://humanlayer.dev/">https://humanlayer.dev</a>.</p><p>Thank you for reading! We’re admittedly early and I welcome your ideas and experiences as it relates to agents, reliability, and balancing human+AI workloads.</p></div></td></tr>        <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td></td></tr>  </tbody></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-element="story-body" data-subscriber-content=""> <p>Schools have generally been working hard to meet the special educational needs of an array of students — those with learning disabilities, those learning English, those with behavioral issues and those whose households struggle with poverty. But they have widely neglected one major group of students with special needs: the academically gifted.</p><p>Many school districts around the country have <a href="https://www.teachforamerica.org/stories/gifted-programs-equity" target="_blank">dropped programs</a> for students who catch on quickly. The trend toward eliminating or scaling back such programs started about 15 years ago. But it picked up steam in 2021, when the Black Lives Matter movement made schools reckon with the discomfiting fact that they were far less likely to identify Black and Latino as gifted than they were white and Asian students.</p><p>Part of the problem was that the original purpose of gifted programs had been lost in parental competition for prestige and advantage. Unlike other special-education categories, the gifted label was coveted by parents. Classes and sometimes entire schools for gifted students often had richer curricula and more resources. They became classrooms for high achievers rather than for students properly defined as gifted.</p><p>These programs were originally meant to meet the needs of students with intense, often irregular learning patterns. They used to be seen as not needing special attention because they often excelled. As standardized testing required schools to aim for student proficiency, all the focus went to those who hadn’t met that mark. Those who exceeded it were deemed to be just fine.</p><p>But they’re not just fine. Gifted children, more than others, tend to shine in certain ways and struggle in others, a phenomenon known as <a href="https://www.sengifted.org/post/asynchronous-development" target="_blank">asynchronous development</a>. A third-grader’s reading skills might be at 11th-grade level while her social skills are more like a kindergartner’s. They often find it hard to connect with other children. They also are in danger of being turned off by school because the lessons move slowly.</p><p>I don’t know whether I would have been identified as gifted when I was a kid, but I certainly was bored out of my mind in elementary school. It felt as though everything was repeated to the point that paying attention in class was worthless. I started acting up simply to keep myself occupied. </p><p>My third-grade teacher tried a few strategies, including sending me on errands invented just to get me out of the classroom. Nothing worked. So they sent me on to fourth grade even though school policy prohibited it.</p><p>That was a disaster. I was cut off from my friends and anxious about constant grilling from adults and children asking why I was in the higher grade. It didn’t work academically, either. I enjoyed the challenge of catching up, but once that happened, school was boring again. The problem wasn’t third-grade material; it was the pace of learning.</p><p>When I started covering education in the late 1970s, it was a pleasant surprise to see this need being addressed — though it was a little off-putting to hear a 10-year-old describe herself as a “mentally gifted minor” at a school board meeting. “MGM” was the name given to the programs, later rebranded “GATE,” for Gifted and Talented Education.</p><p>It was never clear exactly what gifted education was, though. In some districts, it amounted to highly sought-after schools devoted to high achievers. Sometimes it was enrichment for certain students. Teachers were supposed to have special training, as any special-ed teacher would, but it seemed hit-or-miss. In the schools my kids attended, the gifted program basically meant extra homework.</p><p>When giftedness became a matter of prestige rather than a particular learning style and need, all bets were off. Maybe the problem was calling it “gifted” instead of “asynchronous development”; no one’s going to fight to get their kid into an asynchronous development program unless they need it.</p><p>There’s little doubt that racism played a role in identifying children as gifted even though the label was based on supposedly objective criteria. But the solution to that problem is to eliminate biases, not the programs themselves. </p><p>To its credit, the Los Angeles Unified School District has retained gifted education, with programs catering to different academic and creative skills. One is for highly gifted students, who may be well into college material in some areas while still high school sophomores. But proportional underenrollment of students of color led the district to relax its requirements for entry before it recently <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-11-11/admission-changes-lausd-honors-program-sparks-debate-academic-equity">reversed</a> course. The criteria should be fairly simple: whether a student needs to and can advance extremely quickly through academic material.</p><p>California <a href="https://reason.com/2023/10/04/california-state-guidelines-discourage-schools-from-offering-advanced-middle-school-math/" target="_blank">doesn’t require</a> schools to offer gifted programs and stopped funding them in 2013, so schools have little incentive to keep them. The answer certainly isn’t eliminating the programs entirely. It doesn’t seem to have helped to open them to all children either; that led some to slow down the pace, defeating their purpose.</p><p><a href="https://reason.com/2023/10/04/california-state-guidelines-discourage-schools-from-offering-advanced-middle-school-math/" target="_blank">Differentiated instruction</a> — in which a teacher tailors lessons to varying student needs — sounds good but is difficult to carry off in a large class. </p><p>My eldest child had the good fortune to be in a small program within her public school, open to all until the spaces were filled, that solved much of the differentiation problem. It involved few tests and many individual projects. Students chose their own books to read and report on. Their projects could be written reports or, if their talents lay elsewhere, movies, plays, songs or board games — as long as they showed they had learned the lesson at hand. It gave students free rein to work at their own level, avoid boredom and show off their talents.</p><p>But that program was run by two extremely gifted teachers who knew how to bring out the best in each student. It’s much easier to grade a test than to evaluate a project, and I don’t know how widely the program could be replicated. In any case, it no longer exists.</p><div data-list-id="00000192-be42-da32-a3db-ff76fc3b0000" data-module-id="00000192-be42-da32-a3db-ff76fc3b0000" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center="">  <p data-element="element-header" data-click="liZZListTitleCTA">  <h3 data-element="element-header-title" data-counter="3">More to Read </h3>  </p>      </div> </div></div>]]></description>

It is often used in malware to conceal malicious intent and avoid detection.</p><p>Various binary obfuscation strategies exist today, including:</p><ul><li>Removing comments / symbols</li><li>Adding opaque predicates (branches on a constant condition)</li><li>Control flow flattening</li><li>Virtualization</li></ul><p><strong>Virtualization</strong> is one of the most popular, and potent<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> forms of obfuscation today.</p><p>Various obfuscators including <a href="https://tigress.wtf/">Tigress</a>, <a href="https://www.oreans.com/Themida.php">Themida</a> and <a href="https://vmpsoft.com/">VMProtect</a> offer virtualization. Due to its potency and the high availability of obfuscators, virtualization has unfortunately been used by threat actors and found in numerous malware (<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/002/">source: MITRE</a>).</p><p>Here is a rough outline of the architecture of a virtualized obfuscated binary:</p><p><a href="https://blog.thalium.re/posts/img/llvm-powered-devirtualization/image.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://blog.thalium.re/posts/img/llvm-powered-devirtualization/image.png" alt="Virtualized binary schematized architecture"></a></p><p>In a virtualized binary, the original program gets encoded into a sequence of <em>virtual instructions</em>.
The obfuscated program is going to contain these <em>virtual instructions</em> as well as an <em>interpreter</em>.
The <em>interpreter</em> is responsible for executing the virtual instructions. It often contains distinctive components:</p><ul><li>a <em>VM entry</em> responsible for context switching and initializing the virtual CPU;</li><li>a <em>VM exit</em>, also for context switching;</li><li>a <em>dispatcher</em> which retrieves the <em>virtual instruction</em> at the <em>virtual program counter</em> (VPC), then sends the control flow to the appropriate <em>handler</em> for the given <em>virtual instruction</em>;</li><li><em>handlers</em>, which encode the semantics of the different <em>virtual instructions</em>.</li></ul><p>Virtual instructions can be anything ranging from logical operations (AND, XOR), control flow operations (JUMP, BRANCH) to more complex operations (see Schloegel <em>et. al.</em> <strong>Loki: Hardening Code Obfuscation Against Automated Attacks</strong> (<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/schloegel">usenix.org</a>)).</p><h2 id="devirtualization-strategy">Devirtualization strategy</h2><h3 id="manual-analysis">Manual analysis</h3><p>If you have ever been led to manually reverse engineering a VM (a program protected with virtualization), you know that it is often a long and complex task. If you haven’t, you can check out our other post <a href="https://blog.thalium.re/posts/ecw-2023-kaleidoscope-write-up/">kaleidoscope</a> and give it a try yourself!</p><p>The intuitive approach to devirtualization is usually to identify the VM context (e.g. where are located the virtual program counter and other virtual registers), reverse engineer each handler, and then create a custom disassembler for this VM.
We can then disassemble the virtual instructions and reverse engineer the original program.</p><p>This is extremely tedious, mainly because the architecture used in the VM may change in each obfuscated program.
Moreover, virtualized binaries can be further obfuscated, making it hard to identify and reverse engineer the handlers.
For example, a common hardening strategy is to encrypt the virtual instructions.</p><h3 id="automated-analysis">Automated analysis</h3><p>A different approach put forward by Yadegari <em>et al.</em> in their paper <strong>A Generic Approach to Automatic Deobfuscation of Executable Code</strong> (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7163054">ieee.org</a>) consists in using a dynamic taint analysis to reconstruct the original program’s CFG.
Jonathan Salwan <em>et al.</em> expanded this strategy in <strong>Symbolic deobfuscation: from virtualized code back to the original</strong> (<a href="https://shell-storm.org/talks/DIMVA2018-deobfuscation-salwan-bardin-potet.pdf">shell-storm.org</a>) by then leveraging symbolic execution and compiler optimizations to recreate a devirtualized program.</p><p>Our devirtualization approach was heavily inspired by these taint-based methods. Given the limited timeframe of the internship, we slightly simplified this approach. We also wanted to experiment with <strong>removing the symbolic execution component</strong> which is notoriously slow.</p><p>For our devirtualization, we perform a dynamic taint analysis on the obfuscated function, tainting its parameters.
We then split an execution trace of the obfuscated binary each time we encounter a tainted conditional instruction in the CFG (branches, <code>cmove</code>, etc.).
Finally, we combine these blocks to reconstruct a CFG.</p><p>This approach is not the most robust, but worked well for the Tigress obfuscated binaries we tested against (this will be further detailed in the <em>Results</em> section).</p><h3 id="example">Example</h3><p>The best way of explaining our approach is through an example.</p><p>Let’s consider we have a simple program:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="C"><span><span><span>int</span> <span>counter</span>(<span>int</span> input) {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>int</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span>;
</span></span><span><span>    <span>while</span> (i <span>&lt;</span> input) {
</span></span><span><span>        i <span>+=</span> <span>1</span>;
</span></span><span><span>    }
</span></span><span><span>    <span>return</span> i;
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Its CFG would look like this:</p><p><a href="https://blog.thalium.re/posts/img/llvm-powered-devirtualization/image-7.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://blog.thalium.re/posts/img/llvm-powered-devirtualization/image-7.png" alt="CFG of the counter function"></a></p><p>A virtualized version of this program could look like this:</p><p><a href="https://blog.thalium.re/posts/img/llvm-powered-devirtualization/image-8.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://blog.thalium.re/posts/img/llvm-powered-devirtualization/image-8.png" alt="CFG of the virtualized counter function"></a></p><p>The main elements of a VM are present in the above diagram.
Here, the virtual instructions (“opcodes”) are simply the handlers’ colors.</p><p>Note that the process of obfuscating this program added additional basic blocks (the hatched ones). These include operations that modify the VPC and the dispatcher.</p><h4 id="taint">Taint</h4><p>Performing a taint analysis on the above obfuscated program reveals that the red block (the branching instruction) is the only tainted instruction (it is the only one which interacts with the user input).</p><blockquote><p><em>This is a very simplified view: in a more complex program, the taint would get propagated during the execution.</em></p></blockquote><h4 id="execution-trace">Execution trace</h4><p>We then collect an execution trace of the obfuscated program with a random input (in this example we picked <code>2</code>):</p><p><a href="https://blog.thalium.re/posts/img/llvm-powered-devirtualization/image-10.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://blog.thalium.re/posts/img/llvm-powered-devirtualization/image-10.png" alt="Trace of the virtualized counter function"></a></p><p>These instructions are all consecutive, the arrows are simply to make the trace fit on screen.</p><p>Note that the trace depends on the input. Had we picked input <code>-1</code>, the trace would not contain the green block.</p><h4 id="splitting-the-trace">Splitting the trace</h4><p>At this stage, we can split the trace on the tainted CFG instructions (which we determined was the red block).</p><p>After splitting, our blocks look like this:</p><p><a href="https://blog.thalium.re/posts/img/llvm-powered-devirtualization/image-11.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://blog.thalium.re/posts/img/llvm-powered-devirtualization/image-11.png" alt="Split trace of the virtualized counter function"></a></p><p>As you can see, the second and the third groups of blocks are identical. We could therefore merge them.
Using various heuristics detailed in the complete report, we are able to merge and split blocks to create this final CFG:</p><p><a href="https://blog.thalium.re/posts/img/llvm-powered-devirtualization/image-12.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://blog.thalium.re/posts/img/llvm-powered-devirtualization/image-12.png" alt="Reconstructed CFG of the counter function"></a></p><h3 id="simplifying-the-cfg">Simplifying the CFG</h3><p>At this point, the CFG is still quite complex with many useless instructions. The next step in the deobfuscation process consists in simplifying the code using compiler optimizations.</p><h2 id="using-llvm">Using LLVM</h2><p>As we just saw, taint-based devirtualization relies on compiler optimizations to simplify the recreated CFG and deobfuscate the program.
We decided to use LLVM’s state-of-the-art optimizations.</p><p>Instead of simply integrating LLVM at the very end of our deobfuscation pipeline, we decided to perform all our analysis in LLVM IR.
We were inspired by another deobfuscator: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01752"><em>Saturn</em></a>, which uses LLVM IR as an intermediate representation to deobfuscate opaque predicates.</p><p>First and foremost, this allows us to perform optimizations at the very beginning of our deobfuscation pipeline.
This initial round of optimizations allows us to remove simple obfuscation passes allowing further analysis to run faster.</p><p>Another important consideration, is that using an IR we are able to easily create a multi-architecture tool. As of writing this article, we were able to devirtualize both <code>amd64</code> and <code>aarch64</code> binaries. We are in the process of adding support for their 32-bit counterparts.</p><p>Last but not least, using LLVM’s IR gives us access to a whole suite of tools. LLVM’s ecosystem not only includes LLVM’s analysis and optimization passes, but also third party tools such as the symbolic execution engine <a href="https://klee-se.org/">KLEE</a>.
Notably, this also works the other way around: we will be able to contribute to LLVM’s ecosystem with our analysis modules. For example, during this internship, we were led to create a dynamic taint analysis engine for LLVM IR (version 17).</p><h3 id="lifting">Lifting</h3><p>An important step is <em>lifting</em>: the process of translating machine instructions to another representation (in this case, LLVM IR).</p><p>To do so, we used Trail of Bits’ <a href="https://github.com/lifting-bits/remill"><em>remill</em></a> library.
Using <em>remill</em> proved to be tricky, but we received some helpful advice from the authors of <em>Saturn</em> detailing not only strategies to lift complete CFGs but also custom LLVM passes and tricks to simplify the generated LLVM IR.</p><p>Lifting binaries was a large and complex part of the internship.</p><h2 id="results">Results</h2><p>During this internship, we were able to use our devirtualization tool on binaries (both <code>amd64</code> and <code>aarch64</code>) obfuscated with the Tigress obfuscator.</p><p>Notably, we were able to partially deobfuscate the first <a href="https://tigress.cs.arizona.edu/challenges.html">Tigress challenge</a>, and so very quickly.</p><p>For example, on our machine (OS: Linux - Fedora 40, CPU: 6-core Intel Core i5-8500, Mem: 15.44 GiB), we <strong>partially</strong> deobfuscated <code>challenge0000-binary1</code> in under a second.
For reference, <em>Triton</em> claims to <strong>fully</strong> deobfuscate the same binary in 9.20s.</p><p>Here is the obfuscated <code>amd64</code> <code>challenge0000-binary1</code>:

<p dir="auto">A Jekyll generator plugin to lets you use SQLite database instead of data files as a data source. It lets you easily create APIs and websites from a SQLite database, by linking together a database file, your template, and the relevant queries.</p>
<p dir="auto">It supports site-level queries, per-page queries, and prepared queries that can
use existing data (possibly generated via more queries) as parameters.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2><a id="user-content-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Add this line to your site's <code>Gemfile</code>:</p>

<p dir="auto">And then add this line to your site's <code>_config.yml</code>:</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">🏁 A fully-functional demo website that uses this plugin is available at
<a href="https://northwind.captnemo.in/" rel="nofollow">northwind.captnemo.in</a>. The source code for
the demo is available at <a href="https://github.com/captn3m0/northwind">captn3m0/northwind</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Update your <code>_config.yml</code> to define your data sources with your SQLite database.</p>

    <span>file</span>: <span>*db</span>
    <span>query</span>: <span>SELECT * from Customers</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Then, you can use the <code>site.data</code> attributes accordingly:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="{{ site.data.customers | jsonify }}"><pre>{{ <span>site</span>.<span>data</span>.<span>customers</span> | <span>jsonify</span> }}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Prepared Queries</h2><a id="user-content-prepared-queries" aria-label="Permalink: Prepared Queries" href="#prepared-queries"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This plugin supports prepared queries with parameter binding. This lets you
use existing data from a previous query, or some other source (such as
<code>site.data.*</code> or <code>page.*</code>) as a parameter in your query.</p>
<p dir="auto">Say you have a YAML file defining your items (<code>data/books.yaml</code>):</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="- id: 31323952-2708-42dc-a995-6006a23cbf00
  name: Time Travel with a Rubber Band

  <span>name</span>: <span>The Art of Cache Invalidation</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">and the prices for the items in your SQLite database, the following configuration will enrich the <code>items</code> array with the price:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sql:
- data: items.books
  query: SELECT price, author FROM pricing WHERE id =:id
  db: books.db"><pre><span>sql</span>:

  <span>query</span>: <span>SELECT price, author FROM pricing WHERE id =:id</span>
  <span>db</span>: <span>books.db</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This would allow the following Liquid loop to be written:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="{% for item in site.data.items %}
{{item.meta.price}}, {{item.meta.author}}
{% endfor %}"><pre>{% <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>site</span>.<span>data</span>.<span>items</span> %}

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Per Page Queries</h2><a id="user-content-per-page-queries" aria-label="Permalink: Per Page Queries" href="#per-page-queries"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The exact same syntax can be used on a per-page basis to generate data within
each page. This is helpful for keeping page-specific queries within the page
itself. Here's an example:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="---

---
<span>{{page.suppliers|jsonify}}</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This will generate a <code>page.suppliers</code> array with all the suppliers, and a <code>page.FeaturedSupplier</code> object with the details of the featured supplier.</p>
<p dir="auto">Each supplier will have a <code>products</code> array with all the products for that supplier.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Generating Pages</h2><a id="user-content-generating-pages" aria-label="Permalink: Generating Pages" href="#generating-pages"></a></p>

<p dir="auto">This will automatically generate a file for each restaurant
restaurants/#{id}.html file with the layout <code>_layouts/restaurant.html</code> and page.id, page.name, page.active set and page.title set to restaurant name</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that the <code>datapage_gen</code> plugin will run <em>after</em> the <code>jekyll-sqlite</code> plugin,
if you generate any pages with per-page queries, these queries will not execute.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dmitrii Kovanikov writes posts about enterprise software development and functional programming, both entertaining and serious. I never used a functional programming language (such as Haskell or OCaml) at work, but several ideas from functional programming have become popular in mainstream general-purpose programming languages such as Swift (which I mostly write). Often even a partially functional approach produces simpler code that’s easy to understand and quick to write and maintain. I’m always looking for good ideas I can adopt to write better code, whatever their source.</p>

<p>Dmitrii recently <a href="https://x.com/ChShersh/status/1859922977208598610" target="_blank">posted a tweet</a> (now also <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chshersh.com/post/3lbjuzgcf6k2w" target="_blank">reposted to Bluesky</a>) titled “Functional programming self-affirmations” that listed five items:</p>

<ol>
<li>Parse, don’t validate</li>
<li>Make illegal states unrepresentable</li>
<li>Errors as values</li>
<li>Functional core, imperative shell</li>
<li>Smart constructor</li>
</ol>

<p>These got me interested, but as usual, the problem with such distilled mantras is that you need a lot of context to understand and use them. What does it <em>mean</em> to have a “smart constructor”? In the comments  Dmitrii himself and other people added links to suggested reading. Let’s go over each item and uncover what it means.</p>

<h3 id="1-parse-don-t-validate">1. Parse, don’t validate</h3>

<p>The text that introduced this notion is <a href="https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/" target="_blank">this blog post with the same name</a> written by Alexis King. It also covers the next notion so we’ll come back to it later. It gives a much better explanation than my second-hand version could ever do.</p>

<p>For me the two standout ideas were:</p>

<ul>
<li>While validation establishes correctness, parsing enriches the data and adds knowledge we can build upon, and does that early on the way from less-structured to more-structured data. In my own work I describe it as “building a solid foundation” meaning that you can confidently build higher-level abstractions when the lower-level abstractions are leak-proof, with correctness likely enforced by the compiler.</li>
<li>The notion of <em>shotgun parsing</em> (a mix of input validation and parsing that tries to capture all the “bad” cases — an antipattern, because it doesn’t work) defined in the paper “<a href="https://langsec.org/papers/langsec-cwes-secdev2016.pdf" target="_blank">The Seven Turrets of Babel: A Taxonomy of LangSec Errors and How to Expunge Them</a>”. It is exactly the same situation as writing tests: the tests cannot prove the absence of bugs, only that certain things are correct. To come closer to proven correctness, illegal states must be forced out of the program, usually with robust type definitions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Which neatly leads us to the next point…</p>

<h3 id="2-make-illegal-states-unrepresentable">2. Make illegal states unrepresentable</h3>

<p>This is an idea that I see talked about fairly often even in “regular” commercial programming. However, in my experience, not many people are willing to go all the way to achieve it. The post I linked above talks about this notion in its second half. I define it to mean “your logic and types (where applicable) are designed in such a way as to make it physically impossible to create a bad state”.</p>

<p>There are specific examples both in the blog post above and also in this <em>F# for Fun and Profit</em> “<a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/designing-with-types-making-illegal-states-unrepresentable/" target="_blank">Designing with types</a>” post that make it clear. The latter makes an excellent point why people do not often go all the way — it often requires flipping assumptions about a system, and also not wanting to bother defining a type (for example) for a container that can hold either one or three items:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At this point, you might be saying that we have made things unnecessarily complicated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People often see this upfront work as complicating the code (“Why can’t I just validate in the initializer and be done?”) and don’t do it. Down the line, someone else doesn’t know about the (unenforced) requirements, and that’s when bugs are introduced. If this idea is implemented well, then the API design or the compiler will make it impossible to make a mistake, because you cannot use the code in a way that represents a bad state. It may be tedious but it’s <em>so</em> worth it.</p>

<h3 id="3-errors-as-values">3. Errors as values</h3>

<p>This notion is well-described in “<a href="https://jessewarden.com/2021/04/errors-as-values.html" target="_blank">Errors as Values: Free Yourself From Unexpected Runtime Exceptions</a>”. The “values” in the phrase refers to returning an error value from a function instead of raising an exception. Usually, the error value is well-defined, and exceptions are unexpected.</p>

<p>This idea is now fairly mainstream and I see that people try to avoid using exceptions. Many languages encourage and support you to return something like a <code>Result</code> (which, for example in Swift, is a sum type of <code>Success</code> and <code>Error</code>) or, like Go, a tuple of values: a successful result and an optional error. This practice came to replace setting a global error variable or returning magic “error” values (like in C) and throwing exceptions (like in C++, Java, etc.).</p>

<p>To me, this simply makes more sense: isn’t it <em>objectively</em> better to get a finite and predictable error value from a function than an unspecified exception that may or may not happen that you still have to guard against?</p>

<h3 id="4-functional-core-imperative-shell">4. Functional core, imperative shell</h3>

<p>I was not familiar with this notion at all, but after reading <a href="https://www.javiercasas.com/articles/functional-programming-patterns-functional-core-imperative-shell" target="_blank">this blog post</a> by Javier Casas it now makes sense. Functional programming is, ideally, a realm of pure functions without side effects that are easy to reason about and easily testable in isolation.</p>

<p>To integrate this code into real systems in the real world you need to set up an environment, procure and provide input values, maybe talk to the OS (which is often stateful) and communicate output values. That’s where the dichotomy comes from. You push as much code as possible that deals with logic into a “functional core”, and only the messy interfacing routines end up in an “imperative shell”. This way the meat of the program can get easily tested without any scaffolding, and the test environment and possibly mocks only need to be provided to the shell.</p>

<h3 id="5-smart-constructor">5. Smart constructor</h3>

<p>The page “<a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/index.php?title=Smart_constructors" target="_blank">Smart constructors</a>” on the Haskell Wiki explains this notion well. It neatly dovetails with “making illegal states unrepresentable” by providing compile- or at least runtime checks when making new values. If the type system cannot enforce a constraint, you can prevent “bad” values from being constructed at runtime.</p>

<p>The page raises another point, that smart constructors can do optimizations because they control internal representation. The example on the page is compacting data, but it can also be normalization, making structures homogenous or converting value formats.</p>

<p>The benefit is, again, creating a solid foundation that you can build on. You know the data you operate is clean, tidy and valid. This means you can do fewer checks later in the pipeline which improves both performance (less code is executed) and clarity (there are fewer noisy checks).</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Do these ideas belong only in functional programming? While they are practiced more there, and functional programming languages generally have strong type systems that help implement these constraints, we “regular” developers can use most of these concepts when writing our mostly imperative code to make it simpler. Clearly, if your functions have few or no side effects, the underlying data is clean, and you can’t accidentally create “bad” objects, you’ll have an easier time.</p>

To see the solution, jump to the end of the post.</p><p id="b9ba">I first became interested in the the problem of cutting onions in a way to reduce the variance of the volumes of the slices at a gathering with friends. One of my friends and colleagues, Dr. Gabe Feinberg, also a mathematician, pointed me to the Youtube video below.</p><figure><figcaption>The origin of the onion problem.</figcaption></figure><p id="6733">In the video, Chef Kenji López-Alt says he has a friend who is a mathematician, who claims that you should cut radially towards a point 60% of the radius below the center of the onion, and claims that this is related to the reciprocal of golden ratio, 0.61803398875…</p><p id="f146">I was intrigued by this, and even began cutting onions at home with this technique, just because it made me happy.</p><figure><figcaption>A post in the Washington College Mathematics and Computer Science Department Discord where I show the results of cutting onions in this manner.</figcaption></figure><p id="13fa">Each time I cut an onion for dinner, my mind would wander. I would think about why this is true, and what techniques I could use to approach the problem. While this was meditative for me, these musings did not lead anywhere substantial over the span of two months.</p></div><div><p id="000f">Last weekend, my thoughts actually lead me towards a solution. Within two days I had found the “true onion constant”, which, spoiler alert, is not the reciprocal of the golden ratio. The depth to which you have to aim your knife for radial cuts depends on the number of layers. You can see this by thinking of how to cut an onion with one layer versus an onion with ten layers to keep the pieces as similar as possible. For one layer you would aim towards the center of the onion, but for ten layers you would aim somewhere below the center of the onion. To simplify matters, I therefore thought of an onion with infinitely many layers (or, as Gabe called it, “the great onion in the sky,” which I love). These kind of abstractions are common in mathematics, and make problems tractable. Once there are infinitely many layers, it makes sense to think of infinitely many cuts. This moves the problem into the realm of continuous mathematics, where calculus can be used to great effect.</p><figure></figure><figure><figcaption>More discussion from the Departmental Discord about the problem. There is also proof that I’m a millennial with the use of the 😂 emoji.</figcaption></figure></div><div><p id="9219">Here’s the technical part of the post. You probably need to know multivariable calculus to follow from here. I’m going to switch to using “we” instead of “I” to match mathematical writing conventions, and to indicate that we (you, dear reader, and I) are walking down this mathematical path together.</p><p id="7f6d">First, we model the onion as half of a disc of radius one, with its center at the origin and existing entirely in the first two quadrants in a rectangular (Cartesian) coordinate system. This ignores a dimension, and perhaps also some geometry of actual onions (are cross sections actually circles?) but makes the problem tractable and is still a good approximation.</p><p id="e6d8">The insight that leads to a solution comes from the Jacobian. When we change from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates in integration, small rectangular pieces of area <em>dx dy</em> are transformed into small pieces of area <em>r dr dθ</em>, where <em>x = r </em>cos<em>(θ)</em> and<em> y = r </em>sin<em>(θ)</em>. The idea of the Jacobian applies to all changes in coordinate systems. We can calculate the Jacobian as</p><figure></figure><p id="baa6">Below is a diagram showing the change of coordinates and the Jacobian in this setting.</p><figure></figure><p id="3db0">Notice that the coordinate system cuts the onion, much as usual grid lines cut the plane into rectangles in the Cartesian coordinate system. The radial part of the coordinate system cuts the onion radially (which of course nature does by default, but we need to model this mathematically), while the angular part of the coordinate system cuts the onion as our knife would if we were making straight cuts towards the center of the onion. Even though every piece of the onion is infinitely small (there are infinitely many layers, and infinitely many cuts) The Jacobian <em>r dr dθ</em> gives a measure of how big the infinitely small pieces are relative to each other. Pieces near the center of the onion are smaller than pieces near the edge of the onion, as we can see that since <em>r</em> is smaller towards the center of the onion and larger towards the edge of the onion.</p><p id="4c45">We can find the average value of the function <em>f(r,θ) = r</em> over the part of the plane that defines the onion to find the average weight of the infinitesimal area, <em>A</em>.</p><figure></figure><p id="6e8b">Once we have the average, we can find the variance, <em>v</em>, of the weight of the infinitesimal area by calculating</p><figure></figure><p id="b3bb">The variance is a good measure of the uniformity of the pieces. If the variance is large, the pieces are not very uniform, and vice-versa.</p><p id="b5a2">The problem with this analysis, of course, is that we are cutting towards the center of the onion. We want to cut towards a point below the center of the onion. To accomplish this, we need a new coordinate system.</p><p id="21c7">We make a coordinate system for cutting towards a point a distance <em>h&gt;0</em> below the center of the onion. In this coordinate system, we measure the angle theta from the point <em>(0,-h)</em>, while we measure the radius from the origin <em>(0,0)</em> (both points in the rectangular coordinate system). The radial part of the coordinate system cuts the onion radially from the origin as before, while the angular part of the coordinate system cuts the onion as our knife would if we were making straight cuts towards the point <em>(0,-h)</em>, below the onion.</p><figure><figcaption>The new coordinate system also cuts the onion, but in exactly the way we want it to in order to model the cutting of an onion radially towards a point beneath the cutting board.</figcaption></figure><p id="ca8e">This coordinate system only works for the upper half plane, as there are now technically two points in the plane for a given point <em>(r,θ)</em>. Luckily, our onion is entirely in the upper-half plane!</p><p id="0d7b">In this coordinate system, the region of the plane that we model as the onion is defined by <em>-</em>arctan<em>(</em>1<em>/h) ≤ θ ≤ </em>arctan<em>(</em>1<em>/h)</em>, and <em>h |</em>tan<em>(θ)| ≤ r ≤1</em>. We can eliminate the absolute value by using symmetry. Since the left side of the onion is a mirror image of the right side of the onion, and therefore both sides would have the same variance in area, we can perform this analysis just in the first quadrant. So, the region is defined by 0<em>≤θ≤</em>arctan<em>(</em>1<em>/h)</em>, and <em>h </em>tan<em>(θ) ≤r≤</em>1.</p><p id="e86e">The relation between <em>(x,y)</em> and <em>(r,θ)</em> is less clear. Given we know <em>r, h</em>, and <em>θ</em>, we can draw the following triangle, with a new variable c which represents the distance from the point <em>(0,-h)</em> to a given point <em>(x,y)</em> (both in the rectangular coordinate system).</p><figure></figure><p id="77f5">First, using the law of cosines, we can calculate</p><figure></figure><p id="dff5">Using this, we can find the relationship between <em>(x,y)</em> and <em>(r,θ)</em> as</p><figure></figure><p id="012d">From this, for a given depth <em>h</em>, we can calculate the Jacobian as</p><figure></figure><p id="f39c">This is, to put it mildly, complicated. Nevertheless, we have done fairly straightforward calculus computations to get here, which shows the power of making this problem continuous. Mimicking what we did before, given a depth <em>h</em>, we can find the average weight of the infinitesimal area, <em>A(h)</em>, by calculating the integral of the Jacobian over the onion region divided by the integral of 1 over the same region</p><figure></figure><p id="6248">And the variance of the weight of the infinitesimal area, <em>v(h)</em>, is found by calculating the integral of the square of the Jacobian minus <em>A(h) </em>over the onion region divided by the integral of 1 over the same region</p><figure></figure><p id="10e3">Yikes! Integrating this by hand looks really difficult, if not impossible. We should use a computer to help us. Using the power of numerical integration in Mathematica, we can plot the variance versus <em>h</em>, the depth of the point we are cutting towards.</p><figure></figure><p id="901c">We can see the minimum variance is around <em>h</em>=.55. We can use a numerical minimization technique to find the <em>h</em> that minimizes the variance.</p></div><div><p id="4d25">I am only confident of this number to 7 decimal points, but the “true onion constant” for the “onion in the sky” is given by 0.5573066…</p><p id="475f">To get the most even cuts of an onion by making radial cuts, one should aim towards a point 55.73066% the radius of the onion below the center. This is close, but different from, the 61.803% claimed in the Youtube video at the top. Also, this number will be different for onions for finitely many layers (that is to say, all onions). Nevertheless, I find this answer to be beautiful, and I will forever treasure the true onion constant.</p><p id="cd14">I think it would be interesting to consider the effect of the number of layers on this answer. Since with one layer the best strategy is to cut towards the center, I suspect that the best depth <em>h</em> to cut towards increases from zero with one layer, with .5573066… as the upper bound on the depth. So, the best depth for an onion with ten layers would be somewhere between 0 and 0.5573066. I have not investigated this in depth, but this seems like a fun next step.</p><p id="b002">I hope we all now know enough about onions to object.</p><figure><figcaption>Comic from Li Chen <a href="https://www.exocomics.com/685/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.exocomics.com/685/</a></figcaption></figure></div><div><p id="fe67">Update: I actually was able to evaluate <em>v(h) </em>in a closed form. The techniques used to do it are really fun, and I am hoping to write them up for a recreational mathematics journal.</p><p id="f87b">As calculus students know, if you want to minimize a function, you should take the derivative and set it equal to zero. Here, the derivative of <em>v(h) </em>is given by</p><figure></figure><p id="2ac1">The unique root of the above expression in the interval <em>(0,1)</em> is the onion constant, since it is a critical point for the function <em>v(h) </em>and the sign of <em>v’(h)</em> changes from negative to positive at this point, as seen in the graph of <em>v’(h)</em> below.</p><figure><figcaption>The derivative of v with respect to h. Notice that the derivative crosses the horizontal axis around 0.55, which is the onion constant. The sign change from negative to positive means this is a minimum of the v function.</figcaption></figure><p id="367e">With this, I can calculate the onion constant to arbitrary precision. Here it is to 1000 decimal places: 0.5573066929856644788510930591459271808320003020727327593398292131946981351272104586975295563488927792384215157297641443660261449855854165046873271472618959107816152780606384065758548635804885244580180000739444280590673621405484408743288174143897178500658897679049099235460450539966379793582365697832234771908624791276216076862484729083731336235000704236891376747519710815301807822317779086701048122723023915093054323298702150340065450327186756623642052156098646912508581593702205375240220768344875026631985363470644632525528856220691258227307037720900190873707797080215945078389222941122441664099620992665469305266348508835318836823451849946341751553954012216070423374355399193069992187951842347509926071534835419058678494025712006870992663407278202945110198402208378584410140122892631419360798953694134222761038423480438048889054739124583187162972867878589998414926409519790844390232917730134252343064728228633559834886507214553757974736357343027167265972675903577598983959532796594227162648681839040…</p></div><div><p id="1c5f">Such a beautiful mathematical constant deserves a name.

Current technologies that can supply food to space travellers are dependent on consumables from resupply missions from Earth (e.g., dried (Venir <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref136"><span>Reference Venir, Del Torre, Stecchini, Maltini and Di Nardo</span>2007</a>; Park <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref98"><span>Reference Park, Song, Han, Kim, Yoon, Choi, Byun, Sohn and Lee</span>2009</a>), freeze dried (Obrist <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref96"><span>Reference Obrist, Tu, Yao and Velasco</span>2019</a>), irradiated food (Pometto and Bourland, <a href="#ref108"><span>Reference Pometto and Bourland</span>2003</a>) or frozen food (Geiges, <a href="#ref51"><span>Reference Geiges</span>1996</a>)). These systems are completely dependent on Earth resupply and thus far from optimized for energy or economics. For example, food demands for a Mars mission for six astronauts will weigh around 12 tons without packaging (Park <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref99"><span>Reference Park, Song, Kim, Choi, Sung, Han and Lee</span>2012</a>). To explore further than Mars would entail massive quantities and masses of food. Even with SpaceX's relatively low cost of $2720 per kilogram to lift into space (Cobb, <a href="#ref25"><span>Reference Cobb</span>2019</a>), a less costly and more sustainable method is preferred. Recycling of air, water and waste will likely also be essential, but such systems are used in the context where waste mitigation includes the jettison or storage of these products, which ultimately leads to the need for resupply missions (Boscheri <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref14"><span>Reference Boscheri, Saverino and Lobascio</span>2021</a>). To deeply explore the solar system, it will be necessary to become less reliant on the resupply tether to Earth (Sercel <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref123"><span>Reference Sercel, Peterson, Britt, Dreyer, Jedicke, Love, Walton and Abreu</span>2018</a>).</p>
<p> Farming in space, on an external base, may be possible but is extremely complex (Monje <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref88"><span>Reference Monje, Stutte, Goins, Porterfield and Bingham</span>2003</a>; Tibbetts, <a href="#ref132"><span>Reference Tibbetts</span>2019</a>; De Pascale <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref37"><span>Reference De Pascale, Arena, Aronne, De Micco, Pannico, Paradiso and Rouphael</span>2021</a>). Bioregenerative life support systems are also a promising approach (Douglas <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref40"><span>Reference Douglas, Wheeler and Fritsche</span>2021</a>). These include methods of food production from almost classical crop cultivation and animal farming (including insects) to innovative microalgae (Yang <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref146"><span>Reference Yang, Li, Liu, Zhong, Ji, Lu, Fan, Li, Leng, Li and Zhou</span>2019</a>), and mushroom cultivation (Manukovsky <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref80"><span>Reference Manukovsky, Kovalev, Rygalov and Zolotukhin</span>1997</a>). There have been significant advances in vegetable production systems in space onboard the International Space Station. For example, the Vegetable Production System (aka Veggie), is a space garden that has grown eight different types of edible leafy greens since 2014 (Massa <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref85"><span>Reference Massa, Dufour, Carver, Hummerick, Wheeler, Morrow and Smith</span>2017</a>). The Advanced Plant Habitat (APH) has shown similar success growing plants in a closed and automated system (Monje <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref89"><span>Reference Monje, Richards, Carver and Dimapilis</span>2020</a>). Bioregenerative systems designed to mimic elements of Earth's biological systems (namely microbial ecologies) (Hendrickx <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref63"><span>Reference Hendrickx, De Wever, Hermans, Mastroleo, Morin, Wilmotte, Janssen and Mergeay</span>2006</a>; Fahrion <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref45"><span>Reference Fahrion, Mastroleo, Dussap and Leys</span>2021</a>), however, are far from mature (Kliss <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref72"><span>Reference Kliss, Heyenga, Hoehn and Stodieck</span>2000</a>).</p>
<p> Protein storage is a particular concern since methods to store it can compromise quality (Bychkov <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref20"><span>Reference Bychkov, Reshetnikova, Bychkova, Podgorbunskikh and Koptev</span>2021</a>). All of these approaches, however, require an initially considerable input of resources from Earth and may well require periodic resupply. These virtual tether to Earth strategies are expensive and will become less viable the further humanity moves out into space. What if humanity could acquire the raw materials to make food in space? This article investigates ways to do just that using new techniques developed to recycle plastic waste into food on Earth, and extrapolating these techniques to the theoretical application of converting asteroidal material into food (Petsch <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref102"><span>Reference Petsch, Eglinton and Edwards</span>2001</a>; Byrne <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref21"><span>Reference Byrne, Schaerer, Kulas, Ankathi, Putman, Codere, Schum, Shonnard and Techtmann</span>2022</a>; Schaerer <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref117"><span>Reference Schaerer, Wu, Putman, Pearce, Lu, Shonnard, Ong and Techtmann</span>2022</a>; Waajen <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref139"><span>Reference Waajen, Prescott and Cockell</span>2022</a>, <a href="#ref140"><span>Reference Waajen, Lima, Goodacre and Cockell</span>2024</a>).</p>
<p> Recently, Waajen <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref140"><span>Reference Waajen, Lima, Goodacre and Cockell</span>2024</a>) examined this process by growing anaerobic microbial communities on the CM2 carbonaceous chondrite Aguas Zarcas as the sole carbon, energy and nutrient source, successfully demonstrating that microbial communities can metabolically transform carbonaceous asteroidal material as a potential resource. Furthermore, Bryne <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref21"><span>Reference Byrne, Schaerer, Kulas, Ankathi, Putman, Codere, Schum, Shonnard and Techtmann</span>2022</a>) demonstrated that potentially human-edible biomass could be produced from bacterial consortia acting on the pyrolytic breakdown products of high-density polyethylene plastics. Although Byrne's work is focused on the recycling of plastic waste, the idea of leveraging bacterial inocula to produce potentially edible biomass from initially inedible precursors is germane to the need to produce food in space (similar to synthetic biological processes described by Waajen <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref140"><span>Reference Waajen, Lima, Goodacre and Cockell</span>2024</a>). This article will outline an approach to providing human-edible food – and calculate theoretical yields – employing naturally occurring organic compounds commonly found in specific types of meteorites: the carbonaceous chondrites. Carbonaceous chondrite meteorites likely originate from the most abundant class of asteroid in our solar system, the C-class, which tend to be most abundant in the outer main asteroid belt (Vilas and Gaffey, <a href="#ref138"><span>Reference Vilas and Gaffey</span>1989</a>; DeMeo <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref32"><span>Reference DeMeo, Alexander, Walsh, Chapman and Binzel</span>2015</a>). In addition to their relatively high organic chemical content, some carbonaceous chondrites can contain as much as 10.5 wt% water (Rivkin <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref113"><span>Reference Rivkin, Howell, Vilas and Lebofsky</span>2002</a>). Selected asteroids could provide the raw materials – organic compounds and water – that when processed by bacterial consortia in bioreactors, would form the basis of an extra-terrestrial food-supply chain.</p>
<p> The mass of potentially available organic compounds in some C-class asteroids will be calculated to provide 100% of the caloric requirements for a human for one year. Furthermore, calculations will be made to determine how many years a single asteroid could theoretically sustain an astronaut. Based on the current biomass yields from bioreactors on Earth, future work will be provided to enable this path as a sustainable source of food for space travellers.</p>

<div data-magellan-destination="sec2" id="sec2"><h2> Background</h2>
<div data-magellan-destination="sec2-1" id="sec2-1"><h3> Meteorites</h3>
<p> The most abundant source of information available regarding asteroid composition is from the analysis of meteorites, which are – for the most part – fragments of asteroids. Meteorites are classified based on their mineralogical and petrological characteristics, as well as their whole-rock chemical and O-isotopic compositions. The main classifications are chondrites, primitive achondrites and achondrites. Within each of these main classifications are multiple sub-classifications. For example, there are currently 15 recognized groups of chondrites: 8 carbonaceous (CI, CM, CO, CV, CK, CR, CH, CB), 3 ordinary (H, L, LL), 2 enstatite (EH, EL) and R and K chondrites (Weisberg <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref144"><span>Reference Weisberg, McCoy and Krot</span>2006</a>). Each sub-group is believed to have sampled a separate parent body or asteroid. There are also individual chondritic meteorites that may share some, but not all, of the characteristics of one of these sub-classifications. These may remain as ungrouped or unique or they may be associated with one of the established sub-classifications but identified as outliers by designations such as C-ungrouped (Grady <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref58"><span>Reference Grady, Verchovsky, Franchi, Wright and Pillinger</span>2002</a>; Mittlefehldt, <a href="#ref86"><span>Reference Mittlefehldt</span>2002</a>; Yesiltas <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref147"><span>Reference Yesiltas, Kebukawa, Glotch, Zolensky, Fries, Aysal and Tukel</span>2022</a>).</p>
</div>
<div data-magellan-destination="sec2-2" id="sec2-2"><h3> Carbon compounds in meteorites and their distribution in carbonaceous chondrites</h3>
<p> Grady and Wright (<a href="#ref57"><span>Reference Grady and Wright</span>2003</a>) provide a very useful overview of the major carbon phases seen in meteorite groups. The carbonaceous chondrites, particularly the CI, CM and some related ungrouped C-chondrites contain the highest concentrations of organic compounds, up to&nbsp;~&nbsp;5&nbsp;wt% (Kissin, <a href="#ref71"><span>Reference Kissin</span>2003</a>; Pizzarello <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref105"><span>Reference Pizzarello, Cooper and Flynn</span>2006</a>). In ordinary chondrites and the achondrites, carbon is usually seen in inorganic forms, occurring as carbonates or carbides, as well as in elemental form as graphite or, more rarely, diamond. Ordinary chondrites, in general, contain less total organic carbon than carbonaceous chondrites, with values ranging from 0.03 to 0.2&nbsp;wt% (Alexander <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref2"><span>Reference Alexander, Barber and Hutchinson</span>1989</a>; Makjanic <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref79"><span>Reference Makjanic, Vis, Hovenier and Heymann</span>1993</a>). The carbon content of achondrites can range from 0.003 to as much as 7&nbsp;wt% but is also typically in inorganic forms (Alexander <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref6"><span>Reference Alexander, Cody, De Gregorio, Nittler and Stroud</span>2017</a>).</p>
<p> Extensive reviews of the possible origins and modifications of extra-terrestrial organic compounds is given by various authors (e.g., Ehrenfreund and Charnley, <a href="#ref41"><span>Reference Ehrenfreund and Charnley</span>2002</a>; Elsila <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref44"><span>Reference Elsila, Aponte, Blackmond, Burton, Dworkin and Glavin</span>2016</a>; Glavin <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref55"><span>Reference Glavin, Alexander, Aponte, Dworkin, Elsila and Yabuta</span>2018</a>; d'Ischia <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref39"><span>Reference d'Ischia, Manini, Martins, Remusat, Alexander, Puzzarini, Barone and Saladino</span>2021</a>; Alexander, <a href="#ref1"><span>Reference Alexander</span>2022</a>; Furukawa <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref48"><span>Reference Furukawa, Saigusa, Kano, Uruno, Saito, Ito, Matsumoto, Aoki, Yamamoto and Nakamura</span>2023</a>). The variety and isotopic diversity of the organic compounds seen in carbonaceous meteorites indicates an initial interstellar and circumstellar formation with subsequent secondary modification on their parent body in the presence of water (Botta and Bada, <a href="#ref15"><span>Reference Botta and Bada</span>2002</a>; Pizzarello <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref105"><span>Reference Pizzarello, Cooper and Flynn</span>2006</a>). Water, in the form of ice, was accreted into primitive asteroidal bodies along with organic compounds and anhydrous minerals such as olivines and pyroxenes (Rubin <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref115"><span>Reference Rubin, Trigo-Rodriguez, Huber and Wasson</span>2007</a>; Le Gillou and Brearly, <a href="#ref76"><span>Reference Le Gillou and Brearly</span>2014</a>). Later heating, caused by the radioactive decay of Al26 and/or energetic impacts with other asteroidal bodies, melted the ice and provided the energy to drive the modification of the organic pre-cursors (Grimm and McSween, <a href="#ref59"><span>Reference Grimm and McSween</span>1989</a>; Nakamura, <a href="#ref91"><span>Reference Nakamura</span>2005</a>; Lee <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref75"><span>Reference Lee, Lindgren, King, Greenwood, Franchi and Sparkes</span>2016</a>). Keil (<a href="#ref70"><span>Reference Keil</span>2000</a>) provides an overview of heating on meteorite parent-bodies. The circulating water also altered the primary anhydrous silicate minerals, yielding a variety of secondary hydrous phyllosilicates (saponites, smectites, serpentines) as well as carbonates, oxides and sulphides. The phyllosilicates form the bulk of the matrix: 84.3% by volume in the Murchison meteorite and 71.2% by volume in Tagish Lake (Bland <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref13"><span>Reference Bland, Cressey and Menzies</span>2004</a>). The CI, CM and C-ungrouped meteorites also commonly contain carbonates (e.g., calcite, dolomite), oxides (e.g., magnetite) and sulphides (e.g., troilite, pyrrhotite, pentlandite) (Bland <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref13"><span>Reference Bland, Cressey and Menzies</span>2004</a>). A historical review of the study of organic compounds in meteorites is provided by Botta and Bada (<a href="#ref15"><span>Reference Botta and Bada</span>2002</a>).</p>
<p> The organic material in meteorites can be divided into two types: solvent-soluble organic material (SOM) and solvent-insoluble organic material (IOM). The SOM is composed of a wide variety of compounds such as ketones, alkanes, carboxylic and amino acids, methane, as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Grady and Wright, <a href="#ref57"><span>Reference Grady and Wright</span>2003</a>; Pizzarello <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref105"><span>Reference Pizzarello, Cooper and Flynn</span>2006</a>). Solvents often used for the extraction of SOM include water, for the extraction of amino acids, and benzene or benzene/methanol mixtures (Pizzarello <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref104"><span>Reference Pizzarello, Huang, Becker, Poreda, Nieman, Cooper and Williams</span>2001</a>; Sephton, <a href="#ref121"><span>Reference Sephton</span>2002</a>). Sephton and Gilmour (<a href="#ref122"><span>Reference Sephton and Gilmour</span>2000</a>) provide a summary of organic moieties which have been identified in the CM-type meteorite, Murchison. The IOM comprises most of the organic compounds in carbonaceous chondrites; approximately 70% in the Murchison CM-type and as much as 99% in the Tagish Lake C-ungrouped meteorite (Pizzarello <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref105"><span>Reference Pizzarello, Cooper and Flynn</span>2006</a>; Alexander <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref6"><span>Reference Alexander, Cody, De Gregorio, Nittler and Stroud</span>2017</a>). Elemental compositions of the IOM in the Murchison and Tagish Lake meteorites are given as C<sub>100</sub>H<sub>70</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>12</sub>S<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>100</sub>H<sub>46</sub>N<sub>10</sub>O<sub>15</sub>S<sub>4.5</sub> respectively (Pizzarello <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref105"><span>Reference Pizzarello, Cooper and Flynn</span>2006</a>).</p>
<p> The IOM is typically in the form of complex, cross-linked macromolecules resembling types of terrestrial kerogens (Botta and Bada, <a href="#ref15"><span>Reference Botta and Bada</span>2002</a>; Pizzarello <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref105"><span>Reference Pizzarello, Cooper and Flynn</span>2006</a>; Alexander <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref6"><span>Reference Alexander, Cody, De Gregorio, Nittler and Stroud</span>2017</a>). See ‘Kerogens as analogs for IOM’, below, for more discussion of terrestrial kerogens. Sephton and Gilmour (<a href="#ref122"><span>Reference Sephton and Gilmour</span>2000</a>) provide a summary of organic moieties which have been identified in the CM-type meteorite, Murchison, that include aromatic hydrocarbons, phenols, carboxylic acids among many others as well as O, S and N bearing moieties. These compounds are bound together into a larger structure by aliphatic linkages. Derenne and Robert (<a href="#ref38"><span>Reference Derenne and Robert</span>2010</a>) proposed a model of the macromolecular structure of IOM in the Murchison CM-type carbonaceous chondrite.</p>
<p> In most studies, the IOM is separated from the mineral matrix of a meteorite by demineralization with acids (HCl, HNO, HF). Cody <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref26"><span>Reference Cody, Alexander and Tera</span>2002</a>) modified the traditional method with the addition of fluorine-salts to overcome issues arising from the use of hydrofluoric acid. Smith and Kaplan, however, noticed that only ~45–80% of the C in bulk carbonaceous chondrites can be accounted for by the reported IOM, SOM, and carbonate abundances, the rest of which is lost during isolation of the IOM (Smith and Kaplan, <a href="#ref127"><span>Reference Smith and Kaplan</span>1970</a>).</p>
<p> Alexander <em>et al</em>., provide a thorough review of studies done in determining the morphologies and distribution of IOM in meteorite matrices and also discuss those studies done <em>in situ</em> (Alexander <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref6"><span>Reference Alexander, Cody, De Gregorio, Nittler and Stroud</span>2017</a>). The IOM occurs, generally, in two forms: as sub-micrometric grains or flakes, often referred to as ‘fluffy’ (Garvie and Buseck, <a href="#ref50"><span>Reference Garvie and Buseck</span>2006</a>), and as solid or hollow spherical, semi-spherical or tubular aggregates often referred to as nanoglobules. Nakamura <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref92"><span>Reference Nakamura, Matsumoto, Amano, Enokido, Zolensky, Mikouchi, Genda, Tanaka, Zolotov, Kurosawa, Wakita, Hyodo, Nagano, Nakashima, Takahashi, Fujioka, Kikuiri, Kagawa, Matsuoka, Brearley, Tsuchiyama, Uesugi, Matsuno, Kimura, Sato, Milliken, Tatsumi, Sugita, Hiroi, Kitazato, Brownlee, Joswiak, Takahashi, Ninomiya, Takahashi, Osawa, Terada, Brenker, Tkalcec, Vincze, Brunetto, Aléon-Toppani, Chan, Roskosz, Viennet, Beck, Alp, Michikami, Nagaashi, Tsuji, Ino, Martinez, Han, Dolocan, Bodnar, Tanaka, Yoshida, Sugiyama, King, Fukushi, Suga, Yamashita, Kawai, Inoue, Nakato, Noguchi, Vilas, Hendrix, Jaramillo-Correa, Domingue, Dominguez, Gainsforth, Engrand, Duprat, Russell, Bonato, Ma, Kawamoto, Wada, Watanabe, Endo, Enju, Riu, Rubino, Tack, Takeshita, Takeichi, Takeuchi, Takigawa, Takir, Tanigaki, Taniguchi, Tsukamoto, Yagi, Yamada, Yamamoto, Yamashita, Yasutake, Uesugi, Umegaki, Chiu, Ishizaki, Okumura, Palomba, Pilorget, Potin, Alasli, Anada, Araki, Sakatani, Schultz, Sekizawa, Sitzman, Sugiura, Sun, Dartois, De Pauw, Dionnet, Djouadi, Falkenberg, Fujita, Fukuma, Gearba, Hagiya, Hu, Kato, Kawamura, Kimura, Kubo, Langenhorst, Lantz, Lavina, Lindner, Zhao, Vekemans, Baklouti, Bazi, Borondics, Nagasawa, Nishiyama, Nitta, Mathurin, Matsumoto, Mitsukawa, Miura, Miyake, Miyake, Yurimoto, Okazaki, Yabuta, Naraoka, Sakamoto, Tachibana, Connolly, Lauretta, Yoshitake, Yoshikawa, Yoshikawa, Yoshihara, Yokota, Yogata, Yano, Yamamoto, Yamamoto, Yamada, Yamada, Yada, Wada, Usui, Tsukizaki, Terui, Takeuchi, Takei, Iwamae, Soejima, Shirai, Shimaki, Senshu, Sawada, Saiki, Ozaki, Ono, Okada, Ogawa, Ogawa, Noguchi, Noda, Nishimura, Namiki, Nakazawa, Morota, Miyazaki, Miura, Mimasu, Matsumoto, Kumagai, Kouyama, Kikuchi, Kawahara, Kameda, Iwata, Ishihara, Ishiguro, Ikeda, Hosoda, Honda, Honda, Hitomi, Hirata, Hirata, Hayashi, Hayakawa, Hatakeda, Furuya, Fukai, Fujii, Cho, Arakawa, Abe, Watanabe and Tsuda</span>2023</a>) reported on the <em>in situ</em> occurrence of nanoglobules in the Tagish Lake meteorite. The fluffy material is typically amorphous and often found intimately associated with the abundant phyllosilicate minerals in the meteorite matrix. Short, vein-like structures have also been reported and may be the result of migration and subsequent modification of the pre-cursor organic material during the secondary, post-accretion phase in the asteroidal parent-body.</p>
</div>
<div data-magellan-destination="sec2-3" id="sec2-3"><h3> Kerogens as analogues for IOM</h3>
<p> The IOM found in carbonaceous meteorites is often broadly compared with some terrestrial kerogens in terms of its insolubility in common solvents, its elemental composition and structure (Alexander <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref6"><span>Reference Alexander, Cody, De Gregorio, Nittler and Stroud</span>2017</a>). Terrestrial kerogens are defined as insoluble organic matter formed from the remains of algae, zoo- and phytoplankton, and/or vascular plants, usually found in sedimentary rocks in petroliferous basins (Curiale, <a href="#ref31"><span>Reference Curiale</span>1986</a>; Vandenbroucke and Largeau, <a href="#ref133"><span>Reference Vandenbroucke and Largeau</span>2007</a>). The organic material in sedimentary rocks undergoes progressive alteration with increasing depth of burial. Initially, bacterial activity and low-temperature chemical reactions occur during diagenesis. Increasing temperature during catagenesis and later metagenesis produces a continuum of thermal maturation (Sanei, <a href="#ref116"><span>Reference Sanei</span>2020</a>). Thermal maturation leads to the production of a variety of substances including coal, bitumens (asphalt), oil and methane. Bitumens have also been proposed as analogues of cometary and asteroidal organic compounds (Moroz <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref90"><span>Reference Moroz, Arnold, Korochantsev and Wäsch</span>1998</a>). In <em>The Origins of Petroleum,</em> Walters (<a href="#ref141"><span>Reference Walters</span>2007</a>) provides a review of the history and classification of kerogens. Tarafdar and Sinha (Tarafdar and Sinh, <a href="#ref130"><span>Reference Tarafdar and Sinh</span>2019</a>) also review the formation of coal as well as hydrocarbons derived from kerogens.</p>
<p> Along the continuum of thermal maturation, characteristic changes occur. Behar and Vandenbroucke (<a href="#ref11"><span>Reference Behar and Vandenbrouke</span>1987</a>) produced structural models showing the progressive alteration of kerogens during their maturation. Kerogens become increasingly aromatic while bitumens become more aliphatic in character (Craddock <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref29"><span>Reference Craddock, van Le Doan, Bake, Polyakov, Charsky and Pomerantz</span>2015</a>). There are also characteristic variations in the ratios of hydrogen to carbon (H/C) and oxygen to carbon (O/C). Van Krevelen (<a href="#ref135"><span>Reference van Krevelen</span>1961</a>) used these elemental ratios to classify coal, but this method is now widely used in classifying kerogens and their products. Such plots are typically referred to as van Krevelen diagrams. Four kerogen types are recognized: Type I, generated from algal and bacterial remains (algal kerogens); Type II, generated from zoo- and phytoplankton (planktonic kerogens); Type III, from vascular plants (humic kerogens) and Type IV (residual kerogens). Types I and II often occur in shales. Type III kerogens commonly occur as varieties of coal which can, on occasion, be interlayered with Type I and II bearing shales. Type 4 kerogens are often found as degraded surface deposits associated with coal (Vandenbrouke, <a href="#ref134"><span>Reference Vandenbrouke</span>2003</a>; Walters, <a href="#ref141"><span>Reference Walters</span>2007</a>; Ławniczak <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref74"><span>Reference Ławniczak, Woźniak-Karczewska, Loibner, Heipieper and Chrzanowski</span>2020</a>) (<a href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a>).

<p> The major elements in the composition of both IOM and terrestrial kerogens are C, H, O, N and S. The elemental compositions of the IOM in the Murchison and Tagish Lake meteorites are C<sub>100</sub>H<sub>70</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>12</sub>S<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>100</sub>H<sub>46</sub>N<sub>10</sub>O<sub>15</sub>S<sub>4.5</sub>, respectively (Pizzarello <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref105"><span>Reference Pizzarello, Cooper and Flynn</span>2006</a>). From these general formulae the H/C are 0.7 (Murchison) and 0.46 (Tagish Lake). The O/C ratios are 0.12 and 0.15, respectively. Naraoka <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref94"><span>Reference Naraoka, Mita, Komiya, Yoneda, Kojima and Shimoyama</span>2004</a>) report H/C values of IOM extracted from 9 CM-type meteorites ranging from 0.11–0.72 (<a href="#tab01">Table 1</a>). The H/C and O/C of most terrestrial kerogens are notably higher, but some types are similar to those of Murchison and Tagish Lake, falling within the range of type 3 and type 4 kerogens (Behar and Vandenbrouke, <a href="#ref11"><span>Reference Behar and Vandenbrouke</span>1987</a>; Pathak <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref100"><span>Reference Pathak, Kweon, Deo and Huang</span>2017</a>) (<a href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a>).

<p> Despite the abundance of C-complex asteroids, carbonaceous meteorites are rather rare in collections on Earth. Of the approximately 27&nbsp;000 known meteorites on Earth, only about 5% are carbonaceous chondrites, or approximately 1350 specimens. Of this number, approximately 733 specimens are of the CI, CM and C-ungrouped types of greatest interest. Of these, 633 are CM-type. Most are significantly under 1&nbsp;km in weight (Simkus <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref125"><span>Reference Simkus, Aponte, Elsila, Parker, Glavin and Dworkin</span>2019</a>). The sample sizes used by Naraoka <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref94"><span>Reference Naraoka, Mita, Komiya, Yoneda, Kojima and Shimoyama</span>2004</a>) ranged from 0.5–1&nbsp;g. Obtaining significant amounts of appropriate meteorite samples is possible but entails considerable cost. Therefore, future studies on the conversion of asteroidal matter into food should initially involve experimentation with selected kerogens instead, which will provide a more cost-effective alternative.</p>

<div data-magellan-destination="sec2-4" id="sec2-4"><h3> Asteroids containing organic compounds</h3>
<p> Reflectance spectra studies have proposed a strong link between the CI, CM and certain C-ungrouped meteorites and the C-complex of asteroids (Vilas and Gaffey, <a href="#ref138"><span>Reference Vilas and Gaffey</span>1989</a>). Although not distributed uniformly within the asteroid belt, the C-complex asteroids are the most numerous (DeMeo <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref32"><span>Reference DeMeo, Alexander, Walsh, Chapman and Binzel</span>2015</a>). A connection has also been proposed between the Ch-class asteroids – a subset of the C-complex defined by Bus and Binzel (<a href="#ref19"><span>Reference Bus and Binzel</span>2002</a>) – and CM-type (Rivkin <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref114"><span>Reference Rivkin, Thomas, Howell and Emery</span>2015</a>). Estimates of the number of Ch-type asteroids in the population of near-Earth objects (NEOs), with diameters greater than 1-km, are 53&nbsp;±&nbsp;27. If no minimum size constraints are applied, these numbers rise to 700&nbsp;±&nbsp;350 (Rivkin and DeMeo, <a href="#ref112"><span>Reference Rivkin and DeMeo</span>2019</a>). The recent success of two sample return missions – OSIRIS-REx (NASA) and Hyabusa2 (JAXA) – to the NEO asteroids 101955 Bennu and 162173 Ryugu demonstrate that, although technically demanding, it is possible to access such asteroids (Lauretta <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref73"><span>Reference Lauretta, Balram-Knutson, Beshore, Boynton, Drouet d'Aubigny, DellaGiustina, Enos, Golish, Hergenrother, Howell and Bennett</span>2017</a>; Nakamura <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref92"><span>Reference Nakamura, Matsumoto, Amano, Enokido, Zolensky, Mikouchi, Genda, Tanaka, Zolotov, Kurosawa, Wakita, Hyodo, Nagano, Nakashima, Takahashi, Fujioka, Kikuiri, Kagawa, Matsuoka, Brearley, Tsuchiyama, Uesugi, Matsuno, Kimura, Sato, Milliken, Tatsumi, Sugita, Hiroi, Kitazato, Brownlee, Joswiak, Takahashi, Ninomiya, Takahashi, Osawa, Terada, Brenker, Tkalcec, Vincze, Brunetto, Aléon-Toppani, Chan, Roskosz, Viennet, Beck, Alp, Michikami, Nagaashi, Tsuji, Ino, Martinez, Han, Dolocan, Bodnar, Tanaka, Yoshida, Sugiyama, King, Fukushi, Suga, Yamashita, Kawai, Inoue, Nakato, Noguchi, Vilas, Hendrix, Jaramillo-Correa, Domingue, Dominguez, Gainsforth, Engrand, Duprat, Russell, Bonato, Ma, Kawamoto, Wada, Watanabe, Endo, Enju, Riu, Rubino, Tack, Takeshita, Takeichi, Takeuchi, Takigawa, Takir, Tanigaki, Taniguchi, Tsukamoto, Yagi, Yamada, Yamamoto, Yamashita, Yasutake, Uesugi, Umegaki, Chiu, Ishizaki, Okumura, Palomba, Pilorget, Potin, Alasli, Anada, Araki, Sakatani, Schultz, Sekizawa, Sitzman, Sugiura, Sun, Dartois, De Pauw, Dionnet, Djouadi, Falkenberg, Fujita, Fukuma, Gearba, Hagiya, Hu, Kato, Kawamura, Kimura, Kubo, Langenhorst, Lantz, Lavina, Lindner, Zhao, Vekemans, Baklouti, Bazi, Borondics, Nagasawa, Nishiyama, Nitta, Mathurin, Matsumoto, Mitsukawa, Miura, Miyake, Miyake, Yurimoto, Okazaki, Yabuta, Naraoka, Sakamoto, Tachibana, Connolly, Lauretta, Yoshitake, Yoshikawa, Yoshikawa, Yoshihara, Yokota, Yogata, Yano, Yamamoto, Yamamoto, Yamada, Yamada, Yada, Wada, Usui, Tsukizaki, Terui, Takeuchi, Takei, Iwamae, Soejima, Shirai, Shimaki, Senshu, Sawada, Saiki, Ozaki, Ono, Okada, Ogawa, Ogawa, Noguchi, Noda, Nishimura, Namiki, Nakazawa, Morota, Miyazaki, Miura, Mimasu, Matsumoto, Kumagai, Kouyama, Kikuchi, Kawahara, Kameda, Iwata, Ishihara, Ishiguro, Ikeda, Hosoda, Honda, Honda, Hitomi, Hirata, Hirata, Hayashi, Hayakawa, Hatakeda, Furuya, Fukai, Fujii, Cho, Arakawa, Abe, Watanabe and Tsuda</span>2023</a>; Potiszil <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref109"><span>Reference Potiszil, Yamanaka, Sakaguchi, Ota, Kitagawa, Kunihiro, Tanaka, Kobayashi and Nakamura</span>2023</a>).</p>
<p> To illustrate the potential of the approach outlined in this article, theoretical production values are calculated below based on the asteroid 101955 Bennu. Bennu has been chosen since it is the target asteroid for the OSIRIS-REx sample return mission (Lauretta <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref73"><span>Reference Lauretta, Balram-Knutson, Beshore, Boynton, Drouet d'Aubigny, DellaGiustina, Enos, Golish, Hergenrother, Howell and Bennett</span>2017</a>). Asteroid Bennu is about 500&nbsp;m in diameter, which is small for an asteroid (Peña <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref101"><span>Reference Peña, Fuentes, Förster, Martinez-Palomera, Cabrera-Vives, Maureira, Huijse, Estévez, Galbany, González-Gaitán and de Jaeger</span>2020</a>). Bennu is an excellent candidate for comparison for four reasons: (1) it is has spectral features consistent with a carbon-rich (presumably carbonaceous chondrite meteorite-like) composition (Simon <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref126"><span>Reference Simon, Kaplan, Hamilton, Lauretta, Campins, Emery, Barucci, DellaGiustina, Reuter, Sandford and Golish</span>2020</a>; Ferrone <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref46"><span>Reference Ferrone, Clark, Kaplan, Rizos, Zou, Li, Barucci, Simon, Reuter, Hasselmann and Deshapriya</span>2021</a>; Kaplan <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref69"><span>Reference Kaplan, Simon, Hamilton, Thompson, Sandford, Barucci, Cloutis, Brucato, Reuter, Glavin and Clark</span>2021</a>), (2) it is a near-earth asteroid meaning that it is feasible to reach and return from the asteroid (as proven by the OSIRIS-REx and Hayabusa2 missions), (3) its mass is very well understood after nearly 2 years of study during the mission (77.6 million metric tons), and (4) studies are underway to determine the asteroid's composition. Thus, the potential of Bennu will be analysed as a human food source. To estimate the amount of usable organic material which may be within asteroid Bennu, values from the extensively studied Murchison CM-type meteorite will be used as a proxy. Dozens of studies have explored the organic compound composition of these samples (Studier <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref129"><span>Reference Studier, Hayatsu and Anders</span>1972</a>; Cronin and Pizzarello, <a href="#ref30"><span>Reference Cronin and Pizzarello</span>1990</a>; Callahan <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref23"><span>Reference Callahan, Smith, Cleaves, Ruzicka, Stern, Glavin, House and Dworkin</span>2011</a>; Botta and Bada, <a href="#ref15"><span>Reference Botta and Bada</span>2002</a>; Oba <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref95"><span>Reference Oba, Takano, Furukawa, Koga, Glavin, Dworkin and Naraoka</span>2022</a>).</p>
</div>
<div data-magellan-destination="sec2-5" id="sec2-5"><h3> Microbial assimilation of kerogens and related organic compounds</h3>
<p> Since the majority of organic compounds in carbonaceous meteorites, and presumably their asteroidal parent-bodies, are insoluble, work in the field of microbially mediated coal-bed methane (CBM) production is of particular interest for this proposal. Wang <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref143"><span>Reference Wang, Wang, Cui, Zhang and Yu</span>2019</a>) studied the effects of microbial activity in the generation of CBM from a Chinese coal deposit, showing that significant quantities of biomethane were produced. A detailed study by Vick <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref137"><span>Reference Vick, Gong, Sestak, Vergara, Pinetown, Li, Greenfield, Tetu, Midgley and Paulsen</span>2019</a>) on the microbial assimilation of coal identifies several of the principal phyla involved and also explores the optimization conditions for enhanced production. Reviews of work in the biogeneration of CBM are also provided by Ritter <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref111"><span>Reference Ritter, Vinson, Barnhart, Akob, Fields, Cunningham, Orem and McIntosh</span>2015</a>) and Colosimo <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref27"><span>Reference Colosimo, Thomas, Lloyd, Taylor, Boothman, Smith, Lord and Kalin</span>2016</a>). Gao <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref49"><span>Reference Gao, Jiang, Yang, Li and Yua</span>2011</a>) studied the effects of bacterial consortia to act on leonardite, a type 4 kerogen, in the production of humic acid for biofertilizers. There are also intriguing recent studies of direct bacterial assimilation of carbonaceous chondrite material. In 2022, Waajen <em>et al</em>., found that naturally occurring bacterial consortia could metabolize carbon from the Cold Bokkeveld CM-type carbonaceous chondrite. In 2024, Waajen <em>et al</em>., used a sample of the Aquas Zarcas CM-type carbonaceous chondrite and found that bacterial consortia could use the meteoritic material exclusively as a source of carbon as well as energy and nutrients. In both studies, bacteria were able to directly transfer meteoritic carbon into biomass. The 2022 study explored the possibilities of carbonaceous meteoritic material supporting early life on Earth. The 2024 study also explores this as well as suggesting the possible use of bacteria in processing asteroids for future human activities.</p>

<div data-magellan-destination="sec3" id="sec3"><h2> Methods</h2>
<p> Byrne <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref21"><span>Reference Byrne, Schaerer, Kulas, Ankathi, Putman, Codere, Schum, Shonnard and Techtmann</span>2022</a>) demonstrated the ability of pyrolysis to produce microbially biodegradable intermediate compounds from high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Pyrolysis uses high temperatures to break down plastics into lower-molecular-weight hydrocarbons (Gracida-Alvarez <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref56"><span>Reference Gracida-Alvarez, Mitchell, Sacramento-Rivero and Shonnard</span>2018</a>). These lower-carbon length hydrocarbons are more easily degraded by microorganisms, particularly for carbon lengths on the order of C10 – C40 (Ji <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref68"><span>Reference Ji, Mao, Wang and Bartlam</span>2013</a>). The hydrocarbons produced by pyrolysis by Byrne <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref21"><span>Reference Byrne, Schaerer, Kulas, Ankathi, Putman, Codere, Schum, Shonnard and Techtmann</span>2022</a>) were analysed with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to quantify the residual compound concentrations of alkenes. In an ideal scenario, the pyrolysis results would be compared to the organic compounds available in high carbon carbonaceous meteorites to determine if the asteroid compounds contain the same potentially human edible biomass identified by Byrne <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref21"><span>Reference Byrne, Schaerer, Kulas, Ankathi, Putman, Codere, Schum, Shonnard and Techtmann</span>2022</a>).</p>
<p> In the Murchison meteorite ~70% of the organic compounds comprise IOM. Studies of the precise breakdown of this IOM, in terms of specific compounds and quantities, are severely limited. Therefore, it is impossible to accurately determine what proportion of organic material in meteorites matches the types of compounds that can be converted into food, such as the low-C chain aliphatic hydrocarbons identified by Byrne <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref21"><span>Reference Byrne, Schaerer, Kulas, Ankathi, Putman, Codere, Schum, Shonnard and Techtmann</span>2022</a>). Instead, the calculations in this study will use the abundance of aliphatic hydrocarbons in the Murchison meteorite (&gt;35&nbsp;ppm, <a href="#tab01">Table 1</a>) as a baseline for the calculations, representing the <em>minimum amount of organic matter that could theoretically be attributed to protein production.</em> This minimum value assumes that only the aliphatic hydrocarbons present in asteroids will be effectively converted into biomass. <em>C</em>alculations for the total C in IOM represent the <em>maximum amount of organic matter that could theoretically be attributed to food production</em>. This is a pure theoretical exercise considering the lack of scientific literature on this topic. The maximum value assumes that all IOM is capable of being effectively converted into biomass. Together, these two values will provide a range of realistic yields to determine how much food could theoretically be extractable from an asteroid. To determine how many grams of biomass could be produced from this organic matter, the mass balance calculations from Byrne <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref21"><span>Reference Byrne, Schaerer, Kulas, Ankathi, Putman, Codere, Schum, Shonnard and Techtmann</span>2022</a>) are used.</p>
<p> The following calculations determine the biomass extractable from an asteroid (<em>b</em>) given the initial mass of the asteroid (<em>m</em> <sub>a</sub>), the proportion of organic material (<em>O</em>) of the asteroid (From <a href="#tab01">Table 1</a>, adapted from Alexander <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref6"><span>Reference Alexander, Cody, De Gregorio, Nittler and Stroud</span>2017</a>)), and the proportion of organic compounds that are in the pyrolysis list in Byrne <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref21"><span>Reference Byrne, Schaerer, Kulas, Ankathi, Putman, Codere, Schum, Shonnard and Techtmann</span>2022</a>) that can be converted into proteins. In the minimum scenario, <em>O</em>&nbsp;<em>=</em>&nbsp;<em>0.0035</em> to represent the concentration of aliphatic hydrocarbons in the Murchison meteorite (&gt;35&nbsp;ppm, <a href="#tab01">Table 1</a>), and in the maximum scenario <em>O</em>&nbsp;<em>=</em>&nbsp;<em>0.096</em> to represent the concentration of IOM in the Murchison meteorite (0.96&nbsp;wt %, <a href="#tab01">Table 1</a>).</p>
<p> First, the mass of organic material present in asteroid (<em>m<sub>o</sub>)</em> is given by:</p><p><span>(1)</span><span><span data-mathjax-type="texmath"><span>$$m_o{\rm \;}( {{\rm grams}} ) = m_a\;( {{\rm grams}} ) \times \;O\;\;( {{\rm unitless}} ) $$</span></span><img data-src="https://static.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20241002074449672-0657:S1473550424000119:S1473550424000119_eqn1.png?pub-status=live" width="293" height="20" data-original-image="/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20241002074449672-0657:S1473550424000119:S1473550424000119_eqn1.png" data-zoomable="false" src="https://www.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20241002074449672-0657:S1473550424000119:S1473550424000119_eqn1.png"></span></p>
<p> Next, the proportion of mass extractable for food production from asteroid (<em>e</em>) is:</p><p><span>(2)</span><span><span data-mathjax-type="texmath"><span>$$e\;( {{\rm unitless}} ) = \displaystyle{{m_p\;( {{\rm grams}} ) } \over {m_i\;( {{\rm grams}} ) }}\;\;\;$$</span></span><img data-src="https://static.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20241002074449672-0657:S1473550424000119:S1473550424000119_eqn2.png?pub-status=live" width="181" height="43" data-original-image="/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20241002074449672-0657:S1473550424000119:S1473550424000119_eqn2.png" data-zoomable="false" src="https://www.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20241002074449672-0657:S1473550424000119:S1473550424000119_eqn2.png"></span></p><p>where, <em>m</em> <sub>p</sub> is the mass attributed to protein production (<a href="#tab01">Table 1</a>, Byrne <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref21"><span>Reference Byrne, Schaerer, Kulas, Ankathi, Putman, Codere, Schum, Shonnard and Techtmann</span>2022</a>)) (grams) and <em>m</em> <sub>i</sub> is the initial mass of pyrolysis product (<a href="#tab01">Table 1</a>, Byrne <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref21"><span>Reference Byrne, Schaerer, Kulas, Ankathi, Putman, Codere, Schum, Shonnard and Techtmann</span>2022</a>)) (grams).</p>
<p> Finally, the biomass extractable from asteroid (<em>b</em>) is thus:</p><p><span>(3)</span><span><span data-mathjax-type="texmath"><span>$$b\;( {{\rm grams}} ) = m_o\;( {{\rm grams}} ) \times e\;( {{\rm unitless}} ) \times k\, ( {{\rm unitless}} ) \times 0.008\;\;$$</span></span><img data-src="https://static.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20241002074449672-0657:S1473550424000119:S1473550424000119_eqn3.png?pub-status=live" width="425" height="20" data-original-image="/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20241002074449672-0657:S1473550424000119:S1473550424000119_eqn3.png" data-zoomable="false" src="https://www.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20241002074449672-0657:S1473550424000119:S1473550424000119_eqn3.png"></span></p><p>where <em>k</em> is the conversion constant, which is currently 0.2 because the conversion efficiency from plastic to biomass is approximately 20% (Byrne <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref21"><span>Reference Byrne, Schaerer, Kulas, Ankathi, Putman, Codere, Schum, Shonnard and Techtmann</span>2022</a>). At present, it is unclear if the conversion efficiency for organic material in asteroids would be similar to that for plastics. For the purposes of this mathematical exercise the assumption is that the conversion efficiency will be the same, however, this may have to be corrected in future studies after testing.</p>
<p> However, this calculation alone would be an oversimplification because of the inefficiencies of extracting resources from a planetary body via in-situ resource utilization (ISRU). Most ISRU technologies have primarily focused on the extraction of oxygen for life support and propellant production (e.g., Taylor and Carrier, <a href="#ref131"><span>Reference Taylor and Carrier</span>1992</a>; Bennett <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref12"><span>Reference Bennett, Ellender and Dempster</span>2020</a>; Schlüter and Cowley, <a href="#ref120"><span>Reference Schlüter and Cowley</span>2020</a>; Linne <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref78"><span>Reference Linne, Schuler, Sibille, Kleinhenz, Colozza, Fincannon, Oleson, Suzuki and Moore</span>2021</a>; Guerrero-Gonzalez and Zabel, <a href="#ref61"><span>Reference Guerrero-Gonzalez and Zabel</span>2023</a>) so there are not good estimates for what the efficiency of an ISRU technology for extracting organic material from an asteroid would be. One potential analogue for these calculations is the method of bioleaching to extract rare earth elements (REE) from rock. Rasoulnia <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref110"><span>Reference Rasoulnia, Barthen and Lakaniemi</span>2021</a>) conducted a critical review of the process and found that the total REE leaching efficiency varied significantly depending on the process parameters, from as low as 0.08% in bastnäsite-bearing rock (the mineral bastnäsite is the most abundant primary source of REEs (Wang <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref142"><span>Reference Wang, Huang, Yu, Zhao, Wang, Feng, Cui and Long</span>2017</a>)) to 80% for extraction from the mineral zircon. Given these extreme uncertainties, the resultant value from equation (<a href="#eqn3">3</a>) is multiplied again by 0.008 to simulate a low extraction efficiency similar to results from Zhang <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#ref149"><span>Reference Zhang, Dong, Liu, Bian, Wang, Zhou and Huang</span>2018</a>) in the extraction from bastnäsite-bearing rock.</p>
<p> Caloric intake requirements differ among astronauts due to size and other factors such as age, metabolism, and gender (Stemonstration Nutrition, NASA, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/stem-content/stemonstrations-nutrition/">https://www.nasa.gov/stem-content/stemonstrations-nutrition/</a>). For these calculations, an average of 2500 calories (<em>C</em>) per day or 912&nbsp;500 calories per year will be assumed. These calorie totals will be used for converting biomass yield to astronaut life-years. Plastics converted to biomass in the lab were analysed by Eurofins Food Chemistry Testing Madison, Inc to determine the calory-content of the biomass (<em>c</em>), as well as specific breakdowns of fat content, carbohydrates, fibre and protein<a href="#fn1"><span>Footnote </span><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>

<div data-magellan-destination="sec4-1" id="sec4-1"><h3> Mass of edible biomass extractable from asteroid Bennu</h3>
<p> Following equation (<a href="#eqn1">1</a>) the <em>minimum</em> estimate of <em>m</em> <sub>o</sub> is 2.565&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;g and the maximum estimate is 7.036&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;g, which is roughly a factor of three. Next, equation (<a href="#eqn2">2</a>) is used to determine what proportion of mass is extractable for food production <em>(x)</em>. To do this, assumptions are made using experimental results from Byrne <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref21"><span>Reference Byrne, Schaerer, Kulas, Ankathi, Putman, Codere, Schum, Shonnard and Techtmann</span>2022</a>) of pyrolysis of different organic materials. Specifically, then if pyrolysis breakdown products were able to be converted to biomass using the consortia that equivalent chemicals found on asteroids could also be converted to biomass with the same nutritional content as the pyrolyzed products. Using results from equations (<a href="#eqn1">1</a>) and (<a href="#eqn2">2</a>), the mass of edible biomass extractable from Bennu is determined (<em>b</em>). The results are summarized in <a href="#tab02">Table 2</a>, calculated in grams. If only the aliphatic hydrocarbons can be converted into biomass (<em>minimum scenario, O</em>&nbsp;<em>=</em>&nbsp;<em>0.0035</em>) the resulting mass of edible biomass extractable from asteroid Bennu ranges from 5.070&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;g to 2.390&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;g. If the biomass extraction process is more efficient, and all IOM is converted into edible biomass (<em>maximum scenario, O</em>&nbsp;<em>=</em>&nbsp;<em>0.096</em>), then the mass of edible biomass extractable from asteroid Bennu ranges from 1.391&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;g to 6.556&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;g. These ranges of values are due to differences in calculations from Byrne <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref21"><span>Reference Byrne, Schaerer, Kulas, Ankathi, Putman, Codere, Schum, Shonnard and Techtmann</span>2022</a>) to determine what mass is attributed to food production.

<p> Based on the food analysis by Eurofins, the total calories extractable from asteroid Bennu is calculated (equation (<a href="#eqn4">4</a>)). From this, equation (<a href="#eqn5">5</a>) is used to calculate the minimum and maximum amount of time in years this could sustain an astronaut for, assuming NASA's standard diet of 2500 calories per day is maintained. The average results for the minimum scenario (only aliphatic hydrocarbons are converted into biomass) is over 631 astronaut life years, and the average results for the maximum scenario (all IOM are converted into biomass) is over 17&nbsp;000 astronaut life years (<a href="#tab03">Table 3</a>).

<p> In addition to these calculations that are specific to the mass of asteroid Bennu, estimates can be made using the same equations to determine the asteroid mass (<em>m</em> <sub>a</sub>) required to sustain an astronaut for a single year (assuming an annual diet consisting of 912&nbsp;500 calories). The results are 206&nbsp;448&nbsp;g of biomass is required to sustain an astronaut for one year to obtain the required 2500 calories per day.</p>
<p> On average, to feed an astronaut for one year would require over 160 million grams of asteroid (&gt; 160&nbsp;000 metric tons) in the minimum-efficiency scenario or over 5 million grams of asteroid (&gt; 5000 metric tons) in the maximum-efficiency scenario (<a href="#tab03">Table 3</a>). For reference, the mass of asteroid Bennu is 77.6 million metric tons.</p>

<div data-magellan-destination="sec5" id="sec5"><h2> Discussion</h2>
<p> The values obtained for the amount of asteroid mass that need to be processed to provide food for a single astronaut are large, but if human exploration of the solar system is to be done, it provides a potential path to doing so. Based on the results of this study, this approach appears promising but there are substantial areas of future work. First, the plastics recycling to food projects currently sponsored by DARPA have a number of ways to target human edible biomass (DARPA Cornucopia programme, <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/cornucopia">https://www.darpa.mil/program/cornucopia</a>) that can be leveraged for applying the same basic mechanisms to space. To get useful (human diet) relevant biomass outputs a scalable open source bioreactor has been developed (Hafting <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref62"><span>Reference Hafting, Yeung, Al-Aribe, Michels and Pearce</span>2023</a>) and is being used to produce biomass that is being tested for chemical toxicity using an open source toolchain (Pham <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref103"><span>Reference Pham, García Martínez, Brynych, Stormbjorne, Pearce and Denkenberger</span>2022</a>). The next state of that work is to do animal trials to obtain U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) status under sections 201(s) and 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), (<a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-ingredients-packaging/generally-recognized-safe-gras">https://www.fda.gov/food/food-ingredients-packaging/generally-recognized-safe-gras</a>) and then human trials.</p>
<p> Meteorites, particularly the carbonaceous type, are a precious and often limited resource. Fortunately, reasonable terrestrial analogues of meteoritic organic compounds (kerogens) are readily available. Future work on this topic could focus on these terrestrial analogues to develop effective and efficient techniques and procedures, before moving on to actual meteorite samples. Thus, in parallel, the identical microbial consortia can be tested on terrestrial kerogens. To make space exploration more cost-effective, there is a reasonable possibility that essentials such as food and water could be produced from resources existing in certain C-class asteroids using ISRU technologies. The extracted water could also potentially be a source of oxygen (for breathing) and fuel (e.g., Taylor and Carrier, <a href="#ref131"><span>Reference Taylor and Carrier</span>1992</a>; Bennett <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref12"><span>Reference Bennett, Ellender and Dempster</span>2020</a>; Schlüter and Cowley, <a href="#ref120"><span>Reference Schlüter and Cowley</span>2020</a>; Linne <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref78"><span>Reference Linne, Schuler, Sibille, Kleinhenz, Colozza, Fincannon, Oleson, Suzuki and Moore</span>2021</a>; Guerrero-Gonzalez and Zabel, <a href="#ref61"><span>Reference Guerrero-Gonzalez and Zabel</span>2023</a>). This study focuses only on the production of edible biomass. The essential idea of Byrne <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref21"><span>Reference Byrne, Schaerer, Kulas, Ankathi, Putman, Codere, Schum, Shonnard and Techtmann</span>2022</a>) to turn initially inedible precursors – post-consumer waste plastic – into edible biomass via microbial assimilation in bioreactors is the basis of this approach. In place of plastics, terrestrial kerogens can be used as the initial carbon source for future studies. Kerogens with H/C ratios in the same range as IOM will be selected. Considerable experimentation will be required to develop the techniques to achieve this, which will require the use of considerable amounts of study material. Fortunately, some types of abundant terrestrial kerogens could provide reasonable analogues of IOM.</p>
<p> Future studies will initially use terrestrial kerogens, however, a fundamental guiding principle is to design processes that mimic an extraterrestrial installation that relies on resources found in space. The use of acidic demineralization to extract IOM is unfeasible since it would involve regularly transporting enormous quantities of highly reactive chemicals as well as the disposal of the spent acids. The aim is to ensure that the only heavy-lift requirements in the initial stages of the development of an asteroidal base would be the processing equipment. Other inputs would be certain dry chemicals necessary to provide essential electrolytes for the bacterial innocula.</p>

<p> The ability of bacteria to assimilate a wide range of naturally occurring terrestrial organic compounds provides a reasonable basis to investigate if the same is true for extraterrestrial organics. If possible, then the ultimate aim of producing food from existing resources found throughout the solar system is achievable, using the approach of Byrne <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref21"><span>Reference Byrne, Schaerer, Kulas, Ankathi, Putman, Codere, Schum, Shonnard and Techtmann</span>2022</a>) and going beyond synthesis from carbon dioxide (Alvarado <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref7"><span>Reference Alvarado, Martinez, Matassa, Egbejimba and Denkenberger</span>2021</a>; Martínez <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref82"><span>Reference Martínez, Alvarado, Christodoulou and Denkenberger</span>2021a</a>). This work also has larger implications on Earth. It may provide alternative means to produce edible biomass from inedible precursors and support current activities in this area of research on alternative foods (Baum <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref10"><span>Reference Baum, Denkenberger, Pearce, Robock and Winkler</span>2015</a>; Martínez <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref83"><span>Reference Martínez, Egbejimba, Throup, Matassa, Pearce and Denkenberger</span>2021b</a>; <a href="#ref84"><span>Reference Martínez, Brown, Christodoulou, Alvarado and Denkenberger</span>2021c</a>) or resilient foods (Schipanski <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref119"><span>Reference Schipanski, MacDonald, Rosenzweig, Chappell, Bennett, Kerr, Blesh, Crews, Drinkwater, Lundgren and Schnarr</span>2016</a>; Gracida-Alvarez <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref56"><span>Reference Gracida-Alvarez, Mitchell, Sacramento-Rivero and Shonnard</span>2018</a>; Linder, <a href="#ref77"><span>Reference Linder</span>2019</a>). This opens up new potentially economic pathways for supplying basic nutrients during times of great distress such as famines or other natural or human-created disasters that cripple normal food supplies (Denkenberger and Pearce, <a href="#ref33"><span>Reference Denkenberger and Pearce</span>2014</a>, <a href="#ref34"><span>Reference Denkenberger and Pearce</span>2015</a>, <a href="#ref35"><span>Reference Denkenberger and Pearce</span>2016</a>; Denkenberger <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref36"><span>Reference Denkenberger, Cole, Abdelkhaliq, Griswold, Hundley and Pearce</span>2017</a>).</p>

<div data-magellan-destination="sec7" id="sec7"><h2> Conclusions</h2>
<p> After comparing the experimental pyrolysis breakdown products, which were able to be converted to biomass using a consortia, it was hypothesized that equivalent chemicals found on asteroids could also be converted to biomass with the same nutritional content as the pyrolyzed products. The results of this study found that if only the aliphatic hydrocarbons can be converted into biomass (minimum scenario) the resulting mass of edible biomass extractable from asteroid Bennu ranges from 5.070&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;g to 2.390&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;g. If the biomass extraction process, however, is more efficient, and all IOM is converted into edible biomass (maximum scenario), then the mass of edible biomass extractable from asteroid Bennu ranges from 1.391&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;g to 6.556&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;g. This would provide between 5.762&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>8</sup> and 1.581&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>10</sup> calories that is enough to support between 600 and 17&nbsp;000 astronaut life years. The asteroid mass needed to support one astronaut for one year is between 160&nbsp;000 metric tons and 5000 metric tons. Based on these results, this approach of using carbon in asteroids to provide a distributed food source for humans exploring the solar system appears promising, but there are substantial areas of future work required.</p>

<p>On the last day of 1945, with World War II finally behind it, Finland's government announced a new and very strange policy.</p><p>All Finns were required to take out a pair of scissors and snip their banknotes in half. This was known in Finland as <i>setelinleikkaus</i>, or banknote cutting. Anyone who owned any of the three largest denomination Finnish banknotes&nbsp;<span lang="en"><span>—</span></span> the 5000 markka note, the 1000, or the 500&nbsp;<span lang="en"><span>—</span></span> was required to perform this operation immediately. The left side of the note could still be used to buy things, but at only half its value. So if a Finn had a 1000 markka note in their wallet, henceforth he or she could now only buy 500 markka worth of items at stores. As for the right side, it could no longer be spent and effectively became a bond (more on this later).</p><p><br><i>Setelinleikkaus </i>was Finland's particular response to the post-War European problem of "monetary overhang," described <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=987262">in a 1990 paper</a> by economists Rudi Dornbusch and Holger Wolf. After many years of war production, price controls, and rationing, European citizens had built-up a substantial chest of <i>forced savings</i>, or involuntary postponed consumption, as Dornbusch &amp; Wolf refer to it. With WWII now over, Europeans would soon want to begin living as they had before, spending the balances they had accumulated on goods and services. Alas, with most factories having been configured to military purposes or having been bombed into dust, there wasn't nearly enough consumption items to make everyone happy.</p><p>It was plain to governments all across Europe what this sudden making-up of postponed consumption in a war-focused economy would lead to: a big one time jump in prices.</p><p>This may sound familiar to the modern day reader, since we just went through our own wartime economy of sorts: the 2020-21 battle against COVID and subsequent return to a peacetime economy. The supply chain problem caused by the COVID shutdowns combined with the big jump in spending as lockdowns expired, spurred on by a big overhang of unspent COVID support cheques, led to the steepest inflation in decades.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Dornbusch and Wolf, European authorities fretted that the post-WWII jump in prices could very well spiral into something worse: all-out hyperinflation, as had happened after the first World War. Currencies were no longer linked to gold, after all, having lost that tether when the war started<span lang="en"><span>, </span></span>or earlier, in response to the Great Depression.&nbsp;</p><p>To prevent what they saw as imminent hyperinflation, almost all European countries began to enact monetary reforms. Finland's own unique reform&nbsp;<span lang="en"><span>—</span></span> obliging their citizens to cut their stash of banknotes in two&nbsp;<span lang="en"><span>—</span></span> would reduce the economy's stock of banknotes to just "lefts," thereby halving spending power and muting the wave of post-wartime spending. After February 16, 1946 the halves would be demonetized, but until then the Finns could continue to make purchases with them or bring them to the nearest bank to be converted into a new edition of the currency.</p><p>As for the right halves, they were to be transformed into a long-term investment. Finns were obligated to bring each right half in to be registered, upon which it would be converted into a Finnish government bond that paid 2% interest per year, to be repaid four years later, in 1949. It was illegal to try and spend right halves or transfer their ownership to anyone else (although it's not apparent how this was enforced).</p><p>In theory, turning right halves into bonds would shift a large part of the Finnish public's post-war consumption intentions forward to 1949, when the bonds could finally be cashed. By then, the economy would have fully transitioned back to a civilian one and would be capable of accepting everyone's desired consumption spending without hyperinflation occurring.</p><div><p>To our modern sensibilities, this is a wildly invasive policy. Had <i>setelinleikkaus</i> been proposed in 2022-23 as a way to dampen the inflationary effects of the reopening of COVID-wracked economies, and we all had to cut our dollar bills or yen or euros in half, there probably would have been a revolt. </p><p>With the benefit of hindsight, we know that <i>setelinleikkaus </i>didn't work very well. Finland continued to suffer from high inflation in the years after the war, much more so than most European countries did.</p></div><p>Why the failure? As Finish economist Matti Viren has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018081609/http://www.rahamuseo.fi/monetaria/studia_monetaria_viren_kev%C3%A4t_2007.pdf">pointed out</a>, the reform only affected banknotes, not bank deposits. This stock of notes only comprised 8% of the total Finnish money supply, (Finns being&nbsp; uncommonly comfortable with banks) so a major chunk of the monetary overhang was left in place.</p><p>Another glitch appears to have been the public's anticipation of <i>setelinleikkaus</i>. According to <br>former central banker Antti Heinonen, who wrote <a href="https://www.suomenpankki.fi/fi/julkaisut/muut-julkaisut/hallitus-kansan-kukkarolla/">an entire book</a> on the subject, banks began to advertise their services as a way to avoid the dangers of the upcoming monetary reform (see images below). So Finns deposited their cash prior to the final date, the monetary overhang to some degree evading the blockade.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgl0LBywd5JlwBT3JynEswJWvqMV_Kb2-rUoIT3dqbParkpHHEo64VI2hc6n3KWktGjJfpYt1hIsR6GJI14HRAuOBSYSfA-7a1_GEed001newOG9bZu9RjTTsap8FUzaMs_XjFAeoKulmCg6V6yyR1x2N1ak9JUkP8wwBSR4tnQygH2wz9_QR7X_QQhqF4/s487/heinonen.PNG"><img data-original-height="364" data-original-width="487" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgl0LBywd5JlwBT3JynEswJWvqMV_Kb2-rUoIT3dqbParkpHHEo64VI2hc6n3KWktGjJfpYt1hIsR6GJI14HRAuOBSYSfA-7a1_GEed001newOG9bZu9RjTTsap8FUzaMs_XjFAeoKulmCg6V6yyR1x2N1ak9JUkP8wwBSR4tnQygH2wz9_QR7X_QQhqF4/s16000/heinonen.PNG"></a></td></tr><tr><td><span>Finnish bank advertisements warning of the upcoming note cutting<br>Left: <i>"Bank accounts are fully secured in the banknote exchange</i>." <br>Right: <i>"Depositors are protected</i>."<br> <b>Source</b>: <a href="https://www.suomenpankki.fi/fi/julkaisut/muut-julkaisut/hallitus-kansan-kukkarolla/">Hallitus kansan kukkarolla</a>, by Antti Heinonen (Translations via Google Translate)</span><br></td></tr></tbody></table><p><br>If the Finnish experiment was a dud, other European responses to the post WWII overhang&nbsp;<span lang="en"><span>—</span></span> either&nbsp; redenominations, temporarily blocking of funds, or all-out write offs of bank accounts&nbsp;<span lang="en"><span>—</span></span> were more successful. Germany's <a href="https://www.bundesbank.de/en/press/contributions/the-economic-and-currency-reform-of-1948-the-basis-for-stable-money-915302">monetary reform of 1948</a>, which introduced the Deutschmark and was later dubbed the <a href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/GermanEconomicMiracle.html">"German economic miracle"</a>, is the one that captures the most attention, but here I want to focus on a lesser known reform.</p><div><p>Belgium's <i>Operation Gutt</i>, named after Belgium's Minister of Finance, Camille Gutt, was the earliest and perhaps the most dramatic of the post-war monetary operations. Taking place over four days in October 1944, Belgium contracted its entire money supply, both banknotes and deposits, from 165 billion to 57.5 billion francs. That's a two-thirds decline! You can see it illustrated in the chart below, along with the monetary reform enacted <a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/financial-history-review/article/abs/netherlands-postwar-monetary-reform-1945521/36CF6F0267461A0A8E9BE14C807BC593">by the Dutch</a> the following year, inspired by the Belgians.</p></div><p>It's not just the size of Operation Gutt that is striking to the modern eye. It's also the oddity of the tool being used. Today, we control inflation with changes in interest rates, not changes in the quantity of money. To soften the effect of the global COVID monetary overhang, for instance, central banks in the U.S., Canada, and Europe began to raise rates in 2022 from around 0% to 4-5% in 2024.&nbsp;</p><div><p>By making it more lucrative for everyone to save and less attractive to borrow, central bankers were trying to reduce our propensity to spend our COVID support payments, and with less spending, prices wouldn't get pushed up as fast.&nbsp;This reliance on interest rates as our main tool of monetary policy is a relatively new phenomenon. In times past, central banks tended to lean heavily on changes in the supply of money, which may explain why in 1945, their main response&nbsp;<span lang="en"><span>—</span></span> in Europe at least&nbsp;<span lang="en"><span>—</span></span>&nbsp; was to obliterate the public's money balances rather than to jack up interest rates to 25% or 50%.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>It's worth exploring in some more detail how Operation Gutt was designed. On October 9, 1944, Belgian bank depositors had 90% of the money held in their accounts frozen, leaving just 10% in spendable form.</p></div><p>As for holders of banknotes, there was no Finnish-style cutting. Rather,
 Belgians had four days, beginning October 9, to bring all their 
banknotes to the nearest bank, only the first 2,000 francs qualifying 
for conversion to newly printed versions. All notes above that ceiling 
got blocked in a separate account (along with excess deposits), some of 
which would be released slowly over the next few years<span lang="en"><span>—</span></span>while
 the rest would remain frozen forever, subject to whether the owner was 
deemed to have been a collaborator who got rich during the occupation. 
(Finland's <i>setelinleikkaus </i>also had this same "cleansing" motivation.) <br></p><br><div><p>In this sense, the post-WWII European monetary reforms were not only designed to reduce inflation, but also had a moral basis. Think of them as progenitors to India's 2016 demonetization, which was designed to catch so-called "black money," although <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/30/india-demonetisation-drive-fails-uncover-black-money">it failed</a> to do so.</p><p>Did Operation Gutt work? Incredibly, the decimation of two-thirds of the money supply in just a few days did <i>not </i>cause an immediate fall in Belgian prices. <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/258/oa_monograph/chapter/861769">According to</a> Belgian economic historians Monique Verbreyt and Herman Van der Wee, the Belgian retail price index stood at 260 the month of the reform, but had risen to 387 by September 1945. So it would seem that the whole operation failed. This surely draws into question the <i>quantity theory of money</i>, one of the basic tenets of monetary economics. A decline in the money supply, all things staying the same, is supposed to cause a fall in prices. Here is a glaring case in which it didn't. </p></div><p>However, the National Bank of Belgium (NBB), the country's central bank, strikes a more constructive tone. In a <a href="https://museum.nbb.be/en/resources/operation-gutt-gamble-paid">recent retrospective</a> on Operation Gutt, the NBB describes the reform as a gamble that paid off over time, eventually inspiring the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_economic_miracle">Belgian Economic Miracle</a>", a period of low inflation and fast growth lasting from 1946-1949. By contrast, France did not embark on its own monetary reforms, the NBB takes pains to point out, and it thereby "paid the consequences of post-World War II inflation well into the 1960s." Belgium's inflation rate was also much lower than Finland's in the four or five years after the war.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Which gets us back to Finland. Unlike the Belgian central bank, Finland's central bank&nbsp;<span lang="en"><span>—</span></span> Suomen Pankki&nbsp;<span lang="en"><span>—</span></span> notably <a href="https://www.suomenpankki.fi/fi/haku/?q=Setelinleikkaus">avoids almost all mention</a> of its post-war reform on its website. According to Matti Viren, <i>setelinleikkaus </i>led to "distrust towards the authorities and economic policy for decades," so there may be some sheepish reticence on the part of the central bank to draw attention to it.</p><p>But <i>setelinleikkaus </i>and Operation Gutt aren't just archaic monetary policy dead-ends. One day I suspect they'll be back. Not just as a special tool for responding to emergencies, but as a day-to-day policy wrench, albeit in a new and refined form.&nbsp;</p></div><p>Cash, which is awkward to immobilize for policy reasons, will be gone in a decade or two, leaving the public entirely dependent on bank deposits and fintech balances which, thanks to digitization and automation, can be easily controlled by the authorities. To rein in a jump in inflation, central bankers will require commercial banks and companies like PayPal to impose temporary <i>quantitative freezing</i> on their clients'&nbsp; accounts, but unlike Finland's 1945 blockade, the authorities will be able to rapidly and precisely define the criteria, say by allowing for spending on necessities&nbsp;<span lang="en"><span>—</span></span> food, electricity, and gas<span lang="en"><span>—</span></span> while embargoing purchases of luxury cars and real estate.</p><p>The future version of <i>setelinleikkaus </i>won't be clumsy, it'll be a precise and surgical inflation-fighting tool, albeit a controversial one.<br></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">The Silicon Valley dream is to build a tech startup that is such a unique idea it alters the commercial universe and turns its founders into billionaires. Participating in the Valley’s most famed startup factory, Y Combinator, is often part of that dream. Airbnb, Coinbase, and Stripe all got started there.</p>

<p>Yet, a deep dive into the data from all of the nearly 5,000 companies YC has backed to date reveals a surprising truth: YC startups don’t have to be unique. Far from it.&nbsp;</p>







<p>YC commonly accepts startups that are building similar or nearly identical products to previous YC grads. Some of them are direct competitors; others differ slightly by targeting a new geography (Asia or Latin America), or are a subset of a larger market (point-of-sale software for bars versus coffee shops).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Data analysis startup <a rel="nofollow" href="https://alphalens.com/">Deckmatch</a> conducted the research, inspired to look at competing YC products after a controversy over a YC-backed startup called PearAI. Critics said that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/30/y-combinator-is-being-criticized-after-it-backed-an-ai-startup-that-admits-it-basically-cloned-another-ai-startup/">PearAI’s code editor product wasn’t much more than a cloned version</a> of another YC product, called Continue — and PearAI’s founder essentially admitted it. There were more reasons that Pear found itself in hot water (including the bravado of its founders and how it handled the open source licensing). But the uproar concluded with Pear’s founders vowing to <a href="https://x.com/trypearai/status/1843336730012987613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">start over from scratch</a>.</p>

<p>YC CEO Garry Tan defended the company, and the fact that YC accepted this behavior, by<a href="https://x.com/garrytan/status/1840490996528029942" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> posting on X</a>, “More choice is good, people building is good, if you don’t like it don’t use it.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is clearly more than lip service for Tan, who has himself, for instance, championed two police bodycam startups a few years apart: Flock Safety (Summer 2017 cohort) and Abel Police (Summer 2024). Along the same lines, more than a dozen startups building AI code editors went through the YC program between 2022 and 2024 — some in the same batch with the same YC partner.</p>

<p>When asked about its propensity to back competitors, a YC spokesperson said that the organization is more interested in the founders’ backgrounds than their business ideas. “YC invests in founders over ideas, focusing on individuals with the potential to build transformative companies — no matter the space they operate in. Our investment strategy focuses on backing the most promising founders with vision, resilience, and ability to execute, which is clear in our RFS process,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>


<h2 id="h-some-founders-love-yc-s-approach">Some founders love YC’s approach</h2>

<p>One of YC’s big benefits is its cozy network, where startups often seek customers, partners, and the like. Consequently, some alums dislike competition if they feel another’s product mimics theirs, rather than differentiates. Around the time of the PearAI controversy, YC alum Bryan Onel, founder of security startup Oneleet, <a href="https://x.com/ayushswrites/status/1847000329201528999" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on X</a> about his experience with this. A few others chimed in to commiserate. (Onel did not respond to our requests for comment.)</p>

<p>Then again, other YC alums think this kind of direct competition is good, especially when the same YC partner advises them. Restaurant PoS systems is one area that has been popular in YC, and YC alum Nick Evans, co-founder CEO of restaurant PoS <a href="https://www.avocadopos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Avocado</a>, is fine with competitors.</p>

<p>He should know. Evans famously founded a device-tracking startup called Tile, which went crazy with crowdfunding, raised money from traditional VCs, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/tile-secures-another-40-million-to-take-on-apple-airtag-with-new-products/">took on Apple’s AirTags</a>, then sold to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/family-locator-service-life360-to-acquire-tile-for-205-million/">Life360 in 2021 for $205 million</a>.&nbsp;</p>







<p>“I think it’s stupid that most investors don’t invest in competing companies,” Evans told TechCrunch about YC competition. “I want investors that deeply understand my business and industry. How the hell would they know anything useful if they aren’t working with similar companies? Startups don’t die by murder; they die by suicide. You are not fighting against other startups. You are fighting against people not giving a s— about your product.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-deep-dive-inspired-by-pearai-controversy">Deep dive inspired by PearAI controversy</h2>

<p>Before diving into the specifics of the categories YC has particularly favored, it’s worth noting that Deckmatch is not a YC company and has never applied to be one, CEO Leo Gasteen tells TechCrunch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Deckmatch was inspired to analyze YC products by the PearAI situation as a demo test for its new product AlphaLens. Deckmatch sells product analysis data on about 8 million startups to private market participants like investors, and corporate innovation and M&amp;A teams.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It wants to do for product data what PitchBook did for company-level data, Gasteen says. Earlier this month, Deckmatch raised a $3.1 million seed round co-led by Alliance VC and Luminar Ventures, with participation from its pre-seed investors First Degree Capital and Skyfall Ventures. It’s raised $4.2 million to date, it says.</p>

<p>AlphaLens lets Deckmatch customers comb through its database to find unique and similar products, build scatter charts, cluster maps, and the like. But the <a href="https://labs.alphalens.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">results of the YC analysis</a>, shared exclusively with TechCrunch, should be fascinating to any founder wondering what kinds of startups YC tends to accept.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-types-of-products-yc-loves-according-to-the-data">Types of products YC loves, according to the data</h2>

<p>According to this data, the current popular product categories, each with at least a dozen startups, include:</p>

<p><strong>AI code editors:</strong> Beyond Continue and PearAI, another example is Void (another open source alternative to Cursor, the popular Andreessen Horowitz/OpenAI-backed startup). Then there’s EasyCode, Ellipsis, Cosine, Greptile, and more, each applying AI to various coding tasks.</p>

<p><strong>Food/beverage/restaurant point of sale systems:</strong> Most of the PoS startups were accepted into the program between 2020 and 2023, including Avocado, Dripos, or Latin American startup Polo.&nbsp;</p>







<p><strong>Business finance/payroll:</strong> With the success of YC alums Gusto and Rippling came many competitors, some aimed at different international markets. Examples include Warp and Zeal.</p>

<p><strong>AI sales and customer relationship management.</strong> This is a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/podcast/marc-benioff-says-its-crazy-talk-that-ai-will-hurt-salesforce-wants-a-billion-ai-agents-in-a-year/">very hot area of development for the big players </a>(Salesforce, Microsoft) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/22/ai-sdr-startups-are-booming-so-why-are-vcs-wary/">and startups</a>. YC alums include Apten, Persana AI, and Topo.</p>

<p><strong>AI meeting assistants:</strong> Circleback, Onward, Sonnet, and Spinach AI are but a few examples.</p>

<p><strong>AI legal assistants:</strong> Dioptra, Leya, and Tower are some examples.</p>

<p>Then again, several areas were popular but have been recently less so. These include:</p>

<p><strong>Crypto trading platforms:</strong> Given the success of YC grad Coinbase, YC was gung ho on this for a while, with about a dozen grads, largely from 2014 to 2022.</p>

<p><strong>E-commerce store platforms:</strong> In the wake of Shopify (not a YC alum) YC accepted about a dozen such companies since 2018, with the majority in the 2018 to 2022 time frame.</p>

<p><strong>Corporate expense cards:</strong> After YC alum Brex came many others, mostly from&nbsp;2018 to 2022.</p>

The fault was noted by Tesla in a November 5 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration <a data-offer-url="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2024/RCLRPT-24V832-7628.PDF" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2024/RCLRPT-24V832-7628.PDF&quot;}" href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2024/RCLRPT-24V832-7628.PDF" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">recall</a>. Any sudden loss of propulsion might “increase the risk of a collision,” added the filing ominously. The latest recall—the wedge wagon’s sixth this year—requires shop time, not an over-the-air (OTA) update.</p><p>Reports of instantaneous loss of e-horsepower due to duff drive inverters—devices that convert DC to AC and control an EV’s motor speed and torque—might alarm the average EV motorist, but to extrovert buyers of Elon Musk’s flagship, it’s evidence of the angular pickup’s edginess, Ivan Drury, the director of insights at <a data-offer-url="https://www.edmunds.com/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.edmunds.com/&quot;}" href="https://www.edmunds.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">car shopping guide Edmunds</a>, told WIRED.</p><p>“The people drawn to [the Cybertruck] don’t have quality of construction or safety at the top of mind,” he says. “That this could be a dangerous vehicle to drive is key to its appeal. Nobody’s buying it to use as an actual truck.”</p><p>Stomping on the accelerator pedals of the affected Cybertrucks might get their drivers nowhere—a downer, you’d think, for a vehicle that’s <a data-offer-url="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1851151793876844949" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1851151793876844949&quot;}" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1851151793876844949" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">faster to 60 mph than a Lamborghini</a> Aventador—but, adds the Hawaii-based Drury, that won’t harm the pickup’s reputation with many wannabe owners.</p><p>“The more the press and others say it’s bad, the more that [typical Cybertruck customers] see it as good,” says Drury.</p><p>Mocked online as <a data-offer-url="https://www.reddit.com/r/CyberStuck/comments/1cqjzpu/cybertrucks_have_the_best_nicknames/?rdt=59131" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CyberStuck/comments/1cqjzpu/cybertrucks_have_the_best_nicknames/?rdt=59131&quot;}" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CyberStuck/comments/1cqjzpu/cybertrucks_have_the_best_nicknames/?rdt=59131" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the Cyberbrick</a>, the car launched in <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-cybertruck-success-failure/">December 2023</a>; Tesla had apparently sold <a data-offer-url="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/17/tesla-stops-taking-orders-for-cybertruck-outside-north-america.html" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/17/tesla-stops-taking-orders-for-cybertruck-outside-north-america.html&quot;}" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/17/tesla-stops-taking-orders-for-cybertruck-outside-north-america.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">27,000 of them by October</a> this year, as could be inferred by the number of Cybertrucks listed on the fifth recall. Some 2,431 Cybertrucks were affected by the sixth recall, requiring vehicle drop-off for new drive inverters to be fitted.</p><p>The recalled drive inverters—equipped with potentially faulty metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors—were fitted to Cybertrucks manufactured between November of last year and the end of July this year.</p><p>“It’s common for all-new models to have increased recalls in the first year after launch,” Karl Brauer, executive analyst at car ranking service <a data-offer-url="https://www.iseecars.com/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.iseecars.com/&quot;}" href="https://www.iseecars.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">iSeeCars</a>, tells WIRED. “Where it gets interesting,” Brauer added, “is how quickly this initial spate of recalls falls off after launch versus continuing as the years pass.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>And on this metric, the Cybertruck might be wanting. “Cars with ongoing recalls well after launch suggest a much higher lifetime recall total,” says Brauer. He calculates that the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-is-recalling-over-2400-vehicles-us-nhtsa-says-2024-11-13/">Cybertruck’s six recalls to date</a> are “worse than 91 percent” of other 2024 vehicles. All this was possibly foreshadowed in 2023 when a leaked Tesla report showed the Cybertruck had <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/a-leaked-tesla-report-shows-the-cybertruck-had-basic-design-flaws/">basic design flaws</a>.</p><p>“We aren’t comfortable making [lifetime recall] predictions on the Cybertruck at this very early stage,” stresses Brauer, “but so far it isn’t doing very well.”</p><p>Most Cybertruck buyers pay scant attention to longevity estimates, believes Edmunds’ Drury, and plenty probably aren’t exercised by recalls, OTA or otherwise, he said. “Cybertruck customers are in it for the stares and glares—they don’t care about how many times [this vehicle is] going to be recalled over 30 years,” says Drury. “They’re buying this car for now, with zero thought to the future.”</p><p>“A standard auto customer wants to know if a car will last 10 years or will be ongoing good value for money,” he says. “A Cybertruck customer doesn’t care about any of that. Owning a Cybertruck isn’t practical; it’s a boast. A boast that ‘I have so much discretionary income I can afford to waste it on an impractical car.’”</p><p>Similar to other critics (earlier this year, a <a data-offer-url="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/23/business/tesla-cybertruck-is-a-troubled-beast" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/23/business/tesla-cybertruck-is-a-troubled-beast&quot;}" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/23/business/tesla-cybertruck-is-a-troubled-beast" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CNN reviewer called the pickup</a> a “disturbing level of individual arrogance in hard, unforgiving steel”), Drury believes Cybertruck buyers are people “who think, ‘I don’t care if I kill people when I drive this thing down the street,’” he says. “There aren’t many of those people out there, so there’s a relatively small market for the Cybertruck.”</p><p>If Tesla, which was contacted for this piece, is genuinely fishing in smaller pools than originally anticipated by Musk—at a <a data-offer-url="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-2023-cyber-roundup-annual-shareholder-meeting-live-blog/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-2023-cyber-roundup-annual-shareholder-meeting-live-blog/&quot;}" href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-2023-cyber-roundup-annual-shareholder-meeting-live-blog/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2023 shareholder meeting</a> he predicted that Cybertruck sales could hit 250,000 by 2025, and reach 500,000 a year once production ramped up—this might help explain the softening of Cybertruck aftersales.</p><p>“Used values on these things have plummeted dramatically,” said Drury.

Because there’s no sign that Cybertrucks are being traded for trucks—which is what we typically see in America—then this likely isn’t a vehicle being used for trucklike purposes,” says Drury.</p><p>While the Cybertruck’s six recalls this year might not alarm “edgy” consumers, the bad press that often results won’t impress Tesla shareholders—higher-than-average recalls could tarnish the greater brand.</p><p>Any spike in general automobile recalls should not necessarily worry consumers since defects range widely in severity, and very few are stop-sale orders or demands to immediately cease driving any particular model. Automakers might hate to file them, but recalls demonstrate that the regulatory system is working as designed.</p><p>However, with Musk advising the US government—<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/donald-trump-elon-musk-department-of-government-efficiency/">even if it’s at arms-length</a>—some regulators might get their wings clipped, perhaps even reducing the number of product recalls, potentially increasing danger for consumers. Not all Cybertruck owners will be too fussed about that, though.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>
