But there’s a raw charm to them — a punk energy that doesn’t care about realism or proportions. A kind of outsider art that merges pop culture with folklore, action with absurdity, and makes every film feel like a blood-soaked fever dream.</span></span></p><p dir="auto" id="viewer-l70kq1933"><span><span>In some posters, you’d swear the artist hadn’t even seen the film (and truthfully, many hadn’t).

And it worked.</span></span></p><p dir="auto" id="viewer-mur231936"><span><span>“These posters were part of the marketing strategy,” said Ernie Wolfe, a collector and curator who helped bring these artworks to international galleries. “They were designed to get people to come to the screenings — and if that meant making the movie look crazier than it actually was, so be it.”</span></span></p><p data-breakout="normal"><h2 dir="auto" id="viewer-25ha82023"><span><span>Cult Status and Global Recognition</span></span></h2></p><p dir="auto" id="viewer-x1ro52027"><span><span>While they started as practical tools for cinema promotion, the posters gradually became art objects in their own right.</span></span></p><p dir="auto" id="viewer-d37062030"><span><span>In the early 2000s, international art collectors began taking notice. Exhibitions of Ghanaian movie posters began appearing in galleries in New York, London, Berlin, and Tokyo. The very posters once stapled to market walls were now being framed and auctioned off for thousands of dollars.</span></span></p><p dir="auto" id="viewer-xs6ou2033"><span><span>One of the most famous collectors, Wolfgang Held, even described them as “the African equivalent of underground comic book art.”</span></span></p><p dir="auto" id="viewer-6tljl2285"><span><span>Artists like </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.erniewolfegallery.com/joe-mensah" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-hook="web-link"><strong><u><span>Joe Mensah</span></u></strong></a><span>, </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.erniewolfegallery.com/heavy-j" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-hook="web-link"><strong><u><span>Heavy J</span></u></strong></a><span>, and </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Ce4busqvnmY/" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-hook="web-link"><strong><u><span>Stoger</span></u></strong></a><span>&nbsp;have since become cult icons among poster enthusiasts.

Hello all NetBSD users, enthusiasts/hobbyists, retro gamers.<p>As 2025 draws to a close, I are reaching out to community with a request for helping The NetBSD Foundation.</p><p>Right now, The NetBSD foundation have raised $10,738 of $50,000 goal for the year. The foundation need one final push to help it cross the finish line and fully fund their work for the coming year.</p><p>If you donate today, your contribution will directly support critical, tangible projects that keep NetBSD modern, secure, and available to everyone:</p><p>=&gt; RISC-V Support: Expanding NetBSD's reach to this new, open-source hardware architecture.</p><p>=&gt; Wi-Fi Renewal: A massive, ongoing project to modernize our wireless networking stack, making NetBSD more practical than ever on laptops and embedded devices.</p><p>NetBSD isn't just another operating system. It is a vital part of the entire technology ecosystem.</p><p>In an age of planned obsolescence, NetBSD is a powerful force for sustainability. Foundation's commitment to running on a vast array of hardware—new and old—helps reduce e-waste. Old laptops and single-board computers that would otherwise be in a landfill are given new life as robust firewalls, file servers, or even retro-gaming machines, all thanks to NetBSD.</p><p>The NetBSD foundation need our help to close this $39,262 gap before the year ends.</p><p>Please consider making a year-end donation to help them continue this important work.</p><p>https://netbsd.org/donations/</p><p>Thanking you in Advance,</p><p>Humble NetBSD user Jay</p><p>P.S. If you've already donated, thank you! You can also help by sharing this email or posting on social media about why you support NetBSD using the hashtag #WhyIRunNetBSD 🙏</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<time datetime="2025-08-03">Aug 3, 2025</time>



(<a href="http://maurycyz.com/tags/programming">Programming</a>) 



<p>A week ago, I set up an <a href="https://maurycyz.com/babble/entry-point">infinite nonsense</a> crawler trap – now it makes up 99% of my server’s traffic.
What surprised me is that feeding scrapers garbage is the cheapest and easiest thing I could do.</p>
<h2 id="meet-the-bots">Meet the bots:</h2>
<p>These aren’t the indexing bots of old, but scrapers collecting data to train LLMs.
Unlike search engines, which need the websites they crawl to stay up, AI companies provide a replacement.</p>
<p>It should come as no surprise that these bots are <a href="https://status.sr.ht/issues/2025-03-17-git.sr.ht-llms/">aggressive and relentless</a>:
They ignore robots.txt, and if block them by user agent they just pretend to be a browser.
If you ban their IP, they switch addresses.</p>
<p>… all while sending multiple requests per second, all day, every day.</p>
<h2 id="giving-up">Giving up:</h2>
<p>So what if we let them access the site?</p>
<p>Serving static files is is relatively cheap, but not free.
SSD access times are in the tens milliseconds, and that’s before you pay the filesystem tax.
Bots also like to grab old and obscure pages, ones that are unlikely to be in cache.
As a result, it doesn’t take all that many requests to bog down the server.</p>
<p>Then there’s the matter of bandwidth:
Many blog posts also include images weighing hundreds to thousands of kB, which can add up <a href="https://about.readthedocs.com/blog/2024/07/ai-crawlers-abuse/">quite quickly</a>.
With an average file size of 100 kB, 4 requests per second adds up to a terabyte each month
– not a huge amount of data, but more then I’m willing to throw away.</p>
<h2 id="the-ban-hammer">The ban hammer:</h2>
<p>Simply making a list of IPs and blocking them would for normal bots…</p>
<p>… but these are hardly normal bots.
Because they are backed by billion dollar companies, they don’t just have a few addresses, but many thousands.
If you managed to ban all of their addresses, they’ll just buy more.</p>
<p>Rate limits fail for the same reason: They just switch IPs.
I’ve even seen them using new IP for each request.</p>
<h2 id="building-a-wall">Building a wall:</h2>
<p>Ok, what about a pay-wall, login-wall, CAPTCHA-wall, or a <a href="https://anubis.techaro.lol/">hash based proof-of-work</a>?</p>
<p>All of these inconvenience users.
Requiring an account guaranties that no one will read what I wrote.
Even just a simple JavaScript challenge will block anyone who’s browser doesn’t support JS
… and when it works, anything that must load before the does content still <a href="https://maurycyz.com/misc/inline_css/">hugely slows down page loads</a>.</p>
<h2 id="throw-them-some-bombs">Throw them some bombs:</h2>
<p>“Serve them few gzip bombs, that’ll teach them” — <a href="https://idiallo.com/blog/zipbomb-protection">Half the internet</a>.</p>
<p>Gzip only provides a compression ratio of a little over 1000:
If I want a file that expands to 100 GB, I’ve got to serve a 100 MB asset.
Worse, when I tried it, the bots just shrugged it off, with some even coming back for more.</p>
<h2 id="jedi-mind-tricks">Jedi mind tricks:</h2>
<p>Ok, what if we just send them 404s – try and make them think my site doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>These tricks only work if your adversary has a mind to trick.
If a link is posted somewhere, the bots will know it exists, and if they can’t access it, they’ll just become more aggressive:.
sending more requests, with more user agents and using more addresses.</p>
<p>Keeping them happy keeps them tolerable.</p>
<h2 id="garbage">Garbage:</h2>
<p>But surely sending them dynamically generated content would be expensive right?</p>
<p>Well… no.</p>
<p>CPU and RAM are the fastest parts of a modern computer.
Dynamic content has the reputation of being slow because it often involves a database (lots of disk IO), a million lines of JavaScript, or both.</p>
<p>My lightly optimized <a href="https://maurycyz.com/projects/trap_bots/">Markov babbler</a> consumes around ~60 CPU microseconds per request.
There’s no disk IO, and the memory cost is only around 1.2 MB.
There’s also no rules or blacklists to maintain: the bots come to it and it consumes them.</p>

<p>If you have a git repository on a server with ssh access, you can just clone it:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span><span># This works. </span>
</span></span><span><span>git clone ssh://username@hostname/path/to/repo
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You can then work on it locally and push your changes back to the origin server.
By default, git won’t let you push to the branch that is currently checked out, but this is easy to change:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span><span># Run this on the remote server. </span>
</span></span><span><span>git config receive.denyCurrentBranch updateInstead
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is a great way to sync code between multiple computers or to work on server-side files without laggy typing or manual copying.
If you want to publish your code, just point your web server at the git repo:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>git clone https://hostname/path/to/repo/.git
</span></span><span><span><span># You can get rid of the .git part of the command by either setting the</span>
</span></span><span><span><span># server to remap it to a nicer URL or by just renaming the .git directory</span>
</span></span><span><span><span># (although this stops you from running git server side)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>… although you will have to run this command server-side to make it cloneable:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span><span># Create some files used by git-over-http:</span>
</span></span><span><span><span># Should be repeated after making changes.</span>
</span></span><span><span>git update-server-info
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>That’s a lot of work, so let’s set up a hook to do that automatically:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span><span># Automatically run git update-server-info.</span>
</span></span><span><span><span># Should be run server-side</span>
</span></span><span><span>cp .git/hooks/post-update.sample .git/hooks/post-update
</span></span><span><span>chmod a+x .git/hooks/post-update
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Git hooks are just shell scripts, so they can do things like running a static site generator:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>cat &gt; .git/hooks/post-update <span>&lt;&lt;EOF
</span></span></span><span><span><span>#!/bin/sh
</span></span></span><span><span><span>set -euo pipefail
</span></span></span><span><span><span>cd /path/to/site
</span></span></span><span><span><span>/path/to/generator
</span></span></span><span><span><span>EOF</span>
</span></span><span><span>chmod a+x .git/hooks/post-update
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is how I’ve been doing this blog for a while now:
It’s very nice to be able to type up posts locally (no network lag), and then push them to the server and have the rest handled automatically.</p>
<p>It’s also backed up by default:
If the server breaks, I’ve still got the copy on my laptop, and if my laptop breaks, I can download everything from the server.
Git’s version tracking also prevents accidental deletions, and if something breaks, it’s easy to figure out what caused it.</p>

          This monument popped up in the middle of Barking recently.<br>
<span size="1"><i>I thought it was very recently but it was actually unveiled in <a href="https://www.barkinganddagenhampost.co.uk/news/20903988.new-memorial-asbestos-victims-unveiled/" target="_blank">April 2022</a> and I'm just not very observant.</i></span>
<p>
<img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgbuQ6KlNFIuf2VazqgZ9PcAPZAJhM58DNeRF5URaJuqC4j7n08GgbC1c9F5MTindfgoY-4rUFrjShKYoTXKO-ZVdgyBn0qZRTp261dzFCmjUrHAJJOqfIMxbyIigftS97vfUBKs5s1V1B3XZ9tc1mZ6bavDZJFtR80VVTC61B0TC3m3uzbZ6z7OQ/s1600/asbesto.jpg" title="asbestosis memorial in Barking" data-original-height="375" data-original-width="500"></p><p>
It says <i>"In Memory of those who lost their lives because of exposure to asbestos".</i></p><p>
And it's here because Barking has one of the highest rates of asbestos-related deaths in the country.
</p><p>
In 1913 the <a href="https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Cape_Asbestos_Co" target="_blank">Cape Asbestos Company</a> built a huge asbestos factory beside the River Roding in <a href="https://maps.nls.uk/geo/explore/#zoom=16.2&amp;lat=51.54212&amp;lon=0.07090&amp;layers=193&amp;b=osm&amp;o=100" target="_blank">Barking</a>. The company mined asbestos-bearing rock at several sites in South Africa, then shipped them in sacks to a private quay in Barking for processing. Hundreds of people were employed to mill the ore into usable fibres and then process these into lagging, packaging, pipes, resins, boards and all forms of insulation widely used in the building trade. They worked without masks or other protection, the dangers of asbestos either unknown or not thought worth bothering about. And hundreds of workers died, often many years later, of insidious chronic respiratory disease.
</p><p>
I found a <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/663498c474933dccbbb6c1d6/IQ8.10.L_Document_11_Cape_Asbestos__Asbestos_the_raw_material.pdf" target="_blank">32-page booklet</a> published by Cape Asbestos in the days before blue asbestos was recognised as dangerous and banned, which was as late as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/asbestos-properties-incident-management-and-toxicology/asbestos-general-information" target="_blank">1985</a>. It shows workers with rolled-up sleeves and women leaning over unshielded machines, all potentially inhaling enough fibres to ultimately kill them. I read <a href="https://www.asbestosjustice.co.uk/cape-asbestos-barking-industrial-killing-machine/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reports</a> about the local school in Barking, barely 100 metres away, saying that the playground was often covered in fine dust which children rolled up and played with as if it were snow. I read that mesothelioma was so common in the area it was known as the ‘Barking Cough’. These were different times, but times that <a href="https://www.barkinganddagenhampost.co.uk/news/20903997.i-feel-angry-retired-engineer-looks-back-asbestos-working-conditions/" target="_blank">linger on</a>.
</p><p>
Cape Asbestos's plant eventually closed in 1968 and in its place was built the <a href="https://estatewatch.london/estates/hartslane/" target="_blank">Harts Lane</a> council estate, which is still not the loveliest corner of Barking. It included two tall <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dgeezer/51342305794/" target="_blank">tower blocks</a> called Colne House and Mersey House, both of which Barking &amp; Dagenham council would now like to <a href="https://www.barkinganddagenhampost.co.uk/news/24654131.colne-house-mersea-house-barking-tower-block-demolition-plans/" target="_blank">demolish</a>. This is chiefly because they're old and covered in combustible cladding, but the additional <a href="https://www.yellowad.co.uk/barking-estate-can-never-be-bulldozed-as-it-sits-on-top-of-old-asbestos-factory/" target="_blank">complications</a> of potentially disturbing polluted land puts any remediation out of financial reach. It's always the insulation you have to watch out for.
</p><p>

The memorial in Barking Town Square comprises a polished chunk of blue pearl granite and was unveiled on Workers' Memorial Day 2022 in a ceremony attended by several trade unionists and representatives of the <a href="https://www.lasag.org.uk/" target="_blank">London Asbestos Support Awareness Group</a>. The emphasis is partly on remembrance and partly on the importance of standing up for workers' rights to make conditions better for all. As the inscription says, <i>"Remember the Dead and Fight for the Living"</i>.
</p><p>
My grandfather worked for another Cape Asbestos plant on <a href="https://maps.nls.uk/geo/explore/#zoom=15.9&amp;lat=51.63977&amp;lon=-0.43534&amp;layers=193&amp;b=osm&amp;o=100" target="_blank">Tolpits Lane</a> in Watford. Originally it had been run by <a href="https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Universal_Asbestos_Manufacturing_Co" target="_blank">Universal Asbestos Manufacturing</a> but in 1967 <a href="https://www.britainfromabove.org.uk/en/image/EPR000489" target="_blank">the factory</a> was acquired by Cape as part of a diversification into cement-based products. They made corrugated roofing, flat sheets, decorated sheets, slates, soil pipes, decking for flat roofs and reinforced troughing - that kind of thing - the asbestos moulded into a multiplicity of shapes for the benefit of the building trade.
</p><p>

To him Cape Universal was just a convenient place to work, a short walk across the moor for a day's shift and then home again for tea. He worked there for many years, from the 1930s to the 1960s, rising through the ranks from a labourer to a machine operator on the factory floor. On his death certificate his occupation was listed as 'Asbestos Moulder', and it was very much a premature death because this didn't end well.
</p><p>
I don't remember very much about my grandfather because he died when I was 8. I know he was there when I took my first steps in his back garden and I can remember sitting at his dining room table and hoping nobody would force me to eat the celery. My final memory is being led up to his bedroom, I suspect not long before his death, to see an ill old man laid out in bed and struggling to breathe. I don't know what was said, nor how short a time I stayed in his presence, indeed my strongest recollection is of the room itself with its austere cupboards and the curtains drawn. And then at the age of 67 he was gone.
</p><p>
My family fought for asbestosis to be recognised as his cause of death but were not successful. I've read recently of fellow workers working at the Tolpits Lane factory now getting six figure payouts in compensation, indeed it's hard to research this topic without ending up on legal websites with popups urging you to make a claim. Even four decades after the factory's closure there are still employees severely affected, and many more already passed, as the toxic legacy endures. The <a href="https://osm.org/go/euufATuc" target="_blank">factory site</a> is now a rather cleaner industrial estate and business park, indeed it's where the National Lottery's been based for the last 30 years because risk and loss are still in play.
</p><p><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhoPK9XdiKSCbJ50wEVFWhrKMQN2jKgyN0cEQlEq1TKL9CYoLKbPESGbQgk1Bf_tKKkuVHoawUhyjGdMmOAVvZoAeTf3y6oh4Wu0YCTaLLFXMH2ejtoZmPgMIAJ3OBr4d6o1WGLRB38Li6IBPg_v8lM2clmifYb9u5EG6M8U3ZIbcbMPzPSPIDdLA/s1600/allwy.jpg" title="National Lottery HQ, formerly Cape Universal Asbestos" data-original-height="375" data-original-width="500"></p><p>
Today my Dad reaches the grand old age of 87, a full 20 years more than his father lived. Science has moved on a long way since the 1970s, also educational opportunities and also workers' rights. Health and safety is sometimes much derided but it can genuinely save lives, even much extend them, rather than everyone continually moaning about additional costs and annoying procedures. If someone had shouted earlier and louder about the dangers of asbestos I might have known my grandfather better, my grandmother could have had many more years of married life and my father could have had a father for much longer.
</p><p>
My Dad lost his Dad at the age of 34, which is no age at all in the grand scheme of things. By contrast I still have my Dad at the age of 60, which has meant an extra quarter century of guidance, support, advice, love and always being there. How lucky am I? Every day we overlap with our parents is a blessing and I've had 22,000 of them, for all of which I'm truly grateful. We're off out later to celebrate with a slap-up dinner, or as slap-up as an 87-year-old stomach requires, which the wider family are greatly looking forward to. What Barking's memorial reminded me is that many families have not been so fortunate, and sometimes that loss can be very close to home.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<article>
<p>Hi!  I'm <a href="https://was.tl/">Eric Wastl</a>. I make Advent of Code.  I hope you like it!  I also make <a href="https://was.tl/projects/">lots of other things</a>.  I'm on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/was.tl" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@ericwastl" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/topaz" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p><em>Advent of Code</em> is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar">Advent calendar</a> of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in <a href="https://github.com/search?q=advent+of+code">any</a> programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, <a href="https://gitlab.com/imhoffman/fa19b4-mat3006/wikis/home">university</a> <a href="https://gribblelab.org/teaching/scicomp2021/index.html">coursework</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mrdanielklein/status/936267621468483584">practice</a> <a href="https://comp215.blogs.rice.edu/">problems</a>, a speed contest, or to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/search?q=flair%3Aupping&amp;restrict_sr=on">challenge each other</a>.</p>
<p>You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/7kd8jt/what_would_you_say_are_the_minimal_skills_for/dre0uu3/">problem solving skills</a> will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.</p>
<p>If you'd like to support Advent of Code, you can do so indirectly by helping to  it with others or directly via <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2025/support">AoC++</a>.</p>
<h2>--- General Tips ---</h2>
<p>If you get stuck, try your solution against the <em>examples</em> given in the puzzle; you should get the same answers.  If not, re-read the description.  Did you misunderstand something?  Is your program doing something you don't expect?  After the examples work, if your answer still isn't correct, <em>build some test cases</em> for which you can verify the answer by hand and see if those work with your program.  Make sure you have the entire puzzle input.  If you're still stuck, maybe <em>ask a friend</em> for help, or come back to the puzzle later.  You can also ask for hints in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/" target="_blank">subreddit</a>.</p>
<h2>--- Frequently Asked Questions ---</h2>
<p id="faq_codeselect"><em>Is there an easy way to select entire code blocks?</em> You should be able to triple-click code blocks to select them. You'll need JavaScript enabled.</p><pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env perl
use warnings;
use strict;

print "You can test it out by ";
print "triple-clicking this code.\n";
</code></pre>
<p id="faq_auth"><em>How does authentication work?</em> Advent of Code uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth" target="_blank">OAuth</a> to confirm your identity through other services.  When you log in, you only ever give your credentials to that service - never to Advent of Code.  Then, the service you use tells the Advent of Code servers that you're really you.  In general, this reveals no information about you beyond what is already public; here are examples from <a href="https://api.reddit.com/user/reddit/about" target="_blank">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://api.github.com/users/octocat" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Advent of Code will remember your unique ID, names, URL, and image from the service you use to authenticate.</p>
<p id="faq_difficulty"><em>Why was this puzzle so easy / hard?</em> The difficulty and subject matter varies throughout each event. Very generally, the puzzles get more difficult over time, but your specific skillset will make each puzzle significantly easier or harder for you than someone else. Making puzzles is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/7idn6k/question_why_does_the_difficulty_vary_so_much/dqy08tk/">tricky</a>.</p>
<p id="faq_unlocktime"><em>Why do the puzzles unlock at midnight EST/UTC-5?</em> Because that's when I can consistently be available to make sure everything is working. I also have a family, a day job, and even need sleep occasionally. If you can't participate at midnight, that's not a problem; if you want to race, many people use <a href="https://adventofcode.com/leaderboard/private">private leaderboards</a> to compete with people in their area.</p>
<p id="faq_highcontrast"><em>I find the text on the site hard to read. Is there a high contrast mode?</em> There is a high contrast alternate stylesheet. Firefox supports these by default (View -&gt; Page Style -&gt; High Contrast).</p>
<p id="faq_puzzleideas"><em>I have a puzzle idea! Can I send it to you?</em> Please don't. Because of legal issues like copyright and attribution, I don't accept puzzle ideas, and I won't even read your email if it looks like one just in case I use parts of it by accident.</p>
<p id="faq_puzzlebugs"><em>Did I find a bug with a puzzle?</em> Once a puzzle has been out for even an hour, many people have already solved it; after that point, bugs are very unlikely. Start by asking on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/" target="_blank">subreddit</a>.</p>
<p id="faq_speed"><em>Should I try to get a fast solution time?</em> Maybe. Solving puzzles is hard enough on its own, but trying for a fast time also requires <a href="https://blog.vero.site/post/advent-leaderboard">many</a> <a href="https://kevinyap.ca/2019/12/going-fast-in-advent-of-code/">additional</a> <a href="https://gist.github.com/mcpower/87427528b9ba5cac6f0c679370789661">skills</a> and a lot of practice; speed-solves often look nothing like code that would pass a code review. If that sounds interesting, go for it! However, you should do Advent of Code in a way that is useful to you, and so it is completely fine to choose <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/e2wjhf/comment/f90ksek/">an approach that meets your goals</a> and ignore speed entirely.</p>
<p id="faq_num_days"><em>Why did the number of days per event change?</em> It takes a ton of my free time every year to run Advent of Code, and building the puzzles accounts for the majority of that time. After keeping a consistent schedule for ten years(!), I needed a change. The puzzles still start on December 1st so that the day numbers make sense <span title="Oct 31 = Dec 25">(Day 1 = Dec 1)</span>, and puzzles come out every day (ending mid-December).</p>
<p id="faq_leaderboard"><em>What happened to the global leaderboard?</em> The global leaderboard was one of the largest sources of stress for me, for the infrastructure, and for many users. People took things too seriously, going way outside the spirit of the contest; some people even resorted to things like DDoS attacks. Many people incorrectly concluded that they were somehow worse programmers because their own times didn't compare. What started as a fun feature in 2015 became an ever-growing problem, and so, after ten years of Advent of Code, I removed the global leaderboard. (However, I've made it so you can share a read-only view of your private leaderboard. Please don't use this feature or data to create a "new" global leaderboard.)</p>
<p id="faq_private_leaderboard_rules"><em>While trying to get a fast time on a private leaderboard, may I use AI / watch streamers / check the solution threads / ask a friend for help / etc?</em> If you are a member of any private leaderboards, you should ask the people that run them what their expectations are of their members. If you don't agree with those expectations, you should find a new private leaderboard or start your own! Private leaderboards might have rules like maximum runtime, allowed programming language, what time you can first open the puzzle, what tools you can use, or whether you have to wear a silly hat while working.</p>
<p id="faq_ai"><em>Should I use AI to solve Advent of Code puzzles?</em> No. If you send a friend to the gym on your behalf, would you expect to get stronger? Advent of Code puzzles are designed to be interesting for humans to solve - no consideration is made for whether AI can or cannot solve a puzzle. If you want practice prompting an AI, there are almost certainly better exercises elsewhere designed with that in mind.</p>
<p id="faq_copying"><em>Can I copy/redistribute part of Advent of Code?</em> Please don't. Advent of Code is free to <em>use</em>, not free to copy. If you're posting a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs. If you're making a website, please don't make it look like Advent of Code or name it something similar.</p>

<li>an <strong>original image</strong> (from <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/factsfigures.html" rel="nofollow">Open Images</a>),</li>
<li>a <strong>human-like edit instruction</strong>, and</li>
<li>the <strong>edited result</strong> generated and verified by the <em>Nano-Banana</em> model.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The dataset spans <strong>35 edit operations</strong> across <strong>8 semantic categories</strong>, covering diverse transformations—from low-level color adjustments to high-level object, scene, and stylistic edits.</p>

<p dir="auto">Pico-Banana-400K is built using a <strong>two-stage multimodal generation pipeline</strong>:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Instruction Generation</strong><br>
Each Open Images sample is passed to <em>Gemini-2.5-Flash</em>, which writes concise, natural-language editing instructions grounded in visible content. We also provide short instructions summarized by Qwen-2.5-Instruct-7B.
Example:
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="{
  &quot;instruction&quot;: &quot;Change the red car to blue.&quot;
}

"><pre>{
  <span>"instruction"</span>: <span><span>"</span>Change the red car to blue.<span>"</span></span>
}

</pre></div>
</li>
<li><strong>Editing + Self-Evaluation</strong>
The Nano-Banana model performs the edit, then automatically evaluates the result using a structured quality prompt that measures:
Instruction Compliance (40%)
Editing Realism (25%)
Preservation Balance (20%)
Technical Quality (15%)
Only edits scoring above a strict threshold (~0.7) are labeled as successful, forming the main dataset; the remaining ~56K are retained as failure cases for robustness and preference learning.</li>

        BOTH TRAINS OF CONTROL ROOM EMERGENCY VENTILATION SYSTEM INOPERABLE</p><p>

The following is a summary of information provided by the licensee via phone and email:</p><p>

On October 21, 2025, at 0610 CDT, while reloading fuel to the reactor vessel, an electrical perturbation initiated a control room ventilation isolation signal (CRVIS). The control room air conditioning system (CRACS) 'A' train A/C unit did not start upon the CRVIS due to a blown fuse. The 'B' CRACS A/C unit was out of service for planned maintenance at the time. At 1020 CDT, the 'A' train CRACS A/C unit was returned to service. Both trains of the control room emergency ventilation system (CREVS) were inoperable for 10 minutes. Due to both trains of CRACS and CREVS being inoperable, this condition is being reported as an eight-hour, non-emergency notification per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v).</p><p>

This condition caused entry into technical specification (TS) limiting condition for operation (LCO) 3.7.10 condition `E' and 3.7.11 condition `D'. Upon discovery of the condition, fuel movement and core alterations were suspended in accordance with the TS LCO required actions.</p><p>

There was no impact on the health and safety of the public or plant personnel. The NRC Resident Inspector was notified.

        AUTOMATIC REACTOR TRIP</p><p>

The following information was provided by the licensee via email and phone:</p><p>

"On October 21, 2025, at 2108 EDT, Unit 1 automatically tripped from 74 percent power due to a negative rate trip. The unit has been stabilized in mode 3 at normal operating temperature and pressure. The reactor trip was uncomplicated, and all control rods fully inserted into the core. This reactor protection system actuation is reportable per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B). The auxiliary feedwater pumps actuated as designed because of the reactor trip and is reportable per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) for a valid engineered safety feature (ESF) actuation. Decay heat is being removed via the steam generator power-operated relief valves and Unit 1 is in a normal shutdown electrical lineup. Unit 2 was not affected by this event."</p><p>

        AGREEMENT STATE REPORT - LEAKING SOURCE</p><p>

The following information was provided by the Georgia Radioactive Material Program (the Department) via email:</p><p>

"On October 8, 2025, a leaking source was discovered while performing a routine leak test. The leak test revealed more than 0.005 mCi of removable contamination of Cs-137. The definitive cause of the leakage was not determined; however, cracks in the source were noticed through visible inspection. The leaking source was placed in a lead pig. The pig and cleanup waste were placed in a double bagged plastic bag and stored behind lead bricks. Removable contamination surveys were performed at the site of the leaking source and on the hands of the physicists. All areas and personnel were found to be free of removable contamination. The licensee will contact a company for waste disposal and will notify the department when the disposal is completed. The incident was reported to our office on October 10, 2025."</p><p>

The following information was provided by the Nevada Radiation Control Program via phone and email:</p><p>

"The radiation safety officer for Universal Engineering Services, [license number] 00-11-14033-01, reported to the Nevada Radiation Control Program that a portable gauge had been stolen from the back of a pick-up truck (all chains were cut) at a hotel where an employee was staying in Reno, this morning at 0815 PDT. The gauge in question is a Troxler, model 3430, serial number 37385, with americium-241/beryllium neutron sealed source with an activity of 40 mCi, and a cesium-137 sealed source with an activity of 8 mCi. The licensee is filing a report to the Reno Police Department for the stolen gauge and has been reaching out to local pawn shops.</p><p>

"Notification is made under 10 CFR 20.2201(a)(1)(i)."</p><p>

THIS MATERIAL EVENT CONTAINS A 'Less than Cat 3' LEVEL OF RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL</p><p>

Sources that are "Less than IAEA Category 3 sources," are either sources that are very unlikely to cause permanent injury to individuals or contain a very small amount of radioactive material that would not cause any permanent injury. Some of these sources, such as moisture density gauges or thickness gauges that are Category 4, the amount of unshielded radioactive material, if not safely managed or securely protected, could possibly - although it is unlikely - temporarily injure someone who handled it or were otherwise in contact with it, or who were close to it for a period of many weeks.

        MANUAL REACTOR SCRAM</p><p>

The following information was provided by the licensee via phone and email:</p><p>

"At 1535 CDT on 10/22/2025, with Unit 1 in mode 1 at 86 percent power, the reactor was manually tripped due to low turbine electro-hydraulic control (EHC) oil system reservoir level, caused by a leak developing in the heater bay. The trip was not complex, with all systems responding normally post-trip. Due to the reactor protection system actuation while critical, this event is being reported as a four-hour, non-emergency notification per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B).</p><p>

"Operations responded using the emergency operating procedure for reactor pressure vessel control and stabilized the plant in mode 3. Decay heat is being removed by discharging steam to the main condenser using the turbine bypass valves, which have a separate EHC oil system.</p><p>

"There was no impact on the health and safety of the public or plant personnel. The NRC Resident Inspector has been notified."

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"><p>At first, all of this AI stuff felt exciting. I was curious to try everything (I was actually one of the few naive people who thought the Rabbit R1 was a good product before it eventually launched), and for a while, it felt useful.</p>    <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! --><!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! --><p>But over time, I realized <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/why-ai-features-ruin-smartphone-innovation/" target="_blank">AI isn't just affecting smartphones</a>; it's creeping into all consumer tech, often making products worse instead of better. What started as something promising has become a constant stream of gimmicks and distractions I didn't ask for.</p>    <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! --><h2 id="ai-features-are-making-products-worse-not-better">

    </h3>


            
    
<p>Somewhere along the way, tech companies forgot what made their products great in the first place. Every update now seems to revolve around AI, even if it means breaking what already worked. The focus isn't on refining the experience anymore; it's about finding new places to wedge in an AI assistant, a chatbot, or some vaguely "smart" feature that adds little value to the people actually using it.</p>    <p>Gemini is a perfect example. Google replaced Assistant with something that was supposed to be smarter, but in practice, it just got in the way. Simple commands started taking longer, and half the time, it couldn't even do something as basic as turning on my lights.</p>    <p>The LLM inference delay alone made me stop using it altogether. <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/im-done-with-gemini-i-went-back-to-google-assistant/" target="_blank">I went back to the old Google Assistant</a> because, at least, it worked when I needed it to. Apple isn't doing much better. Siri was already horrible to begin with, but with Apple Intelligence, it has somehow managed to get even worse.</p>    <p>Microsoft has fallen into the same trap. Copilot is everywhere in Windows now — pinned to the taskbar, forced into apps, and even sometimes showing up as ads on the lock screen. It feels less like a helpful feature and more like something Microsoft wants to constantly shove in my face, taking up space I'd rather use for things that actually matter.</p>

<p> Even Arc, which has been my daily browser since its beta days, couldn't escape it. Its successor, <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/arc-supposed-successor-not-even-close/" target="_blank">Dia, went all-in on AI and lost everything that made the original special</a>. It's yet another example of a great idea being replaced by something that exists purely to fit the trend. And Dia now pretty much exists as the same product as Perplexity's Comet, or OpenAI's new ChatGPT Atlas browser.</p>    <p>At this point, AI isn't even about improving products anymore. It's a marketing checkbox companies use to convince shareholders they're staying ahead in this artificial race. Whether it's a feature nobody asked for or a chatbot no one uses, it's all about being able to say "we have AI too." That constant push for relevance is exactly what's ruining the products that used to feel polished and well-thought-out.</p>    <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! --><h2 id="the-internet-itself-feels-worse-because-of-generative-ai">

<p> <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/dead-internet-theory-explained/" target="_blank">The dead internet theory</a> suggests that most of the content we see online isn't made by real people anymore, but by bots and automated systems that mimic human behavior. It used to sound far-fetched, but these days, it feels pretty close to reality.</p>    <p>I've felt it most on X. It used to be one of the apps I opened every day, but now it feels like half the posts are written by ChatGPT. The comments under most tweets follow the same robotic tone, and it's obvious that a lot of them exist only to farm engagement. Since X pays verified users for impressions and boosts their visibility, the top replies are usually just spam from accounts pretending to be real people. It's not a community anymore; it's a loop of bots talking to other bots for profit.</p>    <p>That same emptiness is spreading everywhere. Instagram and YouTube are filled with recycled, AI-written scripts. Reddit threads feel more like generated summaries than real discussions. There's no sense of authenticity left, just the same rephrased, SEO-optimized noise designed to go viral.</p>    
    
    
    
<p>Even Google Search, which used to be the foundation for finding real information, now struggles with its own AI additions. The new AI overviews are often wrong, confidently spitting out hallucinated facts instead of reliable results. And the worst part is that Google treats them like an upgrade, when in reality, they're a downgrade from what used to work perfectly fine.</p>    <p>The internet used to be messy, human, and unpredictable. That's what made it interesting. Generative AI has flattened all of that into a lifeless feed of content that looks real but isn't.</p>    <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! --><h2 id="there-39-s-nothing-ethical-about-how-this-stuff-is-built">

<p> The problem with generative AI goes far deeper than annoying features. It starts with how these models are trained. Large language models learn by analyzing massive amounts of data scraped from the internet, like books, articles, photos, videos, and social media posts — all taken without asking permission. What it really means is that someone's original work is being used to build a commercial product they'll never profit from.</p>    <p>Every creative field has been affected. Writers, artists, and photographers have found their work inside datasets used to train AI tools that can now mimic their style. In most cases, there's no credit, no payment, and no consent involved. When an AI tool generates an article, an image, or even a song, it's built on the collective effort of thousands of people who never agreed to be part of the process.</p>    <p>If you engage with a post that features an AI-generated video, your view still counts as engagement. That interaction feeds money and visibility to whoever uploaded it, not to the original artists whose work the model learned from. The system rewards the wrong side of creativity while quietly taking more data from users to fuel itself.</p>    <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! --><h3 id="your-data-is-training-the-next-model">

<p> These systems also depend on constant data collection to improve their output. Every prompt you type, every voice query you make, and every interaction you have with an AI product is stored, analyzed, and often used to refine future models.</p>    <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! --><p>What's worse is how personal these systems have become. People talk to models like ChatGPT in ways they'd never talk to a human. They share ideas, insecurities, life problems, and things that paint a detailed picture of who they are. And that's data too. Every conversation helps these companies build a psychological profile that's far more accurate than anything traditional advertising could ever create.</p>    <p>Think about how much Google already knows about you. Now, when you use Gemini with the same Google account, they know even more. Between your search history, emails, location, and other activity, they can build a very detailed picture of you.

<p>Generative AI and LLMs are impressive tools, and they can be genuinely useful when used thoughtfully. The problem is that they're treated like the centerpiece of every product instead of a supporting feature.</p>    <p>I wish companies would step back and focus on what actually makes their products work well for people, rather than piling on AI just to look innovative.</p>    </div></div>]]></description>

<h2 id="part-1--from-power-button-to-the-kernels-first-breath">Part 1 — From power button to the kernel’s first breath</h2>

<p>You press the power button. A second later a wall of text scrolls by, or a logo fades in, and eventually Linux appears. What happens in between is not magic. It is a careful handshake between tiny programs and a very literal CPU. This part follows that handshake until the very first line of C code inside the Linux kernel runs.</p>

<h3 id="the-very-first-instruction">The very first instruction</h3>

<p>When power stabilizes, the CPU resets itself to a tiny, old‑fashioned mode called real mode. Real mode dates back to the original 8086 chip. The rules are simple on purpose. Memory addresses are built from two values the CPU keeps in special fast storage called registers. You combine a segment and an offset like this:</p>

<p><code>physical_address = (segment &lt;&lt; 4) + offset</code></p>

<p>If you see numbers like <code>0xFFFFFFF0</code>, that is hexadecimal. Hex is base 16. We write <code>0x</code> in front to make that clear. <code>0x10</code> is 16 in everyday counting. <code>0x100000</code> is 1 megabyte. Hex lines up nicely with how hardware stores bits, which is why you see it everywhere in low‑level code.</p>

<p>Right after reset the CPU jumps to a special address called the reset vector at <code>0xFFFFFFF0</code>. Think of it as a permanent bookmark that says “start here.” There is room for almost nothing at that address, so manufacturers put a short jump there that passes control to the firmware on your motherboard.</p>

<p><strong>Tiny explainer: register</strong>
A register is a tiny slot inside the CPU. It holds a number the CPU is using right now. Names like CS and IP are register names. CS means “code segment,” which marks the current neighborhood for instructions. IP means “instruction pointer,” which marks which instruction comes next.</p>

<h3 id="bios-and-uefi">BIOS and UEFI</h3>

<p>The firmware is a small starter program baked into your board.</p>

<p>BIOS stands for Basic Input Output System. It is the older style. BIOS does a quick health check called POST, looks at the boot order, and tries each device. If it finds a disk whose very first 512‑byte sector ends with the marker bytes <code>0x55</code> and <code>0xAA</code>, it treats that device as bootable. BIOS copies that sector to memory at <code>0x7C00</code> and jumps there. That sector is tiny, so it usually knows only how to load the next, larger piece.</p>

<p>UEFI is the modern replacement. It still starts the machine, but it understands filesystems directly and can load bigger boot programs without the old “first sector” dance. UEFI also passes richer information to the operating system. Different path, same goal: hand control to a boot program that can load Linux.</p>

<h3 id="meet-the-bootloader">Meet the bootloader</h3>

<p>The bootloader is the usher that gets the operating system into place. GRUB is a popular choice on PCs. It reads its configuration, shows a menu if you installed one, and loads the Linux kernel into memory. The Linux kernel file actually contains two things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a small setup program that still runs in real mode</li>
  <li>the larger compressed kernel that will be unpacked a little later</li>
</ul>

<p>GRUB also fills out a small structure called the setup header with useful facts: where it placed the kernel, where the command line lives, where the initrd is if you have one. Then it jumps into the setup program.</p>

<h3 id="the-setup-program-makes-a-safe-room">The setup program makes a safe room</h3>

<p>Before Linux can do anything interesting, the setup code creates a predictable workspace.</p>

<p>It lines up the segment registers so memory copies behave the same way every time. Names you’ll see here are CS for code, DS for data, and SS for stack. It also clears a single CPU bit called the “direction flag” so copy instructions move forward through memory.</p>

<p>It creates a stack. The stack is a last‑in, first‑out workbench where functions store temporary values. SS says which segment the stack uses. SP is the pointer to the current top of the stack.</p>

<p>It clears a region called BSS. BSS is where global variables that must start as zero live. C code assumes BSS is zero. The setup program writes zeros over that entire span to keep that promise.</p>

<p>If you passed <code>earlyprintk</code> on the kernel command line, the setup code also programs the serial port so it can print very early messages. This is useful when graphics are not ready yet.</p>

<p>Finally the setup program asks the firmware “how much usable RAM do we really have and where are the holes.” On old BIOS this is a call people often nickname e820, which returns a simple list of usable and reserved ranges. The kernel will use that list to avoid stepping on the firmware’s toes.</p>

<p>With that done, the setup code calls its first C function, which is literally named <code>main</code>. We are still in the small old real mode at this point. The next job is to leave it.</p>

<p><strong>Tiny explainer: interrupt</strong>
An interrupt is a hardware or software “excuse me” that pauses what the CPU is doing and runs a small handler for something urgent. A timer tick is an interrupt. A key press is an interrupt. There are two flavors here. Maskable interrupts follow your rules and can be temporarily blocked so they do not fire during delicate moments. Non‑maskable interrupts, often called NMI, always cut in because they usually report serious hardware issues. We will control both while switching modes so nothing surprises us halfway through.</p>

<h2 id="part-2--leaving-real-mode-stepping-through-32bit-land-and-arriving-in-64bit">Part 2 — Leaving real mode, stepping through 32‑bit land, and arriving in 64‑bit</h2>

<p>Modern Linux on PCs runs in long mode, which is the 64‑bit mode of x86_64. You cannot jump there directly from real mode. The path is real mode to protected mode and then protected mode to long mode. This part covers that path and explains the vocabulary on the way.</p>

<h3 id="protected-mode-without-the-jargon-haze">Protected mode, without the jargon haze</h3>

<p>Protected mode is the 32‑bit world introduced to get past the limits of the 1980s. It adds two central ideas.</p>

<p>The Global Descriptor Table, or GDT, is a short list of segment descriptions. A description says “this segment starts here, covers this much, and is allowed to do these things.” Linux keeps this simple. It uses a flat model, which means the base is zero and the size covers the whole 32‑bit space. When everything is flat, addresses look like plain numbers again.</p>

<p>The Interrupt Descriptor Table, or IDT, is a directory of “phone numbers” for emergency calls. If an interrupt arrives, the CPU looks up the entry in the IDT and jumps to the handler listed there. During the switch we load a tiny placeholder IDT because we are about to block interrupts anyway. The full‑featured IDT arrives later once the real kernel is in charge.</p>

<h3 id="the-careful-switch">The careful switch</h3>

<p>The setup code turns off the noisy parts first. It disables maskable interrupts with a single instruction. It quiets the old PIC chips so hardware interrupts are fully blocked for a moment. It opens the A20 line. This is a historical quirk. Early PCs made addresses wrap at 1 megabyte. Opening A20 removes that wrap so higher addresses work like you expect. It resets the math coprocessor so the floating point state is clean.</p>

<p>Then it loads a tiny GDT with only what we need right now and a tiny IDT. Finally it sets a single bit named PE in a control register named CR0 and performs a far jump. That jump reloads the code segment from the GDT and locks in protected mode. It reloads the data and stack segments and fixes the stack pointer to match the new flat world.</p>

<p>We are now in 32‑bit protected mode.</p>

<p><strong>Tiny explainer: control registers</strong>
The CPU has a few special registers for on off switches. CR0 turns on protected mode. CR3 holds the address of the top of the page tables, which we will need in a second. CR4 enables a set of extended features such as larger page table entries.</p>

<h3 id="why-we-still-are-not-done">Why we still are not done</h3>

<p>Linux wants 64‑bit. That is long mode. Two things are needed.</p>

<p>Paging must be on. Paging is the translator between virtual addresses and physical addresses. Programs use virtual addresses. The hardware reads and writes physical memory. Page tables map one to the other in fixed‑size chunks called pages. On PCs a normal page is 4 kilobytes. There are also bigger pages. Early in boot the kernel uses 2 megabyte pages to describe low memory quickly.</p>

<p>A single bit named LME in a special register called EFER must be set to allow long mode. EFER is a model specific register, which is a fancy way of saying “a register used for certain CPU features.”</p>

<h3 id="building-just-enough-paging">Building just enough paging</h3>

<p>The 32‑bit prologue builds a small set of page tables that say “for this region, virtual equals physical.” That is called an identity map. It is enough to flip paging on safely.</p>

<p>To make this work the code enables PAE in CR4 so larger entries are used. It builds a minimal set of tables that cover low memory in 2 megabyte chunks. It writes the address of the top table into CR3. Paging is now ready.</p>

<p>Finally it sets LME in EFER and performs a far return into a label that is written as 64‑bit code. Long mode is now active. Segments are still “flat,” but addresses and registers are 64‑bit wide.</p>

<p><strong>Why all the extra care</strong>
Switching modes while a live system runs is like changing a car tire while rolling. The code blocks interruptions, prepares the minimum needed tables, flips the bit, and only then invites interrupts back. Slow and steady prevents weird half‑switched states.</p>

<h2 id="part-3--unpacking-the-real-kernel-fixing-addresses-and-why-linux-sometimes-moves-itself">Part 3 — Unpacking the real kernel, fixing addresses, and why Linux sometimes moves itself</h2>

<p>We have a 64‑bit CPU with paging on and a compressed kernel in memory. Now the small 64‑bit stub does the practical work: get out of the way if needed, unpack the kernel, fix addresses if the kernel is not at its default spot, and jump.</p>

<h3 id="clearing-a-path-and-setting-safety-nets">Clearing a path and setting safety nets</h3>

<p>The stub first figures out where it is actually running. Early code is linked as if it lived at address zero and then computes its real base at runtime. If the planned destination for the decompressed kernel would overlap the stub, it copies itself to a safe place.</p>

<p>It clears its own BSS so global state starts clean.</p>

<p>It loads a minimal IDT with two handlers. One for page fault and one for NMI. A page fault happens when the CPU cannot find a mapping for a virtual address it just tried to use. In our early identity‑mapped world, the tiny page fault handler can add the missing mapping on the fly and continue. The NMI handler is there so a non‑maskable interrupt does not crash the machine while we are still bringing things up.</p>

<p>It also builds identity mappings for the regions it will touch next. That includes the future home of the kernel, the small boot parameters page the bootloader filled in, and the command line buffer.</p>

<h3 id="decompressing-linux">Decompressing Linux…</h3>

<p>A C function commonly named <code>extract_kernel</code> takes over. It sets aside a tiny heap for temporary buffers, prints the classic line, and unpacks the kernel using whatever algorithm the kernel was built with. gzip, xz, zstd, lzo, and others all plug into the same wrapper.</p>

<p>When the bytes are out, the decompressor reads the kernel’s ELF headers. ELF, short for Executable and Linkable Format, is both a file format and a map. It says which chunks are code, which are data, and exactly where each chunk wants to live. The decompressor copies each chunk where it belongs.</p>

<p>If the kernel is being loaded at a different address than it was built for, the decompressor applies relocations. A relocation is a small fix‑up that adjusts a pointer or an instruction that contains an address. The decompressor walks a list of these and patches each place so it points to the right spot in the address space we are actually using.</p>

<p>When everything is in place, the decompressor returns the entry point of the real kernel and jumps there, passing a pointer to the boot parameters. From that moment you are in the full kernel. The first function you meet is <code>start_kernel</code>, and the big initialization begins.</p>

<h3 id="why-the-kernel-sometimes-moves-itself-on-purpose">Why the kernel sometimes moves itself on purpose</h3>

<p>You may see kASLR mentioned in kernel logs. That stands for Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization. The idea is simple. If attackers do not know where the kernel lives in memory, certain attacks get a lot harder.</p>

<p>Early in boot, if kASLR is enabled, the decompressor chooses two “bases” at random:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a physical base, which is where the bytes will live in RAM</li>
  <li>a virtual base, the starting virtual address the kernel will use once full paging is set up</li>
</ul>

<p>How does it choose without breaking anything</p>

<p>It builds a do not touch list. That includes the decompressor itself, the compressed image, the initial ramdisk, the boot parameters page, and the command line buffer. It can also include ranges you reserve with a <code>memmap=</code> option on the command line.</p>

<p>It scans the memory map from firmware to find large free regions. For each free region it counts how many aligned “slots” of the right size would fit. It draws a random number using the best early entropy source it has. On modern CPUs that might be a hardware random instruction. It reduces the number to the total number of slots and picks the matching slot. That becomes the physical base. The virtual base is chosen the same way, but within the kernel’s virtual address window.</p>

<p>If nothing suitable exists, the code falls back to the default addresses and prints a small warning. If you pass <code>nokaslr</code> on the command line, the randomization step is skipped by design.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="a-quick-glossary-you-can-bookmark">A quick glossary you can bookmark</h2>

<p><strong>Hexadecimal.</strong> Base 16 numbers written with <code>0x</code>. <code>0x10</code> is 16. <code>0x100000</code> is 1 megabyte. Hex maps cleanly to bits, which is why low‑level code uses it.</p>

<p><strong>Register.</strong> A tiny slot inside the CPU that holds a number right now. Examples: CS, DS, SS, IP, SP.</p>

<p><strong>Segment and offset.</strong> The two pieces used to build real‑mode addresses. Physical address equals segment times 16 plus offset.</p>

<p><strong>BIOS.</strong> Older firmware that starts the machine, checks hardware, and loads the first boot sector into memory.</p>

<p><strong>UEFI.</strong> Modern firmware that understands filesystems and loads larger boot programs directly.</p>

<p><strong>Bootloader.</strong> The usher that places the kernel in memory and passes facts about the system to it. GRUB is a common one.</p>

<p><strong>Stack.</strong> A last‑in, first‑out workbench for functions. SS selects its segment. SP points at the current top.</p>

<p><strong>BSS.</strong> A region where global variables that must start as zero live. The kernel setup code clears it before C runs.</p>

<p><strong>Interrupt.</strong> A fast “excuse me” from hardware or software. The CPU pauses, runs a small handler, then resumes. Maskable interrupts can be blocked for a moment. NMI cannot.</p>

<p><strong>GDT.</strong> Global Descriptor Table. Short list of segment descriptors. Linux sets it to a simple flat model.</p>

<p><strong>IDT.</strong> Interrupt Descriptor Table. Directory of interrupt handlers. Early boot uses a minimal one. The full kernel installs the real one later.</p>

<p><strong>A20 line.</strong> Historical switch that must be opened to address above 1 megabyte correctly on old PCs.</p>

<p><strong>Protected mode.</strong> 32‑bit mode that introduces the GDT and IDT and allows paging.</p>

<p><strong>Long mode.</strong> 64‑bit mode on x86_64. Requires paging and a bit named LME set in the EFER register.</p>

<p><strong>Paging.</strong> The translator from virtual addresses to physical memory. Implemented with page tables.</p>

<p><strong>Page tables.</strong> The data structure that maps virtual pages to physical pages. Early boot uses identity maps. Normal pages are 4 KB. Early boot often uses 2 MB pages to cover ground quickly.</p>

<p><strong>CR0, CR3, CR4.</strong> Control registers. CR0 turns on protected mode. CR3 points to the top of the page tables. CR4 enables extended features such as PAE.</p>

<p><strong>EFER.</strong> A model‑specific register that holds Long Mode Enable among other bits.</p>

<p><strong>ELF.</strong> The kernel’s on‑disk format with a built‑in map of what belongs where.</p>

<p><strong>Relocation.</strong> A fix‑up that adjusts addresses when code is loaded at a different base than it was built for.</p>

<p><strong>kASLR.</strong> Randomizes kernel base addresses at boot to make exploitation harder.</p>

<p><strong>D2</strong> is a diagram scripting language that turns text to diagrams. It stands for
<strong>Declarative Diagramming</strong>. Declarative, as in, you describe what you want diagrammed, it
generates the image.</p>
<p>For example, download the CLI, create a file named <code>input.d2</code>, copy paste the following,
run this command, and you get the image below.</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>
      The <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/630727/">previous article</a>
      in this series described the general
      mechanisms that the Linux kernel has for executing programs as a result of a user-space call
      to <tt>execve()</tt>.  However, the particular format handlers described in that article each deferred the
      process of execution to an inner call to <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/exec.c#L1352"><tt>search_binary_handler()</tt></a>.  That
      recursion almost always ends with the invocation of an ELF binary program, which is the subject of this
      article.
    </p>


    <h4>The ELF format</h4>
    <p>
      The ELF (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format">Executable and Linkable Format</a>)
      format is the main binary format in use on modern Linux systems, and support for it is implemented
      in the file <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c"><tt>fs/binfmt_elf.c</tt></a>.  It's also a slightly complicated format
      for the kernel to handle;
      the main <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L571"><tt>load_elf_binary()</tt></a> function spans over 400 lines,
      and the ELF support code is more than four times as big as the
      <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_aout.c">code that supports the old a.out format</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      An ELF file for an executable program (rather than a shared library or an object file) must always contain
      a <a href="http://www.sco.com/developers/gabi/latest/ch5.pheader.html">program header table</a> near the
      start of the file, after the <a href="http://www.sco.com/developers/gabi/latest/ch4.eheader.html">ELF
      header</a>; each entry in this table provides information that is needed to run the program.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kernel only really cares about three types of program header
    entries.  The first type is the <tt>PT_LOAD</tt> segment,
      which describes areas of the new program's running memory.  This
    includes code and data sections that come from the
      executable file, together with the size of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.bss">BSS</a> section.  The BSS will
      be filled with zeroes (thus only its length needs to be stored in the executable file).  The second entry of
      interest is a <tt>PT_INTERP</tt> entry, which identifies the run-time linker needed to assemble the complete
      program; for the time being, we'll assume a statically linked ELF binary and return to dynamic linking later.
      Finally, the kernel also gets a single bit of information from a <tt>PT_GNU_STACK</tt> entry, if present,
      which indicates whether the program's stack should be made executable or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      (This article only focuses on what's needed to load an ELF program, rather than exploring all of the details of
      the format.  The interested reader can find much more information via the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format#References">references</a> linked from
      Wikipedia's ELF article or
      by exploring real binaries with the
      <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/objdump.1.html"><tt>objdump</tt></a> tool.)
    </p>


    <h4>Processing ELF binaries</h4>
    <p>
      Loading an ELF binary is handled by the <tt>load_elf_binary()</tt> function, which starts by examining the ELF
      header to check that the file in question does indeed <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L603">look like a supported ELF format</a>.
      The handler needs the whole of the ELF program header, whether it is
    within the first 128 bytes read into <tt>buf</tt> in
    <tt>linux_binprm</tt> or not,
      so it needs to <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L626">read it</a> into some scratch space.
    </p>
    <p>
      The code now loops over the program header entries, checking for an
    interpreter (<tt>PT_INTERP</tt>) and whether the program's stack should
   be executable (from the <tt>PT_GNU_STACK</tt> entry).  With this
      preparation done, the code needs to initialize those attributes of the new program that are not inherited from the
      old program;
      the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_UNIX_Specification">Single
    UNIX Specification</a> version 3 (SUSv3) <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/exec.html"><tt>exec</tt></a>
      specification describes most of the required behavior
      (and table 28-4 of <a href="http://man7.org/tlpi/index.html"><i>The Linux Programming Interface</i></a>
      gives an excellent summary of the attributes involved).
    </p>
    <p>
      The process of setting up the new program starts with a <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L722">call</a> to
      <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/exec.c#L1054"><tt>flush_old_exec()</tt></a>, which clears up state in the kernel that refers to the
      previous program.  Any <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/exec.c#L892">other threads</a> of the old program are killed so the new program
      starts with a single thread, and the signal-handling information for the process
      is <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/exec.c#L995">unshared</a> so that it can be safely altered later.
      Any pending POSIX timers for the old program are <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/exec.c#L992">cleared</a>, and the location of
      the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/kernel/fork.c#L672">executable file</a> for the program (visible
      at <tt>/proc/<i>pid</i>/exe</tt>) is updated.
      The <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/exec.c#L819">virtual memory mappings</a> for the old program are released, which also
      <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/kernel/fork.c#L655">kills any pending asynchronous I/O operations</a>
      and <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/kernel/fork.c#L654">frees</a> any <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/499190/">uprobes</a>.
      Finally, the <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/personality.2.html">personality</a> of the process
      is <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/exec.c#L1081">updated</a> to remove any features that could affect security, as previously recorded
      in the <tt>per_clear</tt> field in <tt>linux_binprm</tt>.
      The main handler code also <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L728">calls</a> the <tt>SET_PERSONALITY()</tt> macro to
      <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/arch/x86/kernel/process_64.c#L385">set the thread flags appropriately</a> for a new 64-bit
      program.
    </p>
    <p>
      A corresponding <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L735">call</a> to <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/exec.c#L1097"><tt>setup_new_exec()</tt></a> now sets up
      the kernel's internal state for the new program.  This function starts by <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/exec.c#L1104">determining</a>
      whether the new program can generate a core dump (or have <tt>ptrace()</tt> attach to it); this
      is <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/exec.c#L69">disabled by default</a> for setuid or setgid programs. Dumping is
      also <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/exec.c#L1123">disabled</a> when the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/exec.c#L1090">program file isn't readable</a> under the
      current credentials.
      A call to <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/exec.c#L1045"><tt>__set_task_comm()</tt></a> sets the current
      task's <tt>comm</tt> field to the basename of the originally invoked filename; this value is used as
      a thread name, and is accessible to user space via the <tt>PR_GET_NAME</tt> and <tt>PR_SET_NAME</tt>
      <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html"><tt>prctl()</tt></a> operations.  A call
      to <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/kernel/signal.c#L484"><tt>flush_signal_handlers()</tt></a> sets up the signal handlers for the
      new program; any signal handler that's not <tt>SIG_IGN</tt> gets set to the default <tt>SIG_DFL</tt> value (so any
      ignored signals are inherited by the new program).  Finally, a call
      to <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/file.c#L596"><tt>do_close_on_exec()</tt></a> closes all of the old program's file descriptors
      that have the <tt>O_CLOEXEC</tt> flag set; other file descriptors will be inherited by the new program.
    </p>
    <p>
      The virtual memory for the new program also needs to be set up. To improve security (by helping protect against
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_buffer_overflow">stack
overflow attacks</a>), the highest address
      for the stack is typically moved <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L555">downward by a random offset</a>.
      An initial <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L739">call</a>
      to <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/exec.c#L640"><tt>setup_arg_pages()</tt></a> then sets up the kernel's memory tracking
      structures, and <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/exec.c#L671">adjusts</a> for the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/exec.c#L711">new location</a> of the stack.
      The code <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L746">loops</a> through all of the <tt>PT_LOAD</tt> segments in the program file and
      <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L816">maps</a>
    them into the process's address space, setting up the new program's
    memory layout. It then sets up zero-filled pages that
      <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L874">correspond to the program's BSS segment</a>. Also, additional special pages — such as
      the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/615809/">virtual dynamic shared object (vDSO)</a> pages — need to be mapped, which is taken care of by
      a <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L925">call</a>
      to <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/arch/x86/vdso/vma.c#L202"><tt>arch_setup_additional_pages()</tt></a>.
    An empty page may
      also be <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L952">mapped
    at the zero address</a> in the program's address space for
    backward-compatibility reasons (old SVr4
      programs apparently assume that reading from a <tt>NULL</tt> pointer would return zeros rather
      than <tt>SIGSEGV</tt>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, the credentials for the new program are set up via a call
      to <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/exec.c#L1187"><tt>install_exec_creds()</tt></a>.
    This function lets any active Linux Security Module (LSM) know about the
      change in credentials (through the
      <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/include/linux/security.h#L223"><tt>bprm_committing_creds</tt></a> and
      <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/include/linux/security.h#L232"><tt>bprm_committed_creds</tt></a> LSM hooks), and the inner
      <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/kernel/cred.c#L414"><tt>commit_creds()</tt></a> function performs the assignment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final preparation for running the new program is to set up the rest of its stack (in its new randomized
      location), by calling the <tt>create_elf_tables()</tt> function; this is described in a separate section below.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of the preparation has now been done, and the new program can be launched.
      An <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/604287/">earlier article</a> explained how the kernel's <tt>system_call</tt>
      entry point pushes the user-space CPU registers to the kernel stack before entering the main kernel code, and these
      registers are correspondingly restored when the system call completes. The area of the stack that holds the saved
      registers is <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/arch/x86/include/asm/processor.h#L928">cast to</a>
      a <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/arch/x86/include/asm/ptrace.h#L33"><tt>pt_regs</tt></a> structure, and the saved user-space CPU registers can thus be <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/arch/x86/include/asm/elf.h#L171">overwritten with</a>
      suitable values (zeroes) for the start of the new program. The <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L975">call</a> to the
      <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/arch/x86/kernel/process_64.c#L230"><tt>start_thread()</tt></a> function also sets the saved
      instruction pointer to the entry point of the program (or the dynamic linker), and the saved stack pointer to the
      current top of the stack (from the <tt>p</tt> field in <tt>linux_binprm</tt>).  The zero return code from the
      handler indicates success, and the <tt>execve()</tt> syscall returns to user space — but to a completely
      different user space, where the process's memory has been remapped, and the restored registers have values that
      start the execution of the new program.
    </p>


    <h4>Populating the stack: the auxiliary vector, environment and arguments</h4>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L149"><tt>create_elf_tables()</tt></a> function adds more information to the
      new program's stack, below the argument and environment information added by the generic code, as two distinct
      chunks.  An initial <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L176">call</a> to <tt>arch_align_stack()</tt>
      <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/arch/x86/kernel/process.c#L459">rounds down</a> the existing stack position to a 16-byte
      boundary, and may also further randomize the stack position downward slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first collection of information forms the ELF auxiliary vector, a collection of (id, value) pairs that
      describe useful information about the program being run and the environment it is running in, communicated
      from the kernel to user space.   To build this vector, the handler code first needs to push onto the stack
      any information that doesn't fit within a 64-bit value; for x86_64 this is a
      <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L178">platform capability description</a> (the
      string <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/arch/x86/include/asm/elf.h#L237"><tt>"x86_64"</tt></a>) and
      <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L206">16
    bytes of random data</a> (to help seed user-space random number generators).
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, the code <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L233">assembles</a> the (id, value) pairs for the auxiliary
      vector in the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/include/linux/mm_types.h#L387"><tt>saved_auxv</tt></a> space within
      the <tt>mm_struct</tt>.  An <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/519085/">LWN article</a> from Michael Kerrisk describes
      the contents of this vector, so here we just mention a few interesting entries:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The (architecture-specific) first entry in the vector is the <tt>AT_SYSINFO_EHDR</tt> value for x86_64; this indicates
        the location of the vDSO page, as referenced in an <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/604515/#vdso">earlier article</a>.</li>
      <li>The <tt>AT_PLATFORM</tt> value is the location of the <tt>"x86_64"</tt> platform capability description pushed
        earlier.</li>
      <li>The <tt>AT_RANDOM</tt> value is the location of the random data pushed earlier.</li>
      <li>The <tt>AT_EXECFN</tt> value holds the location of the program filename that was pushed as the very first
        thing on the stack (and whose location was stored in the <tt>exec</tt> field of <tt>linux_binprm</tt>), above
        the arguments and environment values.</li>
      <li>The <tt>AT_ENTRY</tt> value holds the entry point for the text segment, i.e. where program execution should
        start.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Once this auxiliary vector is created, the code now assembles the rest of the new program's stack.  The required
      <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L278">space is calculated</a>, and then the entries are inserted from low addresses
      to higher ones:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <tt>argc</tt> argument count is <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L294">inserted</a> first.</li>
      <li>An array of argument pointers is <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L301">inserted</a> next, ending with a
        NULL pointer.  This is where <tt>main()</tt>'s <tt>argv</tt> will eventually point.</li>
      <li>An array of environment pointers is <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L313">inserted</a> next, ending with
        a NULL pointer.  This is
        where <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/environ.7.html"><tt>environ</tt></a> will point.</li>
      <li>The auxiliary vector is <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L326">put at the highest address</a>, just below the
        additional values it references.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Taken together, the top of the new program's address space will have contents like the following example
      (<a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/hh/stack-layout.html">this page</a> has a similar example):

    <p>
      Note that although there are two randomizations in the stack layout (the position of the top of memory and the
      size of the gap between the argument values and the auxiliary
      vector), the newly running program can still figure
      out where all of the information on the stack is.  The SP register tells the program where the top of the stack is
      (i.e. the lowest address), and the command-line arguments are arranged upwards in memory from there, with a NULL
      pointer to mark where they end.  The environment values are found next, again with a NULL pointer to terminate,
      and the auxiliary vector is found at the next consecutive addresses, closing with an <tt>AT_NULL</tt> ID. The
      values found within all of this information give the addresses of the argument strings, environment strings, and
      auxiliary data values, so no explicit information about the size of the random gap is needed.
    </p>


    <h4>Dynamically linked programs</h4>
    <p>
      So far we've assumed the program being executed is statically linked and skipped over steps that would be
      triggered by the presence of a <tt>PT_INTERP</tt> entry in the ELF program header.  However, most programs are
      dynamically linked, meaning that required <a href="http://lurklurk.org/linkers/linkers.html#sharedlibs">shared
      libraries</a> have to be located and linked at run-time.  This is performed by the <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ld.so.8.html">runtime linker</a> (typically
      something
      like <tt>/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2</tt>), and
      the identity of this linker is specified by the <tt>PT_INTERP</tt> program header entry.
    </p>
    <p>
      To cope with a runtime linker, the ELF handler first <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L660">reads the ELF interpreter file name</a>
      into scratch space, then <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L673">opens the executable file</a>
      with <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/exec.c#L786"><tt>open_exec()</tt></a>.  The first 128 bytes of the file are read into
      the <tt>bprm-&gt;buf</tt> scratch area, replacing the contents of the original program file and
      allowing <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L694">access</a> to the ELF header of the interpreter program — which
      <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L711">must</a> therefore be an ELF binary itself, rather than any other format.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the program code has been loaded into memory as described previously,
      the ELF handler also <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L890">loads the ELF interpreter program</a> into memory
      with <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L395"><tt>load_elf_interp()</tt></a>.  This process is similar to the process of loading the
      original program: the code <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L408">checks the format information in the ELF header</a>,
      <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L427">reads in the ELF program header</a>, <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L470">maps</a> all of
      the <tt>PT_LOAD</tt> segments from the file into the new program's memory, and <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L518">leaves room</a>
      for the interpreter's BSS segment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The execution start address for the program is also <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L900">set
    to be the entry point</a> of the
      interpreter, rather than that of the program itself.  When the <tt>execve()</tt> system call completes, execution
      then begins with the ELF interpreter, which takes care of satisfying the linkage requirements of the program from
      user space — finding and loading the shared libraries that the program depends on, and resolving the
      program's undefined symbols to the correct definitions in those libraries.  Once this linkage process is done (which
      relies on a much deeper understanding of the ELF format than the kernel has), the interpreter
      can start the execution of the new program itself,
      <a href="https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=elf/dl-sysdep.c;h=65a90469c6bdd12cba03c5a21a283971db39868d;hb=c758a6861537815c759cba2018a3b1abb1943842#l129">at
      the address previously recorded</a> in the <tt>AT_ENTRY</tt> auxiliary value.
    </p>


    <h4>Compatibility with other architectures</h4>
    <p>
      As <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/604515/#x86_32">described previously</a>, a modern 64-bit (x86_64) Linux
      system can also support running 32-bit binaries of two types: normal 32-bit binaries (x86_32),
      and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI">x32 ABI</a> programs (which can make use of additional
      x86_64 registers).  So how does the kernel support these binaries?
    </p>
    <p>
      The key file that provides support for these formats
      is <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/compat_binfmt_elf.c"><tt>compat_binfmt_elf.c</tt></a>, which is included in the kernel when the
      <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/Kconfig.binfmt#L26"><tt>CONFIG_COMPAT_BINFMT_ELF</tt></a> config option is set.  This file
      didn't appear in our earlier list of places that register binary handlers, because the file contains almost no
      code of its own.  Instead, it <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/compat_binfmt_elf.c#L145">includes</a> the main <tt>binfmt_elf.c</tt> ELF handler
      code (using <tt>#include</tt>), and uses the preprocessor to redirect various internal functions and values to 32-bit compatibility
      versions.  Other than these changes, the format handler therefore behaves the same as the normal ELF handler
      described above.
    </p>
    <p>
      One set of changes <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/compat_binfmt_elf.c#L34">uses 32-bit versions</a> of the structures describing the layout of
      the ELF file;
      similarly, the appropriate <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/compat_binfmt_elf.c#L81">constant values</a> for 32-bit binaries are used, which ensures
      that the compatibility handler only claims support for the relevant ELF binary types.  In particular,
      the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L609"><tt>elf_check_arch()</tt></a> call is <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/compat_binfmt_elf.c#L79">replaced</a> with a
      <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/arch/x86/include/asm/elf.h#L163"><tt>compat_elf_check_arch()</tt></a> version
      that checks for either x86_32 or (if configured) x32.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preprocessor changes also redirect some of the inner functionality of the ELF handler code.
      The <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L728">invocation</a> of the <tt>SET_PERSONALITY()</tt> macro is
      <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/compat_binfmt_elf.c#L116">redirected</a>
      to <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/arch/x86/kernel/process_64.c#L405"><tt>set_personality_ia32()</tt></a>  so that
      the relevant thread flags for the 32-bit architecture are set and,
    similarly, 
      the <tt>arch_setup_additional_pages()</tt> function is <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/compat_binfmt_elf.c#L130">replaced</a> with
      a <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/arch/x86/vdso/vma.c#L211">version</a> that sets up a 32-bit vDSO.
      More significantly, the <tt>start_thread()</tt> function is
      <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/compat_binfmt_elf.c#L121">replaced</a> with <tt>compat_start_thread()</tt>,
      which <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/arch/x86/include/asm/elf.h#L190">maps</a>
      to <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/arch/x86/kernel/process_64.c#L255"><tt>start_thread_ia32()</tt></a>.  This alters
      the arguments to the inner <tt>start_thread_common()</tt> function so that the saved segment registers are
      initialized differently than for x86_64 binaries (and
      the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/arch/x86/include/asm/elf.h#L186"><tt>ELF_PLAT_INIT()</tt></a> macro is also
      <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/compat_binfmt_elf.c#L111">adjusted</a> to <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/arch/x86/include/asm/elf.h#L186">match</a>).
    </p>




    <h4>Epilogue</h4>
    <p>
      Every program that runs on a Linux system passes through the portal of <tt>execve()</tt>; as such it's a key
      piece of kernel functionality that's worth understanding in detail.  Although the kernel natively supports script
      and other machine-code format programs, program execution on a modern Linux system eventually involves running an
      ELF binary.  ELF is a complicated format, but fortunately the kernel can ignore most of that complexity — it
      only needs to understand just enough ELF to load segments into memory, and to invoke a user space run-time linker
      program to finish the job of assembling a complete running program.

<p dir="auto">The goal of <code>oxdraw</code> is to make it easy to create and maintain high-quality diagrams using a declarative and reproducible syntax.
Charts are written in <a href="https://mermaid.js.org/" rel="nofollow">Mermaid</a> syntax, while a web interface allows users to fine-tune positions connector paths, colors, and other styling components. Whenever a diagram is tweaked visually, the structural changes are persisted back to the source file as declarative code so that everything remains deterministic and versionable.
The changes are saved as comments in the mermaid file so it remains compatible with other Mermaid tools.
The repo is composed of the Rust CLI to compile <code>.mmd</code> files into images and the React based web interface to editing the files.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Vision</h2><a id="user-content-vision" aria-label="Permalink: Vision" href="#vision"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The reason I started this project was I used Mermaid a lot in the past when making architecture diagrams or trying to understand large codebases through having AI tools generate .mmd files to visualize them. However what typically happened was since these diagrams couldn't be edited minutely for example cleaning up joints and chart organization, I would have to move over the diagrams I started to things like Lucidchart. So the big picture goal of this project is to unite the benefits of code generated diagramming like Mermaid with the customizability of diagram software like Lucidchart.</p>

<p dir="auto">The path drawing algorithm is fun because there is a lot of ambiguity with what optimal behavior could be.
Some prefer smooth lines because there is less total line but I prefer strong edges to make the diagram a bit more clear.
Some prefer no overlapping lines but I sometimes prefer an overlap rather than letting the lines get super long and string out of the diagram very far.
This is an example of using the delete key to remove one relationship and then using the arrow keys to move around one the nodes and seeing how the algorithm recomputes the positioning.
There's definitely some improvements to be made to this algorithm so I imagine this will keep getting better :)</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nike is unveiling Project Amplify: the world’s first powered footwear system for running and walking, designed to help everyday athletes go a little bit faster and farther — all with less effort.</p><p>Engineered to augment natural lower leg and ankle movement, the Project Amplify system breaks the perception of possibility by providing an unparalleled boost to anyone who wants to move, creating a new future for running, jogging and walking.&nbsp;</p><p>Built on motion algorithms informed by the <a href="https://about.nike.com/en/stories/nike-spaces-sports-design-innovation-performance" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nike Sport Research Lab</a>, the first-generation footwear system is comprised of a lightweight, powerful motor; drive belt; and rechargeable cuff battery that seamlessly integrate with a carbon fiber–plated running shoe that can be worn with or without the robotics system.</p><p>This makes it easier for everyday athletes to walk or run more often, for longer amounts of time, while having more fun — adding movement to their lives, extending their walking commute, or helping them to enjoy the run for another mile or two.&nbsp;</p><p>Each application reflects Nike’s unmatched commitment to solving problems for athletes, improving their experience and powering the future of sport. What’s more: Project Amplify represents one of <a href="https://about.nike.com/en/newsroom/releases/nike-new-innovation-engine-announcement" rel="noopener noreferrer">four major technological advances</a> Nike is unveiling this month, joining innovations across <a href="https://about.nike.com/en/newsroom/releases/nike-therma-fit-air-milano-jacket-official-images" rel="noopener noreferrer">Air apparel</a>, <a href="https://about.nike.com/en/newsroom/releases/nike-aero-fit-official-images" rel="noopener noreferrer">advanced cooling</a>, and <a href="https://about.nike.com/en/newsroom/releases/nike-mind-001-mind-002-official-images" rel="noopener noreferrer">mind science</a> in demonstrating the depth, breadth and impact of the brand’s commitment to athlete-centered innovation.&nbsp;</p><p>“Our job is to dream big while keeping athletes at the center,” says Michael Donaghu, VP of Create The Future, Emerging Sport and Innovation. “Project Amplify started with a single question: What if we could find a way to help athletes move faster and farther with less energy and a lot more fun? At its core, Project Amplify is about seamlessly adding a little more power to your stride. The fun comes from realizing you can do more than you thought you could — whatever ‘more’ means to you.”</p><p>Akin to how electric bikes have made it easier to ride farther and more frequently, revolutionizing urban commuting, Nike is developing Project Amplify to make slower running, jogging and walking easier and more fun, with a focus on athletes running between a 10- and 12-minute mile pace.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The first-generation product, created alongside robotics partner <a href="https://www.dephy.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dephy</a>, isn’t designed for competitive, faster runners trying to shave seconds off their time; rather, it’s intended to serve athletes who want to go faster and farther with less effort by giving them more power for everyday movement —&nbsp;in effect, a second set of calf muscles.</p><p>That approach is backed by insights developed from NSRL testing involving athletes of all abilities and intensities, who have shared that the system feels like it’s part of their body and that it makes walking or running uphill feel like moving on flat ground. For some, wearing Project Amplify helps them go from a 12-minute mile to a 10-minute mile.</p><p>These learnings are the product of extensive testing over several years, both in outdoor environments and the NSRL. More than 400 athletes have covered over 2.4 million steps, the equivalent of roughly 12,000 laps around the NSRL’s 200-meter track, in more than nine different versions of the hardware — each iteration focused on refining a different element of the system.&nbsp;</p><p>“Is this new for Nike? Yes and no,” says Donaghu. “It’s obviously a new innovation, but the day&nbsp;<a href="https://about.nike.com/en/magazine/bill-bowerman-nike-s-original-innovator" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill Bowerman</a>&nbsp;poured rubber into&nbsp;<a href="https://about.nike.com/en/magazine/nike-moon-shoe-waffle-iron-true-history" rel="noopener noreferrer">the family waffle iron</a>&nbsp;was the start of a journey to augment movement and create the future of sport. We’ve always believed movement is medicine, and Project Amplify is the next chapter in that story. It’s a bold leap forward, crossing a new threshold of putting power directly into your stride.”</p><p><strong>﻿</strong>With Project Amplify still in the testing stage, Nike is blending art and science to reach performance readiness and bring the footwear system to a broad consumer launch in the coming years.&nbsp;</p><p><em>* If you have a body, you are an athlete.</em><br></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-element="story-body" data-subscriber-content=""> <p>For decades, rolling blackouts and urgent calls for energy conservation were part of life in California — a reluctant summer ritual almost as reliable as the heat waves that drove them. But the state has undergone a quiet shift in recent years, and the California Independent System Operator hasn’t issued a single one of those emergency pleas, known as Flex Alerts, since 2022.</p><p>Experts and officials say the Golden State has reached a turning point, reflecting years of investment in making its electrical grid stronger, cleaner and more dependable. Much of that is new battery energy storage, which captures and stores electricity for later use. </p><p>In fact, batteries have been transformative for California, state officials say. In late afternoon, when the sun stops hitting solar panels and people are home using electricity, batteries now push stored solar energy onto the grid. </p><p>California has invested heavily in the technology, helping it mature and get cheaper in recent years. Battery storage in the state has grown more than  3,000% in six years — from 500 megawatts in 2020 to more than 15,700 megawatts today.</p><p>“There is no question that the battery fleet that has grown rapidly since 2020, along with the state’s expanding portfolio of other supply and demand-side resources, has been a real game changer for reliability during summer periods of peak demand,” said Elliot Mainzer, CAISO’s president and chief executive.</p><p>It was only five years ago that a record-shattering heat wave pushed the grid to its limit and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-08-15/worst-heat-wave-in-years-causes-rolling-blackouts-dangerous-conditions-across-california">plunged much of the state into darkness.</a> In the wake of that event, California’s energy leaders <a href="https://www.caiso.com/Documents/Final-Root-Cause-Analysis-Mid-August-2020-Extreme-Heat-Wave.pdf" target="_blank">vowed to take action</a> to make the grid more resilient.</p><p>Since then, CAISO has overseen a massive build-out of new energy and storage resources, including more than 26,000 megawatts of new capacity overall, which has also helped make the grid more stable, Mainzer said. The state hasn’t seen rolling blackouts since 2020.</p><p>“Extreme weather events, wildfires and other emergencies can pose reliability challenges for any bulk electric system,” he said. “But the CAISO battery fleet, along with the additional capacity and close coordination with state and regional partners, have provided an indisputable benefit to reliability.” </p><p>Batteries are now key to California’s climate goals, including its mandate of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2022-11-16/carlifornia-unveils-plan-to-reach-carbon-neutrailty-by-2045">100% carbon neutrality by 2045</a>. </p><div data-click="enhancement" data-align-center-expanded=""><figure> <picture>    <source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ab445bf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x2400+0+0/resize/320x213!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F60%2F46%2Fe7815bd24596b27f02aecb479118%2F1484362-me-dwp-solar-battery-storage-plant-15-brv.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/660f63d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x2400+0+0/resize/568x379!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F60%2F46%2Fe7815bd24596b27f02aecb479118%2F1484362-me-dwp-solar-battery-storage-plant-15-brv.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5fc0252/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x2400+0+0/resize/768x512!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F60%2F46%2Fe7815bd24596b27f02aecb479118%2F1484362-me-dwp-solar-battery-storage-plant-15-brv.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/49e65a8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x2400+0+0/resize/1080x720!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F60%2F46%2Fe7815bd24596b27f02aecb479118%2F1484362-me-dwp-solar-battery-storage-plant-15-brv.jpg 1080w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fe1e076/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x2400+0+0/resize/1240x826!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F60%2F46%2Fe7815bd24596b27f02aecb479118%2F1484362-me-dwp-solar-battery-storage-plant-15-brv.jpg 1240w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f8baf74/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x2400+0+0/resize/1440x960!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F60%2F46%2Fe7815bd24596b27f02aecb479118%2F1484362-me-dwp-solar-battery-storage-plant-15-brv.jpg 1440w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0bbf4f1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x2400+0+0/resize/2160x1440!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F60%2F46%2Fe7815bd24596b27f02aecb479118%2F1484362-me-dwp-solar-battery-storage-plant-15-brv.jpg 2160w" sizes="100vw">       <img alt="The LADWP's biggest solar and battery storage plant, the Eland Solar and Storage Center in the Mojave Desert.

Now they’re becoming a more cost-effective and reliable replacement for aging gas-fired power plants, according to Maia Leroy, founder of the California energy consulting firm Lumenergy LLC and co-author of a <a href="https://ceert.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Gas-vs-BESS-Report.pdf" target="_blank">recent report</a> on the rise of battery storage over gas generation in California. </p><p>“Historically, Flex Alerts have always come through in summertime when it’s super hot and everyone is cranking their AC,” Leroy said. “But also in the summertime, we’re seeing that gas plants underperform because combustion doesn’t work well with ambient heat. So when we’re able to shift that need from having to use gas plants to something more stable, dispatchable and flexible like battery storage, then we’re able to meet that demand in the summer without having to rely on those underperforming gas plants.” </p><p>Battery energy storage is not without challenges, however. Lithium-ion batteries — the most common type used for energy storage — typically have about  four to six hours of capacity. It’s enough to support the grid during peak hours as the sun sets, but can still leave some gaps to be filled by natural gas.</p><p>Nikhil Kumar, program director with the energy policy nonprofit GridLab, said the technology already exists for longer-duration batteries, including through different chemistries such as iron-air batteries, which release energy through oxidation, and flow batteries, which store energy in liquid chemicals that flow through a reactor.</p><p>Those batteries are not yet as mature and can be more expensive and larger than their lithium-ion counterparts, Kumar said. But a <a href="https://gridlab.org/portfolio-item/gas-tubine-cost-report/" target="_blank">recent GridLab report</a> indicates that equation is changing, with the average cost of a new gas plant often on par with  four-hour lithium-ion batteries and only slightly less expensive than longer-duration battery technologies. </p><p>“Batteries are going to get cheaper,” Kumar said. “Gas isn’t.” </p><p>The battery storage shift is occurring as the Trump administration takes steps to stifle solar and other forms of renewable energy in favor of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal. At the end of September, the administration announced that it would <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-09-29/trump-administration-coal-mining-land-coal-fired-power-plants"><u>open 13 million acres of federal lands for coal mining</u></a> and provide $625 million to recommission or modernize coal-fired powered plants, which officials said would help strengthen the economy, protect jobs and advance American energy.</p><p>During an hourlong  news conference on the initiative, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum described wind and solar energy as intermittent sources that are “literally dependent on the weather” — but neither he nor any other official mentioned the growth of battery storage that has made those sources more reliable and more promising. </p><p>It’s not a partisan issue. ERCOT, which operates Texas’ electrical grid, has <a href="https://www.ercot.com/files/docs/2025/08/06/ERCOT-Monthly-July-2025.pdf" target="_blank">more than 14,000 megawatts</a> of batteries online, a nearly threefold increase from early 2023. California and Texas are constantly trading places as the top state for battery storage. </p><div data-click="enhancement" data-align-center-expanded=""><figure> <picture>    <source type="image/webp"

made in China, and Trump’s tariffs — including a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-10-10/trump-threatens-tech-export-limits-new-100-tariff-on-chinese-imports-starting-nov-1-or-sooner">proposed 100% tariff on China</a> — have been good for at least one Sacramento-based battery manufacturer, Sparkz.</p><p>“The administration wants critical material manufacturing to happen in the U.S.,” said Sanjiv Malhotra, founder and chief executive. “They basically are very much in favor of domestic manufacturing of batteries.”</p><p>Sparkz is making lithium-iron batteries that don’t use nickel and cobalt — a composition that has long been an industry darling but that depends on imported metals. Instead, their lithium-iron-phosphate batteries have a supply chain that is entirely based in the U.S., which means they can take advantage of federal tax credits that favor the production of clean energy components made mostly of domestic parts, Malhotra said. The company’s clients include data centers and utilities. </p><p>Malhotra added that California has done an excellent job “beefing up” the grid’s storage capacity in the last few years. He said batteries are a major reason why the state hasn’t seen a Flex Alert since 2022.</p><p>“The numbers basically tell the story that it was all because of, essentially, energy storage,” he said.</p><p>There is still work to do. While the state’s grid has seen improvements, it is more than a century old and was built primarily for gas plants. Experts and officials agree that it needs additional substantial upgrades and reforms to meet current energy demands and goals. </p><p>Permitting is also a hurdle, as California typically requires lengthy environmental review for new projects. The state, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-08-25/battery-solar-project-darden-fresno-county-community-impacts">sometimes controversially,</a> is now speeding review, and recently approved a massive solar and battery storage farm, the Darden Clean Energy Project in Fresno County, through a new fast-track permitting program. It will make enough electricity to power 850,000 homes for four hours, according to the California Energy Commission. </p><p>Safety remains a considerable concern. In January, a fire tore through one of the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-26/horrifying-fire-at-california-battery-plant-sparks-call-for-new-clean-energy-rules">world’s largest battery storage facilities</a> in Moss Landing, Monterey County. The facility housed around 100,000 lithium-ion batteries, which are exceptionally dangerous when ignited because they burn extremely hot and cannot be extinguished with water, which can trigger a violent chemical reaction.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content--body"><div> <p>When Kenneth Wehr started managing the Greenlandic-language version of Wikipedia four years ago, his first act was to delete almost everything. It had to go, he thought, if it had any chance of surviving.</p>  <p>Wehr, who’s 26, isn’t from Greenland—he grew up in Germany—but he had become obsessed with the island, an autonomous Danish territory, after visiting as a teenager. He’d spent years writing obscure Wikipedia articles in his native tongue on virtually everything to do with it. He even ended up moving to Copenhagen to study Greenlandic, a language spoken by some 57,000 mostly Indigenous Inuit people scattered across dozens of far-flung Arctic villages.&nbsp;</p> </div><div> <p>The Greenlandic-language edition was added to Wikipedia around 2003, just a few years after the site launched in English. By the time Wehr took its helm nearly 20 years later, hundreds of Wikipedians had contributed to it and had collectively written some 1,500 articles totaling over tens of thousands of words. It seemed to be an impressive vindication of the crowdsourcing approach that has made Wikipedia the go-to source for information online, demonstrating that it could work even in the unlikeliest places.&nbsp;</p>    <p>There was only one problem: The Greenlandic Wikipedia was a mirage.&nbsp;</p> </div><div> <p>Virtually every single article had been published by people who did not actually speak the language. Wehr, who now teaches Greenlandic in Denmark, speculates that perhaps only one or two Greenlanders had ever contributed. But what worried him most was something else: Over time, he had noticed that a growing number of articles appeared to be copy-pasted into Wikipedia by people using machine translators. They were riddled with elementary mistakes—from grammatical blunders to meaningless words to more significant inaccuracies, like an entry that claimed Canada had only 41 inhabitants. Other pages sometimes contained random strings of letters spat out by machines that were unable to find suitable Greenlandic words to express themselves.&nbsp;</p>  <p>“It might have looked Greenlandic to [the authors], but they had no way of knowing,” complains Wehr. </p> 
 <p>“Sentences wouldn’t make sense at all, or they would have obvious errors,” he adds. “AI translators are really bad at Greenlandic.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>What Wehr describes is not unique to the Greenlandic edition.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>Wikipedia is the most ambitious multilingual project after the Bible: There are editions in over 340 languages, and a further 400 even more obscure ones are being developed and tested. Many of these smaller editions have been swamped with automatically translated content as AI has become increasingly accessible. Volunteers working on four African languages, for instance, estimated to <em>MIT Technology Review </em>that between 40% and 60% of articles in their Wikipedia editions were uncorrected machine translations. And after auditing the Wikipedia edition in Inuktitut, an Indigenous language close to Greenlandic that’s spoken in Canada, <em>MIT Technology Review </em>estimates that more than two-thirds of pages containing more than several sentences feature portions created this way.&nbsp;</p>  <p>This is beginning to cause a <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/06/26/1093692/book-review-technological-complexity-problems/">wicked problem</a>. AI systems, from Google Translate to ChatGPT, learn to “speak” new languages by scraping huge quantities of text from the internet. Wikipedia is sometimes the largest source of online linguistic data for languages with few speakers—so any errors on those pages, grammatical or otherwise, can poison the wells that AI is expected to draw from. That can make the models’ translation of these languages particularly error-prone, which creates a sort of linguistic doom loop as people continue to add more and more poorly translated Wikipedia pages using those tools, and AI models continue to train from poorly translated pages. It’s a complicated problem, but it boils down to a simple concept: <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/10/15/1105533/a-data-bottleneck-is-holding-ai-science-back-says-new-nobel-winner/">Garbage in, garbage out</a>.&nbsp;</p>  <p>“These models are built on raw data,” says Kevin Scannell, a former professor of computer science at Saint Louis University who now builds computer software tailored for endangered languages. “They will try and learn everything about a language from scratch. There is no other input. There are no grammar books. There are no dictionaries. There is nothing other than the text that is inputted.”</p>  <p>There isn’t perfect data on the scale of this problem, particularly because a lot of AI training data is kept confidential and the field continues to evolve rapidly. But back in 2020, Wikipedia was <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2020.lrec-1.325.pdf">estimated</a> to make up more than half the training data that was fed into AI models translating some languages spoken by millions across Africa, including Malagasy, Yoruba, and Shona. In 2022, a research team from Germany that looked into what data could be obtained by online scraping <a href="https://aclanthology.org/anthology-files/anthology-files/pdf/dclrl/2022.dclrl-1.5.pdf">even found</a> that Wikipedia was the sole easily accessible source of online linguistic data for 27 under-resourced languages.&nbsp;</p> </div><div> <p>This could have significant repercussions in cases where Wikipedia is poorly written—potentially pushing the most vulnerable languages on Earth toward the precipice as future generations begin to turn away from them.&nbsp;</p>  <p>“Wikipedia will be reflected in the AI models for these languages,” says Trond Trosterud, a computational linguist at the University of Tromsø in Norway, who has been raising the alarm about the potentially harmful outcomes of badly run Wikipedia editions for years. “I find it hard to imagine it will not have consequences. And, of course, the more dominant position that Wikipedia has, the worse it will be.”&nbsp;</p>  <h3>Use responsibly</h3>  <p>Automation has been built into Wikipedia since the very earliest days. Bots keep the platform operational: They repair broken links, fix bad formatting, and even correct spelling mistakes. These repetitive and mundane tasks can be automated away with little problem. There is even an army of bots that scurry around generating short articles about rivers, cities, or animals by slotting their names into formulaic phrases. They have generally made the platform better.&nbsp;</p>  <div> <p>But AI is different. Anybody can use it to cause massive damage with a few clicks.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Wikipedia has managed the onset of the AI era better than many other websites. It has not been flooded with AI bots or disinformation, as social media has been. It largely retains the innocence that characterized the earlier internet age. Wikipedia is open and free for anyone to use, edit, and pull from, and it’s run by the very same community it serves. It is transparent and easy to use. But community-run platforms live and die on the size of their communities. English has triumphed, while Greenlandic has sunk.&nbsp;</p> </div>  <p>“We need good Wikipedians. This is something that people take for granted. It is not magic,” says Amir Aharoni, a member of the volunteer Language Committee, which oversees requests to open or close Wikipedia editions. “If you use machine translation responsibly, it can be efficient and useful. Unfortunately, you cannot trust all people to use it responsibly.”&nbsp;</p> 

 <p>Trosterud has studied the behavior of users on small Wikipedia editions and says AI has empowered a subset that he terms “Wikipedia hijackers.” These users can range widely—from naive teenagers creating pages about their hometowns or their favorite YouTubers to well-meaning Wikipedians who think that by creating articles in minority languages they are in some way “helping” those communities.&nbsp;</p>  <p>“The problem with them nowadays is that they are armed with Google Translate,” Trosterud says, adding that this is allowing them to produce much longer and more plausible-looking content than they ever could before: “Earlier they were armed only with dictionaries.”&nbsp;</p>  <p>This has effectively industrialized the acts of destruction—which affect vulnerable languages most, since AI translations are typically far less reliable for them. There can be lots of different reasons for this, but a meaningful part of the issue is the relatively small amount of source text that is available online. And sometimes models struggle to identify a language because it is similar to others, or because some, including Greenlandic and most Native American languages, have structures that make them badly suited to the way most machine translation systems work. (Wehr notes that in Greenlandic most words are agglutinative, meaning they are built by attaching prefixes and suffixes to stems. As a result, many words are extremely context specific and can express ideas that in other languages would take a full sentence.)&nbsp;</p>  <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03983">Research produced</a> by Google before a major expansion of Google Translate rolled out three years ago found that translation systems for lower-resourced languages were generally of a lower quality than those for better-resourced ones. Researchers found, for example, that their model would often mistranslate basic nouns across languages, including the names of animals and colors. (In a statement to <em>MIT</em> <em>Technology Review</em>, Google wrote that it is “committed to meeting a high standard of quality for all 249 languages” it supports “by rigorously testing and improving [its] systems, particularly for languages that may have limited public text resources on the web.”)&nbsp;</p> </div><div> <p>Wikipedia itself offers a built-in editing tool called Content Translate, which allows users to automatically translate articles from one language to another—the idea being that this will save time by preserving the references and fiddly formatting of the originals. But it piggybacks on external machine translation systems, so it’s largely plagued by the same weaknesses as other machine translators—a problem that the Wikimedia Foundation says is hard to solve. It’s up to each edition’s community to decide whether this tool is allowed, and some have decided against it. (Notably, English-language Wikipedia has largely banned its use, claiming that some 95% of articles created using Content Translate failed to meet an acceptable standard without significant additional work.) But it’s at least easy to tell when the program has been used; Content Translate adds a tag on the Wikipedia back end.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Other AI programs can be harder to monitor. Still, many Wikipedia editors I spoke with said that once their languages were added to major online translation tools, they noticed a corresponding spike in the frequency with which poor, likely machine-translated pages were created.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Some Wikipedians using AI to translate content do occasionally admit that they do not speak the target languages. They may see themselves as providing smaller communities with rough-cut articles that speakers can then fix—essentially following the same model that has worked well for more active Wikipedia editions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <blockquote> <h2><strong>Google Translate, for instance, says the Fulfulde word for January means June, while ChatGPT says it’s August or September. The programs also suggest the Fulfulde word for “harvest” means “fever” or “well-being,” among other possibilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2> </blockquote>  <p>But once error-filled pages are produced in small languages, there is usually not an army of knowledgeable people who speak those languages standing ready to improve them. There are few readers of these editions, and sometimes not a single regular editor.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>Yuet Man Lee, a Canadian teacher in his 20s, says that he used a mix of Google Translate and ChatGPT to translate a handful of articles that he had written for the English Wikipedia into Inuktitut, thinking it’d be nice to pitch in and help a smaller Wikipedia community. He says he added a note to one saying that it was only a rough translation. “I did not think that anybody would notice [the article],” he explains. “If you put something out there on the smaller Wikipedias—most of the time nobody does.”&nbsp;</p>  <p>But at the same time, he says, he still thought “someone might see it and fix it up”—adding that he had wondered whether the Inuktitut translation that the AI systems generated was grammatically correct. Nobody has touched the article since he created it.</p> 
 <p>Lee, who teaches social sciences in Vancouver and first started editing entries in the English Wikipedia a decade ago, says that users familiar with more active Wikipedias can fall victim to this mindset, which he terms a “bigger-Wikipedia arrogance”: When they try to contribute to smaller Wikipedia editions, they assume that others will come along to fix their mistakes. It can sometimes work. Lee says he had previously contributed several articles to Wikipedia in Tatar, a language spoken by several million people mainly in Russia, and at least one of those was eventually corrected. But the Inuktitut Wikipedia is, by comparison, a “barren wasteland.”&nbsp;</p>  <p>He emphasizes that his intentions had been good: He wanted to add more articles to an Indigenous Canadian Wikipedia. “I am now thinking that it may have been a bad idea. I did not consider that I could be contributing to a recursive loop,” he says. “It was about trying to get content out there, out of curiosity and for fun, without properly thinking about the consequences.”&nbsp;</p> </div><div> <h3>&nbsp;“Totally, completely no future”</h3>  <p>Wikipedia is a project that is driven by wide-eyed optimism. Editing can be a thankless task, involving weeks spent bickering with faceless, pseudonymous people, but devotees put in hours of unpaid labor because of a commitment to a higher cause. It is this commitment that drives many of the regular small-language editors I spoke with. They all feared what would happen if garbage continued to appear on their pages.</p>  <p>Abdulkadir Abdulkadir, a 26-year-old agricultural planner who spoke with me over a crackling phone call from a busy roadside in northern Nigeria, said that he spends three hours every day fiddling with entries in his native Fulfulde, a language used mainly by pastoralists and farmers across the Sahel. “But the work is too much,” he said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Abdulkadir sees an urgent need for the Fulfulde Wikipedia to work properly. He has been suggesting it as one of the few online resources for farmers in remote villages, potentially offering information on which seeds or crops might work best for their fields in a language they can understand. If you give them a machine-translated article, Abdulkadir told me, then it could “easily harm them,” as the information will probably not be translated correctly into Fulfulde.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Google Translate, for instance, says the Fulfulde word for January means June, while ChatGPT says it’s August or September. The programs also suggest the Fulfulde word for “harvest” means “fever” or “well-being,” among other possibilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>Abdulkadir said he had recently been forced to correct an article about cowpeas, a foundational cash crop across much of Africa, after discovering that it was largely illegible.&nbsp;</p>  <p>If someone wants to create pages on the Fulfulde Wikipedia, Abdulkadir said, they should be translated manually. Otherwise, “whoever will read your articles will [not] be able to get even basic knowledge,” he tells these Wikipedians. Nevertheless, he estimates that some 60% of articles are still uncorrected machine translations. Abdulkadir told me that unless something important changes with how AI systems learn and are deployed, then the outlook for Fulfulde looks bleak. “It is going to be terrible, honestly,” he said. “Totally, completely no future.”&nbsp;</p>  <p>Across the country from Abdulkadir, Lucy Iwuala contributes to Wikipedia in Igbo, a language spoken by several million people in southeastern Nigeria. “The harm has already been done,” she told me, opening the two most recently created articles. Both had been automatically translated via Wikipedia’s Content Translate and contained so many mistakes that she said it would have given her a headache to continue reading them. “There are some terms that have not even been translated. They are still in English,” she pointed out. She recognized the username that had created the pages as a serial offender. “This one even includes letters that are not used in the Igbo language,” she said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Iwuala began regularly contributing to Wikipedia three years ago out of concern that Igbo was being displaced by English. It is a worry that is common to many who are active on smaller Wikipedia editions. “This is my culture. This is who I am,” she told me. “That is the essence of it all: to ensure that you are not erased.”&nbsp;</p> 
</div><div> <p>Iwuala, who now works as a professional translator between English and Igbo, said the users doing the most damage are inexperienced and see AI translations as a way to quickly increase the profile of the Igbo Wikipedia. She often finds herself having to explain at online edit-a-thons she organizes, or over email to various error-prone editors, that the results can be the exact opposite, pushing users away: “You will be discouraged and you will no longer want to visit this place. You will just abandon it and go back to the English Wikipedia.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>These fears are echoed by Noah Ha‘alilio Solomon, an assistant professor of Hawaiian language at the University of Hawai‘i. He reports that some 35% of words on some pages in the Hawaiian Wikipedia are incomprehensible. “If this is the Hawaiian that is going to exist online, then it will do more harm than anything else,” he says.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Hawaiian, which was teetering on the verge of extinction several decades ago, has been undergoing a recovery effort led by Indigenous activists and academics. Seeing such poor Hawaiian on such a widely used platform as Wikipedia is upsetting to Ha‘alilio Solomon.&nbsp;</p>  <p>“It is painful, because it reminds us of all the times that our culture and language has been appropriated,” he says. “We have been fighting tooth and nail in an uphill climb for language revitalization. There is nothing easy about that, and this can add extra impediments. People are going to think that this is an accurate representation of the Hawaiian language.”&nbsp;</p>  <p>The consequences of all these Wikipedia errors can quickly become clear. AI translators that have undoubtedly ingested these pages in their training data are now assisting in the production, for instance, of error-strewn AI-generated books aimed at learners of languages as diverse as Inuktitut <a href="https://www.aptnnews.ca/national-news/amazon-removes-questionable-plains-cree-language-book-after-being-contacted-by-aptn-news/">and Cree</a>, <a href="https://www.montrealgazette.com/news/article562709.html">Indigenous</a> languages spoken in Canada, and Manx, a small Celtic language spoken on the Isle of Man. Many of these have been popping up for sale on Amazon. “It was just complete nonsense,” says Richard Compton, a linguist at the University of Quebec in Montreal, of a volume he reviewed that had purported to be an introductory phrasebook for Inuktitut.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Rather than making minority languages more accessible, AI is now creating an ever expanding minefield for students and speakers of those languages to navigate. “It is a slap in the face,” Compton says. He worries that younger generations in Canada, hoping to learn languages in communities that have fought uphill battles against discrimination to pass on their heritage, might turn to online tools such as ChatGPT or phrasebooks on Amazon and simply make matters worse. “It is fraud,” he says.</p>  <h3>A race against time</h3>  <p>According to UNESCO, a language is declared extinct every two weeks. But whether the Wikimedia Foundation, which runs Wikipedia, has an obligation to the languages used on its platform is an open question. When I spoke to Runa Bhattacharjee, a senior director at the foundation, she said that it was up to the individual communities to make decisions about what content they wanted to exist on their Wikipedia. “Ultimately, the responsibility really lies with the community to see that there is no vandalism or unwanted activity, whether through machine translation or other means,” she said. Usually, Bhattacharjee added, editions were considered for closure only if a specific complaint was raised about them.&nbsp;</p>  <p>But if there is no active community, how can an edition be fixed or even have a complaint raised?&nbsp;</p> </div><div> <p>Bhattacharjee explained that the Wikimedia Foundation sees its role in such cases as about maintaining the Wikipedia platform in case someone comes along to revive it: “It is the space that we provide for them to grow and develop. That is where we are at.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>Inari Saami, spoken in a single remote community in northern Finland, is a poster child for how people can take good advantage of Wikipedia. The language was headed toward extinction four decades ago; there were only four children who spoke it. Their parents created the Inari Saami Language Association in a last-ditch bid to keep it going. The efforts worked. There are now several hundred speakers, schools that use Inari Saami as a medium of instruction, and 6,400 Wikipedia articles in the language, each one copy-edited by a fluent speaker.&nbsp;</p>  <p>This success highlights how Wikipedia can indeed provide small and determined communities with a unique vehicle to promote their languages’ preservation. “We don’t care about quantity. We care about quality,” says Fabrizio Brecciaroli, a member of the Inari Saami Language Association. “We are planning to use Wikipedia as a repository for the written language. We need to provide tools that can be used by the younger generations. It is important for them to be able to use Inari Saami digitally.”&nbsp;</p> </div><div> <p>This has been such a success that Wikipedia has been integrated into the curriculum at the Inari Saami–speaking schools, Brecciaroli adds. He fields phone calls from teachers asking him to write up simple pages on topics from tornadoes to Saami folklore. Wikipedia has even offered a way to introduce words into Inari Saami. “We have to make up new words all the time,” Brecciaroli says. “Young people need them to speak about sports, politics, and video games. If they are unsure how to say something, they now check Wikipedia.”</p>  <p>Wikipedia is a monumental intellectual experiment. What’s happening with Inari Saami suggests that with maximum care, it can work in smaller languages. “The ultimate goal is to make sure that Inari Saami survives,” Brecciaroli says. “It might be a good thing that there isn’t a Google Translate in Inari Saami.”&nbsp;</p>  <p>That may be true—though large language models like ChatGPT can be made to translate phrases into languages that more traditional machine translation tools do not offer. Brecciaroli told me that ChatGPT isn’t great in Inari Saami but that the quality varies significantly depending on what you ask it to do; if you ask it a question in the language, then the answer will be filled with words from Finnish and even words it invents. But if you ask it something in English, Finnish, or Italian and then ask it to reply in Inari Saami, it will perform better.&nbsp;</p>  <p>In light of all this, creating as much high-quality content online as can possibly be written becomes a race against time. “ChatGPT only needs a lot of words,” Brecciaroli says. “If we keep putting good material in, then sooner or later, we will get something out. That is the hope.” This is an idea supported by multiple linguists I spoke with—that it may be possible to end the “garbage in, garbage out” cycle. (OpenAI, which operates ChatGPT, did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>  <p>Still, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/07/24/1095263/ai-that-feeds-on-a-diet-of-ai-garbage-ends-up-spitting-out-nonsense/">the overall problem is likely to grow and grow</a>, since many languages are not as lucky as Inari Saami—and their AI translators will most likely be trained on more and more AI slop. Wehr, unfortunately, seems far less optimistic about the future of his beloved Greenlandic.&nbsp;</p> </div><div><p>Since deleting much of the Greenlandic-language Wikipedia, he has spent years trying to recruit speakers to help him revive it. He has appeared in Greenlandic media and made social media appeals. But he hasn’t gotten much of a response; he says it has been demoralizing.&nbsp;</p>  <p>“There is nobody in Greenland who is interested in this, or who wants to contribute,” he says. “There is completely no point in it, and that is why it should be closed.”&nbsp;</p>  <p>Late last year, he began a process requesting that the Wikipedia Language Committee shut down the Greenlandic-language edition. Months of bitter debate followed between dozens of Wikipedia bureaucrats; some seemed to be surprised that a superficially healthy-seeming edition could be gripped by so many problems.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Then, earlier this month, Wehr’s proposal was accepted: Greenlandic Wikipedia is set to be shuttered, and any articles that remain will be moved into the Wikipedia Incubator, where new language editions are tested and built. Among the reasons cited by the Language Committee is the use of AI tools, which have “frequently produced nonsense that could misrepresent the language.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>Nevertheless, it may be too late—mistakes in Greenlandic already seem to have become embedded in machine translators. If you prompt either Google Translate or ChatGPT to do something as simple as count to 10 in proper Greenlandic, neither program can deliver.&nbsp;</p>  <p><em>Jacob Judah is an investigative journalist based in London.&nbsp;</em> </p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A while back, I worked on a <a href="https://github.com/AmitPr/RISCuit" rel="nofollow">RISC-V-based userspace simulator</a> for fun. In doing so, taught myself a lot more than I wanted to know about what happens in-between when the Kernel is asked to run a program, and when the first line of our program’s <code>main</code> function is actually executed. Here’s a summary of that rabbit hole.</p> <h2>In the beginning…</h2> <p>First question: When is the OS kernel actually asked to run any program? The answer, at least on Linux, is the <code>execve</code> system call (“syscall”). Let’s take a quick look at that:</p> <!----><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>int</span><span> execve</span><span>(</span><span>const</span><span> char</span><span> *</span><span>filename</span><span>,</span><span> char</span><span> *</span><span>const</span><span> argv</span><span>[]</span><span>,</span><span> char</span><span> *</span><span>const</span><span> envp</span><span>[]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><!----> <p>This is actually quite straightforward! We pass the name of the exectuable file, a list of arguments, and a list of environment variables. This signals to the kernel where, and how, to start loading the program.</p> <p>Many programming languages provide an interface to execute commands that eventually call <code>execve</code> under the hood. For example, in Rust, we have:</p> <!----><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>use</span><span> std</span><span>::</span><span>process</span><span>::</span><span>Command</span><span>;</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Command</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"ls"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>arg</span><span>(</span><span>"-l"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>spawn</span><span>();</span></span></code></pre><!----> <p>In these higher-level wrappers, the language’s standard library often handles translation of the command name to a full path, acting similarly to how a shell would resolve the command via the <code>PATH</code> environment variable. The kernel itself, however, expects a proper path to an executable file.</p> <blockquote><p>A note on interpreters: If the executable file starts with a shebang (<code>#!</code>), the kernel will use the shebang-specified interpreter to run the program. For example, <code>#!/usr/bin/python3</code> will run the program using the Python interpreter, <code>#!/bin/bash</code> will run the program using the Bash shell, etc.</p></blockquote> <h2>ELF</h2> <p>What does an executable file look like? On Linux, it’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format" rel="nofollow">ELF</a>, which the kernel knows how to parse. Other operating systems have different formats (e.g. Mach-O on MacOS, PE on Windows), but ELF is the most common format on Linux. I won’t go into too much detail here, to keep things brief, but ELF files have grown out of the original <code>a.out</code> format, and are expressive enough to support pretty much every program you’ll ever write. Here’s what the header of an ELF file looks like:</p> <!----><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>%</span><span> readelf</span><span> -h</span><span> main</span><span> # main is an ELF file</span></span>

But we’ll be coming back to this.</li></ol> <p>Other ELF files will have different entries and specific values, but the general structure is what we’re after here.</p> <blockquote><p>As you can see by the numerous mentions to “RISC-V”, this is an ELF file I compiled and linked targeting the RV32 architecture (which the aforementioned emulator is built for), hence the “32” in “ELF32”, the “RVC” flag, and the “RISC-V” machine type.</p></blockquote> <h3>More than just a header</h3> <p>ELF files contain everything our program needs to run, including the code, data, symbols, and more. We can see this again with the <code>readelf</code> command with the <code>-a</code> flag. Here’s what we care about:</p> <!----><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>Section Headers:</span></span>

Not quite. There’s a massive amount of machinery inside the kernel to make all sorts of programs under all sorts of conditions run.</p> <p>For example, the “PLT” (Procedure Linkage Table) is a section that allows us to call functions in “shared libraries”, for example, <code>libc</code>, without having to package them alongside our program (“dynamically” vs “statically linking”). The ELF file contains a dynamic section which tells the kernel which shared libraries to load, and another section which tells the kernel to dynamically “relocate” pointers to those functions, so everything checks out.</p> <blockquote><p><code>libc</code> is the C standard library, which contains all the “useful” functions: <code>printf</code>, <code>malloc</code>, etc. Various flavors implementing the <code>libc</code> interfaces exist, most commonly <code>glibc</code> and <code>musl</code>. Most of the binaries that are discussed in this post are compiled and linked against <code>musl</code>, since it’s much easier to statically link.</p></blockquote> <p>The symbol table looks something like this:</p> <!----><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>Symbol table '.symtab' contains 2308 entries:</span></span>

<span><span>     ...</span></span></code></pre><!----> <p>You may ask: “Wow! <code>2308</code> looks like a lot, right? What behemoth of a program could possibly need that many symbols?“.</p> <p>Good question! Here’s the behemoth:</p> <!----><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>#include</span><span> &lt;stdio.h&gt;</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>int</span><span> main</span><span>() {</span></span>
<span><span>  printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, World!</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>  return</span><span> 0</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><!----> <p>Yeah, that’s it. Now, <code>2308</code> may be <em>slightly</em> bloated because we link against <code>musl</code> instead of <code>glibc</code>, but the point still stands: There’s <em>a lot</em> of stuff going on behind the scenes here.</p> <p>The kernel’s job here is to iterate over each section, loading those marked as “loadable”. Some security mitigations start to become relevant here, such as moving sections around in memory (ASLR — Address Space Layout Randomization), marking sections as non-executable (NX bit — hardware-level security), etc. But ultimately, the kernel loads the code and data into memory, sets up the stack, and prepares to jump to the entry point of the program.</p> <h2>The stack</h2> <p>Ah yes, the infamous stack! Fortunately for most of us, the stack is something we take for granted. Unfortunately for the kernel, the stack is not some omnipotent magical space that just exists — it needs to be set up properly before our program can run.</p> <p>As a reminder: stack space is typically used for variables, function arguments, “frames” (to keep track of function-local variables, call trees, etc), and a variety of other things, depending on what, and how your program is running.</p> <p>Hypothetically, if we simplify a bit and say that the ELF file is loaded into memory starting at the zero address, the stack is typically placed at the “opposite end” of the memory, from a high address, and grows “downwards” towards the lower addresses, with the space in-between used as heap space, and for other data (shared libraries, mmapped files, etc). This is a simplification, but in fairness, there is significant ambiguity as much of the semantics here depend on the program itself.</p> <p>The stack is also something that is non-empty! Remember <code>argv</code> and <code>envp</code> from the <code>execve</code> call above? Those are passed to the program via the stack. In most programming languages we frequently access these via the various <code>args</code> and <code>env</code> utilities, whether that be directly, like in C, or more indirectly, like in Rust (<code>std::env</code>) or Python (<code>sys.argv</code>).</p> <p>The kernel also stores something called the “ELF auxiliary vector” in the nascent stack. This “auxv” contains information about the environment, such as the memory page size, metadata from the ELF file, and other system information. These are important! For example, <code>musl</code> uses the “page size” entry of the auxv so that <code>malloc</code> can request and manage memory more optimally. There are over 30 entries in the auxiliary vectors, but not all of them are used by every program (and some may not be defined by the kernel).</p> <p>Let’s pretend we’re the kernel. Here’s a simplified version of how we might setup the stack of a new process (taken and simplified from my RISC-V emulator, which also emulates parts of the kernel):</p> <!----><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>// Choose an arbitrary high address for the stack</span></span>

This is the address of the first instruction to run in the process. Typically, this is under a function called <code>_start</code>. Both glibc and musl provide implementations of <code>_start</code>, but it’s also possible to write your own. Again, here’s a Rust example:</p> <!----><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>// Disable the language runtime, we're DIYing it.</span></span>

It’s at this part that things like global constructors, thread-local storage, and other language-specific features are set up.</p> <p>Here, our journey comes to an end — things become much more language-specific from this point on. Most languages will set up their own runtimes (yes, even C and C++ have a “runtime”!), and eventually call the standard <code>main</code> function we’re normally familiar with.</p> <p>In Rust, the generated code ends up looking like the following:</p> <!----><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>// the user defined main function</span></span>
<span><span>fn</span><span> main</span><span>() { </span><span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, world!"</span><span>); }</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>// the generated _start function</span></span>
<span><span>fn</span><span> _start</span><span>() </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>    let</span><span> argc </span><span>=</span><span> ...</span><span>; </span><span>// get argc from stack</span></span>
<span><span>    let</span><span> argv </span><span>=</span><span> ...</span><span>; </span><span>// get argv from stack</span></span>
<span><span>    let</span><span> envp </span><span>=</span><span> ...</span><span>; </span><span>// get envp from stack</span></span>
<span><span>    let</span><span> main_fn </span><span>=</span><span> main; </span><span>// pointer to user main function</span></span>
<span><span>    std</span><span>::</span><span>rt</span><span>::</span><span>lang_start</span><span>(argc, argv, main_fn);</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><!----> <p>With the <code>lang_start</code> function (defined here)[https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/04ff05c9c0cfbca33115c5f1b8bb20a66a54b799/library/std/src/rt.rs#L199] and taking care of the rest.</p> <p>C and C++ have similar, minimal setups. Languages that are traditionally thought to have “heavier” runtimes, such as Java or Python, work the same way, but with the <code>std::rt::lang_start</code> equivalent doing far more than the Rust/C/C++ runtimes.</p> <p>And there you have it! I’m missing lots of detail here, but hopefully this gives a rough idea of what happens before <code>main()</code> gets called. I’ve left out complexity that is mostly internal to “real” linux kernels, such as how the kernel sets up address space, the process tables, various group semantics, and et cetera, but I hope this still serves as a decent primer.</p> <p>Feel free to reach out to me with any questions or corrections!</p><!----></div></div>]]></description>
