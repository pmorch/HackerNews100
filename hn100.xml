<p>The first flight of an SR-71 took place on Dec. 22, 1964, and the first SR-71 to enter service was delivered to the 4200th (later 9th) Strategic Reconnaissance Wing at Beale Air Force Base, Calif., in January 1966. </p>



<p>The Blackbird was in a different category from anything that had come before. “Everything had to be invented. Everything,” Skunk Works legendary aircraft designer Kelly Johnson recalled in an interesting article appeared on <a href="https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/news/features/history/blackbird.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lockheed Martin website</a>. </p>



<p>Experience gained from the A-12 program convinced the US Air Force that flying the SR-71 safely required two crew members, a pilot and a Reconnaissance Systems Officer (RSO). The RSO operated with the wide array of monitoring and defensive systems installed on the airplane. This equipment included a sophisticated Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) system that could jam most acquisition and targeting radar and the Nortronics NAS-14V2 Astroinertial Navigation System (ANS). </p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://timeandnavigation.si.edu/multimedia-asset/nortronics-nas-14v2-astroinertial-navigation-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Smithsonian Institution website</a>, the ANS provided rapid celestial navigation fixes for the SR-71. </p>



<p>Mounted behind the SR-71 RSO’s cockpit, this unit (that was affectionately dubbed “R2-D2” after <a href="https://theaviationgeekclub.com/no-the-f-15-never-attacked-death-star-of-star-wars-but-the-mighty-eagle-was-the-only-us-aircraft-to-destroy-a-machine-orbiting-earth-heres-how/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Star Wars movie</a> came out in 1977), computed navigational fixes using stars sighted through the lens in the top of the unit. These fixes were used to update the inertial navigation system and provided course guidance with an accuracy of at least 90 meters (300 feet). Some current aircraft and missile systems use improved versions as a backup to GPS. </p>



<p>About the ANS RSOs were known to say, “no one can jam or shoot down the sun, the moon, the planets or the stars.” </p>



<p>Piloting the Blackbird was an unforgiving endeavor, demanding total concentration. But pilots were giddy with their complex, adrenaline-fueled responsibilities. “At 85,000 feet and Mach 3, it was almost a religious experience,” said Air Force Colonel Jim Watkins. “Nothing had prepared me to fly that fast… My God, even now, I get goose bumps remembering.” </p>

<p>But once the SR-71 reached cruising speed and altitude, it was time to focus on the mission, which was to collect information about hostile and potentially hostile nations using cameras and sensors. The pilot’s job was to handle the aircraft and watch over the automatic systems to make sure they were doing their jobs properly. Meanwhile, the RSO handled the cameras, sensors, and the all-important ANS. The ANS was the 1960’s version of GPS, but instead of using satellites to locate itself, the ANS used the stars. This is because before the invention of the modern satnav networks there wasn’t a way to navigate the SR-71 in the areas where it operated. The SR-71 needed to be able to fix its position within 1,885 feet (575 m) and within 300 ft (91 m) of the center of its flight path while traveling at high speeds for up to ten hours in the air. </p>



<p>The ANS provided specific pinpoint targets located in hostile territory. It was a Gyro compass that was able to sense the rotation of the earth, while still on the runway before the SR-71 would take off. The RSO could use his coordinates of the spot ….of one place …on the runway …then read of the ANS. They were almost always exactly the same. Not always were the same stars were used on every mission, as they used the stars depending on what part of the world they were going to fly to. If flying in the southern hemisphere* they used only the stars that were seen there.</p>

<p>On Jul. 2, 1967 Blackbird crew Jim Watkins and Dave Dempster flew the first international sortie in SR-71A #17972 when the ANS failed on a training mission and they accidentally flew in to Mexican airspace. </p>



<p>The ANS works by tracking at least two stars at a time listed in an onboard catalog, and with the aid of a chronometer, calculates a fix of the SR-71 over the ground. It was programmed before each flight and the aircraft’s primary alignment and the flight plan was recorded on a punched tape that told the aircraft where to go, when to turn, and when to turn the sensors on and off. The stars were sighted through a special quartz window (located behind the RSO cockpit) and there was a special star tracker that could see the stars even in daylight.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-74947">
	
	<!-- .entry-header -->

	
		<div data-first_letter="I">
		<p>If there’s one language that’s been at the heart of the Macintosh for the last 39 years it’s PostScript, the page description language developed by the founders of Adobe, the late John Warnock and Charles Geschke, and their team of engineers. It brought the Mac’s first commercial success in desktop publishing, in PostScript fonts, and early PostScript printers including Apple’s game-changing LaserWriter. Although Mac OS X never inherited NeXTStep’s Display PostScript, its descendant Quartz and Core Graphics are still based on PostScript’s relative PDF.</p>
<p>Following a short illness that started in macOS Monterey 12.3, PostScript has died suddenly in Sonoma.</p>
<p>The first sign passed almost unnoticed in Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-12_3-release-notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release notes to macOS 12.3</a>, where it recorded the “deprecation” of PostScript in WebKit: “Support for inline viewing of PostScript files is no longer available.”</p>
<p>Then in macOS 13.0, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213250" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Preview lost the ability</a> to convert PostScript and EPS: “The Preview app included with your Mac supports PostScript (.ps) and Encapsulated PostScript (.eps) files in macOS Monterey or earlier. Starting with macOS Ventura, Preview no longer supports these files. Other apps that can view or convert .ps and .eps files are available from the App Store and elsewhere.”</p>
<p>Finally, the complete removal of support for PostScript and EPS was recorded as another “deprecation” in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-14-release-notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the release notes for Sonoma</a>: “macOS has removed the functionality for converting PostScript and EPS files to PDF format. As a result, CoreGraphics’ CGPSConverter returns an error when invoked, ImageIO no longer converts EPS files, NSEPSImageRep does not display EPS files, and PMPrinterPrintWithFile does not accept a PostScript file for non-PostScript print queues.”</p>
<p>Search of Apple’s previous release notes doesn’t reveal any prior warnings of this removal of support or deprecation (in the general meaning of the term), in contrast to other removals from Sonoma such as ATS/ATSUI. Although conversion from PostScript and EPS must now be in relatively little demand, its demise has been rapid, as if Apple can’t wait for macOS to be rid of it. The most likely reason is security.</p>
<p>PostScript is an old stack-based interpreted language designed at a time when code security had barely been conceived, and malicious software hardly existed. Among its attractive features is the fact that any PostScript object can be treated as data, or executed as part of a program, and can itself generate new objects that can in turn be executed. More recently, security researchers have drawn attention to the fact that it’s a gift for anyone wishing to write and distribute malicious code. As it’s effectively an image format, embedding malware inside a PostScript file could enable that to be run without user interaction, as with some other graphics formats.</p>
<p>There are three major PostScript interpreters in common use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adobe’s Distiller engine, built into its Acrobat products,</li>
<li>Apple’s PSNormalizer engine, built into macOS,</li>
<li>Artifex’s open source engine, built into Ghostscript, and widely used in Linux and other platforms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Research into those engines has so far been relatively limited, but has revealed some serious vulnerabilities. Most recently, Kai Lu and Brett Stone-Gross of Zscaler’s ThreatLabz <a href="https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/smash-postscript-interpreters-using-syntax-aware-fuzzer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published an account</a> of three vulnerabilities they found in Distiller, and one in PSNormalizer, in 2022. Those were fixed by Adobe and Apple last year, in the latter case in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213345" target="_blank" rel="noopener">macOS Monterey 12.5</a> released on 20 July 2022, and its equivalent security updates for Big Sur and Catalina. From the dates, I suspect that the removal of support for inline viewing of PostScript files in WebKit in Monterey 12.3 may also have been part of Apple’s mitigations.</p>
<p>Apple was most probably prompted into conducting a security audit of PSNormalizer as a result of the vulnerability reported, and would have been faced with the choice of re-engineering it or removing it from macOS completely. Unlike the PDF engine in Quartz, PSNormalizer is now little used, and has no significant role in macOS. The first step was to make it inaccessible from the GUI by disabling that feature in Ventura’s Preview, then following that in Sonoma by removing PSNormalizer altogether, so removing its command tool <code>pstopdf</code> and Core Graphics’ CGPSConverter.</p>
<p>This leaves those still wishing to convert PostScript files with a choice between Adobe’s Distiller in its paid-for Acrobat products, and Artifex’s Ghostscript, which has had its own share of vulnerabilities. There is also a third option, of running a late version of macOS Monterey in a lightweight VM and continuing to use PSNormalizer through Preview there. For most, that will be the cheapest and simplest option.</p>
<p>John Warnock, co-founder of Adobe and driving force behind PostScript, died on 19 August this year. His page description language had brought success to the Mac for almost 39 years, but at least PDF lives on.</p>
<p><em>I’m very grateful to Ben for drawing my attention to the changes in Sonoma.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Postscript</strong></em> (it’s only appropriate)</p>
<p>I’m now starting to see warnings from third-party app developers that, in Sonoma, their apps will be unable to open or import EPS files, for example, as they can no longer convert them using Quartz in macOS 14. Although the impact on most of us should be very small or negligible, if you do still use EPS or PostScript at any scale, you will need to prepare a solution for continuing to do so after upgrading to Sonoma. I wish you success.</p>

<p>The Pixel 8 is rapidly approaching its October 4 unveiling, but before then there are a bunch of leaks out there. Reliable leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/Za_Raczke/status/1706190950232445368">Kamila Wojciechowska</a> has a whole list of Pixel 8 and 8 Pro specs over at <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-8-pro-specifications-revealed/">91mobiles</a>, along with some Pixel<a href="https://twitter.com/Za_Raczke/status/1706277114717040721"> market materials</a>. The big news is that Google is finally giving its Pixel phones a longer support window. Pixel phones are getting <em>seven years</em> of updates, which is longer than Apple. Google pitches the Pixel phones as the flagship of the Android ecosystem, and now, if this spec sheet pans out, the OS maker is finally giving them an update plan to match.</p>
<p>Currently, Pixel phones have three years of OS updates and five years of security updates, which is not only beaten by Apple's update policy but is also inexplicably worse than many of Google's Android partners. For instance, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/samsung-now-updates-android-for-longer-than-google-does/">Samsung</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/oneplus-adds-an-extra-year-to-its-update-promise-now-at-4-years-of-major-updates/">OnePlus</a> offer four years of OS updates, albeit with some caveats around arrival times and the security update cadence. Apple doesn't have a policy written in stone anywhere, but with the iPhone X not <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/ios-and-ipados-17-drop-support-for-iphone-x-first-ipad-pros-and-other-old-devices/">making the jump</a> to iOS17, that makes for a five-year major OS update policy if you're counting to 2022's iOS16, though with some point updates in 2023 you could argue six years.</p>
<p>Google has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/pixel-6-leaks-five-years-of-security-updates-749-and-1049-price-tags/">messed around</a> in the past by calling its current "three years of major OS updates and five years of security updates" plan "five years of updates," but this spec sheet very clearly says "seven years of OS, security, and feature drop updates." That would comfortably lead all major manufacturers, leaving only Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/fairphone-5-sets-a-new-standard-with-8-10-years-of-android-support/">and Fairphone</a> at the top of the charts.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>In most of the Android world, manufacturers are dependent on their system on a chip vendor's update policy (that's usually Qualcomm) to provide Android updates. The process of shipping an Android update is an ultra-complicated relay race from Google's Android builds to the SoC vendor to the phone manufacturer. With the launch of the Pixel 6, Google started making its own SoCs (with a lot of help from Samsung's Exynos division), so every company in each step of the Android update process is just "Google." With no one else to collaborate with, the updates can last as long as Google wants.</p>

<p>The specs for the Pixel 8 Pro include something called a "Super Actua" display, which the marketing docs say will work "even in direct sunlight." The spec sheet lists 1600 nits in HDR mode and 2400 nits in "peak brightness" sunlight mode. That's probably a high point for a sunlight mode—it's certainly better than the peaks of the S23 Ultra (<a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s23-series-equal-display-brightness-fantastic-colors/">1750 nits</a>) and iPhone 15 Pro Max (<a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/SP904?locale=en_US">2000 nits</a>)—but <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/nit#:~:text=One%20nit%20is%20equal%20to,cathode%20ray%20tubes%20(CRTs).">noon sunlight</a> is 1.6 billion nits. Manufacturers keep picking this fight with the sun, and while I guess brighter is better, I'm still not confident any phone will put a dent in sunlight.</p>
<p>The Pro display is the usual 120 Hz, 6.7-inch OLED, but the aspect ratio is tweaked a bit to 20:9 (the 7 Pro is 19.5:9). This spec sheet also lists a funky resolution of 2992×1344 instead of the usual 3120×1440. The device dimensions have not really changed beyond a factional millimeter, and the Pro clocks in at 162.6×76.5×8.8 mm. The battery is pretty much the same at 5050 mAh, and it still only has 30 W charging. It still has 12GB of RAM. The storage is all sorts of disappointing, with the base storage tier still 128GB, while lots of phones start at 256GB, and it's still UFS 3.1 storage, while most other flagships have UFS 4.0.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The non-pro Pixel 8 is smaller, now 6.2 inches instead of 6.3 inches, with a noticeably smaller width and height to boot. It's now at 150.5×70.8×8.9 mm. The Pixel 7 is 155.6x73.2x8.7 mm. The display is branded "Actua," and not "Super Actua," and that means 1400-nit HDR and 2000-nit peak brightness. It's still 120 Hz 2400×1080, and the lower power mode still caps at 60 Hz instead of the dynamic refresh rate of the Pro model, which can go down to 1 Hz when you aren't scrolling or watching a video. The battery is jumping from 4355 mAh to 4575 mAh, and the phone is still packing 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.</p>
<p>The one update we know is coming is the Google Tensor 3 SoC. This will be the first Google SoC to have an actual CPU upgrade. The Tensor 1 and 2 had CPU clusters headlined by two Arm Cortex X1 CPUs and benchmarked <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/pixel-7-pro-review-google-makes-refinements-to-the-best-android-phone/#h2">similarly</a>. Wojciechowska <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-8-tensor-g3-specs-3331398/">previously reported</a> the Pixel 8 would switch to a newer Cortex X3 CPU, followed by four Cortex A715 cores and four A510 cores. This would put it in the same class as a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2.</p>
<p>As for the most important spec, the price, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/09/24/google-pixel-8-price-retail-leak/">9to5Google</a> has a leak for that and says everything is getting $100 more expensive in the US. The report has the Pixel 8 at $699 and the Pixel 8 Pro at $999, with a ship date of October 12. Check back on October 4, when all of this can be officially confirmed.</p>

<p>I think the biggest reason so many indie games “fail” is that teams enter into making huge, overly ambitious projects that take years to release before they are ready. Indie teams do not spend enough time making smaller (and less profitable) games first before transitioning to multi-year projects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I know it seems like the modern games-industry ecosystem is unique and there is no one who can understand our plight, but indie game studios have faced similar problems for decades and they have been able to ship creative, profitable games under those conditions. It’s critical that we learn the history of our business so that we don’t repeat the same mistakes they did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While reading John Romero’s new book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Doom-Guy-Life-First-Person/dp/141975811X">Doom Guy: Life in First Person</a> it occurred to me that at the start, he and the founders of id Software were facing many of the same issues modern indies are.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/trDddifG5ciQHjdOXkP77pjZ3lDJJvOpoGt2TohLIkPLc5DKScgbkvT1I5PFZdUrwNCrkI_gJtW-xNLVQDj4hmlR5UdRcGwOxrjrhBV6q1UIU2lCDyFS3nfW7eyDKoVhir5CVHNOy3ooTbYCugrriLQ" alt=""></figure>



<p>It seemed so relevant that I reached out to John Romero for an interview to see what it was like releasing indie games back in the early 1990s. The following is a transcription of the interview I did with John.</p>



<p>When appropriate, I added a bit of historical context which you can see prefaced as HISTORY. In fact, let me set the scene right now:</p>



<p><em>HISTORY: In the early 1990s, John Romero worked full time at </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softdisk"><em>Softdisk</em></a><em> which was a monthly subscription service where every month they would ship you a floppy disk full of PC games called Gamer’s Edge (think of it as an ancient Xbox Games Pass). While making games for Softdisk, his team innovated a technique that could make games on PC side scroll smoothly like the NES and formed id Software to release games that exploited this new technology. Their games they made under id Software were published by Apogee. When John quit Softdisk, the Softdisk CEO realized how much talent he was losing so he negotiated a deal with id Software where id Software would make 6-more games for Softdisk to be delivered in 1991.</em></p>



<p><em>The confluence of working full time at Softdisk, then quitting and publishing games under Apogee, and then closing out on a contract for Softdisk meant that John and his team released 27 games in 1990 and 1991. For the full list of games see the table in Appendix.</em></p>

<h4>Chris Zukowski (CZ): Why did you make so many games in 1990 and 1991?</h4>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-20-1024x576.png" alt="" srcset="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-20-1024x576.png 1024w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-20-300x169.png 300w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-20-768x432.png 768w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-20.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p><strong>John Romero (JR):</strong> When we were working at Gamer’s Edge, every two months we had to ship a game. That’s only six games in a year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we also wanted to make more Commander Keen games. And we also made games outside of work. So the first half of 1991, John Carmack and I made about three games outside of the normal work hours.</p>



<p>And then during the second half of 1991, all of our hours, once again, were spent on two games at a time. It resulted in 13 games that we made in 1991 alone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From July of 1991, it took us three months to do the first Commander Keen 4 episode that was shareware. We felt like that was kind of a disaster. Like it took too long, it’s a game that everybody remembers from the Keen series, but to us it was like that was a bad, bad, bad, that it took three months, that’s nuts! We knew we had to go faster if we’re going to ship by Christmas.</p>



<p>So what we did was make Keen 5 right after 4, but then we got a deal to make a Keen for Christmas. And it had to be done before Christmas, way before Christmas, to get in boxes and in stores. So we had to do Keen 4 and then Keen 6 and then Keen 5. For Keen 5 to even make it for shareware to make it out into the market.</p>



<p>At the same time we’re trying to ship these games, we were making the first texture map 3d shooter game. Called Catacomb 3D.&nbsp; And that took two months as well to get that done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was so busy.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>CZ: How did you manage to do it that fast?</h4>



<p>JR: There were just four of us. We’d been making games every day for 10 years. So we had so much experience making games, especially small games. We knew how to scope. We knew what felt like a good size, so when we scoped it out, it was 16 levels made with a level editor, which I already had made.</p>



<h4>CZ: How did you scope it?</h4>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-21.png" alt="" width="627" height="392" srcset="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-21.png 320w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-21-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px"><figcaption>(Screenshot of the Gamer’s Edge platformer Shadow Knights)</figcaption></figure>



<p>JR: The scoping on our very first game, <a href="https://archive.org/details/msdos_Slordax_-_The_Unknown_Enemy_1991">Slordax: The Unknown Enemy</a>, was really us deciding how many levels we can make and how long it take us to make these levels. At the time, we didn’t know how long it take Adrian to do varieties of textures, tiles (with scrolling), characters, the ship, shooting, sound effects. You’ve got to create levels, you’ve got to write an editor for that. We saw how many levels we could make, and that kind of showed us what our velocity was.</p>



<p>The second game was a totally different game. It was a side scrolling ninja game called <a href="https://archive.org/details/msdos_Shadow_Knights_1990">Shadow Knights</a>. We could see how many levels we could make before we hit our two month goal. And so we could tell that we’re getting faster. The art was going at a good speed so we could determine how much data we can create for these games.</p>



<p>The same time that we’re doing that, we’re actually scoping out Commander Keen and we scoped out 48 levels to get done in these three months that we were trying to fit in.</p>



<h4>CZ: How were you disciplined to keep your ideas small enough to produce so fastt?&nbsp;</h4>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-22.png" alt="" width="643" height="401"><figcaption>Might and Magic II: Gates to Another World. John had worked on this project with a larger team</figcaption></figure>



<p>JR: I had made big games before, and it was really fun making big games [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Might_and_Magic_II:_Gates_to_Another_World">Might and Magic II: Gates to Another World</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_(1989_video_game)">Journey: The Quest Begins</a>]. But they were too big for one person to make. So as a team, we knew not to scope beyond the time that we knew that we had.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We knew that we were under constraints and that those constraints are finite. So we didn’t whine or complain that we weren’t making big games because we said let’s just get done with our current games and then we’ll think about what’s next. So when we got to the point where we were done with obligations to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softdisk">Softdisk Publishing</a> and we can actually just be 100 percent id Software.</p>



<h4>CZ: Weren’t all games small at that time?&nbsp;</h4>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-23.png" alt="" width="718" height="449" srcset="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-23.png 320w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-23-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 718px) 100vw, 718px"><figcaption>&nbsp;Screenshot of Ultima V: Warriors of Destiny. A huge game at the time.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>JR: </strong>Back in the 80s, there were massive games. So if you talk about, say, Ultima V, you’re looking at several years of a team of people, maybe 10 people working on it. Programming in an assembly language, making a lot of data as compressed as possible to fit on probably 10 disk sides. These projects were really big. I think they had a producer on board to handle all the tasks. And this is in the 80s.</p>



<p>So when we started making our games, especially with Keen, it was September. You have to ship for Christmas and we had to ship three games. We knew, “Okay, these are going to be fast, these won’t be really huge games, but we’ll do the best that we can.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>We mapped out an initial 16 levels per game. So that’s like 48 levels. So we decided, we can do 48 levels and two and a half months plus all the code and all the art and animations.</p>



<h4>CZ: There were a lot of Keen sequels in a short period of time. Were you worried they would cannibalize each other?&nbsp;</h4>



<p>JR: No, because people just wanted more, more and more and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>History Lesson: In 1991, John Carmack began research on a 3D-real-time game engine that was the predecessor of every First Person Shooter (FPS) we have today. Carmack was doing things that had never before thought possible with a consumer-grade home computer. It was revolutionary. But, instead of just holding the tech until it was perfect, id Software published 2 smaller, more experimental games under their contract with Softdisk.

Know your gaming history.&nbsp;</em></p>



<h4>CZ: You all released the first smooth scrolling 3D game with the game Hovertank, but you published it under Gamer’s Edge, not under your studio id Software. Why reveal your hand with such revolutionary technology?</h4>

The first prototypes were actually shipped as Gamer’s Edge games.</figcaption></figure>



<p>JR: We were basically getting paid to experiment and do R&amp;D (Research and Development) and create a 3D engine. We made it and sold it to them. And then later we could take another chance six months later with Catacomb 3D doing texture mapping for the first time. And so it was another experiment that they’re paying us for.</p>



<p>And then with Wolfenstein 3D, we were on our own at that point. We had done 3D twice, we knew how to do it, and we’re going to do our own game this time. We didn’t need advances or anything like that kind of stuff. We already had money coming in every month (from the Keen series).</p>



<h4>CZ: When did you know you were ready to move from Keen games to make Wolfenstein and Doom?</h4>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-24.png" alt="" width="722" height="451" srcset="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-24.png 541w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-24-300x187.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px"><figcaption><em>Castle Wolfenstein 3D was the first game that id Software released after completing the Gamer’s Edge contract for 6 games. There was no time constraint in making it, so they got it out in a very long 5.5 months.</em></figcaption></figure>







<p>JR: I knew that we’re wasting our time with Keen because 3D was really where it’s going to be. It’s not going to be with this 2D stuff. We need to get out of the 2D stuff. We’d spent two weeks already making a really cool demo of Keen 7. It had VGA parallax scrolling, all this stuff that was going to be a big jump in 2D.</p>



<p>And… at one in the morning, I said “Guys, we should not be doing this game. We have this cool technology that we’re not using, that we’re not taking advantage of to make a better version of that game going forward.” And so everyone immediately went, ‘Yep, you’re right.’</p>



<p>That’s where Castle Wolfenstein was kind of born, was right then. We knew this is the first game that we’re going to make that does not have a time constraint on it. And, uh, and so this is, this is let’s make a really good game and put everything that we feel belongs in it and just do it right.</p>



<p>And that’s what we did. And it took us four months to get the shareware version out, which for us four months is crazy. We spent a month and a half getting the five episodes of maps and bosses done. And so it was a total of five and a half months with the hint book and like everything.</p>



<p>So it felt like that was great. We weren’t time-constrained. We could make a really great game and we did and everybody&nbsp;</p>



<h4>CZ: In the early days of id Software, you guys were making decent money but not Ferrari money yet. Were you upset by that? Did you know how much money the big studios were making in the 1990s?</h4>



<p>JR: When I was working at Origin Systems, they would have a company meeting and they would talk about sales and everything. And they were making amazing money, like $3,000,000 profit in 1987 (side note that is $7,605,928.98 in 2023 money.)</p>



<p>We wanted to be LucasArts and Origin in quality but make the kind of games at the size that we felt was appropriate. We don’t want to make these epic sagas. We just wanted to make really fun experiences.</p>



<h4>CZ: But At the time, Softdisk paid you just $5000 ($11,405 in 2023 dollars) for every game you developed for them. Did that seem small compared to what you saw Origin was earning?</h4>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-25-1024x768.png" alt="" srcset="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-25-1024x768.png 1024w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-25-300x225.png 300w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-25-768x576.png 768w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-25-1536x1152.png 1536w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-25.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Softdisk, publisher of Gamer’s Edge: What Software company offices looked like in the late 80s. <a href="https://romero.smugmug.com/Video-Games/The-Archives/i-b8k8NJZ/A">Courtesy of John’s Photo Archive</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>JR: No, we were blown away that it was that much. Back then rent was really cheap. It was in the hundreds of dollars per month. Our goal was to survive as a company and a team. So when we got the first check and the idea was to start the company, work full time, and there was four of us.</p>



<p>The first thing that we thought was “we need to hold on to as much money as we can in the company.” Each person at that point had a different situation with how much money they needed to spend to live every month because of their rent cost and their bills that they had. There might be a car payment or something.</p>



<p>Later, we were making $50,000 a month and, and we gave ourselves little raises, but we kept as much as we could in the bank because if, if the game didn’t sell well or we had a dry spell or took too long to make a game or whatever, we needed to be able to keep on going to finish the game and to be able to get it out.</p>



<p>So we had to be as conservative as we could possibly be. Yeah. We weren’t out buying anything. We were just working.</p>



<h4>CZ: Today your first month of sales are a large proportion of how much your game will make. What was the revenue curve like for newly launched games in the 1990s?</h4>



<p>JR: It was a very long tail. The spike wasn’t even at the beginning because BBSs (Bulletin board systems) were really limited in the amount of people that would be exposed to stuff. So, our initial spike actually went on for a long time. At minimum, it was half a year before it peaked, and then it went down.</p>



<p>Income stacking was critical. We needed to be getting income from multiple games at the same time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We made $10,500 ($23,846 in 2023 dollars) that first month of id Software. By the same time the next year, we were making $50,000 ($113,555.35) per month. And it’s because of income stacking.</p>



<p>At that point, we had the original Keen (which was still going really strong), we had the second set of Keens, and what that meant was we had a shareware version of Keen that had two pieces, which was a really bad idea, because it didn’t do as well as the first one because of that.</p>



<p>But we also had a retail Keen that was out as well, so we had three products that were out and we also had money coming in because we’re making these Gamer’s Edge games.</p>



<p>So we were just being real conservative and saving as much as we could. And then when Wolfenstein 3D hit, that changed the world basically. It was huge.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>CZ: How did you make money even after Wolfenstein and Doom hit it big?</h4>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="698" src="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-26-1024x698.png" alt="" srcset="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-26-1024x698.png 1024w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-26-300x205.png 300w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-26-768x524.png 768w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-26.png 1488w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Workstation of Wolfenstein 3D development <a href="https://romero.smugmug.com/Video-Games/The-Archives/i-Rb9skm4/A">From John’s photo archive</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>JR: After Doom (during Quake’s development) was when I got <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Doom">Final Doom</a> going. But I also had <a href="http://browser-doom.io/?page=game&amp;game=heretic&amp;profile=Heretic%20(Shareware)">Heretic</a> and <a href="https://gamesnostalgia.com/game/hexen-beyond-heretic">Hexen</a>. We did <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Master_Levels_for_Doom_II">Master Levels for Doom 2</a>. We were upgrading Doom to <a href="https://doom.fandom.com/wiki/The_Ultimate_Doom">Ultimate Doom</a> to go retail. It was just a lot of games. I think within the six years that I was there at id Software, we had published 35 Games or something like that.</p>



<h4>CZ: If we were to transport 20-year-old John Romero to 2023, with today’s tools, and game environment, do you think you could replicate that productivity of the 1990s?</h4>



<p>JR: I think so. When you look at the breadth of indie games and what they look like, if you go to itch. io and places where indies live, there’s such a wide range of art styles and games.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Horror games are massive with indies and there’s a 1995, a PlayStation aesthetic of graphics. That’s really big. It takes less time to make that graphic quality than it does for a realistic or semi realistic full Unreal Engine.</p>



<p>So, you could do that if you were spending the most time that you can on the gameplay part because the engine’s done. Don’t think about the engine, you think about making. Figure out what you’re making, your experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s say if it’s Unreal, are you making blueprints that are really modular for the different rooms you’re going to go in if you’re making a horror game. You want it to feel like it’s a roller coaster ride to get through.</p>



<p>So how are you pacing it? How big is it? What’s the scope?&nbsp;</p>



<p>I do game jams every once in a while. In 2017 I did a 10 hour game jam with a programmer that works at our company. In 10 hours we put together a horror adventure game, with about 13 different screens, creepy music, creepy dialogue, and it had a very weird vibe and published it.</p>



<p><a href="https://rome.ro/july-4-1976">If you want to check it out, it’s called July 4th, 1976</a>. So it’s on iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows done in, in 10 hours published on four platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s a really great company in Portugal that’s putting this game together with a bunch of other indie games and they’re going to be taking the Switch version of it and it’s going to actually appear on an indie compilation on Switch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But you can see, it’s a 10 hour game. If you’re asking, what games can you get in a month, this is 10 hours.</p>

<h4>CZ: But what if my dream game is in the style of a Final Fantasy game?&nbsp;</h4>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-27-1024x683.png" alt="" srcset="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-27-1024x683.png 1024w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-27-300x200.png 300w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-27-768x512.png 768w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-27.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>JR: You need to scope way down. A scoping exercise is like the most important thing you can do at the very beginning. Like, just think about this: since we’re talking about the horror genre and I did this 10 hour thing, one of the most memorable horror demos that people have seen in recent years?</p>



<p>It’s P. T. It’s a hallway, and people won’t forget it, right? It’s a hallway. And that tells you everything about the amount of content you need to make to stick in people’s minds. It’s the design that matters. It’s not the size. It’s not a gigantic adventure. It’s doing something brand new no one has seen in the genre that you’ve chosen that’s really unique.</p>



<p>And if you’re talking about spending a lot of time on a game, spend it on design. Think about what you’re doing and think about something that’s new and pushing the boundaries of the genre that you’re in.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>CZ: What if you are stuck in a 2,3, or even 4-year-long development hell?</h4>



<p>JR: If you don’t see the end, if you don’t see a good end, if you don’t know where it’s going to end up, but you have an idea for something else that you’re more excited about, it’s really hard advice, but I would like do the thing that you’re most interested in doing, even if you’ve spent that much time.</p>



<p>It’s going to show that it’s not this big inspired amazing thing because you wouldn’t be in that position if it was. So move on to the next thing as soon as you can. You’ve learned a lot. You’ve learned what happens when you have big ideas and they don’t turn out to be what you were hoping for.</p>



<p>Try to make something maybe more doable in a shorter span of time. Even if it’s mildly successful, you’ve learned something. Do another thing that’s a little bit bigger.</p>



<p>And it could be a sequel. It could be an offshoot. If it’s the kind of game that you like, but start small always and release something that’s interesting and then go up from there. Don’t ever start with something gigantic if you haven’t done it before, because you don’t know what’s going to happen if you’ve never done it before.</p>



<p>The bigger it is, the more off course you’re going to get. Just think about an angle where you’re trying to hit a mark years down the road. If it’s off by one degree, what’s it going to look like years later?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those errors will magnify over time. So you need to make sure that you make really good decisions at the very beginning and try to correct them as soon as you can.</p>



<p>As soon as you see something’s wrong, cut your losses as soon as you can. You have a certain amount of time. You only have so many games.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>CZ: Final question, what do you think about the term Boomer Shooter?</h4>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-28-1024x576.png" alt="" srcset="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-28-1024x576.png 1024w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-28-300x169.png 300w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-28-768x432.png 768w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-28.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The funny thing about boomers, it doesn’t even matter because for people who made up the term boomer shooter, anyone who’s old as a boomer, boomers are actually the kids of World War Two vets.</p>



<p>That’s my mom. My mom is 20 years older than I am. She’s actually a boomer. So, boomers are not typically developing games.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s funny. It’s a funny name. And I usually say it is a boomer shooter. It’s got a shotgun in it. It makes a big boom sound and you’re shooting. it doesn’t bug me. It’s really like you’re trying to nail the aesthetics of the style and that’s like that’s a phrase that kind of says what you need to know&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<h2>
To the BUG community:
</h2>

<p>
It is with a heavy heart that we are announcing Wednesday, September 27th as the date of <a href="https://www.meetup.com/b-u-g-boston-unity-group/events/296318684/?isFirstPublish=true">the final Boston Unity Group event</a>.
</p>

<p>
Founded in the summer of 2010 by Elliott Mitchell and Alex Schwartz, BUG was the first official Unity user group in the world. At that time the Unity game engine was still a relatively new technology that empowered creators with an accessible tool for shipping games on a variety of platforms. Over the last 13 years, BUG has hosted regular monthly meetups with networking events, technical lectures, panels, interviews, parties, demo nights, workshops and more. It's been a place for us to network, share our struggles, find and give help, and learn and grow together. The consistent growth of the BUG community spawned a new era of game development in Boston and beyond.
</p>

<p>
BUG's membership has grown from a few dozen to a few thousand, bringing together everyone from Boston's indies, hobbyists, AAA developers, AI researchers, museum exhibit designers, med-tech innovators, archeologists, automotive designers, software engineers, volumetric filmmakers, VR/XR game makers, educators and countless others. With growing membership our leadership team also grew. Jono Forbes, Graham Pentheny, and Chris Hart joined Elliott in organizing BUG's events and online presence. Unity lived up to its name, bringing together people with widely diverse backgrounds under a shared love for creating interactive technology.
</p>

<p>
From day one, BUG was enthusiastically sanctioned and supported by Unity and former CEO David Helgason. Unity provided logistical support, Pro license giveaways, workshops, presentations, sponsorships, speaking opportunities at Unite, and so much more. In those early days, David and Unity understood that fostering grassroots groups of independent developers was essential to planting the seeds of Unity's long-term growth and building toward their goal of democratizing game development for people from all walks of life.
</p>

<p>
We are immensely grateful to David and all the Unity employees who have given their time and effort to support BUG and the broader Unity community.
</p>

<p>
Over the past few years, Unity has unfortunately shifted its focus away from the games industry and away from supporting developer communities. Following the IPO, the company has seemingly put profit over all else, with several acquisitions and layoffs of core personnel. Many key systems that developers need are still left in a confusing and often incomplete state, with the messaging that advertising and revenue matter more to Unity than the functionality game developers care about.
</p>

<p>
Recently, Unity unveiled a set of unthinkably hostile terms of service and pricing changes for its users. The resounding, unequivocal condemnation from the games industry was unprecedented and Unity had no choice but to rescind some of the most egregious changes. Even with these new concessions, the revised pricing model disproportionately affects the success of indie studios in our community.
</p>

<p>
More importantly, we've seen how easily and flippantly an executive-led business decision can risk bankrupting the studios we've worked so hard to build, threaten our livelihoods as professionals, and challenge the longevity of our industry. The Unity of today isn't the same company that it was when the group was founded, and the trust we used to have in the company has been completely eroded. 
</p>

<p>
Since our launch in 2010, the focus of BUG has been first and foremost about supporting developers, not the Unity company. As members of the broader Boston game developer community, we feel our efforts as organizers would be better spent creating opportunities for everyone, not just Unity users. Please join us as we all work together in the larger local development community to continue to host events and presentations for all to enjoy.
</p>

<p>
We encourage our members to join the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/bostongamedev">Boston Game Dev meetup group</a> where they can continue to connect with local developers using Unity, Unreal, Godot and everything in between.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/bostonunitygroup">Boston Unity Group Youtube channel</a> will continue to host recordings of past events.
</p>

<p>
The final BUG meeting will be a social event next Wednesday, September 27th, held on Zoom. We'd like to take the opportunity to thank our community members for their contributions and active support, celebrate the last 13 years, and discuss Boston Game Dev and other groups our members can join to support their endeavors.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the day, it was the thousands of people - participants, speakers, and organizers - who made BUG what it was. As our communities and industry evolve, let's continue to support each other and find new ways to unite.
</p>

<p>
Much love,<br>
Elliott, Chris, and Graham<br>
<i>Boston Unity Group Organizers</i>
</p>

  <div>
    <p>	I just wanted to thank you for your knot (not something I'd ever thought I'd write in an email).</p>
    <p>	Many years back, I was referred to your site from some distant corner of the internet and discovered your “Ian Knot”.
	For the fun of it, I challenged myself to learn this and several other knots, which has been extremely useful more often than I'd have guessed.
	I greatly appreciate the effort you put into not only providing a nice collection of resources, but in making them easy to absorb through diagrams and descriptions.</p>
    <p>	I learned a collection of knots through scouting long ago, but as an avid hiker, the Ian Knot especially has saved time and shoelaces.
	I realized yesterday while teaching knots (including yours) to a group of kids that you may not always see your impact. I'm glad to see that your site it still up,</p>
    <p>	In short, thank you.</p>
    <p>	– Jeremy S., Aug-2023</p>

  <div>
    <p>	I hadn't been on the site for quite awhile but just picked up a new “used” pair of sneakers at our local thrift store; so I wanted to give them some groovy lacing method
	(as I do with every lace up shoes I have, since I found you) and I see the new flip option!! Oh how this will help me.
	I'm one of those who doesn't know right from left and up from down. So yeah 🎉😁 and Thanks.</p>
    <p>	P.S. because of you, I learned I had been trying my shoes wrong for over 50 years and never wore lace up athletic shoes
	because they constantly come untied and made the tops of my feet go numb...but now I've learned so much from your site! Thank you thank you thank you</p>
    <p>	– Krista E., Colorado, USA, Aug-2023</p>

  <div>
    <p>	First, a big thank you for the nice and useful website. Your shoelace instructions are clear and you present so many different lacing techniques.</p>
    <p>	– Stefan, Germany, Jul-2023</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>	I wanted to find out more about lacing shoes, when I chanced upon your web-site.
	I certainly found what I was looking for, and very pleasantly surprised at the wealth of lacing, and laces, information. It was clearly a labour of love.</p>
    <p>	On reading further, I was moved by how long that you've been doing this, the breadth of your efforts (including a book!), and the app tale of woe.
	Being a chap of a certain age myself (66), and of European extraction too (Switzerland), your tale resonated with me, and I could certainly sympathise.
	So, of course, I wanted to help,  hence the small donation.</p>
    <p>	– Maurice L., Switzerland, Jul-2023</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>	Your site's great; I've used your Mega Ian Shoelace Knot many times. I also use your site as a reference for other things, such as Over Under Lacing,
	whenever I'm too lazy to remember what the amount of eyelets on a given shoe means in terms of starting the lacing.</p>
    <p>	– Larry C., Jul-2023</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>	I use your Website regularly to pair my shoes with the fitting lacing to the style and fit of the shoe.</p>

You picked up the telephone and waited. After a brief chat with the operator she asked you who you wanted. Not a number or even a house; the <i>name</i> of the person. The response might be <tt>So-and-so? I just saw him go by so I’ll call him for you in twenty minutes when he gets to his office</tt>. Or maybe <tt>So-and-so? No, not today, lovie. He’s gone fishing</tt>.</blockquote><p>In 1973 a Business Line cost per month was <span id="q_uq3">£0.83</span> and a residential line per month was <span id="q_uq4">£0.67</span>. In <a href="http://sainthelenaisland.info/bluebook.htm" type="text/html" title="The ‘Blue Book’: The Annual Colonial Report">The ‘Blue Book’</a> for 1970/3 it is reported that:</p><blockquote>The telephone system now comprises some five route miles of multi-core cable supported on the electricity supply poles and some thirteen and a half route miles of open bare-wire lines on telephone poles. These figures exclude individual service lines. Service in Jamestown and in the adjacent country areas is given from the cable system and it is planned to replace, eventually, all open trunk lines by supported multi-core cables. The present Manual Exchange at <a href="http://sainthelenaisland.info/forts.htm#ladderhillfort" type="text/html" title="Ladder Hill Fort: Forts and Batteries: Defensive military installations">Ladder Hill Fort</a> has a capacity of 120 lines. This Exchange at present controls 65 subscribers on direct lines and 131 subscribers on party lines. There are 52 party lines. The Manual Exchange is very fully loaded and as a result development of the telephone service is restricted. There are at present 11 public telephones available, two in Jamestown and the remainder in the rural areas, from which some 1,400 calls are handled annually.</blockquote><p>The system remained manual until 1983. Due to the shortage of exchange lines, many people used a shared line (‘Party Line’) and there was an ingenious system for the parties to know for whom was an incoming call: one ring for party 1; two rings for party 2; etc., sometimes with as many as five parties sharing a line. The potential for error was immense! This ended when the island’s first automated telephone exchange was commissioned on 16<samp>th</samp>&nbsp;April 1983 at an installation cost of <span id="q_uq5">£100,000</span>. At commissioning the system had 488 active telephones (and a capacity for 600) with three-digit telephone numbers. <a href="http://sainthelenaisland.info/governor.htm#gov059" type="text/html" title="John Dudley Massingham: The Governor of St&nbsp;Helena: The Crown’s representative">Governor Massingham</a> made the first automatically-handled telephone call to George Stevens, Manager of the Government Telephone System.

At this time the three-digit numbers were changed to four digits by adding a 2 for <a href="http://sainthelenaisland.info/jamestown.htm" type="text/html" title="Jamestown: The city where it all happens">Jamestown</a> numbers, a 3 for <a href="http://sainthelenaisland.info/halftreehollow.htm" type="text/html" title="Half Tree Hollow: Home on the hill">Half Tree Hollow</a> and 4 for everywhere else.

From that date they all became five-digit by adding a 2 to the front (thus losing the regionalisation created in 1990).

CS Anglia and CS Britannia carried out this work. To provide an alternative route in case of cable failure another cable laid by CS Anglia in the same year was that from Ascension to Freetown, Sierra Leone, a distance of <ins title="1,125 nm, 1,295 miles">2,085Km</ins>.</p><p>In 1902 the final link in the global network of cables owned and operated by British companies was made with the laying of the Pacific cable from Canada to Australia. The Pacific Cable, jointly owned by the British Government and the Governments of Canada, Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, New Zealand, Tasmania and Western Australia in a unique partnership arrangement was, <tt>effected in obedience to the strong desire of the people of the wide-spread British Empire to utilize electricity for the accomplishment of Imperial consolidation</tt>, and to ensure that ‘The All Red Line’ touched only the territories of the British Empire.</p><p>Some parts of the line had been completed considerably earlier. In 1866, the Great Eastern connected Ireland to Newfoundland, by 1870 Suez was linked to Bombay and from there to Madras, Penang and Singapore. Australia was linked to British telegraph cables directly in 1870, by extending a line from Singapore to Port Darwin and by 1872, messages could be sent direct from London to Sydney.</p><p>To complete the network, the final major cable laying project was the trans-Pacific section. The route selected was Bamfield, Vancouver Island - Fanning Island - Fiji - Norfolk Island. From Norfolk Island, two cables would be laid, one to Southport, Queensland, with a landline to Sydney, while the other would land at Doubtless Bay, Auckland and in total <ins title="7,837 nm, 9,000 miles">14,500Km</ins> of cable would be required.</p><p>It was decided to lay the Bamfield-Fanning Island section in one continuous length. At the time no cable ship existed that could carry the cable to do this, so the Telegraph Construction &amp; Maintenance Company had CS Colonia built. Laying of the <ins title="3,459 nm, 4,000 mile">6,400Km</ins> long cable began at Bamfield on 18<samp>th</samp>&nbsp;September 1902, reaching Fanning Island on 6<samp>th</samp>&nbsp;October. Fanning Island had been formally annexed to Great Britain in 1888.</p><p>The CS Anglia which had been used to connect Cape Town and St&nbsp;Helena then laid all the sections from Fanning Island to Australia and New Zealand during 1902.</p><p>The ‘All Red Line’ was inaugurated on 31<samp>st</samp>&nbsp;October 1902 and the Imperial Defence Committee was able to report to the British Government, <tt>The dependence of the United Kingdom on cable stations situated upon foreign territory has been generally eliminated.</tt></p><p>Britain dominated the international cable networks and no other country possessed such an extensive network. In 1896 there were 30 cable-laying ships in the world, 24 of them owned by British companies.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-element="story-body" data-subscriber-content=""> <p>Inside the row of workshops in an industrial stretch of Pacoima, men labored over hefty slabs of speckled stone, saws whining over the sounds of Spanish-language rock.</p><p>Pale dust rose around them as they worked. Many went without masks. Some had water spurting from their machines, but others had nothing to tamp down the powder rising in the air. </p><p>“Nobody uses water,” one man in a Dodgers cap said in Spanish when Maria Cabrera approached, holding flyers about silicosis, an incurable and suffocating disease that has devastated dozens of workers across the state and killed men who have barely reached middle age. </p><p>Cabrera, a community outreach worker with the nonprofit Pacoima Beautiful, urged him and others at the Branford Street site to try to protect themselves. Silicosis can ravage<b> </b>the lungs of  workers after they inhale tiny particles of crystalline silica while they cut and grind stone that contains the mineral. </p><p>The disease dates back centuries, but researchers say the booming popularity of countertops made of engineered stone, which has much <a href="https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/OSHA3768.pdf" target="_blank">higher concentrations of silica</a> than many kinds of natural stone, has driven a new epidemic of an accelerated form of the suffocating illness. As the dangerous dust builds up and scars the lungs, the disease can leave workers short of breath, weakened and ultimately suffering from lung failure. </p><p>“You can get a transplant,” Cabrera told the man in Spanish, “but it won’t last.”</p><p>In California, it has begun to debilitate young workers, largely Latino immigrants who cut and polish slabs of engineered stone. Instead of cropping up in people in their 60s or 70s after decades of exposure, it is now afflicting men in their 20s, 30s or 40s, said Dr. Jane Fazio, a pulmonary critical care physician who became alarmed by cases she saw at Olive View-UCLA Medical Center. Some California patients have <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6838a1.htm" target="_blank">died in their 30s</a>.</p><p>“They’re young guys who essentially have a terminal diagnosis,” Fazio said.</p><p>In Pacoima, a 27-year-old father said he now has to hustle home from the park with his 8-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son because his oxygen tank starts to run out as they play. Leobardo Segura Meza said he could no longer run around on the soccer field or exercise the way he used to. </p><p>Nor is he able to work. For a decade, he made a living by cutting, polishing and installing countertops in and around Los Angeles County. Dust was everywhere, he said, and he was given only a dust mask — one he said was inadequate for the job — to protect himself. Sometimes he brought a hose and tried to attach it to the machine to reduce dust, but there were no machines dispensing water as they were cutting, he said.</p><p>He began to suffer a cough that wouldn’t go away and lost his breath when going up stairs, he said. His weight dropped. At one point, he was hospitalized when one of his lungs collapsed. </p><p>Segura Meza had never heard of silicosis before he was diagnosed. “There’s no cure for this illness.

In California, workplace safety regulators have <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/oshsb/documents/petition-597-CalOSHAeval.pdf" target="_blank">estimated</a> that out of roughly 4,000 workers in the industry across the state, silicosis will afflict between 485 and 848  — and that as many as 161 could ultimately die.</p><p>A recent <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2807615" target="_blank">study</a> by UCLA and UCSF physicians found that among dozens of California workers who got silicosis from grinding countertops, nearly a fifth had died. Their median age at death was 46. More than half had suffered delays in getting diagnosed, as the disease was mistaken for bacterial pneumonia or tuberculosis, and over a third already had severe scarring in their lungs when they were diagnosed.</p><p>Los Angeles County has been an epicenter of the debilitating disease, with 60 out of the 83 cases among countertop workers identified across the state since 2019 by the California Department of Public Health. </p><p>The San Fernando Valley is a hub for the stone “fabrication” industry — those who cut and polish the slabs made by manufacturers — and county officials also said that growing awareness spurred by Fazio and others may have resulted in better reporting of such cases in L.A. In July, the state sent out an advisory to healthcare providers about the threat, recommending that physicians ask  if ailing patients have worked as countertop cutters and urging them to report any identified cases of silicosis to the state.</p><p>California workplace safety regulators are now drafting emergency rules to try to protect workers as engineered stone has come to dominate the countertop industry. The material is also sometimes called artificial or synthetic stone, made with crushed quartz bound together with resin. L.A. County is exploring whether to go further and ban the sale and installation of “silica engineered stone” entirely.</p><p>Existing safety standards must be followed, but “we feel that there need to be additional changes to the standards to make it even more safe in the workplace,” said Dr. Nichole Quick, deputy director of health protection with the L.A. County public health department. </p><p>The county department is now preparing a report requested by county supervisors on<b> </b>options for<b> </b>a potential ban, as well as other possible steps. It has also partnered with Pacoima Beautiful to provide outreach. “This is a preventable disease,” Quick said, “and we want to take appropriate action to make these workplaces safer.”</p><p>One question before the county — and government regulators across the globe — is whether any safeguards will effectively protect workers grinding materials so high in silica. The Agglomerated Stone Manufacturers Assn., an international group representing manufacturers of engineered stone, <a href="https://www.astaworldwide.com/general-statement-engineered-stone-manufacturers-association-a-st-a-world-wide/" target="_blank">maintains</a> its products can be cut “with no safety issues or health hazards if it is performed according to the best practices.” </p><p>In a statement, the association said the risk lies not with engineered stone itself, but poor adherence to safety measures by fabricators, arguing that safety regulations need to be “simplified and rigorously enforced.” Members of the Stone Coalition, which represents fabricators as well as manufacturers, said an L.A. County ban would have “severe economic consequences” and argued for additional enforcement and training on workplace safety, especially efforts to eliminate “dry cutting.” </p><p>And the Los Angeles County Business Federation contended that enforcing safety regulations “will do more to prevent disease, while not adversely [affecting]  the cost of construction at a time when Los Angeles is seeing a devastating housing crisis.”</p><p>But Raphael Metzger, a Long Beach attorney who represents Segura Meza and other workers suing manufacturers of engineered stone such as Cambria and Caesarstone for damages, argued that typical respirators and other standard measures don’t go far enough. Even with many “wet methods,” workers can be exposed to dangerous levels of silica and need additional protection, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/surveyreports/pdfs/2021-DFSE-710.pdf?id=10.26616/NIOSHEPHB2021DFSE710" target="_blank">NIOSH research</a> has found. </p><p>Nearly half of the workers suffering silicosis in the UCLA and UCSF study said their workplaces were using water to control dust. Roughly a quarter said they always had respiratory protection. Fazio said studies have found that in many shops, dust is so thick in the air that respirators cannot filter out a sufficient amount.</p><p>Metzger argued that the kind of sophisticated and costly measures that would be needed to reliably protect workers cutting engineered stone are not economically plausible in an industry where immigrant workers typically labor in small shops and are often paid in cash. Engineered stone “is too dangerous to be used safely,” he said. “If there’s any industrial product that should be banned, this is the product.”</p><p>Segura Meza agreed, calling it “very deadly.” Vasquez, with Pacoima Beautiful, said that when she and Cabrera started talking to workers about engineered stone and silicosis, many of them asked, “How come they don’t do anything with the stores that sell the products?”</p><p>In Australia, where the government is <a href="https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/media-centre/news/closing-soon-consultation-prohibition-use-engineered-stone" target="_blank">weighing whether to ban</a> engineered stone, a professional group whose members assess worker health hazards concluded that the high concentration of silica in engineered stone makes it difficult for measures such as wet cutting and ventilation to adequately protect workers.</p><p>Additional measures for respiratory protection are needed, but such systems “have largely been absent from this sector,” the Australian Institute of Occupational Hygienists wrote. In light of those concerns, it <a href="https://www.aioh.org.au/product/consultation-on-the-prohibition-on-the-use-of-engineered-stone/" target="_blank">recommended</a> prohibiting engineered stone containing more than 10% crystalline silica, but said it would also support banning all engineered stone because of the rigorous compliance needed even at a 10% level.</p><p>In California, existing rules to protect workers have often not been followed, state regulators found. Cal/OSHA, which is now hustling to draft emergency standards to protect California workers in the stone cutting and polishing industry, found rampant violations of the current standards when it looked closer in 2019 and 2020. </p><p>Despite the rise of the deadly disease, homeowners and other consumers shopping for countertops know little about the threat it could pose to the workers behind the surfaces in their kitchens and bathrooms, Fazio said. Engineered stone is now estimated to represent more than 60% of materials used for countertops, the L.A. County business federation said, and market researchers say its popularity is <a href="https://www.freedoniagroup.com/industry-study/engineered-stone-countertops-4395.htm" target="_blank">only expected to rise</a>.</p><p>Engineered stone “is everywhere and people have no idea,” Fazio said. Consumers “have a right to know that the countertop that might be the cheapest one ... may really be costing folks’ lives.”</p> </div></div>]]></description>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apache_Software_Foundation">The Apache Software Foundation</a>
offers a suite of office productivity software named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Open_Office">Apache Open Office</a>.
Based on the <a href="https://www.openoffice.org/download/">download page</a>, you would
never guess the last major release of the software was made available in 2014.</p>
<p>With that bit of release history in mind, would it be fair to consider Apache
Open Office as an un-maintained project? In this blog post, I share a quick
recap of the history behind Apache Open Office, and my opinion on why The
Apache Software Foundation’s actions may be masking the answer to this question.</p>
<h2 id="in-the-beginning-staroffice-was-created">In the beginning, StarOffice was created</h2>
<p>A proprietary office suite was developed in 1985 by a company named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Division">Star Division</a>,
aptly named StarOffice.</p>
<h2 id="the-sun-shined-and-openofficeorg-was-released">The SUN shined, and OpenOffice.org was released</h2>
<p>In the year 2000, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems">Sun Microsystems</a>
released the source code of StarOffice for free. This resulted in the first
release of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenOffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a> the following year.</p>
<h2 id="libreoffice-joins-the-party">LibreOffice joins the party</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice">LibreOffice</a> was first released in
2010 based on the OpenOffice.org source code. LibreOffice is actively
maintained by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Document_Foundation">The Document Foundation</a>,
a non-profit created by members of the OpenOffice.org community for the express
purpose of managing and developing LibreOffice.</p>
<h2 id="oracle-gives-openofficeorg-to-the-apache-software-foundation">Oracle gives OpenOffice.org to The Apache Software Foundation</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation">Oracle</a>, having acquired Sun
Microsystems in 2010, now owned the OpenOffice.org trademarks. The year
following the acquisition, Oracle provided the OpenOffice.org trademarks
and any related Oracle-owned code to The Apache Software Foundation in 2011.
This resulted in the creation of Apache Open Office.</p>
<h2 id="apache-open-office-dies-and-refuses-to-leave">Apache Open Office dies, and refuses to leave</h2>
<p>Between its first release with version 3.4 in 2012, and its last major release
with version 4.1 in 2014, Apache Open Office integrated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Lotus_Symphony">IBM Lotus Symphony</a>,
after it was donated to The Apache Software Foundation, added a reworked sidebar
and some other new features, as documented in the <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOOUSERS/AOO+4.1+Release+Notes">4.1 release notes</a>.</p>
<p>Since 2014… Bug fixes, dictionary updates, bug fixes, dictionary updates,
whitespace “fixes”, dictionary updates, dictionary updates and <strong>did I
mention dictionary updates</strong>!?</p>
<h2 id="things-start-to-get-weird">Things start to get weird</h2>
<p>You might want to sit down before opening the next link. Take a look at the
<a href="https://github.com/apache/openoffice/commits/trunk">apache/openoffice</a> commits
made over the last several years.</p>
<p>What do we find? A lot of commits that don’t actually amount to much at all.
In many cases, the commits <strong>don’t even make any change to the program</strong>,
because they are only changing the blank space that surrounds the source code.</p>
<p>Why would someone do this? Two possible reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are legitimate whitespace issues that need to be addressed.</li>
<li>There is an incentive to make a project appear as though it were active, when it is actually inactive.</li>
</ol>
<p>While the first is fair to assume in most cases, when we look at the list of
commits made to the repository, we find that whitespace changes are not just
part of the commits that Apache Open Office has been receiving, whitespace
changes make up a substantial amount of the commits added to the repository.</p>
<p>Projects become unmaintained every day. This is a fact of life, and is not the
issue I am taking with The Apache Software Foundation. It is the way the
foundation, and its contributors, do not disclose information relating to the
lack of substantial updates or changes for nearly a decade, and seems to
intentionally mask the lack of development.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-can-do-about-it">What we can do about it</h2>
<p>We can tell The Apache Software Foundation that we, as a community of users, do
not support the foundation’s actions in regard to their management of Apache
Open Office. If this blog post motivated you, send an email to <a href="mailto:apache@apache.org">apache@apache.org</a>
saying something along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>Apache Open Office has not received substantial updates nor changes in nearly
a decade, yet there is no mention of this anywhere on the download page. In
the best interest of the community, please consider mentioning this
information, as well as providing a link for users to download other actively
maintained office software.</p>
<p>The Apache Open Office GitHub repository receives regular commits, but these
changes seem to largely be whitespace-only. This gives the impression that
the repository is more active than it really is, as non-substantial changes
seem to make up a large number of the commits added. Please archive the
repository if active development has ceased.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>R</span><span>achel Nuwer’s</span> “<a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/i-feel-love-9781635579581/">I Feel Love: MDMA and the Quest for Connection in a Fractured World</a>,” is clearly aimed at a broad audience. It will resonate with readers who have experienced MDMA recreationally, probably at a rave, or therapeutically, probably to heal the emotional aftereffects of deep-seated trauma. Or both. But it’s also intended for readers who have never touched the drug, colloquially known as ecstasy or molly. Perhaps it’s <em>especially </em>for them.</p>



<p>“I Feel Love” belongs to a growing family of nonfiction accounts of the fraught history of psychedelics and why, through compelling anecdotes and the latest science, we should reconsider them. Nuwer, a science journalist, chronicles the hopeful story of something both small and large — MDMA, the compound, and MDMA, the drug that’s repeatedly brought humans together across decades, continents, politics, and moral panics. The book is a natural successor to Michael Pollan’s 2018 bestseller “<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/529343/how-to-change-your-mind-by-michael-pollan/">How to Change Your Mind</a>,” which covered the mystical and medical benefits of LSD and psilocybin, and paved the way for a psychedelic renaissance of sorts, Nuwer writes in the introduction, “no such modern telling exists for MDMA.”</p>

<p>Now, it does. “I Feel Love” is, above all, a time capsule. Nuwer begins with a crucial asterisk: “MDMA, also known as Ecstasy or Molly, is currently an illegal drug.” Today, most journalism around psychedelics is stipulated with this simple fact. Despite their potential to heal, drugs like psilocybin, LSD, and MDMA are still classified as Schedule I, the Drug Enforcement Administration’s highest category for controlled substances with no medical use, with a high potential for abuse. For MDMA specifically, that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/14/health/mdma-ptsd-psychedelics.html">might be</a> about to change.</p>



<p>A team of researchers that included MAPS Public Benefit Corporation — a company developing prescription psychedelics that arose from the nonprofit Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, or MAPS, which has been advocating for the legalization of <a href="https://undark.org/2023/08/23/can-mdma-therapy-ease-the-worlds-traumas-critics-arent-sure/">MDMA-assisted therapy</a> since 1986 — published a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02565-4">study</a> on MDMA earlier this month. In it, the researchers suggest that MDMA-assisted therapy is an effective approach for reducing post-traumatic stress disorder. The company plans to submit the results to the Food and Drug Administration, meaning that MDMA, when paired with talk therapy, could potentially be FDA-approved as a treatment for PTSD as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02886-x">early as next year</a>.</p>



<p>In many ways, these recent developments feel like the appropriate ending to “I Feel Love.” “Seemingly overnight, MDMA-assisted therapy has emerged in the popular imagination as a miracle cure for otherwise intractable cases of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in combat veterans, survivors of sexual violence and childhood abuse, and others haunted by past pain,” Nuwer writes.</p>



<p>I’ve found that to be the case in my own reporting — former cult members and sexual assault survivors have told me, with fervor, that MDMA was<em> the thing </em>that healed their trauma. But through meticulous research, Nuwer demonstrates that the therapeutic potential of MDMA wasn’t, in fact, an overnight sensation.</p>



<p>Her sharp retelling of MDMA’s history takes readers from Germany in 1912, where Merck first synthesized the drug, to the United States, when the Army briefly considered it for controversial research into a truth serum. In one fascinating tangent, Nuwer quotes one of her many sources, Nicholas Denomme, now a postdoctoral scholar in psychiatry at Stanford University, who notes that “it would be mind-blowing to know” that a drug that’s poised to be approved by the FDA for the treatment of PTSD in vets was originally used unethically by the military over 70 years ago.</p>

</div>


<p>From there, Nuwer chronicles MDMA’s unfurling as a party drug, with ecstasy displacing cocaine as the drug of choice on the dance floor. In the early 1980s, MDMA meccas unfurled in Dallas, Texas, where the drug brought together a “level of diversity seen nowhere else in the Bible Belt.” By the late 1980s, it was in use throughout the U.K., where it allegedly reduced violence at football matches; it also exploded onto the Dutch party scene, and quickly after, made its way to in Berlin. Today, of course, molly — MDMA’s modern moniker and a nickname for “molecule” —&nbsp;powers music festivals around the world.</p>



<p>While most of the recent science around MDMA focuses on its therapeutic benefits — for <a href="https://undark.org/2023/08/23/can-mdma-therapy-ease-the-worlds-traumas-critics-arent-sure/">PTSD,</a> addiction, depression, anorexia, social anxiety in autistic adults, and traumatic brain injuries, for example — Nuwer shrewdly points out that relatively little research has been directed toward MDMA’s recreational use. “The largest single population of Ecstasy users is probably still young people in music-focused environments, and for many of them, these are among their most treasured and beautiful life experiences,” says Kevin Balktick, the founder of <a href="https://www.horizonspbc.com/">Horizons</a>, an organization that runs a large annual psychedelic conference.</p>



<p>Those treasured and beautiful life experiences are recorded across a spectrum of characters throughout the book. A DJ describes the feeling MDMA invokes as “almost like a religious experience,” one where ecstasy tablets become sacrament. A Vietnam veteran remembers it as an “electric shock to the system.”</p>



<p>A couple in their 70s, who have done MDMA dozens of times, say it’s the “antidote to feeling old: we become ageless for a day.” My favorite descriptor is one Nuwer offers from a friend: “What the rush of joy, elation, and love would feel like if you were suddenly reunited with a good friend you hadn’t seen in years, and you stayed up all night talking because you were so happy to see each other.” (It’s funny; The first time I personally took molly, with a close girlfriend, we were locked in conversation for hours, giggling until the sun came up.)</p>



<p>At several points throughout the book, it starts to feel as if MDMA can do it all. Through Nuwer’s interviews with scientists and activists, we learn that MDMA can solve marital problems, help cancer patients cope with their realities, save years of therapy, and all but eradicate negative emotions. But Nuwer is careful to cut through those shaky claims with breakneck precision, providing an important bulwark against casual hype.</p>

</div>


<p>Nuwer argues throughout the book that the most common effect of MDMA is imparting a feeling of connection. Perhaps MDMA is simply a lens through which to look at human behavior, as it mirrors our innate desire to tinker with consciousness. “Because our tendency to seek out consciousness-altering experiences has withstood the selective pressures of evolution, scientists surmise that there must be benefits,” she writes. “Some of these benefits probably relate to survival: caffeine to keep us alert and enhance our abilities, opium to relieve pain, alcohol to bring us together.”</p>



<p>“But,” she continues, “evidence also indicates that our use of psychoactive substances has shaped us in subtler but perhaps equally powerful ways, by helping mold the customs, beliefs, and traditions that have made our species what it is today.”</p>



<p>Will MDMA save the world? Nuwer denounces that idea in her introduction and repeats the sentiment in many corners of the book. Instead, “I Feel Love” offers a foundation of knowledge that’s perhaps needed to push MDMA to the forefront of mental health through a nonalarmist, honest perspective.</p>



<p>From there, Nuwer lightly suggests that MDMA might potentially be a solvent for the drivers of loneliness and disconnection — caused by the pandemic, our ever-widening political divide, and the isolation of social media — on the individual level. Either way, you may well be tempted to take MDMA immediately after reading this book.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecraft_Wiki:Moving_from_Fandom">https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecraft_Wiki:Moving_from_Fandom</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37644047">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>After <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecraft_Wiki:Moving_from_Fandom/First_discussion" title="Minecraft Wiki:Moving from Fandom/First discussion">several</a> <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecraft_Wiki:Moving_from_Fandom/Second_discussion" title="Minecraft Wiki:Moving from Fandom/Second discussion">discussions</a>, we are excited to announce that the Minecraft Wiki has now moved from Fandom to <b>minecraft.wiki</b> – all of the information about the game can now be found at the new location!
</p><p><br>
By moving to a new place, we are able to bring lots of improvements to the wiki. For example, here are some changes you’ll find when visiting the new wiki!
</p>
<dl><dt>A new skin!</dt>
<dd>No more ugly yellow sidebar! We’ve designed a familiar yet fresh look to the wiki to make it really pop. There’s also a dark mode option (located in the top-right corner of the webpage) and a fixed width option (currently just for logged-in users under “gadgets” in your user settings). We also have a new logo to celebrate!</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Faster load times!</dt>
<dd>Our new host has better built out infrastructure that makes the site load <i>significantly</i> faster than Fandom, especially in different parts of the world and with slower internet connections. This is also thanks to a cleaner website interface that doesn’t require as many resources as the Fandom website does with all its additional non-wiki features.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Fewer ads!</dt>
<dd>The new site won’t have popups, quizzes, unrelated articles or videos ads; only one ad at most will show up per page.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Note that for the moment, there will not be any ads at all as we still work on getting the ad infrastructure fully set up. We will make sure to notify the wiki community and be as transparent as possible about the placement and selection of the ad.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Improved search functionality!</dt>
<dd>You might have noticed that the search results on Fandom are often less than ideal. With our move away from Fandom we’re now able to use a much more powerful and user-friendly search engine again. For example, try to find out which Java snapshot armor trims were added in by searching for “armor trim snapshot”.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>No more age popup!</dt>
<dd>Unlike Fandom, we won’t be forcing you to tell us if you’re a child or an adult.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Anonymous editing is back!</dt>
<dd>You will no longer need to create an account to help improve the wiki.</dd></dl>
<h2><span id="We_need_your_help!">We need your help!</span></h2>
<p>Unfortunately, because Fandom does not close wikis that have moved away, the old Fandom wiki will remain in place and continue to appear in search results. The old domains “minecraft.gamepedia.com” and “minecraftwiki.net” will still redirect to the Fandom wiki as well.
</p><p>As such, for the new wiki to be successful, we need your help! Here are a few ways you can help out:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Spread the word!</b> Tell your friends that we’ve moved to a new place!</li>
<li><b>Don’t click on Fandom links.</b> In search results, always pick <b>minecraft.wiki</b> links instead of Fandom ones. This tells Google and other search engines which site is better for users.</li>
<li><b>Don't use the old domains.</b> Change any existing “minecraftwiki.net”, “minecraft.gamepedia.com”, or “minecraft.fandom.com” links to <b>minecraft.wiki</b> – this helps us become more established and show up higher in search results.</li>
<li><b>Help improve the wiki!</b> At the new wiki, you don’t even have to create an account to make edits! Need help with editing? Come join our <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href="https://discord.com/invite/fGdE5ZE">Discord server</a> and ask some questions, or check out <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecraft_Wiki:How_to_help" title="Minecraft Wiki:How to help">this help page</a>.</li></ul>
<p>You can also try out the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href="https://getindie.wiki/">Indie Wiki Buddy</a> browser extension, which will redirect you there automatically, as well as hide the Fandom wiki on Google and other search engines.
</p>
<h2><span id="Migrating_Gamepedia/Fandom_accounts_to_the_new_wiki">Migrating Gamepedia/Fandom accounts to the new wiki</span></h2>
<p>If you’d like to migrate your account to the new wiki, go to <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Special:MigrateUserAccount" title="Special:MigrateUserAccount">this page</a> and follow the steps there. You’ll be prompted to input your name and verify your identity on the Fandom wiki. It should only take a few minutes.
</p><p>All of your previous contributions will be kept when you migrate your account. However your user preferences (including email and talk page signature) unfortunately cannot be transferred and you will need to set them again.
</p><p>In case you have issues with this, please let us know on our <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href="https://discord.com/invite/fGdE5ZE">Discord server</a>.
</p>
<h2><span id="Who_is_hosting_the_new_wiki?">Who is hosting the new wiki?</span></h2>
<p>The new Minecraft Wiki will be hosted by <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href="https://weirdgloop.org/">Weird Gloop</a>, the company that hosts the <a href="https://runescape.wiki/">RuneScape wikis</a>. There are a number of reasons why it was chosen as a host, which you can read about on the discussion page <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecraft_Wiki:Moving_from_Fandom/Second_discussion" title="Minecraft Wiki:Moving from Fandom/Second discussion">here</a>.
</p><p>The long and short of it is that our new host has a minimal amount of ads, a strong set of technical infrastructure, lots of transparency, and a strong track record regarding the SEO competition with Fandom for page ranking. Weird Gloop offers us the autonomy we would get from hosting the wiki ourselves, but they also have the experience and expertise needed to set up and maintain the infrastructure behind the wiki, which we do not have ourselves.
</p>
<h2><span id="What_about_the_non-English_wikis?">What about the non-English wikis?</span></h2>
<p>For the moment, only the English Minecraft Wiki has moved away from Fandom. While we are fortunate enough to be able to move, we also understand that not all language wikis are able to or wish to move as well.
</p><p>Some non-English wikis are also planning to move to the new location in the future. However, others have decided to stay at Fandom for now, or are still discussing whether they want to move or not. You can find out what the current position of each wiki is by checking out their respective community portals and/or Discord servers.
</p><p>To all the community, please respect the decisions of those who choose to stay, as we are all still a part of the Minecraft community!
</p>
<h2><span id="Comments_and_discussion">Comments and discussion</span></h2>
<p>If you have any further questions or comments, feel free to put them on the <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecraft_Wiki_talk:Moving_from_Fandom" title="Minecraft Wiki talk:Moving from Fandom">discussion page</a>!

<p dir="auto">KitForStartups is still in the early stages of development. Here is a list of features that we plan to add in the very near future:</p>
<ul>
<li> PostgreSQL support</li>
<li> Proper error handling on the client with toast notifications</li>
<li> A central configuration file for the app</li>

<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-life-dashboard" dir="auto"><a href="#life-dashboard">Life Dashboard</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">Low power, heads up display for every day life running on a Kindle.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-details" dir="auto"><a href="#details">Details</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">Second hand Kindles are waiting in drawers for someone to repurpose them into something great. Boasting large e-ink screens, wifi connectivity and ARM processors they are an amazing hacking platform.</p>
<p dir="auto">(This is the second version of this project, see the post about the original <a href="https://www.davidhampgonsalves.com/life-dashboard/" rel="nofollow">here</a>)</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-v2-rewrite-and-compromises" dir="auto"><a href="#v2-rewrite-and-compromises">V2 Rewrite and Compromises</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">Ideally this dashboard would generate and display its image on its own. The issue with doing this originally was that the Kindles ability to display images (via eips) requires they be in a strange format. A few yars back when I started this it was hard to get GoLang to generate this format but it was easy to cross compile GoLang to the target ARM-7 softfloat arch. On the other hand Rust could generate the image but it was a pain to setup the cross compiler toolchain (also connecting to Google API's wasn't well supported).</p>
<p dir="auto">In the 5 years that followed the dashboard was a great tool but as API services would die (Magicseaweed, Forecast.io, DarkSky, etc) it would break. Sometimes that would require changes to the Rust front end and I would have to setup the cross compiling toolchain on each new machine I was using and eventually this got annoying.</p>
<p dir="auto">I found out about <a href="https://github.com/NiLuJe/FBInk">FBInk</a> which has Go bindings and decided that using that I could use it to do text layout and print the resulting PNG's to the screen. Unfortunately I found that GoLangs OpenFont lib crashes when run on the kindle and that these old arm archetectures aren't well supported. This seemed like an unstable footing to build on.</p>
<p dir="auto">This led me to my current compromise. I use FBInk on the kindle to display the images after curling them from a API Gateway/Lambda backend. This gives me a low friction way to update the API logic without needing to touch the kindle or cross compile anything. I also was able to use GoLangs <a href="https://github.com/tdewolff/canvas/">tdewolff/canvas</a> which provides nice text setting and image generation tooling. I think is the right balance to keep this device productive for another 5+ years.</p>

<blockquote><p>It began tamely. Someone turned her around. Someone thrust her arms into the air. Someone touched her somewhat intimately. The Neapolitan night began to heat up. In the third hour all her clothes were cut from her with razor blades. In the fourth hour the same blades began to explore her skin. Her throat was slashed so <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_vampirism" title="Clinical vampirism">someone could suck her blood</a>. Various minor sexual assaults were carried out on her body. She was so committed to the piece that she would not have resisted rape or murder. Faced with her abdication of will, with its implied collapse of human psychology, a protective group began to define itself in the audience. When a loaded gun was thrust to Marina's head and her own finger was being worked around the trigger, a fight broke out between the audience factions."<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>As Abramović described it later: "What I learned was that ... if you leave it up to the audience, they can kill you ... I felt really violated: they cut up my clothes, stuck rose thorns in my stomach, one person aimed the gun at my head, and another took it away. It created an aggressive atmosphere. After exactly 6 hours, as planned, I stood up and started walking toward the audience. Everyone ran away, to escape an actual confrontation."<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><!--[--><!--[--><div><p>We are beginning to roll out new voice and image capabilities in ChatGPT. They offer a new, more intuitive type of interface by allowing you to have a voice conversation or show ChatGPT what you’re talking about.</p><p>Voice and image give you more ways to use ChatGPT in your life. Snap a picture of a landmark while traveling and have a live conversation about what’s interesting about it. When you’re home, snap pictures of your fridge and pantry to figure out what’s for dinner (and ask follow up questions for a step by step recipe). After dinner, help your child with a math problem by taking a photo, circling the problem set, and having it share hints with both of you.</p><p>We’re rolling out voice and images in ChatGPT to Plus and Enterprise users over the next two weeks. Voice is coming on iOS and Android (opt-in in your settings) and images will be available on all platforms.<br></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div id="speak-with-chatgpt-and-have-it-talk-back" data-heading=""><p><h2>Speak with ChatGPT and have it talk back</h2></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>You can now use voice to engage in a back-and-forth conversation with your assistant.

Then, tap the headphone button located in the top-right corner of the home screen and choose your preferred voice out of five different voices.</p><p>The new voice capability is powered by a new text-to-speech model, capable of generating human-like audio from just text and a few seconds of sample speech. We collaborated with professional voice actors to create each of the voices. We also use Whisper, our open-source speech recognition system, to transcribe your spoken words into text.<br></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><h2>Listen to voice samples</h2><p><label><span>Select text</span></label></p><blockquote><p><span>Once in a tranquil woodland, there was a fluffy mama cat named Lila. One sunny day, she cuddled with her playful kitten, Milo, under the shade of an old oak tree.<p>“Milo,” Lila began, her voice soft and gentle, “you’re going to have a new playmate soon.”</p><p>Milo’s ears perked up, curious. “A new playmate?”</p><p>Lila purred, “Yes, a baby sister.”</p><p>Milo’s eyes widened with excitement. “A sister? Will she chase tails like I do?”</p><p>Lila chuckled. “Oh, she’ll have her own quirks. You’ll teach her, won’t you?”</p><p>Milo nodded eagerly, already dreaming of the adventures they’d share.</p></span></p></blockquote><p><label><span>Select voice</span></label><audio src="https://cdn.openai.com/new-voice-and-image-capabilities-in-chatgpt/story-juniper.mp3" controls=""></audio></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div id="chat-about-images" data-heading=""><p><h2>Chat about images</h2></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>You can now show ChatGPT one or more images. Troubleshoot why your grill won’t start, explore the contents of your fridge to plan a meal, or analyze a complex graph for work-related data. To focus on a specific part of the image, you can use the drawing tool in our mobile app.<br></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div id="chat-about-images"><p>Show ChatGPT one or more images.<br></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>To get started, tap the photo button to capture or choose an image. If you’re on iOS or Android, tap the plus button first. You can also discuss multiple images or use our drawing tool to guide your assistant.</p><p>Image understanding is powered by multimodal GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. These models apply their language reasoning skills to a wide range of images, such as photographs, screenshots, and documents containing both text and images.<br></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div id="we-are-deploying-image-and-voice-capabilities-gradually" data-heading=""><p><h2>We are deploying image and voice capabilities gradually</h2></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>OpenAI’s goal is to build AGI that is safe and beneficial. We believe in making our tools available gradually, which allows us to make improvements and refine risk mitigations over time while also preparing everyone for more powerful systems in the future. This strategy becomes even more important with advanced models involving voice and vision.<br></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div id="voice" data-heading=""><p><h3>Voice</h3></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>The new voice technology—capable of crafting realistic synthetic voices from just a few seconds of real speech—opens doors to many creative and accessibility-focused applications. However, these capabilities also present new risks, such as the potential for malicious actors to impersonate public figures or commit fraud.</p><p>This is why we are using this technology to power a specific use case—voice chat. Voice chat was created with voice actors we have directly worked with. We’re also collaborating in a similar way with others. For example, Spotify is using the power of this technology for the pilot of their <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-09-25/ai-voice-translation-pilot-lex-fridman-dax-shepard-steven-bartlett" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Voice Translation</a> feature, which helps podcasters expand the reach of their storytelling by translating podcasts into additional languages in the podcasters’ own voices.<br></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div id="image-input" data-heading=""><p><h3>Image input</h3></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>Vision-based models also present new challenges, ranging from hallucinations about people to relying on the model’s interpretation of images in high-stakes domains. Prior to broader deployment, we tested the model with red teamers for risk in domains such as extremism and scientific proficiency, and a diverse set of alpha testers.

                        <p>I've been working remotely since October 2019 and took a sabbatical during the pandemic.</p><p>I started my job as an Amazon talent-management specialist in September 2022. When I was hired, Amazon office employees were working remotely.</p><p>My team's senior leadership had to fly to different cities for in-person strategic meetings with other senior leaders, but no one else was in the office.</p><p>I went into the Chicago office voluntarily for meetings and team bonding once a month over six months.</p><h2>Being in an office environment makes my disability worse</h2><p>I have a stress-intolerance disorder and work is inherently stressful. My stressors make me both physically and mentally sick. An in-person office environment exacerbates my symptoms.</p><p>I've had to be hospitalized multiple times for stress-related illnesses after working in person for more than a couple of months.</p><p>Working from home allows me to control my environment and minimize stressors. I can take breaks and reduce the impact of stress on my body.</p><p>I can also be my authentic self while working without masking most of the time, which takes a huge mental and physical load off of me.</p><h2>When I moved to Raleigh, North Carolina, there were no rumblings of RTO at Amazon</h2><p>I was tired of the long, dark, cold winters in Chicago. I wanted a metropolitan location that was warmer, safe, and not too big. Raleigh checked all my boxes. People here are friendly and welcoming.</p><p>At that time, Amazon's internal messaging was that we would be remote indefinitely —&nbsp;there were no whispers that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-rto-return-to-office-policy-news-updates-2023-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>RTO was coming</u></a>, so I felt confident relocating.</p><p>I didn't mention my move to my manager because I never felt like there would be any threat of me having to go into the office anytime soon, if ever. Members of my team lived in different places across the country.</p><p>In March, less than a week after I moved, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-voluntary-resignation-employees-relocate-rto-2023-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>Amazon issued its RTO</u></a> order. Employees had to be working in the office for a minimum of three days a week from May 1. </p><h2>My whole team wanted to keep working remotely</h2><p>Our team's leadership advocated for our team to remain remote since we were spread across the country. Even if we all went to our nearest offices, we still wouldn't have the opportunity to collaborate in person.</p><p>Our work involved sensitive employee data, so we couldn't have meetings or calls in a cubicle or open-office floor plan. We'd always need the security and privacy of a private room, so there was another wrench in the RTO.</p><p>I'm confident that my leaders did their best to find alternatives and advocate, but they don't have as much power as the C-suite.</p><h2>I knew I wasn't going back to Chicago or in-person work</h2><p>I wasn't returning to Chicago or another Amazon hub — it was off the table. Amazon wasn't talking about relocation assistance at the time.</p><p>My relocation was expensive and a lot of work. I love Raleigh and I couldn't afford to move again, so returning to a hub was never on the table.</p><h2>It took me 90 days to find a new remote job</h2><p>When the RTO message came out, I waited to see what my direct leadership chain would do. Over the next month, it became apparent that all of us would have to submit to it.</p><p>Paired with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-layoffs-second-round-9000-job-jobs-2023-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>the mass layoffs</u></a> that were happening nearly every quarter, I didn't feel I had job security.</p><p>I started applying for remote jobs in April, which made my search difficult because entirely remote jobs aren't as plentiful as they were in 2020 and competition is tough.</p><p>After three months, I received an offer from another Fortune 100 company to work remotely.</p><h2>Leaving Amazon was a blessing in disguise</h2><p>It was a blessing in disguise. If Amazon had never announced RTO or layoffs, I would probably still be there.</p><p>I like the new job much more and it's a much better match for my skill set and abilities.</p><p>My role at Amazon was very task-oriented. Get this done, get that done. My new role is strategic. I get to partner with senior business leaders and determine the talent strategy to make their business strategy a reality.</p><p><em>In response to a request from Insider to comment on Amazon's return-to-office order, a spokesperson for the company said: "We believe that being in the office at least three days a week is the right long-term approach because it drives culture, team connection, innovation, and learning.&nbsp;We also appreciate that there will be exceptions based on an employee's individual circumstances. Insider wouldn't share the information necessary for us to verify this account, however we have processes in place for employees to request exceptions or accommodations, and if an employee is asked to relocate, we provide financial assistance."&nbsp;</em></p>

Now, the rest of the state joins a handful of others with similar laws, including California and Colorado.</p><p>“There is a trend, not just in legislatures but among workers, to know how much they can expect going into a job. There’s a demand from workers to know of the pay range,” said Da Hae Kim, a state policy senior counsel at the National Women’s Law Center.</p><p>The law, signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul in 2022, also will apply to remote employees who work outside of New York but report to a supervisor, office or worksite based in the state. The law would not apply to government agencies or temporary help firms.</p><p>Compliance will be a challenge, said Frank Kerbein, director of human resources at the New York Business Council, which has criticized the law for putting an additional administrative burden on employers.</p><p>“We have small employers who don’t even know about the law,” said Kerbein, who predicted there would be “a lot of unintentional noncompliance.”</p><p>To avoid trouble when setting a salary range, an employer should examine pay for current employees, said Allen Shoikhetbrod, who practices employment law at Tully Rinckley, a private law firm.</p><p>State Senator Jessica Ramos, a Democrat representing parts of Queens, said the law is a win for <a href="https://english.elpais.com/usa/2023-09-01/rising-tensions-between-employers-and-employees-have-put-the-labor-back-in-this-years-labor-day.html" target="_blank">labor rights groups.</a></p><p>“This is something that, organically, workers are asking for,” she said. “Particularly with young people entering the workforce, they’ll have a greater understanding about how their work is valued.”</p><p><a href="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en"><i>Sign up</i></a><i> for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition</i></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><em><span>Welcome to BIG, a newsletter on the politics of monopoly power. If you’d like to sign up to receive issues over email, you can do so </span><a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/subscribe" rel="">here</a><span>.</span></em></p><p>Normally on Sunday’s I do a round-up of monopoly-related news for paid subscribers. That’ll be at the end of this email. But today, I want to do a bit of a summary of the Google antitrust trial, since we’re investing so much into covering it. The key question is as follows. Google is a very powerful corporation worth around $2 trillion, it controls access to the internet, and it will roll out generative artificial intelligence for billions of people. And yet, the public hasn’t heard that much about a major trial where the firm and its executives are being asked how they secured that immense power. Why?  </p><p>There are several possibilities, but in my view, the most obvious reason is that the judge in the case, Amit Mehta, is effectively holding the contest in secret. Last week, according to our calculations, over half of the trial, including testimony from key witnesses, happened in closed session, unavailable to the public. Why? Here’s Mehta in a pre-trial hearing in August, explaining his thinking to Google’s attorneys.</p><p><em>“Look, I’m a trial judge. I am not anyone that understands the industry and the markets in the way that you do. And so I take seriously when companies are telling me that if this gets disclosed, it’s going to cause competitive harm. And I think it behooves me to be somewhat conservative in thinking about that issue, because, you know, I can’t see around every corner.”</em></p><p>In other words, Mehta is deferring to Google on the need for secrecy.</p><div id="youtube2-gRelVFm7iJE" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;gRelVFm7iJE&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gRelVFm7iJE?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p><span>In 1998, the richest man in the world, Bill Gates, had to answer to the public in an antitrust trial. Gates had been a titan for almost two decades, gracing the cover of Time Magazine multiple times as a young genius. That all changed when he was deposed by government lawyers. “The Bill Gates on the courtroom screen,” reported </span><a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/tech/98/11/biztech/articles/03soft.html" rel="">the New York Times</a><span>, “was evasive and uninformed, pedantic and taciturn, a world apart from his reputation as a brilliant business strategist, guiding every step in Microsoft Corp.'s rise to dominance in computing.” </span></p><p>For eight months, the Microsoft antitrust trial was front-page news, the drama of the trillion dollar personal computing revolution unveiled to the public. One result was that Microsoft, afraid of public exposure years later, refused to use its control over the browser to kill nascent rivals, in particular a young search company called Google. </p><p><span>Today, we should be in a similar moment, only this time with Google as the titan on trial. Google has engaged in behavior that’s almost identical to what Microsoft did in terms of coercion of rivals, and just as consequential in terms of shaping the future. And yet, the reporting and interest in this trial is minuscule compared to what we saw 25 years ago. Frankly, some days, our </span><a href="https://www.bigtechontrial.com/" rel="">Big Tech on Trial</a><span> reporting site is one of the few journalists in the court room, which is astonishing. This dynamic is especially odd because, unlike 1998, we are in an anti-monopoly moment, with political interest in corporate behavior far more elevated than it was in 1998.</span></p><p><span>What gives? There are a few reasons for this odd disconnect, but one reason is very simple - there was public access to the Microsoft trial in 1998. However today the judge, a guy named Amit Mehta, has effectively barred the public from seeing anything meaningful or interesting. In my </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/the-first-big-antitrust-trial-of" rel="">profile of the trial</a><span>, back in August, I focused on Mehta, because I knew the dynamics would be organized by his decision-making. And so it has been.</span></p><p><span>Let’s compare the two trials. For Microsoft, the judge ruled on </span><a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/gates-depositions-open-to-public/" rel="">behalf of media organizations</a><span> that the deposition of Bill Gates would be unsealed, a deposition that was not meaningful for the trial, but also critically important to the historical record, and one you can watch online today. He also unsealed </span><a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/04/biztech/articles/09soft.html" rel="">over a hundred transcripts</a><span> of other depositions from industry players, including ones that weren’t used in the trial itself. This public record was critical to the reporting, and to public understanding of the industry.</span></p><p><span>But this Google trial? By far the most important moment was when Judge Mehta </span><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.685.0_1.pdf" rel="">denied a third-party motion</a><span> to broadcast a publicly accessible audio feed of the trial for fear that information Google wishes wouldn’t be disclosed become public. Indeed, Google lawyers have explicitly argued that the judge should avoid allowing documents to become public solely because it is “clickbait.” To put it differently, the search giant literally argues material should stay sealed merely because if that material is interesting. Imagine if Bill Gates, or say, a routine defendant in any case, could have availed himself of that innovative legal argument!</span></p><p>These arguments should be laughed out of court. And yet, Mehta takes them seriously, which has led to an almost-entirely private trial, deadeningly boring to the public because key documents have been deleted and the important or embarrassing moments are held in secret. </p><p>As a result of this monumental decision, the trial is now only available to people who can go to the court in D.C.  And yet, even if you can come to the courthouse, it’s hard to see the trial because huge portions are fully sealed. There is often no clear indication beforehand of how long the trial will be sealed for. And when court ends a sealed session and re-opens to the public, it often resumes within a couple minutes of opening the door to the courtroom. This means anyone who wants to watch the public portions of the trial just has to wait outside the courtroom to see when it re-opens. Moreover, even though you can watch the trial from the courtroom or a public overflow room, unless you are in the media room, electronic devices are not allowed.</p><p>It’s an eight week trial, but a chronicle of Friday’s court date is as good an example as any. Big Tech on Trial waited all day, with no information, as the lawyers debated something in what is known as a ‘closed session.’ This is a common occurrence. Most of the trial is happening behind closed doors, including procedural questions that should clearly be public. Indeed, Big Tech on Trial looked at the transcripts for the last week to estimate roughly how much of the trial was held in secret, based on how much they are redacted. </p><p>Easily half of the week’s courtroom days were sealed. Here’s a breakdown of how much of the trial was sealed on each day:</p><ul><li><p>Monday, Sept. 18: roughly half of the trial was sealed</p></li><li><p>Tuesday, Sept. 19: trial was fully open</p></li><li><p><span>Wednesday, Sept. 20 roughly three quarters of the trial was sealed. That morning, Bloomberg reporter Leah Nylen came to the courtroom with a First Amendment attorney hired by Bloomberg. But the attorney never got a chance to speak because the court unexpectedly </span><a href="https://www.bigtechontrial.com/p/what-is-it-like-to-compete-against" rel="">began in a closed session and the public was asked to leave the courtroom</a><span> (after Judge Mehta reportedly had a private meeting with the lead attorneys in his chambers).</span></p></li><li><p>Thursday, Sept. 21: roughly half of the trial was sealed</p></li><li><p>Friday, Sept. 22: the entirety of testimony was sealed. Court opened up only for a few minutes to deal with administrative matters at the very end of the day.</p></li></ul><p><span>And that means we heard little of the most important testimony, perhaps of the entire trial, from a man named John Giannandrea. Giannandrea is a senior executive at Apple who reports directly to Tim Cook and came to Apple from Google in 2018, where he was head of Search. The relationship between Apple and Google is the heart of the trial, and, in the year this man left from Apple to Google, the two firms went from aggressive </span><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apples-web-search-technology-chief-returns-to-google?irclickid=zaGVWgzd3xyPWD-UXyyJiw2eUkFRgRVRRWdJ1s0&amp;irgwc=1&amp;utm_source=affiliate&amp;utm_medium=cpa&amp;utm_campaign=10078-Skimbit+Ltd.&amp;utm_term=macrumors.com" rel="">competitors to gentle collaborators</a><span>. And yet, the public heard just </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-22/apple-ai-chief-posits-new-private-browser-search-at-google-trial" rel="">ten minutes of open-court testimony from Giannandrea</a><span>.

On a separate post, I’ve put up </span><a href="https://www.bigtechontrial.com/p/secrecy-is-systemic" rel="">seven different</a><span> ways he’s doing that, from letting Google avoid disclosing documents based on false claims of attorney-client privilege to doing nothing even when Google executives used “history-off chats” to destroy conversations after 24 hours even after Google was on a litigation hold. The point is, Mehta is far more concerned that Google isn’t embarrassed, and almost wholly uninterested in public access.</span></p><p>The problem here isn’t just the judge or Google. The Department of Justice shouldn’t be let off the hook either. The trial team, which is generally doing a good job, seems mostly unconcerned with public access. They didn’t support a set of nonprofits who made a motion for a public audio feed, and they tend to litigate in closed session whenever Google seems uncomfortable, so as not to come close to offending the judge. Indeed, when the judge expressed a bit of frustration that exhibits were posted publicly, government lawyers immediately pulled down their website and said they would work with Google to make sure everyone was satisfied with the process. That’s the opposite of standing your ground.</p><p><span>Trials are </span><em>supposed</em><span> to be public, and the government should fight for them to be public. Public access and a public record in a trial, especially when the powerful are concerned, is a core part of what makes our legal system different from those in authoritarian regimes. Not vigorously challenging Google in its penchant for secrecy is inconsistent with their obligation to their client, which is the people of the United States. </span></p><p>And this isn’t costless. At this point, I am hearing from random commentators that the fix is in, and it’s hard not to disagree. Conspiracy theorists arguing how the corporations, judges, and the government are in collaboration could look at this trial and have a field day. That’s the price of secrecy, there’s just no way to uphold the legitimacy of a legal order when redactions are both unnecessary and routine.</p><p>Fortunately, this trial isn’t the last time Google will be on the stand. And despite Mehta’s caution, we are learning more about Google, just not nearly as much as we should. I didn’t know what to expect from this trial, but a blackout of information wasn’t on my radar. But I guess I shouldn’t have been surprised. After all, who knows more about the value of privacy than Google?</p><p><span>The monopoly round-up for paid subscribers is below.

<p>Intel is a newcomer to the world of discrete graphics cards, and the company’s Xe architecture is driving its effort to establish itself alongside AMD and Nvidia. We’ve seen Xe variants serve in integrated GPUs and midrange discrete cards, but Intel’s not stopping there. Their GPU ambitions extend to the datacenter and supercomputing markets. That’s where Ponte Vecchio (PVC) comes in.</p>
<p>Like other compute-oriented GPUs, PVC goes wide and slow. High memory bandwidth and FP64 throughput differentiate it from client architectures, which emphasize FP32 throughput and use caching to reduce memory bandwidth demands. Compared to Nvidia’s H100 and AMD’s MI210, PVC stands out because it lacks fixed function graphics hardware. H100 and MI210 still have some form of texture units, but PVC doesn’t have any at all. Combine that with its lack of display outputs, and calling PVC a GPU is pretty funny. It’s really a giant, parallel processor that happens to be programmed in the same way you’d program a GPU for compute.</p>

<p>PVC’s physical design makes it even more unique, because it’s a chiplet extravaganza. Compute tiles fabricated on TSMC’s 5 nm process contain PVC’s basic building blocks, called Xe Cores. They sit on top of a 640 mm<sup>2</sup> base tile, which contains a giant 144 MB L2 cache and uses Intel’s 7 process. The base tile then acts as an IO die, connecting to HBM2e, PCIe, and peer GPUs. PVC combines five different process nodes in the same package, and connects them using embedded bridges or 3D stacking. Intel has pulled all the stops on advanced packaging, making PVC a fascinating product.</p>
<p>Today, we’re looking at the Intel GPU Max 1100, which implements 56 Xe Cores and clocks up to 1.55 GHz. Its base tile has 108 MB of L2 cache enabled, and connects to 48 GB of HBM2e memory with a <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/232876/intel-data-center-gpu-max-1100/specifications.html">theoretical 1.2 TB/s</a> of bandwidth. The Max 1100 comes as a PCIe card with a 300W TDP, making it similar to AMD’s MI210 and Nvidia’s H100 PCIe.</p>
<h2>Cache and Memory Latency</h2>
<p>Intel uses a two-level caching setup, but with higher capacity and latency than contemporary compute GPUs. To start, each Xe Core gets a massive 512 KB L1 cache. Like Nvidia, Intel allocates both L1 cache and local memory out of the same block of storage. Unlike Nvidia, Intel recognized that our memory latency test doesn’t use any local memory, and gave it the entire 512 KB. L1 latency is reasonably good considering the cache’s size.</p>

<p>If accesses miss the L1, they proceed to access L2 on the base tile. Intel’s L2 cache (sometimes called a L3) is massive, with 144 MB of nominal capacity. We have 108 MB enabled on the SKU we had access to, which is still no joke. A fully enabled AD102 die from Nvidia’s Ada Lovelace architecture has 96 MB of L2 cache, while AMD’s RDNA 2 has up to 128 MB of Infinity Cache. Both architectures represent a recent trend where consumer GPUs are using giant caches to avoid exotic VRAM setups, and PVC’s cache is firmly in the “giant cache” area. </p>

The L2 is called a L3 here, in keeping with Intel’s naming scheme from older integrated graphics architectures where each subslice (Xe Core equivalent) had two levels of texture cache</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Intel’s L2 latency unfortunately is quite high at over 286 ns. Some consumer GPUs even enjoy lower VRAM latency. I don’t think chiplets are a major culprit, since vertical stacking on AMD’s CPUs only adds a couple extra nanoseconds of latency. Rather, I suspect Intel struggled because they were not used to making big GPUs with big caches. Their Arc A750 has nearly 40% higher L2 latency than the A380 for a 4x L2 capacity increase. Contrast that with a 23% latency increase when going from the RX 7600’s 32 MB Infinity Cache to the RX 6900 XT’s 128 MB one. Larger GPUs with bigger caches tend to see higher latency, but Intel struggles with this more than AMD or Nvidia.</p>

<p>Finally, Intel’s presentation at ISSCC shows the TLB implemented on the base tile, alongside the L2 cache. That suggests the L1 cache is virtually addressed, and hitting the L2 may incur an address translation delay. I’m sure a lot of GPUs do this, but if Intel’s TLB lookups are slow, they would add to cache latency.</p>
<p>High L2 latency may seem pretty bad at first glance, but coping mechanisms exist. PVC’s large 512 KB L1 is as large as L2 capacity on older GPUs, like Nvidia’s GTX 680 or AMD’s Radeon HD 6950. It’s also larger than the L1 mid-level caches on AMD’s RDNA 2 and 3 architectures. Intel’s L1 is really serving as both a first level cache and a mid-level cache. Compared to AMD and Nvidia, Intel’s L2 cache should see far fewer accesses because the L1 will have fewer misses.</p>

<p>We’ve already seen compute architectures experience higher latency than client ones, but PVC takes this another step further. RDNA 2’s Infinity Cache has lower latency than PVC’s L2, despite having similar capacity. VRAM latency is nearly 600 ns, which puts it roughly on par with AMD’s old <a href="https://chipsandcheese.com/2023/04/01/amds-hd-6950-vs-rx-6900-xt-what-does-adding-50-do/">Terascale 3</a> architecture. If workloads don’t have good L1 hitrates, Intel’s GPU will need a lot of work in flight to hide latency.</p>
<p>Intel’s A770 is another interesting comparison, because it’s another Xe architecture variant. Like PVC, the A770 has a larger L1 cache than its peers. Its L2 is reasonably sized at 16 MB, putting the A770 somewhere between GPUs with a legacy caching strategy, and newer ones that emphasize massive caching capacity. While A770 appears to take a conservative approach, PVC’s giant L2 cache points towards Intel’s ambitions to combine giant caching capacity with high memory bandwidth to create something special.</p>
<h3>Local Memory Latency</h3>
<p>Besides global memory, which corresponds to memory as we know it on a CPU, GPUs have local memory that acts as a software managed scratchpad. Intel calls Shared Local Memory (SLM). Nvidia calls the same thing Shared Memory, and AMD calls it the Local Data Share (LDS). Intel’s SLM strategy has varied throughout the years. Their integrated graphics architectures started by allocating SLM out of an iGPU-wide cache. That resulted in poor latency and low bandwidth for what should have been a high performance block of memory, so Intel moved SLM into the subslices (the predecessor to Xe Cores). PVC switches things up again by merging the SLM with the L1 cache.</p>

<p>SLM latency is decent on the Intel Max 1100, but isn’t anything to write home about. It’s a bit faster than accessing the same block of storage as L1 cache because there’s no need to check tags and cacheline state.</p>
<p>Compared to other architectures, PVC gets bracketed by GCN and CDNA 2. Consumer architectures from both AMD and Nvidia offer significantly lower latency access to local memory. H100’s shared memory is also very fast.</p>
<h3>Atomics Latency</h3>
<p>Atomic operations can help pass data between threads and ensure ordering. Here, we’re using OpenCL’s atomic_cmpxchg function to bounce data between two threads. This is the closest we can get to a GPU core to core latency test.</p>
<p>Unlike a CPU, we can test with both local and global memory. We should see the best performance when bouncing data through local memory, because the SLM/LDS/Shmem structure that backs local memory is designed for low latency data sharing. Threads have to be part of the same workgroup to use this method, which means they’re guaranteed to run on the same Intel Xe Core, AMD Compute Unit, or Nvidia Streaming Multiprocessor. It’s a bit like testing core to core latency between sibling threads on a SMT-enabled CPU.</p>

<p>Intel performs reasonably well exchanging data through an Xe Core’s Shared Local Memory. As with the uncontested local memory test, it gets bracketed by two GCN-derived GPUs. Consumer GPUs are again faster. H100 is also quite fast, though not by the same margin as before.</p>
<p>If we use atomic_compxchg on global memory, latency of course is much higher. Intel now falls far behind AMD’s CDNA 2, and very far behind consumer graphics architectures.</p>

<p>In fairness to Intel, bouncing data between threads on a massive GPU isn’t easy. PVC has an incredibly complex interconnect, with cross-die interfaces and a switching fabric on the base die. With that in mind, the Intel Max 1100 only barely loses to Nvidia’s monolithic H100. Intel’s GPU also ties with Nvidia’s Tesla K80, which scored 172.21 ns in this test. Kepler was a very well received architecture and K80 GPUs are so good that they’re still in use today.</p>
<h2>Cache Bandwidth</h2>
<p>Shared caches need to provide enough bandwidth to service all of their clients. That’s particularly difficult on GPUs, where workloads tend to want a lot of bandwidth. PVC’s L2 cache is special because it’s implemented on a separate base die. All other GPUs (at the time of this writing) place the L2 on the same die as their basic compute building blocks, making PVC unique. </p>

<p>Thankfully, Intel’s 3D stacking interface provides plenty of bandwidth. We peaked at just over 2.7 TB/s with 64 MB of data in play with a different test run that uses 1024 threads per workgroup instead of 256 as on other GPUs. It’s not quite as good as AMD’s MI210 or even H100’s “far” L2 partition. But trading a bit of L2 bandwidth for more capacity seems like a fair choice. PVC does have less memory bandwidth than MI210 or H100, so there’s less bandwidth to service L2 misses with.</p>
<p>We can also see that PVC’s slope is much shallower then the slops for the other GPUs here. Usually, we see bandwidth gently taper off as we get enough work in flight to saturate the cache. Instead, PVC seemingly can’t fully saturate its cache even with over 500 million OpenCL threads being thrown at the GPU to crunch through. For some perspective both MI210 and H100 only needed about 1 million threads to get their high utilization.</p>
<p>PVC may have the biggest L2 cache of any contemporary compute GPU, but it’s not alone in implementing large caches. AMD’s RDNA 2 and RDNA 3 have 128 MB and 96 MB of Infinity Cache, which effectively acts as a fourth-level cache. RDNA 3 implements its Infinity Cache on separate memory controller dies, so its accesses have to go through a cross-die interface just like on PVC. RDNA 2 and Ada Lovelace keep their high capacity caches within a monolithic die.</p>

<p>Intel’s L2 offers similar bandwidth to RDNA3’s Infinity Cache. However, Infinity Cache doesn’t need the same amount of bandwidth as a L2 cache because AMD has a multi-megabyte L2 cache in front of it. Nvidia’s Ada Lovelace needs a lot of L2 bandwidth because it only has 128 KB cache in front of it. Ada’s L1 capacity will be even lower if some of it is used for shared memory. So, Ada’s L2 can deliver nearly 5 TB/s of bandwidth.</p>
<h2>VRAM Bandwidth</h2>
<p>Consumer GPUs like AMD’s RDNA 2 and Nvidia’s Ada Lovelace have opted for large caches instead of expensive memory configurations, while compute GPUs like MI210 and H100 have done the opposite. Intel’s approach is to do both. A PVC tile features four stacks of HBM2e memory, giving it more memory bandwidth than any consumer GPU. Still, PVC falls a bit short compared to other compute GPUs.</p>

<p>We should see <a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/232876/intel-data-center-gpu-max-1100.html">1228.8 GB/s of theoretical bandwidth</a>, but my test doesn’t get anywhere close. I’m not sure what happened here. Perhaps Intel’s very high memory latency makes it difficult to make use of the bandwidth, and the Xe Cores can’t track enough cache misses in flight to hide that latency.</p>
<h2>Compute Throughput</h2>
<p>Each Xe Core in PVC consists of eight 512-bit vector engines, which would be good for 16 32-bit operations per cycle. Nvidia and AMD’s designs have settled on using four partitions in their basic building blocks. H100’s SMs have four 32-wide SMSPs, or 1024-bit wide when we consider 32-bit operations. MI210’s CUs have four 16-wide SIMDs, which are also 1024-bits wide because each lane natively handles 64-bit operations.</p>

<p>Intel’s Max 1100 has 56 of these Xe Cores, so it has 7168 lanes running at 1.55 GHz, for a nominal throughput of 11.1 billion operations per second. The MI210’s 6656 lanes at 1.7 GHz should provide 11.3 GOPS, making it similar in size. Nvidia’s H100 PCIe is much larger. With 14592 vector lanes at 1.755 GHz, Nvidia’s monster can do 25.6 GOPS. </p>
<p>Intel makes up some ground if we test instruction rate with 500 million OpenCL threads like we did with cache bandwidth. For reference, FluidX3D’s most common kernel launches with 16 million threads, and a full-screen pixel shader at 4K launches 8 million threads. Our instruction rate test also gets over theoretical throughput, perhaps indicating that the compiler is eliminating some operations. We weren’t able to get to the bottom of this because we don’t have the profiling tools necessary to get disassembly from the GPU. </p>
<p>But even with what looks like an overestimate, AMD’s MI210 has a substantial lead in FP32 throughput if it can use packed operations. Intel can’t do packed FP32 execution but can execute 16-bit integer operations at double rate. FP16 operations can also execute at double rate, though only for adds. This is likely a compiler issue where the v0 += acc * v0 sequence couldn’t be converted into a FMA instruction. </p>

<p>PVC can boost throughput in other ways too. INT32 and FP32 operations can dual issue, giving a substantial performance boost if those operations are evenly mixed. This is true dual issue operation, unlike the claimed “dual issue” on post-Turing Nvidia architectures, where mixing FP32 and INT32 operations won’t get you increased throughput over INT32 alone. Nvidia’s “integer datapath” actually deals with INT32 multiplication. In that respect, PVC and Nvidia follow a similar strategy, and can do 32-bit integer multiplies at half rate. Intel likely carried this strategy over from their integrated graphics architectures. Gen 9 (Skylake integrated graphics) could also do half rate integer multiplication.</p>

<p>Finally, double precision floating point performance is an important differentiator for datacenter GPUs. Consumer grade cards can put up a decent performance in other categories especially considering their price, but generally lack competent FP64 hardware. PVC can do FP64 additions at full rate, but strangely couldn’t do so with FP64 FMAs. I wonder what’s going on here, because their Gen 9 architecture could do FP64 adds and FMAs at the same rate using the same test code.</p>
<h2>(Macro) Benchmarks</h2>
<h3>FluidX3D (FP32)</h3>
<p>FluidX3D uses the lattice Boltzmann method to simulate fluid behavior. It uses a variety of techniques to achieve acceptable accuracy without using FP64. Density distribution function (DDF) values are shifted into ranges where FP32 can provide enough precision. DDF summation uses alternating additions and subtractions to reduce loss of significance errors. The result is that FluidX3D can produce results very close to the FP64 “ground truth” while using FP32 operations that perform well on consumer GPUs. I’m using FluidX3D’s built in benchmark here.</p>

<p>Intel’s Max 1100 does not compete favorably against the current crop of compute GPUs from AMD and Nvidia. AMD’s similarly sized MI210 wins by more than 47%, while Nvidia’s giant H100 is three times faster. PVC performs closest to AMD’s RX 7900 XTX, showing that consumer graphics architectures can hit pretty hard in FP32 compute. RDNA 3 combines tremendous FP32 throughput, with caching capacity and memory bandwidth not far off PVC’s, so its performance isn’t a surprise.</p>
<h3>Calculate Gravitational Potential</h3>
<p>CGP is a workload written by Clamchowder. It does a brute force calculation of gravitational potential, given a map of column density. Code quality is roughly what you’d expect from a typical high school student working on a research project at 3 AM after doing the necessary things to have any chance at college admission (homework for 8 classes, studying for 9 APs, practicing two instruments, playing a sport, and definitely not getting the four hours of sleep recommended in the “sleep four hours pass, sleep five hours fail” saying). In other words, it’s completely unoptimized, and should represent what happens if you’re using hardware time to save human brain time. </p>

<p>Consumer GPUs suffer heavily in this workload because they don’t have a lot of hardware FP64 units, and PVC shows its worth. It’s twice as fast as AMD’s RX 6900 XT, and blows Nvidia’s consumer GA102 chip (A10) out of the water.</p>
<p>However, PVC struggles against recent datacenter GPUs, just as it did in FluidX3D. MI210 outperforms it by a staggering margin by natively handling FP64. H100 does as well, by simply being a massive GPU. PVC also takes a surprising loss to the older Radeon VII, which has a decent 1:4 FP64 ratio.</p>
<h2>PVC’s Chiplet Setup</h2>
<p>Now that we have an idea of how PVC performs, we can make a few observations on its chiplet setup. PVC’s chiplet setup is fascinating because Intel has chosen to use a more complex chiplet configuration than Zen 4 or RDNA 3. Chiplets are challenging, so that’s risky. Die to die interfaces create area overhead. Data movement between dies is often more expensive than doing so within a monolithic die. Vertically stacked dies can be harder to cool. Successful chiplet implementations mitigate these problems to enjoy cost benefits while suffering minimal performance degradation compared to a monolithic solution.</p>
<p>Lets go over these areas one by one, starting with area.</p>
<h3>Area Overhead</h3>
<p>Chiplets aim to reduce cost by letting engineers use cheaper process nodes when using better nodes would have limited benefit, and by using smaller individual dies to increase yield. However, chiplets will use more total area than an equivalent monolithic implementation due to duplicated logic and cross-die interfaces. Area overhead can also be more subtle. For example, Zen 4 uses a large and fast L3 cache to mitigate the latency and bandwidth hit of going through an IO die. The fast L3 takes up more die area on a Zen 4 CCD than the cores themselves.</p>

<p>On the area front, Ponte Vecchio uses a 640 mm<sup>2</sup> base die. Rough pixel counting gives us the following for the Intel Max 1100:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Die</td><td>Node</td><td>Contains</td><td>Area</td><td>Count</td><td>Total Area</td></tr><tr><td>Base</td><td>Intel 7 Foveros</td><td>Switch fabric, 144 MB of L2 cache, IO to HBM and peer GPUs</td><td>640 mm<sup>2</sup></td><td>1</td><td>640 mm<sup>2</sup></td></tr><tr><td>Compute</td><td>TSMC N5</td><td>8x Xe Cores</td><td>40.31 mm<sup>2</sup></td><td>8</td><td>322.47 mm<sup>2</sup></td></tr><tr><td>RAMBO</td><td>Intel 7</td><td>Four 3.75 MB banks of extra L2 cache each</td><td>14.17 mm<sup>2</sup></td><td>4</td><td>60.66 mm<sup>2</sup></td></tr><tr><td>Xe Link</td><td>TSMC N7</td><td>Cross-package links and switching logic</td><td>74.12 mm<sup>2</sup></td><td>1</td><td>74.12 mm<sup>2</sup></td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>The Max 1100 has 56 Xe Cores, so we’re looking at half of a PVC package</figcaption></figure>
<p>One PVC GPU instance uses 1097 mm<sup>2</sup> of total die area across various nodes, excluding HBM. I don’t think any RAMBO cache is enabled on the Max 1100, so we can also consider a 1036 mm<sup>2</sup> figure for fairness. AMD’s MI210 uses a 724 mm<sup>2</sup> die on TSMC’s N6 process and achieves better performance. Intel is therefore taking at least a 43-51% area overhead. I’m saying at least, because a substantial amount of area is using TSMC’s N5 node, which is more advanced than the N6 node used by AMD. If we use AMD Epyc’s 10% chiplet area overhead as a benchmark, PVC looks unbalanced.</p>
<h3>Data Movement</h3>
<p>Moving data between chiplets is often more challenging than doing so within a monolithic die. <a href="https://chipsandcheese.com/2020/12/28/nvidias-next-generation-gpu-mcm/">Old Nvidia research</a> estimated 0.54 pj/bit of power draw for cross-chiplet links, but that paper did not consider 3D stacking. AMD showed that 3D stacking could allow massive bandwidth with very little power cost.</p>

<p>On Ponte Vecchio, compute tile to base tile communication would be the highest bandwidth cross-die interface. The L2 cache can provide several terabytes per second, and that’s handled by a 3D stacking interface well suited to such high bandwidth demands. Xe Link and HBM use 2D interfaces, but don’t deal with nearly as much bandwidth. Intel is using the best and highest bandwidth interfaces where they’re needed, making for a sound strategy here.</p>
<h3>Cooling</h3>
<p>PVC employs 3D stacking in spades. 3D stacking can reduce critical path lengths and package size, but can also create cooling challenges. AMD’s VCache addresses cooling by not stacking any logic over the cores. On my 7950X3D, the VCache CCD clocked 7% lower on average than the non-VCache one. AMD’s MI210 runs at 1.7 GHz, and thus clocks 9.7% faster than Intel’s Max 1100. That’s a problem. PVC puts its shaders on TSMC’s newer 5 nm node, and targets 300W just like MI210. If chiplets are delivering the benefits they’re supposed to, PVC should be pulling ahead. </p>
<p>Intel never published Ponte Vecchio’s die layout, but their slides indicate that IO interfaces are placed around the die edge (as is typical in many designs). IO interfaces shouldn’t get particularly hot, and are covered by “thermal tiles” with no other function other besides conducting heat.</p>

<p>If the compute tiles aren’t overlapping IO, they’re sitting on top of either cache or the switch fabric. Both of those would create heat, which would have to be dissipated through the hot compute tiles. That could exacerbate any hotspot issues within the compute tiles, and force the cooling solution to deal with more heat in the same surface area.</p>
<p>Zen 4 with VCache in comparison only sees a <a href="https://chipsandcheese.com/2023/04/23/amds-7950x3d-zen-4-gets-vcache/">7% clock speed penalty</a> compared to a vanilla setup without 3D stacking. That’s largely because AMD avoided stacking any cache or logic on top of the CPU cores. In fact, most of VCache’s clock speed deficit appears to come from the vertically stacked cache not being able to handle high voltage, rather than thermal issues. Intel should adopt a similar strategy, and try to overlap compute with cache as little as possible. I don’t think this is an easy change because there’s a massive 144 MB of L2 on the base die, and the switching fabric is likely not small either. </p>
<p>RDNA 3’s chiplet strategy offers an alternative approach. 3D stacking is avoided in favor of putting cache on memory controller dies (MCDs), which use an <a href="https://twitter.com/KarbinC/status/1634388173303304192">interposer </a>to get enough cross-die bandwidth. We saw earlier that Intel’s L2 isn’t too much faster than RDNA 3’s Infinity Cache. Certainly RDNA 3’s approach is not without compromises because it’ll make cache bandwidth more difficult to scale. But not all workloads will be bound by last level cache bandwidth, especially with 512 KB L1 caches in play. And higher clock speed could let PVC narrow the performance gap with AMD’s MI210.</p>
<h2>Final Words: A Foot in the Door</h2>
<p>Compute GPUs like Nvidia’s H100 and AMD’s MI210 push the boundaries of how fast we can process information and are among the most complex chips around. AMD and Nvidia are where they are today thanks to decades of experience building large GPUs. Intel may have a lot of money and good engineers, but they don’t have the same experience. Short of a miracle, their journey to build a big GPU will be an arduous one.</p>
<p>For their part, Intel made it even more arduous by using a chiplet setup with borderline insane complexity. From an outsider’s perspective, they seem to have looked at available nodes and packaging technologies, and decided all of the above would be appropriate. Doing this on any product would be risky, let alone a first entry into a new market.</p>

<p>Intel therefore deserves a lot of credit for not only getting the thing working, but creating a product that’s competent in isolation. Intel’s Max 1100 is a legitimately useful compute GPU capable of decent performance. It’s a far cry from the Moore Threads MTT S80, which uses a conventional monolithic die and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPMptuEokPQ">fails to match a budget GPU</a> from the Maxwell generation, while failing to run many games.</p>
<p>Of course, Intel has their work cut out for them. Landing between Nvidia’s old P100 and V100 GPUs is not where they want to be. PVC has plenty of weaknesses that Intel has to solve if they want to move up the performance ladder. L2 cache and VRAM latency are way too high. FP64 FMA throughput is curiously low, even in a microbenchmark. For the massive die area investment, PVC doesn’t bring enough compute power to draw even with AMD’s MI210. </p>
<p>With that in mind, Ponte Vecchio is better seen as a learning experience. Intel engineers likely gained a lot of experience with different process nodes and packaging technologies while developing PVC. PVC deployments like<a href="https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/news/latest-news/2023/07/24/taccs-new-stampede3-advances-nsf-supercomputing-ecosystem/"> TACC’s Stampede3</a> and <a href="https://www.alcf.anl.gov/sites/default/files/2022-06/ALCF-Aurora_0.pdf">ANL’s Aurora</a> supercomputers will give Intel real world performance data for tuning future architectures. Finally, innovations like a giant, expandable L2 cache give the Xe architecture unique flexibility.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently, I found myself returning to a compelling series of blog posts titled
<a href="https://aturon.github.io/blog/2016/08/11/futures/">Zero-cost futures in Rust</a>
by Aaron Turon about what would become the foundation of Rust's async ecosystem
and the <a href="https://tokio.rs/">Tokio</a> runtime.</p>
<p>This series stands as a cornerstone in writings about Rust. People like Aaron
are the reason why I wanted to be part of the Rust community in the first place.</p>
<p>While 2016 evokes nostalgic memories of excitement and fervor surrounding async
Rust, my sentiments regarding the current state of its ecosystem are now
somewhat ambivalent.</p>
<h2 id="why-bother">Why Bother?</h2>
<p>Through this series, I hope to address two different audiences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Newcomers to async Rust, seeking to get an overview of the current state of
the ecosystem.</li>
<li>Library maintainers and contributors to the async ecosystem, in the hope that
my perspective can be a basis for discussion about the future of async Rust.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the first article, we will focus on the current state of async Rust runtimes,
their design choices, and their implications on the broader Rust async ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="one-true-runtime">One True Runtime</h2>
<p>An inconvenient truth about async Rust is that <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/areweasyncyet.rs/issues/34">libraries still need to be
written against individual
runtimes</a>. Writing your
async code in a runtime-agnostic fashion requires <a href="https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/blob/d0fbe7feff4b3a200cf0453417d5e53bd011643a/sqlx-core/src/rt/mod.rs#L116-L136">conditional
compilation</a>,
<a href="https://docs.rs/async-compat/latest/async_compat">compatibility layers</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/719#issuecomment-558758637">handling
edge-cases</a>.</p>
<p>This is the rationale behind most libraries gravitating towards the
One True Runtime — <a href="https://tokio.rs/">Tokio</a>.</p>
<p>Executor coupling is a big problem for async Rust as it breaks the ecosystem
into silos. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/f10tcq/confusion_with_rusts_async_architecture_and_how/fh1oagw/">Documentation and examples for one runtime don't work with the
other
runtimes</a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, much of the existing documentation on async Rust feels outdated or
incomplete. For example, the async book remains in draft, with concepts like
<code>FuturesUnordered</code> yet to be covered. (There is an open <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/async-book/pull/96">pull
request</a>, though.)</p>
<p>That leaves us with a situation that is unsatisfactory for everyone involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>For new users, it is a big ask to <a href="https://github.com/rust-netlink/netlink-proto/issues/7">navigate this space</a> and make future-proof decisions.</li>
<li>For experienced users and library maintainers, <a href="https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/1669#issuecomment-1032132220">supporting multiple runtimes is an additional burden</a>. It's no surprise that popular crates like <a href="https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest"><code>reqwest</code></a> <a href="https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/blob/master/Cargo.toml#L109">simply insist on Tokio as a runtime</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This close coupling, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-async/issues/45">recognized by the async working
group</a>, has me worried about
its potential long-term impact on the ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="the-case-of-async-std">The case of <code>async-std</code></h2>
<p><code>async-std</code> was an attempt to create an alternative runtime that is closer to
the Rust standard library. Its promise was that you could almost use it as a
drop-in replacement.</p>
<p>Take, for instance, this straightforward synchronous file-reading code:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>use</span> <span>std<span>::</span></span><span>fs<span>::</span></span>File<span>;</span>
<span>use</span> <span>std<span>::</span></span><span>io<span>::</span></span>Read<span>;</span>

<span><span><span>fn</span> </span><span>main</span></span><span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span><span>)</span></span></span></span><span> <span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>std<span>::</span></span><span>io<span>::</span></span><span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> file <span>=</span> <span>File<span>::</span></span>open<span><span>(</span><span><span>"</span>foo.txt<span>"</span></span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> data <span>=</span> <span>vec!</span><span><span>[</span><span>]</span></span><span>;</span>
    file<span>.</span><span>read_to_end</span><span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> data</span><span><span>)</span></span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
    <span>Ok</span><span><span>(</span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span></span><span><span>)</span></span>
</span><span><span>}</span></span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>In <code>async-std</code>, it is an <a href="https://docs.rs/async-std/latest/async_std/fs/struct.File.html#method.open">async
operation</a>
instead:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>use</span> <span>async_std<span>::</span></span><span>prelude<span>::</span></span><span>*</span><span>;</span>
<span>use</span> <span>async_std<span>::</span></span><span>fs<span>::</span></span>File<span>;</span>
<span>use</span> <span>async_std<span>::</span></span>io<span>;</span>

async <span><span><span>fn</span> </span><span>read_file</span></span><span><span><span>(</span><span>path</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>str</span></span><span><span><span>)</span></span></span></span><span> <span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>io<span>::</span></span><span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> file <span>=</span> <span>File<span>::</span></span>open<span><span>(</span>path</span><span><span>)</span></span><span>.</span>await<span>?</span><span>;</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> data <span>=</span> <span>vec!</span><span><span>[</span><span>]</span></span><span>;</span>
    file<span>.</span><span>read_to_end</span><span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> data</span><span><span>)</span></span><span>.</span>await<span>?</span><span>;</span>
    <span>Ok</span><span><span>(</span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span></span><span><span>)</span></span>
</span><span><span>}</span></span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>The only difference is the <code>await</code> keyword.</p>
<p>While the the name might suggest it, <code>async-std</code> is not a drop-in replacement
for the standard library as there are many <a href="https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/719#issuecomment-558758637">subtle differences between the
two</a>.</p>
<p>It is hard to create a runtime that is fully compatible with the standard
library. Here are some examples of issues that are still open:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/issues/731">New thread is spawned for every I/O request</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/issues/914">OpenOptionsExt missing for Windows?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/issues/900">Spawned task is stuck during flushing in
File.drop()</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It is an enormous effort to replicate the standard library and it is not clear
to me if it is worth it.</p>
<p>Even if it <em>were</em> a drop-in replacement, I'd still ponder its actual merit.
Rust is a language that values explicitness. This is especially true for
reasoning about runtime behavior, such as allocations and blocking operations.
The async-std's teams proposal to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ebfj3x/stop_worrying_about_blocking_the_new_asyncstd/">"Stop worrying about
blocking"</a>
was met with a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ebpzqx/do_not_stop_worrying_about_blocking_in_async">harsh community
response</a>
and later retracted.</p>
<p>As of this writing, <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/async-std/rev">1754 public crates have a dependency on
<code>async-std</code></a> and there
are companies that <a href="https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/1669#issuecomment-1028879475">rely on it in
production</a>.</p>
<p>However, looking at the commits over time <code>async-std</code> is essentially abandoned
as there is <a href="https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/graphs/contributors">no active development
anymore</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://corrode.dev/blog/async/async-std-github.svg" alt="Fading async-std contribution graph on Github"></p>
<p>This leaves those reliant on the <a href="https://docs.rs/async-std/latest/async_std/"><code>async-std</code>
API</a> – be it for concurrency
mechanisms, extension traits, or otherwise – in an unfortunate situation, as is
the case for libraries developed on top of <code>async-std</code>, such as
<a href="https://github.com/http-rs/surf"><code>surf</code></a>. The core of <code>async-std</code> is now
powered by <a href="https://github.com/smol-rs/smol"><code>smol</code></a>, but it is probably best to
use it directly for new projects.</p>
<h2 id="can-t-we-just-embrace-tokio">Can't we just embrace Tokio?</h2>
<p>Tokio stands as Rust's canonical async runtime.
But to label Tokio merely as a runtime would be an understatement.
It has extra modules for
<a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/fs/index.html">fs</a>,
<a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/io/index.html">io</a>,
<a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/net/index.html">net</a>,
<a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/process/index.html">process-</a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/signal/index.html">signal
handling</a> and
<a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/#modules">more</a>.
That makes it more of a framework for asynchronous programming than just a
runtime.</p>
<p>Partially, this is because Tokio had a pioneering role in async Rust. It
explored the design space as it went along. And while you could exclusively use
the runtime and ignore the rest, it is easier and more common to buy into the
entire ecosystem.</p>
<p>Yet, my main concern with Tokio is that it makes a lot of assumptions about how
async code should be written and where it runs.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/">at the beginning of the Tokio
documentation</a>, they state:</p>
<p>"The easiest way to get started is to enable all features. Do this by enabling
the <code>full</code> feature flag":</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>tokio <span>=</span> <span><span>{</span> version <span>=</span> <span><span>"</span>1<span>"</span></span><span>,</span> features <span>=</span> <span><span>[</span><span><span>"</span>full<span>"</span></span><span>]</span></span> </span><span><span>}</span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>By doing so, one would set up a <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/attr.main.html">multi-threaded
runtime</a> which mandates that
types are <code>Send</code> and <code>'static</code> and makes it necessary to use synchronization
primitives such as <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html"><code>Arc</code></a>
and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html"><code>Mutex</code></a> for all but
the most trivial applications.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Original Sin of Rust async programming is making it multi-threaded by
default. If premature optimization is the root of all evil, this is the mother
of all premature optimizations, and it curses all your code with the unholy
<code>Send + 'static</code>, or worse yet <code>Send + Sync + 'static</code>, which just kills all the
joy of actually writing Rust.</p>
<p>— <a href="https://maciej.codes/2022-06-09-local-async.html">Maciej Hirsz</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any time we reach for an <code>Arc</code> or a <code>Mutex</code> it's good idea to stop for a moment
and think about the future implications of that decision.</p>
<p>The choice to use Arc or Mutex might be indicative of a design that
hasn't fully embraced the ownership and borrowing principles that Rust
emphasizes. It's worth reconsidering if the shared state is genuinely necessary
or if there's an alternative design that could minimize or eliminate the need
for shared mutable state.</p>
<p>The problem, of course, is that Tokio imposes this design on you. It's not your
choice to make. </p>
<p>Beyond the complexities of architecting async code atop these synchronization
mechanisms, they carry a performance cost: Locking means runtime overhead and
additional memory usage; in embedded environments, these mechanisms are often
not available at all.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-threaded-by-default runtimes cause accidental complexity completely
unrelated to the task of writing async code.</strong></p>
<p>Ideally, we'd lean on an explicit
<code>spawn::async</code> instead of <code>spawn::blocking</code>. Futures should be designed for
brief, scoped lifespans rather than the 'static lifetime.</p>
<p>Maciej suggested to use a <a href="https://maciej.codes/2022-06-09-local-async.html">local async
runtime</a> which is
single-threaded by default and does <strong>not</strong> require types to be <code>Send</code> and
<code>'static</code>.</p>
<p>I fully agree.</p>
<p>However, I have little hope that the Rust community will change course at this
point. Tokio's roots run deep within the ecosystem and it feels like for better
or worse we're stuck with it.</p>
<p>In the realms of networking and web operations, it's likely that one of your
dependencies integrates Tokio, effectively nudging you towards its adoption. At
the time of writing, <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/tokio/rev">Tokio is used at runtime in 20,768 crates (of which 5,245
depend on it optionally)</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://corrode.dev/blog/async/runtimes.svg" alt="Runtime popularity bar chart between tokio, async-std, and smol with Tokio greatly dominating"></p>
<p>In spite of all this, we should not stop innovating in the async space!</p>
<h2 id="other-runtimes">Other Runtimes</h2>
<p>Going beyond Tokio, several other runtimes deserve more attention:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/smol-rs/smol">smol</a>: A small async runtime,
which is easy to understand. The entire executor is around
<a href="https://github.com/smol-rs/async-executor/blob/master/src/lib.rs">1000 lines of code</a>
with other parts of the ecosystem being similarly small.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy">embassy</a>: An async runtime for
embedded systems.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/DataDog/glommio">glommio</a>: An async runtime for I/O-bound
workloads, built on top of io_uring and using a thread-per-core model.</li>
</ul>
<p>These runtimes are important, as they explore alternative paths or open up new
use cases for async Rust. Drawing a parallel with, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@mre/111019994687648975">Rust's error handling
story</a>, the hope is that
competing designs will lead to a more robust foundation overall.
Especially, iterating on smaller runtimes that are less invasive and
single-threaded by default can help improve Rust's async story.</p>
<h2 id="async-vs-threads">Async vs Threads</h2>
<p>Regardless of runtime choice, we end up doing part of the kernel's job in user
space.</p>
<p>If you allow me a play on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_tenth_rule">Greenspun's tenth
rule</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any sufficiently advanced async Rust program contains an ad hoc,
informally-specified, potentially bug-ridden implementation of half of an
operating system's scheduler.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Modern operating systems come with highly optimized schedulers that are
excellent at multitasking and support async I/O through
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/776703/">io_uring</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/mre/fcat">splice</a>. We should make better use of these
capabilities.</p>
<p>Let's finally address the elephant in the room:
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/">Threads</a>, with their familiarity,
present a path to make synchronous code faster with minimal adjustments.</p>
<p>For example, take our sync code to read a file from above and put it into a
function:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span><span>fn</span> </span><span>read_contents</span></span><span><span>&lt;</span>T<span>:</span> <span><span>AsRef</span><span>&lt;</span>Path<span>&gt;</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>:</span> T</span><span><span><span>)</span></span></span></span><span> <span><span>-&gt;</span> <span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span>, <span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span>dyn Error<span>&gt;</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span></span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>

    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> contents <span>=</span> <span>String</span><span><span>::</span></span>new<span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>;</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>Ok</span><span><span>(</span>contents</span><span><span>)</span></span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span></span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>We can call this function inside the new <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/fn.scope.html">scoped

<p>That code looks almost identical to the single-threaded version! Notably, there
are no <code>.await</code> calls.</p>
<p>Were <code>read_contents</code> part of a public API, it could be used by both async and
sync callers, eliminating the need for an asynchronous runtime.</p>
<p>Async Rust might be more memory-efficient than threads, at the cost of
complexity and worse ergonomics. As an example, if the function were <em>async</em> and
you called it <em>outside</em> of a runtime, it would compile, but not run. Futures do
nothing unless being polled. This is a common footgun for newcomers.</p>

<p>In a recent benchmark, <a href="https://vorner.github.io/async-bench.html">async Rust was 2x faster than
threads</a>, but the <em>absolute</em>
difference was only <em>10ms per request</em>. To put this into perspective, <a href="https://github.com/bdrung/startup-time">this
about as long as PHP takes to start</a>. In
other words, the difference is negligible for most applications.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37641640">clarification on the aforementioned
benchmark</a>: Upon a closer
inspection, the disparity between async Rust and threads is notably smaller than
initially mentioned. In scenarios with a limited number of threads, traditional
threading even outperformed the async approach. This underscores the core
premise that, in real-world applications, the performance distinctions between
the two approaches are often negligible, if not slightly favoring threads. Thus,
it's crucial not to gravitate towards async Rust driven solely by anticipated
performance gains.</p>
<p>Thread-based frameworks, like the now-inactive
<a href="https://github.com/iron/iron">iron</a>, showcased the capability to effortlessly
handle <a href="https://github.com/iron/iron/wiki/How-to-Benchmark-hello.rs-Example">tens of thousands of requests per
second</a>.
This is further complemented by the fact modern Linux systems can manage <a href="https://thetechsolo.wordpress.com/2016/08/28/scaling-to-thousands-of-threads/">tens
of thousands of
threads</a>.</p>
<p>Turns out, computers are pretty good at doing multiple things at once!</p>
<p>As an important caveat, threads are not available or feasible in all
environments, such as embedded systems. My context for this article is primarily
conventional server-side applications that run on top of platforms like Linux or
Windows.</p>
<p>I would like to add that threaded code in Rust undergoes the same stringent
safety checks as the rest of your Rust code: It is protected from data races,
null dereferences, and dangling references, ensuring a level of thread safety
that prevents many common pitfalls found in concurrent programming, Since there
is no garbage collector, there never will be any stop-the-world pause to reclaim
memory. Traditional arguments against threads simply don't apply to Rust —
fearless concurrency is your friend!</p>
<p>If you find yourself needing to share state between threads, consider using a
channel:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>use</span> <span>std<span>::</span></span><span>error<span>::</span></span>Error<span>;</span>
<span>use</span> <span>std<span>::</span></span><span>path<span>::</span></span>Path<span>;</span>
<span>use</span> <span>std<span>::</span></span><span>sync<span>::</span></span>mpsc<span>;</span>
<span>use</span> <span>std<span>::</span></span>thread<span>;</span>

<span><span>//</span> Our error type needs to be `Send` to be used in a channel
</span><span><span>//</span> That's the only change we need to make to our original code
</span><span><span><span>fn</span> </span><span>read_contents</span></span><span><span>&lt;</span>T<span>:</span> <span><span>AsRef</span><span>&lt;</span>Path<span>&gt;</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>:</span> T</span><span><span><span>)</span></span></span></span><span> <span><span>-&gt;</span> <span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span>, <span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span>dyn Error <span>+</span> <span>Send</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span></span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<h3 id="use-async-rust-sparingly">Use Async Rust Sparingly</h3>
<p>My original intention was to advise newcomers to sidestep async Rust for now,
giving the ecosystem time to mature. However, I since acknowledged that this is
not feasible, given that a lot of libraries are async-first and new users will
encounter async Rust one way or another.</p>
<p>Instead, I would recommend to use async Rust only when you really need it. Learn
how to write good synchronous Rust first and then, if necessary, transition to
async Rust. Learn to walk before you run.</p>
<p>If you have to use async Rust, stick to Tokio and well-established libraries
like <a href="https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest">reqwest</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx">sqlx</a>.</p>
<p>While it may seem surprising given the context of this article, we can't
overlook Tokio's stronghold within the ecosystem. A vast majority of libraries
are tailored specifically for it. Navigating compatibility crates can pose
challenges, and sidestepping Tokio doesn't guarantee your dependencies won't
bring it in. I'm hoping for a future shift towards leaner runtimes, but for now,
Tokio stands out as the pragmatic choice for real-world implementations.</p>
<p>However, it's valuable to know that there are alternatives to Tokio and that
they are worth exploring.</p>
<h3 id="consider-the-alternatives">Consider The Alternatives</h3>
<p>At its core, Rust and its standard library offer just the absolute
essentials for <code>async/await</code>. The bulk of the work is done in
crates developed by the Rust community.
We should make more use of the ability to iterate on async Rust and
experiment with different designs before we settle on a final solution.</p>
<p>In binary crates, think twice if you really need to use async. It's probably
easier to just spawn a thread and get away with blocking I/O. In case you have a
CPU-bound workload, you can use <a href="https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon">rayon</a> to
parallelize your code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don't need async for performance reasons, threads can often be the
simpler alternative. — <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/01_getting_started/02_why_async.html#async-vs-threads-in-rust">the Async Book</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="isolate-async-code">Isolate Async Code</h3>
<p>If async is truly indispensable, consider isolating your async code from the
rest of your application.</p>
<p>Keep your domain logic synchronous and only use async for I/O and external
services. Following these guidelines will make your code <a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/">more
composable</a>
and accessible. On top of that, the error messages of sync Rust are much easier
to reason about than those of async Rust.</p>
<p>In your public library code, avoid async-only interfaces to make downstream
integration easier.</p>
<h3 id="keep-it-simple">Keep It Simple</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~ianmdlvl/rust-polyglot/async.html">Async Rust feels like a different
dialect</a>,
significantly more brittle than the rest of the language.</p>
<p>The default mode for writing Rust should be <em>synchronous</em>. Freely after
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22206779">Stroustup</a>:<br>
<em>Inside Rust, there is a smaller, simpler language that is waiting to get out.</em>
It is this language that most Rust code should be written in.</p>

However, to maintain focus, I've opted to address web frameworks in a dedicated
follow-up article.
