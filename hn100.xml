<p dir="auto">Black Candy use SQLite as database by default. Because SQLite can simplify the process of installation, and it's an ideal choice for self-hosted small server. If you think SQLite is not enough, or you are using some cloud service like heroku to host Black Candy, you can also use PostgreSQL as database.</p>

<p dir="auto">Black Candy supports use Nginx to delivery audio file to the client. It's a more effective way than handled by Black Candy backend. And Black Candy docker image is also ready for <a href="https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy">nginx-proxy</a>, which means you can set up a Nginx proxy for Black Candy easily.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can use docker-compose to set up those services. The docker-compose.yml file looks like this:</p>

            Bird flu has been on the rise in Washington state and one sanctuary was hit hard: 20 big cats – more than half of the facility’s population – died over the course of weeks.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm547w5dd00073b6mxjogyui4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The Wild Felid Advocacy Center of Washington announced the deaths Friday on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WildFelidAdvocacyCenter" target="_blank">Facebook</a>. The nonprofit sanctuary is in Shelton, about 22 miles northwest of Olympia.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm547u5dy00003b6mbwnsviwy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            “It’s been one big nightmare. I never thought something like this would happen to us,” the center’s director and cofounder Mark Mathews told CNN affiliate <a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/avian-influenza-bird-flu-wild-felid-advocacy-center-mark-matthews-co-founder-december-washington-department-fish-and-wildlife-cougar-bird-droppings" target="_blank">KOMO</a>. “Maybe only in a facility that had cats near each other, and ours are spread out over five acres.”
    </p>

            It is currently unknown exactly how the big cats contracted bird flu, but Mathews said the first death occurred around Thanksgiving.
    </p>

            The 20 animals that died include: five African Servals, four bobcats, four cougars, two Canada Lynxes, one Amur-Bengal tiger mix and other species of big cats.
    </p>

            “Tabbi, she was my favorite tiger,” Mathews told KOMO. “Before Thanksgiving, we had 37 cats. Today, we have 17 cats, (including) four recovering.”
    </p>

            The sanctuary is under quarantine and closed to the public to prevent further spread of the bird flu, it said in a statement. The center said it is working with federal and state animal health officials, disinfecting each enclosure and working with veterinarians on “prevention strategies while they oversee treatment to protect animal welfare.”
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm547wt73000l3b6m4oczeysb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The sanctuary hopes to reopen in the new year, according to the center’s <a href="https://www.wildfelids.org/index.html" target="_blank">website</a>.

            While it is unknown how the big cats contracted the bird flu, the sanctuary said it “spreads primarily through respiratory secretions and bird-to-bird contact and can also be contracted by carnivorous mammals that ingest birds or other products,” the center <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WildFelidAdvocacyCenter" target="_blank">said in its statement</a>.
    </p>

            Cats are particularly vulnerable to bird flu, which can cause subtle initial symptoms that may “progress rapidly, often resulting in death within 24 hours due to pneumonia-like conditions,” the center said. Symptoms include low energy, swelling of body parts, lack of coordination and diarrhea in pet birds, while cats and dogs may experience a fever, lethargy and low appetite, among other symptoms, according to the <a href="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/animal-health-and-welfare/animal-health/avian-influenza/avian-influenza-companion-animals" target="_blank">American Veterinary Medical Association</a>.

            “Usually, when a vet comes out and they do immobilization, they start to feel better, and with Harley (the cougar), it was different because he made it pretty obvious he wasn’t feeling better after his treatment,” sanctuary employee Jolie Connolly-Poe told KOMO.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm547wt73000q3b6mew5iuq4r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife <a href="https://wdfw.medium.com/avian-influenza-cases-increase-in-washington-a5cb8600ab0d" target="_blank">reported earlier this month</a> bird flu cases have been on the uptick across the state. It also confirmed two cougars contracted bird flu in another part of the state.
    </p>

  


    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm547wt73000r3b6marffzvwi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            “(I’m) feeling devastated, kind of in shock. It just feels terrible that you take such good care of them, and then something unforeseen takes its toll real fast,” Connolly-Poe said. The center is “just taking good care of those recovering.”
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm547wt73000s3b6m4qc0is9i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            In the 20 years since the sanctuary opened, Mathews told KOMO there hasn’t been an instance like this before. The center is taking additional precautions to avoid a further spread of bird flu as they prepare to disinfect everything.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm547wt73000t3b6m0d4rod2c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/virus-transmission/avian-in-other-animals.html" target="_blank">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> said it’s “rare for people to be infected with bird flu viruses through contact with infected wild, stray, feral, or domestic mammals” but it is possible if there is “prolonged and unprotected exposure” to the sick animal.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm547wt73000u3b6mbtutn7g6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            There have been two instances of bird flu being passed to a human from mammals, according to the CDC: one in 2016 involving a cat and the other in 2024 involving a cow.

<p dir="auto">By using those two techniques together:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>your attackers will have a tough time while trying to identify your real services.</li>
<li>the only way to determine if a service is emulated is through a protocol probe (imagine probing protocols for 65k open ports!).</li>
<li>it takes more than 8hours and 200MB of sent data in order to properly go through the reconessaince phase for your system ( nmap -sV -p - equivalent).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">*** Art of Active (Offensive) Defense***</p>
<p dir="auto">Portspoof can be used as an 'Exploitation Framework Frontend', that turns your system into responsive and aggressive machine. In practice this usually means exploiting your attackers' tools and exploits...
<em>At the moment there are few example exploits in the configuration file (portspoof.conf)</em></p>
<p dir="auto">Portspoof is meant to be a lightweight, fast, portable and secure addition to any firewall system or security system.</p>
<p dir="auto">The general goal of the program is to make the reconessaince phase slow and bothersome for your attackers as much it is only possible.
This is quite a change to the standard 5s Nmap scan, that will give a full view of your systems running services.</p>
<p dir="auto">The most important features that this software has:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>it will add some real pain to your attackers reconessaince phase.</li>
<li>it is a userland software and does not require root privileges !</li>
<li>it binds to just ONE tcp port per a running instance !</li>
<li>it is easily customizable through your iptables rules</li>
<li>marginal CPU and memory usage (multithreaded)</li>
<li>more than 9000 dynamic service signatures to feed your attackers scanning software !</li>
</ul>
</li>

It even plays a role in the $52.7 billion US,  €43 billion EU and $150 billion (unconfirmed) Chinese Chips Acts. Apple Silicon is the main reason TSMC opened a US factory [1], keeping its instruction set details secret is deemed important.</p><p>If you want more information, you should join our offline video discussions for more info.

Plenty of legacy software never <i>was</i> supported in Metal, it's "implementation detail" never manifested. It wasn't even really used in AI either until Apple upstreamed their own MPS hacks into Pytorch and people got BERT et. al. working, and even <i>that</i> was a pint-sized party trick that you could do on a Raspberry Pi.

Apple's GPU design is stuck in iPhone mode and they refuse to change their approach with Apple Silicon desktop hardware. It was Apple's big bet on NPUs that hamstrung them, not an implementation detail, and if you don't believe me then wait and see. Xserve didn't tear down the 1U market, Asahi didn't upend Linux HPC, and Metal isn't going to upend AI compute any more than DirectX will.

Your 720 Gbps is for a &gt;$8000 Mac Pro M2 Ultra but the number is to high because the 2x Gen4x16 is shared/oversubscribed with the other PCIe lanes for x8 PCIe slots, SSD and Thunderbolt. You need to measure/benchmark it, not read the marketing PR.</p><p>I estimate the $1400 M4 Pro Mac mini networking bandwidth by adding the external WiFi, 10 Gbps Ethernet, two USC-C ports (2 x 10 Gbps) and three Thunderbolt 4 ports (3 x 80/120 Gbps) but subtracting the PCIe 64 Gbps limit and not counting the internal SSD. Two $599 M4 Mac mini base models are faster and cheaper than one M4 Pro Mac mini.</p><p>The point of the precise actual measurements I did of the trillion opereations per second and the billion of bits per second networking/interconnect of the M4 Mac mini against all the other Apple silicon machines is to find which package (chip plus pcb plus case) has the best price/performance/watt balanced against them networked together. On januari 2025 you can build the cheapest fastest supercomputer in the world from just off the shelf M4 16Gb Mac mini base models with 10G Ethernet, Mikrotek 100G switches and a few FPGA's. It would outperform all Nvidia, Cerebras, Tenstorrent and datacenter clusters I know of, mainly because of the low power Apple Silicon.</p><p>Note that the M4 has only 1,2 Tips unified memory bandwidth and the M4 Pro has double that. The 8 Tops unified memory bandwidth is on the M1 and M2 Studio Ultra with 64/128/192GB DRAM. Without it you cant's reach 50 trillion operations per second. A Mac Studio has only around 190 Gbps external networking bandwidth but does not reach 43 trillion TOPS, as does the 720 Gbps of your Mac Pro estimate. By reverse engineering the instruction set you could squeeze a few percent extra performance out of this M4 cluster.</p><p>The 43 trillion TOPS of the M4 itself is an estimate. The ANE does 34 TOPS, the CPU less than 5 TOP depending on float type and we have no reliable benchmarks for the CPU floating point.</p></div></td></tr>

You can contact me for this highly technical report and several scientific papers (email in my profile).</p><p>Do you know of people who might buy a super computer based on better specifications? Or even just buyers who will go for 'the lowest Capex and the lowest Opex supercomputer in 2025-2027'?</p><p>Because the problem with HPC is that almost all funders and managers buy supercomputers with a safe brand name (Nvidia, AMD, Intel) at triple the cost and seldom from a super computer researcher as myself. But some do, if they understand why. I have been designing, selling, programming and operating super computers since 1984 (I was 20 years old then), this M4 Apple Silicon Cluster will be my ninth supercomputer. I prefer to build them from the ground up with our own chip and wafer scale integration designs but when an off-the-shelf chip is good enough I'll sell that instead. Price/Performance/Watt is what counts, ease of programming is a secondary consideration for what performance you achieve. Alan Kay argues you should rewrite your software from scratch [2] and do your own hardware [3] so that is what I've done sinds I learned from him.</p><p>&gt;Is it just a bunch of FPGAs issuing DMA TLPs?</p><p>No. The FPGA's are optional for when you want to flatten the inter-core (=inter-SRAM cache) networking with switches or routers to a shorter hop topology for the message passing like a Slim fly diameter two hop topology [4].</p><p>DMA (Direct Memory Access) TLPs (Transaction Layer Packets) are one of the worst ways of doing inter-core and inter-SRAM communication and on PCIe it has a huge 30% protocol overhead at triple the cost. Intel (and most other chip companies like NVIDIA, Altera, AMD/XILINX) can't design proper chips because they don't want to learn about software [2]. Apple Silicon is marginally better.</p><p>You should use pure message passing between any process, preferably in a programming language and a VM that uses pure message passing at the lowest level (Squeak, Erlang). Even better if you then map those software messages directly to message passing hardware as in my custom chips [3].</p><p>The reason to reverse Apple Silicon instructions for CPU, GPU and ANE are to be able to adapt my adaptive compiler to M4 chips but also to repurpose PCIe for low level message passing with much better performance and latency than DMA TLPs.</p><p>To conclude, if you want to get the cheapest Capex and Opex M4 Mac mini supercomputer you need to rewrite your supercomputing software in a high level language and message passing system like the parallel Squeak Smalltalk VM [3] with adaptive load balancing compilation. C, C++, Swift, MPI or CUDA would result in sub-optimal software performance and orders of magnitude more lines of code when optimal performance of parallel software is the goal.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_X_(supercomputer)" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_X_(supercomputer)</a></p><p>[2] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubaX1Smg6pY" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubaX1Smg6pY</a></p><p>[3] <a href="https://vimeo.com/731037615" rel="nofollow">https://vimeo.com/731037615</a></p><p>[4] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLjMrIWHsxs" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLjMrIWHsxs</a></p></div></td></tr>

<p>As Earth grows warmer, its ground is becoming drier and saltier, with profound consequences for the planet’s 8 billion inhabitants — nearly a third of whom already live in places where water is increasingly scarce and the ability to raise crops and livestock is increasingly difficult.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Climate change is accelerating this trend. New research has found global warming has made 77 percent of the Earth’s land drier over the past three decades while rapidly increasing the proportion of excessively salty soils.&nbsp;</p>    




<p>Drylands, or arid areas where water is hard to come by, now make up more than 40 percent of the planet (excluding Antarctica), a likely permanent consequence of climate change, <a href="https://www.unccd.int/resources/reports/global-threat-drying-lands-regional-and-global-aridity-trends-and-future">according to a landmark report</a> by the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, or UNCCD. Another new analysis, by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, or FAO, found that roughly <a href="https://openknowledge.fao.org/items/b17f6ad2-348b-41e7-8e4c-629fdc3c675c">10 percent of the world’s soils</a> are affected by excess salt, with another 2.5 billion acres at risk.</p>



<p>These interwoven trends threaten agricultural productivity, biodiversity, and ecosystem health while exacerbating food and water insecurity. Together, the two reports sound an urgent alarm: Unless the world curbs emissions, these shifts will continue, with grave implications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Without concerted efforts, billions face a future marked by hunger, displacement, and economic decline,” <a href="https://www.unccd.int/news-stories/press-releases/three-quarters-earths-land-became-permanently-drier-last-three-decades">said</a> Nichole Barger, an aridlands ecologist who works with the UNCCD.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some 7.6 percent of the planet’s land was remade by climate change between 1990 and 2020, with most of the impacted areas shifting from humid landscapes to drylands — defined as an area where 90 percent of rainfall evaporates before reaching the ground. Together, they cover a geographic expanse larger than Canada, researchers found, and in 2020 were home to about 30 percent of the world’s population. That’s a jump of more than 7 percent in recent decades. Unless the world sharply limits emissions, that proportion could more than double by the end of the century. By that point, more than two-thirds of land worldwide, with the exception of Greenland and Antarctica, is expected to store less <a href="https://grist.org/food-and-agriculture/water-availability-farmers-crops-food-agriculture/">water</a>.</p>



<p>These changes are not limited to regions already considered dry, or expected to experience desertification. When modeling global high-emissions scenarios, the researchers found similar changes could occur in the Midwest, central Mexico, and the Mediterranean, to name three examples. The researchers have no expectation that this trend will reverse.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What Hannah Waterhouse, a soil and water scientist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, finds “important, and unnerving to emphasize” is that this expansion occurred under conditions that aren’t nearly as hot as what’s to come. That suggests the problem will only escalate and, as food and water grow more scarce, <a href="https://grist.org/food-and-agriculture/one-in-11-people-went-hungry-last-year-climate-change-is-a-big-reason-why/">usher in issues like widespread conflict</a>, she said.</p>



<p>“We can look to current geopolitical and ecological events that are playing out currently to understand what we can expect in the future,” Waterhouse said. “Think of what is occurring in Sudan right now, where climate change is exacerbating resource scarcity, which is interacting in governance and geopolitics in violent outcomes for civilians.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Aridity is not to be confused with drought. Drought is best described as a sudden and startling, but temporary, water shortage often caused by low precipitation, high temperatures, little humidity, and unusual wind patterns. Arid regions, on the other hand, experience persistent, long-term climatic conditions in which evaporation exceeds rainfall, creating conditions in which it can be difficult to sustain life. It is much more subtle than a drought, but no less significant.</p>



<p>“Droughts end,” Ibrahim Thiaw, executive secretary of the UNCCD, <a href="https://time.com/7201214/three-quarters-of-the-earth-has-gotten-permanently-drier/">said in a statement</a>. “When an area’s climate becomes drier, however, the ability to return to previous conditions is lost. The drier climates now affecting vast lands across the globe will not return to how they were, and this change is redefining life on Earth.”</p>



<p>Expanding drylands are widely considered the biggest contributor to the degradation of Earth’s agricultural systems and difficulty producing enough food. Such conditions also have been linked to loss of gross domestic product, large-scale migration, and adverse health impacts and rising mortality. They intensify wildfires, sand storms, and dust storms while degrading ecosystems. They also promote erosion and the salinization of water and soil.</p>



<p>Climate change is already hampering food production, leaving <a href="https://grist.org/food-and-agriculture/one-in-11-people-went-hungry-last-year-climate-change-is-a-big-reason-why/">one in 11</a> people worldwide hungry last year, and the research suggests the problem will intensify, particularly in much of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. Under the business-as-usual emissions scenario, sub-Saharan Africa could lose as much as 22 percent of its current crop production capacity by 2050. The production of staple food crops grown in regions highly susceptible to aridity, such as soybeans, wheat, and rice, could plummet worldwide as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rapid expansion of the world’s drylands is “100 percent interconnected” with the coinciding surge in saltier soils, said Maria Konyushkova, a soil scientist at the Food and Agriculture Organization and lead author of the report the U.N. agency released December 11. The more arid an area is, the less freshwater is available. That requires farmers to rely upon brackish water, increasing soil salinity.</p>



<p>While water-soluble salt is a component of all soils, too much of it impairs plants’ water absorption, effectively stealing moisture from them and suppressing their growth. High salinity also changes soil structure, making it more prone to erosion. All of this diminishes soil fertility, and could lead to yield losses as high as 70 percent for crops like rice and beans in the countries most impacted, the researchers found. Roughly 10 percent of the world’s irrigated cropland, and a similar proportion of its rain-fed cropland, already has been impacted by this dire trend.</p>



<p>As it stands, 10 countries, including China, Russia, and the United States, account for 70 percent of the planet’s salt-affected soils. This costs the global agriculture sector at least $27 billion every year. If the world continues to warm at its current rate, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4336437/#:~:text=All%20soils%20contain%20some%20water,strongly%20suppresses%20the%20plant%20growth.">past research</a> has estimated that more than 50 percent of the world’s cropland would be similarly impacted by 2050, exacerbating the declining yields that are already driving <a href="https://grist.org/food-and-agriculture/one-in-11-people-went-hungry-last-year-climate-change-is-a-big-reason-why/">rising hunger rates</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where to go from here was the central topic of UNCCD COP16 earlier this month, as representatives of nearly 200 nations gathered in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to discuss land degradation, desertification, and drought. “We depend on land for our survival,” U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres <a href="https://wmo.int/media/news/un-conference-stop-treating-land-dirt">said at the conference</a>. “Yet we treat it like dirt.”</p>



<p>Nature-based solutions like agroecology are among the slate of locally-deployed mitigation and adaptation tactics the two reports suggest, alongside improved crop and water management, technological solutions, and the development of water-efficient and salt-resistant varieties of crops.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Big-dollar investments are being touted as solutions, too. Previous UNCCD <a href="https://www.unccd.int/news-stories/stories/poor-land-use-costs-countries-9-percent-equivalent-their-gdp">reports</a> found that halting the planet’s rate of land degradation, which they suggest could lose the global economy $23 trillion by 2050, would cost roughly $4.6 trillion. The agency told negotiators at the summit that <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158196">at least $2.6 trillion</a> for restoration and resilience purposes is needed by 2030.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the time the summit concluded, just over $12 billion had been pledged to tackle the issue across 80 vulnerable countries, while negotiators departed having failed to agree on a legally binding protocol for action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Waterhouse has doubts about some proposals highlighted in the research she considers “top-down technocratic solutions.” The Great Green Wall, a multibillion-dollar initiative to plant trees to combat desertification in the Sahel region of Africa, is one example. The effort, launched in 2007, has <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590332224000393">drawn criticism</a> for exacerbating water scarcity and biodiversity loss.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Konyushkova considers the two reports an urgent call for governments worldwide to prioritize investing in resilience efforts to manage what is clearly becoming a crisis. “All the trends show that the freshwater resources will be depleting … but we have so many approaches to adapt,” she said. “We just need to start doing it right now, because it’s already here. Even if governments don’t always understand, it’s already here, and deteriorating.” </p>
