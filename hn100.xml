		<h3>Abstract</h3>
		<p>We investigate whether an LLM can successfully perform financial statement analysis in a way similar to a professional human analyst. We provide standardized and anonymous financial statements to GPT4 and instruct the model to analyze them to determine the direction of future earnings. Even without any narrative or industry-specific information, the LLM outperforms financial analysts in its ability to predict earnings changes. The LLM exhibits a relative advantage over human analysts in situations when the analysts tend to struggle. Furthermore, we find that the prediction accuracy of the LLM is on par with the performance of a narrowly trained state-of-the-art ML model. LLM prediction does not stem from its training memory. Instead, we find that the LLM generates useful narrative insights about a company's future performance. Lastly, our trading strategies based on GPT's predictions yield a higher Sharpe ratio and alphas than strategies based on other models. Taken together, our results suggest that LLMs may take a central role in decision-making. </p>

The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/google-shopping-ai-search-generative-experience-1851028975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/google-shopping-ai-search-generative-experience-1851028975">AI is hallucinating</a></span> answers to several user queries, creating a less-than-trustworthy experience across Google’s flagship product. In the last week, Gizmodo received AI overviews from Google that reference <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/worst-google-ai-answers-glue-pizza-dogs-playing-sports-1851495298&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/worst-google-ai-answers-glue-pizza-dogs-playing-sports-1851495298">glue-topped pizza</a></span> and suggest Barack Obama was Muslim.<br></p><p>The hallucinations are concerning, but not entirely surprising. Like we’ve seen before with AI chatbots, this technology seems to confuse satire with journalism – several of the incorrect AI overviews we found seem to reference <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theonion.com/geologists-recommend-eating-at-least-one-small-rock-per-1846655112&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theonion.com/geologists-recommend-eating-at-least-one-small-rock-per-1846655112">The Onion</a></span>. The problem is that this AI offers an authoritative answer to millions of people who turn to Google Search daily to just look something up. Now, at least some of these people will be presented with hallucinated answers.</p><p>“The vast majority of AI Overviews provide high quality information, with links to dig deeper on the web,” said a Google spokesperson in an emailed statement to Gizmodo, noting many of the examples the company has seen have been from uncommon queries. “We’re taking swift action where appropriate under our content policies, and using these examples to develop broader improvements to our systems, some of which have already started to roll out.<strong>”</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>In my experience, AI overviews are more often right than wrong.  However, every wrong answer I get makes me question my entire experience on Google Search even more – I have to asses each answer carefully. Google notes that AI is “experimental” but they’ve opted everyone into this experiment by default.</p><p>“The thing with Search — we handle billions of queries,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/24158374/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-ai-search-gemini-future-of-the-internet-web-openai-decoder-interview&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/24158374/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-ai-search-gemini-future-of-the-internet-web-openai-decoder-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Verge</a></span> on Monday when asked about the AI overview rollout. “You can absolutely find a query and hand it to me and say, ‘Could we have done better on that query?’ Yes, for sure. But in many cases, part of what is making people respond positively to AI Overviews is that the summary we are providing clearly adds value and helps them look at things they may not have otherwise thought about.”</p><p>Strangely, Google Search occasionally responds to a query with “An AI overview is not available for this search,” while other times, Google will just not say anything and show traditional search results. I got this answer when I searched “what ethnicity are most US presidents” and when I searched “what fruits end in me.”</p><figure id="" data-id="f70bb6ae125cd44692ce2178afc54c5e" data-recommend-id="image://f70bb6ae125cd44692ce2178afc54c5e" data-format="png" data-width="746" data-height="218" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><div><picture><source media="(max-width: 37.31em)" type="image/jpeg" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-srcset="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/f70bb6ae125cd44692ce2178afc54c5e.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 37.37em)" type="image/jpeg" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-srcset="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/f70bb6ae125cd44692ce2178afc54c5e.jpg"><img alt="Image for article titled Google Search Is Now a Giant Hallucination" data-chomp-id="f70bb6ae125cd44692ce2178afc54c5e" data-format="png" data-height="218" data-alt="Image for article titled Google Search Is Now a Giant Hallucination" data-anim-src="" data-src="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/f70bb6ae125cd44692ce2178afc54c5e.jpg" src="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/f70bb6ae125cd44692ce2178afc54c5e.jpg"></picture></div><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Google Search</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f70bb6ae125cd44692ce2178afc54c5e" data-recommend-id="image://f70bb6ae125cd44692ce2178afc54c5e" data-format="png" data-width="746" data-height="218" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>A Google spokesperson says its systems occasionally start generating an AI overview, but stop it from appearing when it doesn’t meet its quality threshold.

It’s unclear if this “stop and start” AI overview generation is related.</p><p>What is clear is that Google felt pressured to put its money where its mouth is, and that means putting AI into Search. People are increasingly choosing ChatGPT, Perplexity, or other AI offerings as their main way to find information on the internet. Google views this race existentially, but it may have just jeopardized the Search experience by trying to catch up.</p><p>This week, Google Search has told people a lot of strange things through AI overviews.

  <article>
    <p>I needed a bit of a break from “real work” recently, so I started a new
programming project that was low-stakes and purely recreational. On April 21st,
I set out to see how much of a Unix-like operating system for x86_64 targets
that I could put together in about a month. The result is
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/bunnix">Bunnix</a>. Not including days I didn’t work
on Bunnix for one reason or another, I spent 27 days on this project.</p>
<p>Here’s a little demo of the results…</p>

<p>You can try it for yourself if you like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cyanide.ayaya.dev/bunnix.iso">Bunnix 0.0.0 iso</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To boot this ISO with qemu:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom bunnix.iso -display sdl -serial stdio
</code></pre><p>You can also write the iso to a USB stick and boot it on real hardware. It will
probably work on most AMD64 machines – I have tested it on a ThinkPad X220 and
a Starlabs Starbook Mk IV. Legacy boot and EFI are both supported. There are
some limitations to keep in mind, in particular that there is no USB support, so
a PS/2 keyboard (or PS/2 emulation via the BIOS) is required. Most laptops rig
up the keyboard via PS/2, and <abbr title="your milage may vary">YMMV</abbr>
with USB keyboards via PS/2 emulation.</p>
<p><em>Tip: the DOOM keybindings are weird. WASD to move, right shift to shoot, and
space to open doors. Exiting the game doesn’t work so just reboot when you’re
done playing. I confess I didn’t spend much time on that port.</em></p>
<h2 id="whats-there">What’s there?</h2>
<p>The Bunnix kernel is (mostly) written in <a href="https://harelang.org/">Hare</a>, plus some
C components, namely lwext4 for ext4 filesystem support and libvterm for the
kernel video terminal.</p>
<p>The kernel supports the following drivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>PCI (legacy)</li>
<li>AHCI block devices</li>
<li>GPT and MBR partition tables</li>
<li>PS/2 keyboards</li>
<li>Platform serial ports</li>
<li>CMOS clocks</li>
<li>Framebuffers (configured by the bootloaders)</li>
<li>ext4 and memfs filesystems</li>
</ul>
<p>There are numerous supported kernel features as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>A virtual filesystem</li>
<li>A /dev populated with block devices, null, zero, and full psuedo-devices,
/dev/kbd and /dev/fb0, serial and video TTYs, and the /dev/tty controlling
terminal.</li>
<li>Reasonably complete terminal emulator and somewhat passable termios support</li>
<li>Some 40 syscalls, including for example clock_gettime, poll, openat et al,
fork, exec, pipe, dup, dup2, ioctl, etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Bunnix is a single-user system and does not currently attempt to enforce Unix
file modes and ownership, though it could be made multi-user relatively easily
with a few more days of work.</p>
<p>Included are two bootloaders, one for legacy boot which is multiboot-compatible
and written in Hare, and another for EFI which is written in C. Both of them
load the kernel as an ELF file plus an initramfs, if required. The EFI
bootloader includes zlib to decompress the initramfs; multiboot-compatible
bootloaders handle this decompression for us.</p>
<p>The userspace is largely assembled from third-party sources. The following
third-party software is included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Colossal Cave Adventure (advent)</li>
<li>dash (/bin/sh)</li>
<li>Doom</li>
<li>gzip</li>
<li>less (pager)</li>
<li>lok (/bin/awk)</li>
<li>lolcat</li>
<li>mandoc (man pages)</li>
<li>sbase (core utils)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></li>
<li>tcc (C compiler)</li>
<li>Vim 5.7</li>
</ul>
<p>The libc is derived from musl libc and contains numerous modifications to suit
Bunnix’s needs. The curses library is based on netbsd-curses.</p>
<p>The system works but it’s pretty buggy and some parts of it are quite slapdash:
your milage will vary. Be prepared for it to crash!</p>
<h2 id="how-bunnix-came-together">How Bunnix came together</h2>
<p>I started documenting the process on Mastodon on day 3 – check out <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@drewdevault/112319697309218275">the
Mastodon thread</a> for the
full story. Here’s what it looked like on day 3:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.fosstodon.org/media_attachments/files/112/319/693/110/194/041/original/2c0bd7006a74aece.png" alt="Screenshot of an early Bunnix build, which boots up, sets up available memory, and exercises an early in-memory filesystem"></p>
<p>Here’s some thoughts after the fact.</p>
<p>Some of Bunnix’s code stems from an earlier project,
<a href="https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/helios">Helios</a>. This includes portions of the kernel
which are responsible for some relatively generic CPU setup (GDT, IDT, etc), and
some drivers like AHCI were adapted for the Bunnix system. I admit that it would
probably not have been possible to build Bunnix so quickly without prior
experience through Helios.</p>
<p>Two of the more challenging aspects were ext4 support and the virtual terminal,
for which I brought in two external dependencies, lwext4 and libvterm. Both
proved to be challenging integrations. I had to rewrite my filesystem layer a
few times, and it’s still buggy today, but getting a proper Unix filesystem
design (including openat and good handling of inodes) requires digging into
lwext4 internals a bit more than I’d have liked. I also learned a lot about
mixing source languages into a Hare project, since the kernel links together
Hare, assembly, and C sources – it works remarkably well but there are some
pain points I noticed, particularly with respect to building the ABI integration
riggings. It’d be nice to automate conversion of C headers into Hare forward
declaration modules. Some of this work already exists in hare-c, but has a ways
to go. If I were to start again, I would probably be more careful in my design
of the filesystem layer.</p>
<p>Getting the terminal right was difficult as well. I wasn’t sure that I was going
to add one at all, but I eventually decided that I wanted to port vim and that
was that. libvterm is a great terminal state machine library, but it’s poorly
documented and required a lot of fine-tuning to integrate just right. I also
ended up spending a lot of time on performance to make sure that the terminal
worked smoothly.</p>
<p>Another difficult part to get right was the scheduler. Helios has a simpler
scheduler than Bunnix, and while I initially based the Bunnix scheduler on
Helios I had to throw out and rewrite quite a lot of it. Both Helios and Bunnix
are single-CPU systems, but unlike Helios, Bunnix allows context switching
within the kernel – in fact, even preemptive task switching enters and exits
via the kernel. This necessitates multiple kernel stacks and a different
approach to task switching. However, the advantages are numerous, one of which
being that implementing blocking operations like disk reads and pipe(2) are much
simpler with wait queues. With a robust enough scheduler, the rest of the kernel
and its drivers come together pretty easily.</p>
<p>Another source of frustration was signals, of course. Helios does not attempt to
be a Unix and gets away without these, but to build a Unix, I needed to
implement signals, big messy hack though they may be. The signal implementation
which ended up in Bunnix is pretty bare-bones: I mostly made sure that SIGCHLD
worked correctly so that I could port dash.</p>
<p>Porting third-party software was relatively easy thanks to basing my libc on
musl libc. I imported large swaths of musl into my own libc and adapted it to
run on Bunnix, which gave me a pretty comprehensive and reliable C library
pretty fast. With this in place, porting third-party software was a breeze, and
most of the software that’s included was built with minimal patching.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h2>
<p>Bunnix was an interesting project to work on. My other project, Helios, is a
microkernel design that’s Not Unix, while Bunnix is a monolithic kernel that is
much, much closer to Unix.</p>
<p>One thing I was surprised to learn a lot about is filesystems. Helios, as a
microkernel, spreads the filesystem implementation across many drivers running
in many separate processes. This works well enough, but one thing I discovered
is that it’s quite important to have caching in the filesystem layer, even if
only to track living objects. When I revisit Helios, I will have a lot of work
to do refactoring (or even rewriting) the filesystem code to this end.</p>
<p>The approach to drivers is also, naturally, much simpler in a monolithic kernel
design, though I’m not entirely pleased with all of the stuff I heaped into ring
0. There might be room for an improved Helios scheduler design that incorporates
some of the desirable control flow elements from the monolithic design into a
microkernel system.</p>
<p>I also finally learned how signals work from top to bottom, and boy is it ugly.
I’ve always felt that this was one of the weakest points in the design of Unix
and this project did nothing to disabuse me of that notion.</p>
<p>I had also tried to avoid using a bitmap allocator in Helios, and generally
memory management in Helios is a bit fussy altogether – one of the biggest pain
points with the system right now. However, Bunnix uses a simple bitmap allocator
for all conventional pages on the system and I found that it works really,
really well and does not have nearly as much overhead as I had feared it would.
I will almost certainly take those lessons back to Helios.</p>
<p>Finally, I’m quite sure that putting together Bunnix in just 30 days is a feat
which would not have been possible with a microkernel design. At the end of the
day, monolithic kernels are just much simpler to implement. The advantages of a
microkernel design are compelling, however – perhaps a better answer lies in a
hybrid kernel.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next</h2>
<p>Bunnix was (note the past tense) a project that I wrote for the purpose of
recreational programming, so it’s purpose is to be fun to work on. And I’ve had
my fun! At this point I don’t feel the need to invest more time and energy into
it, though it would definitely benefit from some. In the future I may spend a
few days on it here and there, and I would be happy to integrate improvements
from the community – send patches to my <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/public-inbox">public inbox</a>. But for the most
part it is an art project which is now more-or-less complete.</p>
<p>My next steps in OS development will be a return to Helios with a lot of lessons
learned and some major redesigns in the pipeline. But I still think that Bunnix
is a fun and interesting OS in its own right, in no small part due to its
demonstration of Hare as a great language for kernel hacking. Some of the
priorities for improvements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A directory cache for the filesystem and better caching generally</li>
<li>Ironing out ext4 bugs</li>
<li>procfs and top</li>
<li>mmaping files</li>
<li>More signals (e.g. SIGSEGV)</li>
<li>Multi-user support</li>
<li>NVMe block devices</li>
<li>IDE block devices</li>
<li>ATAPI and ISO 9660 support</li>
<li>Intel HD audio support</li>
<li>Network stack</li>
<li>Hare toolchain in the base system</li>
<li>Self hosting</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether or not it’s me or one of you readers who will work on these first
remains to be seen.</p>
<p>In any case, have fun playing with Bunnix!</p>

<p>Spotify announced today that it's bricking all purchased Car Things on December 9 and not offering refunds or trade-in options. On a <a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/car-thing-discontinued/">support page</a>, Spotify says:</p>
<blockquote><p>We're discontinuing Car Thing as part of our ongoing efforts to streamline our product offerings. We understand it may be disappointing, but this decision allows us to focus on developing new features and enhancements that will ultimately provide a better experience to all Spotify users.</p></blockquote>
<p>Spotify has no further guidance for device owners beyond asking them to reset the device to factory settings and “safely” get rid of the bricked gadget by “following local electronic waste guidelines.”</p>
<p>The company also said that it doesn’t plan to release a follow-up to the Car Thing.</p>
<h2>Early demise</h2>
<p>Car Thing came out to limited subscribers in October 2021 before <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/02/spotify-car-thing-is-a-90-thing-that-plays-spotify-in-your-car/">releasing to the general public</a> in February 2022.</p>
<p>In its Q2 2022 earnings report released in July, Spotify revealed that it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/07/spotify-is-no-longer-making-its-car-thing-music-player/">stopped making Car Things. </a>In a chat with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/27/spotify-exits-short-lived-car-thing-hardware-play-as-reports-q2-maus-of-433m-offsetting-russia-exit-and-service-outage/">TechCrunch</a>, it cited "several factors, including product demand and supply chain issues." A Spotify rep also told the publication that the devices would continue to “perform as intended,” but that was apparently a temporary situation.</p>
<p>Halted production was a warning sign that Car Thing was in peril. However, at that time, Spotify also cut the device’s price from $90 to $50, which could have encouraged people to buy a device that would be useless a few years later.</p>
<p>Car Thing's usefulness was always dubious, though. The device has a 4-inch touchscreen and knob for easy navigation, as well as support for Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and voice control. But it also required users to subscribe to Spotify Premium, which starts at $11 per month. Worse, Car Thing requires a phone using data or Wi-Fi connected via Bluetooth in order to work, making the Thing seem redundant.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>In its Q1 2022 report, Spotify said that quitting Car Thing hurt gross margins and that it took a 31 million euro (about $31.4 million at the time) hit on the venture.</p>
<h2>Open source pleas</h2>
<p>Spotify's announcement has sent some Car Thing owners to online forums to share their disappointment with Spotify and beg the company to open-source the device instead of dooming it for recycling centers at best. As of this writing, there are over 50 posts on the <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/forums/searchpage/tab/message?advanced=false&amp;allow_punctuation=false&amp;q=car%20thing">Spotify Community</a> forums showing concern about the discontinuation, with many demanding a refund and/or calling for open-sourcing. There are similar discussions happening elsewhere online, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CarThing/">like on Reddit</a>, where users have used phrases like "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/1cyx5fs/comment/l5ckxkv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">entirely unnacceptable</a>" to describe the news.</p>
<p>A Spotify Community member going by AaronMickDee, for example, <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/With-Car-Thing-being-sunsetted-would-you-open-source-the-device/idi-p/6088742">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I'd rather not just dispose of the device. I think there is a community that would love the idea of having a device we can customize and use for other uses other than a song playback device.</p>
<p>Would Spotify be willing to maybe unlock the system and allow users to write/flash 3rd party firmware to the device?</p></blockquote>
<p>A Spotify spokesperson declined to answer Ars' questions about why Car Thing isn't being open-sourced and concerns around e-waste and wasted money.</p>
<p>Instead, a company rep told Ars, in part: “The goal of our Car Thing exploration in the US was to learn more about how people listen in the car. <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2022-07-27/spotify-reports-second-quarter-2022-earnings/">In July 2022,</a> we announced we’d stop further production and now it’s time to say goodbye to the devices entirely." I followed up with Spotify's rep to ask again about making the device open source but didn't hear back.</p>
<p>At this point, encouraging customers to waste nearly $100 on a soon-obsolete device hasn't resulted in any groundbreaking innovations or lessons around "how people listen in the car." In their initial response, Spotify's rep pointed me to a <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/?s=how+to+listen+to+spotify+in+the+car">Spotify site</a> that searches Spotify's newsroom for "how to listen to Spotify in the car." One of the <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-08-26/how-to-listen-to-spotify-in-the-car/">top posts </a>is from 2019 and states that “if your car has an AUX or USB socket, using a cable is probably one of the fastest ways to connect by using your phone."</p>
<p>As for Spotify, using customer dollars for company-serving learning experiences isn't the best business plan. And for regular users, it's best to avoid investing in an unproven hardware venture from a software company.</p>
<p>As Redditor Wemie1420 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CarThing/comments/1cywpze/comment/l5ccejb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">put it</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Doesn’t feel great that there is literally no alternative other than trashing it. Feels like we’re being punished for supporting them. Dissuades me from buying anything Spotify puts out in the future. I feel like there would be some way to approach this without being like, 'yeah we’re done. Just throw it out it’s a waste of money now.'</p></blockquote>

<article id="post-67489">
	
	<div>
			<p>A letter from Lewis Carroll to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/035517a0"><em>Nature</em></a>, March 31, 1887:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Having hit upon the following method of mentally computing the day of the week for any given date, I send it you in the hope that it may interest some of your readers. I am not a rapid computer myself, and as I find my average time for doing any such question is about 20 seconds, I have little doubt that a rapid computer would not need 15.</p>
<p>Take the given date in 4 portions, viz. the number of centuries, the number of years over, the month, the day of the month.</p>
<p>Compute the following 4 items, adding each, when found, to the total of the previous items. When an item or total exceeds 7, divide by 7, and keep the remainder only.</p>
<p><em>The Century-Item.</em> — For Old Style (which ended September 2, 1752) subtract from 18. For New Style (which began September 14) divide by 4, take overplus from 3, multiply remainder by 2. [The Century-Item is the first two digits of the year, so for 1811 take 18.]</p>
<p><em>The Year-Item.</em> — Add together the number of dozens, the overplus, and the number of 4’s in the overplus.</p>
<p><em>The Month-Item.</em> — If it begins or ends with a vowel, subtract the number, denoting its place in the year, from 10. This, plus its number of days, gives the item for the following month. The item for January is ‘0’; for February or March (the 3rd month), ‘3’; for December (the 12th month), ’12.’ [So, for clarity, the required final numbers after division by 7 are January, 0; February, 3; March, 3; April, 6; May, 1; June, 4; July, 6; August 2; September, 5; October, 0; November, 3; and December, 5.]</p>
<p><em>The Day-Item</em> is the day of the month.</p>
<p>The total, thus reached, must be corrected, by deducting ‘1’ (first adding 7, if the total be ‘0’), if the date be January or February in a Leap Year: remembering that every year, divisible by 4, is a Leap Year, excepting only the century-years, in New Style, when the number of centuries is <em>not</em> so divisible (<em>e.g.</em> 1800).</p>
<p>The final result gives the day of the week, ‘0’ meaning Sunday, ‘1’ Monday, and so on.</p>
<p>Examples</p>
<p>1783, <em>September</em> 18</p>
<p>17, divided by 4, leaves ‘1’ over; 1 from 3 gives ‘2’; twice 2 is ‘4.’</p>
<p>83 is 6 dozen and 11, giving 17; plus 2 gives 19, <em>i.e.</em> (dividing by 7) ‘5.’ Total 9, <em>i.e.</em> ‘2.’</p>
<p>The item for August is ‘8 from 10,’ <em>i.e.</em> ‘2’; so, for September, it is ‘2 plus 3,’ <em>i.e.</em> ‘5.’ Total 7, <em>i.e.</em> ‘0,’ which goes out.</p>
<p>18 gives ‘4.’ Answer, <em>‘Thursday.’</em></p>
<p>1676, <em>February</em> 23</p>
<p>16 from 18 gives ‘2.’</p>
<p>76 is 6 dozen and 4, giving 10; plus 1 gives 11, <em>i.e.</em> ‘4.’ Total ‘6.’</p>
<p>The item for February is ‘3.’ Total 9, <em>i.e.</em> ‘2.’</p>
<p>23 gives ‘2.’ Total ‘4.’</p>
<p>Correction for Leap Year gives ‘3.’ Answer, <em>‘Wednesday.’</em>
</p></blockquote>

    <span>2D Rigid Body Collision Resolution</span><br>
    <span>Part 1: Defining the problem</span><!--]--></h2><p><!--[-->From Mario bouncing off a Goomba to two cars bumping into each other in a racing
game, dealing with collisions is such an integral part of most video games that
we often take it for granted.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->In this series of blog posts, I want to show you what actually goes on behind the
scenes in a physics simulation like the one above.
While we're going to look at this through the lens video games, this post is
really about the actual math and physics of collisions.
Video games are just a nice way to contextualize these concepts and help make
things a little less abstract.<!--]--></p><div><p>A word about math</p><!--[--><p><!--[-->While these articles will involve a fair bit of math, please don't be discouraged
by that if you don't consider yourself to be a "math person".
I think this kind of thinking is harmful and actively prevents you from engaging
with topics that you might actually enjoy!<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Many times, it's the math <em><!--[-->notation<!--]--></em> that makes things look more complicated
than they actually are because it's so information-dense and unfamiliar.
Most of the math in these articles will be fairly straight-forward arithmetic
but dressed up to look fancy!<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->This is something that's really dear to my heart.
I think too many people have this instinctive reaction of
<em><!--[-->"I'm not smart enough to understand this"<!--]--></em> whenever they see any kind of math
notation.
While I can definitely empathize with this, I encourage you to fight this
reaction because at some point it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.<!--]--></p><!--]--></div><h2 id="before-we-start"><a href="#before-we-start"><!--[-->Before we start<!--]--></a></h2><p><!--[-->Let's set our expectations and define a few terms.<!--]--></p><h3 id="rigid-bodies"><a href="#rigid-bodies"><!--[-->Rigid bodies<!--]--></a></h3><p><!--[-->The specific kind of physics simulation we are going to cover is called
<strong><!--[-->rigid body physics<!--]--></strong>.
A <strong><!--[-->rigid body<!--]--></strong> is a body that does not deform when subjected to forces.
This is an idealized model because true rigid bodies do not exist in the real
world; everything deforms on the molecular level even if this deformation
is not visible to the naked eye.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->For most physics simulations, trying to simulate this level of detail is not
only extremely difficult (if not flat out impossible) and computationally
expensive, it's also unnecessary.
As long as our bodies behave realistically, we're allowed to simplify as much
as we want.
Rigid bodies are one such simplification.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->This might sound a little abstract at the moment but will hopefully start to
make sense as we work through our examples.<!--]--></p><h3 id="collision-detection-vs-collision-resolution"><a href="#collision-detection-vs-collision-resolution"><!--[-->Collision detection vs. collision resolution<!--]--></a></h3><p><!--[-->In a video game engine, dealing with collisions can be broken down into two
distinct phases: <strong><!--[-->collision detection<!--]--></strong> and <strong><!--[-->collision resolution<!--]--></strong>.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Collision detection is about determining which bodies in our scene are
colliding.
This usually involves a bunch of geometry to check if two shapes are
intersecting or overlapping.
Depending on how many objects there are in our scene, this can be quite
computationally expensive and is usually heavily optimized.
The result of this step is then used in the collision resolution step.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Collision resolution is the process of figuring out what needs to happen to
two colliding bodies based on things like their current movement directions,
speeds, materials, and many other things.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->In this series of blog posts, we're only looking at the <strong><!--[-->collision resolution<!--]--></strong>
phase as this where all the interesting physics happens.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Ok, enough preamble. Let's get started!<!--]--></p><h2 id="what-are-we-trying-to-do"><a href="#what-are-we-trying-to-do"><!--[-->What are we trying to do?<!--]--></a></h2><p><!--[-->Let's start out by trying to define the problem we're trying to solve.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Most games run in a big loop. In order to make things move on the screen, the
game engine needs to continually calculate the positions of the various objects
in the scene.
So on each iteration of the game loop, the position of each of object
gets updated a tiny amount based on its current <strong><!--[-->velocity<!--]--></strong>.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Velocity is a vector quantity, meaning it has both a magnitude and a direction.
We can represent an object's current velocity with an arrow where the length of
the arrow represents the object's current speed and the direction the arrow
is pointing its travel direction.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->In the demonstration below, you can change the box's
<strong><!--[--><span>velocity</span><!--]--></strong> by dragging the <strong><!--[--><span>arrow</span><!--]--></strong> around.

Therefore, we can see that displacement is also a vector quantity, meaning it

We then add the displacement to the object's current position to get its new

What are these laws?
Well, that's what the majority of this series of articles is going to be about!<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->To start, let's try defining what a collision is a little more rigorously.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Take a look at the scene below.
This scene shows two bodies on a specific frame of our game.
We can see that the bodies are touching, but are they <em><!--[-->colliding<!--]--></em>?<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->In the last section we learned that two bodies are said to be colliding if
continuing to move them along their current velocities would cause them to
penetrate each other.
So, with the information we've been given, can we actually determine if the
scene above depicts a collision or not?<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->We can't!
All we know is that the bodies are touching.
We haven't been given any information about their velocities.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->To see why this matters, take a look at the demonstration below.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->You can change the velocities of the bodies by dragging the
<strong><!--[--><span>arrows</span><!--]--></strong> around.
The indicator tells you if the current configuration would lead to a
<span>collision</span>
or <span>no&nbsp;collision</span>.
You can verify the result by playing the simulation.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->We can see that depending on the velocities of the bodies, the same scene can
either represent a collision or not.<!--]--></p><div><p>That doesn't look right</p><!--[--><p><!--[-->You might have noticed that the way the two boxes bounce off each other looks
a little strange.
This is because, in order to keep things simple for now, we're not yet
making the boxes spin when they hit each other.
Don't worry we'll add that in a later post, but let's try and keep the
complexity to a minimum for now.<!--]--></p><!--]--></div><h3 id="towards-a-definition"><a href="#towards-a-definition"><!--[-->Towards a definition<!--]--></a></h3><p><!--[-->In order for two bodies to be colliding, two conditions have to be met:<!--]--></p><ol><!--[--><li><!--[-->The bodies' geometries have to be touching or overlapping<!--]--></li><li><!--[-->The bodies are still moving <em><!--[-->towards the collision<!--]--></em><!--]--></li><!--]--></ol><p><!--[-->Let's assume that point 1 is true for now and focus on point 2, instead.
What does it mean for two bodies to be moving "towards the collision"?
This seems like a pretty circular definition.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Instead of asking what it means to move towards the collision, let's ask what it
means to move <em><!--[-->away<!--]--></em> from the collision.
In fact, let's ignore collisions entirely for a moment.
What does it mean to move away from a <em><!--[-->surface<!--]--></em>?<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->The image below shows a box sitting on the floor.
What direction would you have to move the box in order to move it away from the
floor?<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->At first glance, this seems like a silly question.
Obviously, we'd have to move the box <em><!--[-->up<!--]--></em>.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->However, there are an infinite number of directions that we could move the box!
As long as we are moving it <em><!--[-->generally<!--]--></em> upwards, we are increasing the distance
between the box and the floor.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Notice that while the box was moved the exact same distance in each
direction—that is, the length of the <strong><!--[--><span>arrows</span><!--]--></strong> is the
same—some of the boxes are clearly further away from the floor than others.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->So, are some of these directions more "up" than others?
Is there a direction that is <em><!--[-->most<!--]--></em> "up"?<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->To explore this idea, let's play a little game.<!--]--></p><h3 id="surface-normals"><a href="#surface-normals"><!--[-->Surface normals<!--]--></a></h3><p><!--[-->You are given a box sitting on the floor.
Your goal is to move the box so that its distance to the floor is as close as
possible to the total distance the box was moved.
It doesn't matter how far you move the box, just that these two distances are
as close to each other as possible.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->To make things a little more challenging, the angle of inclination of the floor
is going to change every time you reset the game.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->I know, I know, Game of the Year material right here.
But hopefully you were able to figure out that the direction that maximizes the
distance between the box and the floor is the direction that is <em><!--[-->perpendicular<!--]--></em>
to the floor, which isn't necessarily straight up!<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->This direction is called the <strong><!--[-->normal direction<!--]--></strong>, often referred to as simply
the <strong><!--[-->normal<!--]--></strong> of the surface.
The normal direction of a surface is always perpendicular to the surface.
It is the direction that points <em><!--[-->directly away<!--]--></em> from the surface.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Normal directions are represented with a <strong><!--[-->normalized vector<!--]--></strong>; that is, a
vector with length <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>.
A vector with length <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> is also called a <strong><!--[-->unit vector<!--]--></strong>.
To make it clear that a vector is normalized, we often add a little hat on top
of the variable like this <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mover accent="true"><mi>n</mi><mo>^</mo></mover></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\hat{n}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->If our surface is perfectly straight, the normal direction is the same
everywhere on the surface.
However, if the surface is curved, the normal direction will be different for
each point on the surface.
The easiest way to demonstrate this is with a circle.
If we stick with the idea that the normal direction points directly away from
a surface, then the normal direction for any point on the circle's circumference
is the direction from the center of the circle to that point.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->More generally, the <strong><!--[--><span>normal</span><!--]--></strong> direction for a point on a
surface is perpendicular to the <strong><!--[--><span>tangent</span><!--]--></strong> of the surface
at that point.<!--]--></p><!--[--><!--]--><p><!--[-->We saw earlier that it isn't necessary to move the box <em><!--[-->directly<!--]--></em> in the normal
direction in order to move it away from the floor.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->What all these directions have in common, is that they all generally point in
the same direction as the surface normal.
We say that these directions have <em><!--[-->some component in the normal direction<!--]--></em>.
Let's take a closer look at what this means, exactly.<!--]--></p><h3 id="the-dot-product"><a href="#the-dot-product"><!--[-->The dot product<!--]--></a></h3><p><!--[-->To calculate how much of one vector is pointing in the same direction as another
vector, we can use the <strong><!--[-->dot product<!--]--></strong> of the two vectors.
In our example, the two vectors are the direction we move the box and the
surface normal.
The dot product between two vectors <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mover accent="true"><mi>a</mi><mo>⃗</mo></mover></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\vec{a}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> and

what this scalar <em><!--[-->represents<!--]--></em>.
Luckily, there is also a geometric interpretation of the dot product that can be
visualized nicely.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Say we have two vectors <strong><!--[--><span>a</span><!--]--></strong> and <strong><!--[--><span>b</span><!--]--></strong> that
have some angle <strong><!--[--><span>θ</span><!--]--></strong> between them.<!--]--></p><!--[--><!----><!--]--><p><!--[-->Next, starting from the tip of <strong><!--[--><span>a</span><!--]--></strong> let's draw a line

two vectors.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->To be precise, it's the <em><!--[-->absolute value<!--]--></em> of the scalar projection that gives us
the length of the shadow, since we will see in a moment that the scalar

Why are we suddenly talking about the <em><!--[-->unit vector in the direction of

What's our surface and its corresponding normal?
What we're looking for is called the <em><!--[-->collision normal<!--]--></em>.
Unfortunately, the way you calculate the collision normal depends on the shapes
(or geometries) of the colliding bodies, so I can't just show you a single
formula.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->What we're dealing with is called a <em><!--[-->vertex-edge collision<!--]--></em>.
In this type of collision, a point (or vertex) on one body collides with a
side (or edge) of another body.
We'll talk more about collision normals when we take a look at the forces that
act during the collision.
For now, you'll have to take my word that in a vertex-edge collision, the
collision normal is perpendicular to the edge.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->In our example, the <strong><!--[--><span>collision normal</span><!--]--></strong> looks like this:<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->If we label our bodies <strong><!--[-->a<!--]--></strong> and <strong><!--[-->b<!--]--></strong>, by convention, the collision normal
points toward body <strong><!--[-->a<!--]--></strong>.
It's fairly arbitrary which body is called <strong><!--[-->a<!--]--></strong> or <strong><!--[-->b<!--]--></strong> as long as we're
consistent throughout our calculations.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Based on what we learned about surface normals earlier, the
<strong><!--[--><span>collision normal</span><!--]--></strong> tells us the direction that points
directly away from the surface of the collision.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->We can now calculate the dot product between the relative velocity of the bodies

determine if the bodies are moving towards the collision or not.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->We'll call this value the <em><!--[-->relative normal velocity<!--]--></em>.
It is the component of the relative velocity in the direction of the collision
normal.
For now, we only care about the sign of the relative normal velocity, but we'll
see later on that it plays an important part in calculating the forces that act
during the collision.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Using our understanding of the dot product, we can say that<!--]--></p><ul><!--[--><li><!--[-->if the relative normal velocity is <strong><!--[-->positive<!--]--></strong>, the bodies are already
separating<!--]--></li><li><!--[-->if the relative normal velocity is <strong><!--[-->negative<!--]--></strong>, the bodies are still smashing
into each other<!--]--></li><!--]--></ul><p><!--[-->The demonstration below combines all concepts we've learned so far.
As before, you can change the <strong><!--[--><span>velocities</span><!--]--></strong> of the boxes by
dragging the arrowheads.
The top right corner shows the <strong><!--[--><span>collision normal</span><!--]--></strong> and
<strong><!--[--><span>relative velocity</span><!--]--></strong> of the bodies.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->You can see that as soon as the angle between the
<strong><!--[--><span>relative velocity</span><!--]--></strong> and the
<strong><!--[--><span>collision normal</span><!--]--></strong> is less than or equal to

no longer colliding.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->So, finally, we can formally define what a collision is:<!--]--></p><div><p>Definition</p><!--[--><p><!--[-->A collision occurs when a point on one body touches a point on another body
with a negative relative normal velocity.<!--]--></p><!--]--></div><p><!--[-->Neat!<!--]--></p><h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion"><!--[-->Conclusion<!--]--></a></h2><p><!--[-->If you made it to this point, pat yourself on the back!
We now have a formal definition of what a collision is, as well as the set of
equations we're ultimate trying to solve when resolving collisions
(see <span></span>).
Not bad at all!<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->In the next post, we'll dive into the actual physics behind collisions.

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Overview</h2><a id="user-content-overview" aria-label="Permalink: Overview" href="#overview"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Perplexica is an open-source AI-powered searching tool or an AI-powered search engine that goes deep into the internet to find answers. Inspired by Perplexity AI, it's an open-source option that not just searches the web but understands your questions. It uses advanced machine learning algorithms like similarity searching and embeddings to refine results and provides clear answers with sources cited.</p>
<p dir="auto">Using SearxNG to stay current and fully open source, Perplexica ensures you always get the most up-to-date information without compromising your privacy.</p>
<p dir="auto">Want to know more about its architecture and how it works? You can read it <a href="https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/architecture/README.md">here</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Preview</h2><a id="user-content-preview" aria-label="Permalink: Preview" href="#preview"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/blob/master/.assets/perplexica-preview.gif"><img src="https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/raw/master/.assets/perplexica-preview.gif" alt="video-preview" data-animated-image=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Local LLMs</strong>: You can make use local LLMs such as Llama3 and Mixtral using Ollama.</li>
<li><strong>Two Main Modes:</strong>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Copilot Mode:</strong> (In development) Boosts search by generating different queries to find more relevant internet sources. Like normal search instead of just using the context by SearxNG, it visits the top matches and tries to find relevant sources to the user's query directly from the page.</li>
<li><strong>Normal Mode:</strong> Processes your query and performs a web search.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Focus Modes:</strong> Special modes to better answer specific types of questions. Perplexica currently has 6 focus modes:
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>All Mode:</strong> Searches the entire web to find the best results.</li>
<li><strong>Writing Assistant Mode:</strong> Helpful for writing tasks that does not require searching the web.</li>
<li><strong>Academic Search Mode:</strong> Finds articles and papers, ideal for academic research.</li>
<li><strong>YouTube Search Mode:</strong> Finds YouTube videos based on the search query.</li>
<li><strong>Wolfram Alpha Search Mode:</strong> Answers queries that need calculations or data analysis using Wolfram Alpha.</li>
<li><strong>Reddit Search Mode:</strong> Searches Reddit for discussions and opinions related to the query.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Current Information:</strong> Some search tools might give you outdated info because they use data from crawling bots and convert them into embeddings and store them in a index. Unlike them, Perplexica uses SearxNG, a metasearch engine to get the results and rerank and get the most relevant source out of it, ensuring you always get the latest information without the overhead of daily data updates.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">It has many more features like image and video search. Some of the planned features are mentioned in <a href="#upcoming-features">upcoming features</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2><a id="user-content-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There are mainly 2 ways of installing Perplexica - With Docker, Without Docker. Using Docker is highly recommended.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Getting Started with Docker (Recommended)</h3><a id="user-content-getting-started-with-docker-recommended" aria-label="Permalink: Getting Started with Docker (Recommended)" href="#getting-started-with-docker-recommended"></a></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Clone the Perplexica repository:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica.git"><pre>git clone https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica.git</pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">After cloning, navigate to the directory containing the project files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Rename the <code>sample.config.toml</code> file to <code>config.toml</code>. For Docker setups, you need only fill in the following fields:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>OPENAI</code>: Your OpenAI API key. <strong>You only need to fill this if you wish to use OpenAI's models</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>OLLAMA</code>: Your Ollama API URL. You should enter it as <code>http://host.docker.internal:PORT_NUMBER</code>. If you installed Ollama on port 11434, use <code>http://host.docker.internal:11434</code>. For other ports, adjust accordingly. <strong>You need to fill this if you wish to use Ollama's models instead of OpenAI's</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>GROQ</code>: Your Groq API key. <strong>You only need to fill this if you wish to use Groq's hosted models</strong></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong>: You can change these after starting Perplexica from the settings dialog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>SIMILARITY_MEASURE</code>: The similarity measure to use (This is filled by default; you can leave it as is if you are unsure about it.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Ensure you are in the directory containing the <code>docker-compose.yaml</code> file and execute:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Wait a few minutes for the setup to complete. You can access Perplexica at <a href="http://localhost:3000/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:3000</a> in your web browser.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong>: After the containers are built, you can start Perplexica directly from Docker without having to open a terminal.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Non-Docker Installation</h3><a id="user-content-non-docker-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Non-Docker Installation" href="#non-docker-installation"></a></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Clone the repository and rename the <code>sample.config.toml</code> file to <code>config.toml</code> in the root directory. Ensure you complete all required fields in this file.</li>
<li>Rename the <code>.env.example</code> file to <code>.env</code> in the <code>ui</code> folder and fill in all necessary fields.</li>
<li>After populating the configuration and environment files, run <code>npm i</code> in both the <code>ui</code> folder and the root directory.</li>
<li>Install the dependencies and then execute <code>npm run build</code> in both the <code>ui</code> folder and the root directory.</li>
<li>Finally, start both the frontend and the backend by running <code>npm run start</code> in both the <code>ui</code> folder and the root directory.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong>: Using Docker is recommended as it simplifies the setup process, especially for managing environment variables and dependencies.</p>
<p dir="auto">See the <a href="https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/installation">installation documentation</a> for more information like exposing it your network, etc.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Ollama connection errors</h3><a id="user-content-ollama-connection-errors" aria-label="Permalink: Ollama connection errors" href="#ollama-connection-errors"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you're facing an Ollama connection error, it is often related to the backend not being able to connect to Ollama's API. How can you fix it? You can fix it by updating your Ollama API URL in the settings menu to the following:</p>
<p dir="auto">On Windows: <code>http://host.docker.internal:11434</code><br>
On Mac: <code>http://host.docker.internal:11434</code><br>
On Linux: <code>http://private_ip_of_computer_hosting_ollama:11434</code></p>
<p dir="auto">You need to edit the ports accordingly.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Using as a Search Engine</h2><a id="user-content-using-as-a-search-engine" aria-label="Permalink: Using as a Search Engine" href="#using-as-a-search-engine"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you wish to use Perplexica as an alternative to traditional search engines like Google or Bing, or if you want to add a shortcut for quick access from your browser's search bar, follow these steps:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Open your browser's settings.</li>
<li>Navigate to the 'Search Engines' section.</li>
<li>Add a new site search with the following URL: <code>http://localhost:3000/?q=%s</code>. Replace <code>localhost</code> with your IP address or domain name, and <code>3000</code> with the port number if Perplexica is not hosted locally.</li>
<li>Click the add button. Now, you can use Perplexica directly from your browser's search bar.</li>

If you have the time, please check it out.</span></p><blockquote><p>In 2022, like many gamers, Gene Park booted up Cyberpunk 2077, the latest open-world RPG. The futuristic video game by the makers of The Witcher depicts a world full of neon lights and cybernetic enhancements, and it had recently received a big content update. Controller in hand, Park vividly recalls directing a digital Keanu Reeves to try and stop a murder, all while medical tubes protruded from his body. The tubes plugged into a port on his torso, and they were ready to pump chemicals inside. Unlike the digital augments that buffed his video game character, chemotherapy is corrosive in a way that makes the experience invasive, even as it was helping. Park likens it to having poison being poured into his heart.</p></blockquote><p><span>A new poll conducted by Harris for </span><em>The Guardian</em><span> found that the American public is widely misinformed about the economy. This is a pretty damning indictment of the news media, generally.</span></p><blockquote><p>Nearly three in five Americans wrongly believe the US is in an economic recession, and the majority blame the Biden administration, according to a Harris poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian. The survey found persistent pessimism about the economy as election day draws closer.</p><p>The poll highlighted many misconceptions people have about the economy, including:</p><ul><li><p>55% believe the economy is shrinking, and 56% think the US is experiencing a recession, though the broadest measure of the economy, gross domestic product (GDP), has been growing.</p></li><li><p>49% believe the S&amp;P 500 stock market index is down for the year, though the index went up about 24% in 2023 and is up more than 12% this year.</p></li><li><p>49% believe that unemployment is at a 50-year high, though the unemployment rate has been under 4%, a near 50-year low.</p></li></ul><p>Many Americans put the blame on Biden for the state of the economy, with 58% of those polled saying the economy is worsening due to mismanagement from the presidential administration.</p></blockquote><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.readtpa.com/p/googles-ai-generated-search-results-9e1?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.readtpa.com/p/googles-ai-generated-search-results-9e1?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.laura-bassett.com/p/why-the-alito-flag-story-matters" rel="">“Why the Alito Flag Story Matters”</a><span> (</span></p><span>, </span><span>, 5/23/24)</span></li><li><p><a href="https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/new-hampshire-repeals-several-protections" rel="">“New Hampshire Legislature Repeals Several Protections Barring Trans Discrimination”</a><span> (</span></p><span>, </span><span>, 5/23/24)</span></li><li><p><a href="https://www.discourseblog.com/p/private-equity-is-ruining-my-weekends" rel="">“Private Equity is Ruining My Weekends”</a><span> (</span></p><span>, </span><span>, 5/22/24) </span></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01468-9?utm_source=bluesky&amp;utm_medium=organic_social&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=CONR_JRNLS_AWA1_GL_PCOM_SMEDA_NATUREPORTFOLIO" rel="">“Harassment of scientists is surging — institutions aren’t sure how to help”</a><span> (</span><em>Nature</em><span>, Bianca Nogrady, 5/21/24)</span></p></li></ul></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

In the “mind” of Claude, we found millions of concepts that activate when the model reads relevant text or sees relevant images, which we call “features”.</p><p>One of those was the concept of the Golden Gate Bridge. We found that there’s a specific combination of neurons in Claude’s neural network that activates when it encounters a mention (or a picture) of this most famous San Francisco landmark.</p><p>Not only can we identify these features, we can tune the strength of their activation up or down, and identify corresponding changes in Claude’s behavior.</p><p>And as we <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/scaling-monosemanticity/index.html#:~:text=For%20instance%2C%20we%20see%20that%20clamping%20the%20Golden%20Gate%20Bridge%20feature%2034M/31164353%20to%2010%C3%97%20its%20maximum%20activation%20value%20induces%20thematically%2Drelated%20model%20behavior">explain in our research paper</a>, when we turn up the strength of the “Golden Gate Bridge” feature, Claude’s responses begin to focus on the Golden Gate Bridge. Its replies to most queries start to mention the Golden Gate Bridge, even if it’s not directly relevant.</p><p>If you ask this “Golden Gate Claude” how to spend $10, it will recommend using it to drive across the Golden Gate Bridge and pay the toll. If you ask it to write a love story, it’ll tell you a tale of a car who can’t wait to cross its beloved bridge on a foggy day. If you ask it what it imagines it looks like, it will likely tell you that it imagines it looks like the Golden Gate Bridge.</p><p>For a short time, we’re making this model available for everyone to interact with. You can talk to “Golden Gate Claude” on <a href="https://claude.ai/">claude.ai</a> (just click the Golden Gate logo on the right-hand side). Please bear in mind that this is a research demonstration only, and that this particular model might behave in some unexpected—even jarring—ways.</p><p>Our goal is to let people see the impact our interpretability work can have. The fact that we can find and alter these features within Claude makes us more confident that we’re beginning to understand how large language models really work. This isn’t a matter of asking the model verbally to do some play-acting, or of adding a new “system prompt” that attaches extra text to every input, telling Claude to pretend it’s a bridge. Nor is it traditional “fine-tuning,” where we use extra training data to create a new black box that tweaks the behavior of the old black box. This is a precise, surgical change to some of the most basic aspects of the model’s internal activations.</p><p><a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/scaling-monosemanticity/index.html">As we describe in our paper</a>, we can use these same techniques to change the strength of <em>safety-related</em> features—like those related to dangerous computer code, criminal activity, or deception. With further research, we believe this work could help make AI models safer.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>
