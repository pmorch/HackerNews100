<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main id="genesis-content"><article aria-label="Amazon Now Openly Discloses You’re Buying a License to View Kindle eBooks" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"><div itemprop="text"><p><a href="https://blog.the-ebook-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kindle-License-Disclaimer.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://blog.the-ebook-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kindle-License-Disclaimer-560x888.jpg" alt="Kindle License Disclaimer" width="560" height="888" srcset="https://blog.the-ebook-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kindle-License-Disclaimer-560x888.jpg 560w, https://blog.the-ebook-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kindle-License-Disclaimer-189x300.jpg 189w, https://blog.the-ebook-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kindle-License-Disclaimer.jpg 605w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px"></a></p>
<p>Amazon recently changed the wording on their website when it comes to buying <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/storefront?storeType=browse&amp;node=154606011&amp;nodl=0&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=ter000-20&amp;linkId=929ad6761676da6a2e0bcb2ef290e121&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank">Kindle ebooks</a>.</p>
<p>As the screenshot above shows, they now have a disclaimer under the buy now button that says, “By placing your order, <strong>you’re purchasing a license to the content</strong> and you agree to the Kindle Store Terms of Use”.</p>
<p>It also says that same thing when shopping for Kindle ebooks directly from the store on Kindle ereaders and Kindle apps.</p>




<p>The funny thing is they only appear to be doing that in the US. I checked Amazon UK and Amazon CA and both show the old disclaimer that just says, “By clicking the above button, you agree to the Kindle Store Terms of Use”.</p>
<p>If you click the terms of use link you’ll find a page full of legal disclaimers indicating you’re buying a license to access Kindle content, but they don’t openly disclose it on product pages under the buy button like on the Amazon US website.</p>
<p>I read somewhere about a new law that was passed in California where companies have to “conspicuously” disclose that customers are buying a license when it comes to digital media like ebooks, so that’s likely the reason why Amazon made the change.</p>
<p>But not all ebook stores are following the same path. Kobo still just has a link to their terms of sale page when you go to checkout. Apple doesn’t say anything about licenses at all when trying to buy an ebook from them. Google doesn’t say anything about it on their ebook product pages, but they do say you’re purchasing a license before confirming the purchase, with a link to their terms of service.</p>
<p>Some people still don’t know that when buying digital content you’re buying a license to view said content, not the actual content itself. You don’t actually “own” the ebooks you purchase; you just own the rights to view them. It’s a distinction that applies to digital media since you can’t physically own it. </p>
<p>I think it’s a good idea for companies to openly disclose that fact before buying. Nobody is going to read through those ridiculous TOS pages before purchasing something.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main role="main"><article><div><p>Two weeks ago at the <a href="https://x.com/trailofbits/status/1893008382677659893">DeFi Security Summit</a>, Trail of Bits’ Josselin Feist (@Montyly) was asked if we’d see a billion-dollar exploit in 2025. His response: “If it happens, it won’t be a smart contract, it’ll be an operational security issue.”</p><p>Today, that prediction was validated.</p><h2 id="the-attack">The Attack</h2><p>On February 21, 2025, cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://x.com/gauthamzzz/status/1893004593979859410">Bybit suffered the largest cryptocurrency theft</a> in history when attackers stole approximately $1.5B from their multisig cold storage wallet. At this time, it appears the attackers compromised multiple signers’ devices, manipulated what signers saw in their wallet interface, and collected the required signatures while the signers believed they were conducting routine transactions.</p><p>This hack is one of many that represent a dramatic shift in how centralized exchanges are compromised. For years, the industry has focused on hardening code and improving their technical security practices, but as the ecosystem’s secure development life cycle has matured, attackers have shifted to targeting the human and operational elements of cryptocurrency exchanges and other organizations.</p><p>These attacks reveal an escalating pattern, with each compromise building on the last:</p><ul><li><a href="https://blog.solidityscan.com/wazirx-hack-analysis-8bc8821928e9">WazirX Exchange</a> ($230M, July 2024)</li><li><a href="https://medium.com/@RadiantCapital/radiant-post-mortem-fecd6cd38081">Radiant Capital</a> ($50M, October 2024)</li><li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/bybit-says-exchange-wallet-hacked-1-5-billion-estimated-loss?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;utm_campaign=copy">Bybit Exchange</a> ($1.5B, February 2025)</li></ul><p>In each case, the attackers didn’t exploit smart contract or application-level vulnerabilities. Instead, they compromised the computers used to manage those systems using sophisticated malware to manipulate what users saw versus what they actually signed.</p><h2 id="the-dprks-cryptocurrency-theft-infrastructure">The DPRK’s Cryptocurrency Theft Infrastructure</h2><p>These hacks are not isolated incidents. According to <a href="https://x.com/arkham/status/1893033424224411885">Arkham Intelligence</a>, famed researcher <a href="https://x.com/zachxbt">ZachXBT</a> has provided definitive proof linking this attack to North Korea, including detailed analysis of test transactions and connected wallets used ahead of the exploit. These incidents represent the maturation of sophisticated attack capabilities developed by <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-dc3-and-npa-identification-of-north-korean-cyber-actors-tracked-as-tradertraitor-responsible-for-theft-of-308-million-from-bitcoindmmcom">North Korean state-sponsored threat actors</a>, specifically groups tracked as <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-108a%20">TraderTraitor</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/intelligence-reports/east-asia-threat-actors-employ-unique-methods">Jade Sleet</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/north-korea-supply-chain">UNC4899</a>, and <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/threat-assessment-north-korean-threat-groups-2024/">Slow Pisces</a> under the DPRK’s Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB).</p><figure><img src="https://blog.trailofbits.com/img/dprk-rgb-structure.png" alt="Figure 1: Organizational structure of DPRK cyber threat actors under the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB).

This chart shows the relationship between different threat groups and their various industry designations. Source: Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, September 2024</figcaption></figure><p>The attack chain typically begins with <a href="https://github.blog/security/vulnerability-research/security-alert-social-engineering-campaign-targets-technology-industry-employees/">aggressive social engineering campaigns</a> targeting multiple employees simultaneously within an organization. The RGB identifies key personnel in system administration, software development, and treasury roles, then creates detailed pretexts - often elaborate job recruitment schemes - customized to each target’s background and interests. These aren’t mass phishing campaigns; they’re meticulously crafted approaches designed to compromise specific individuals with access to critical systems.</p><p>What makes these attacks particularly concerning is their repeatability. The RGB has built a sophisticated cross-platform toolkit that can:</p><ul><li>Operate seamlessly across Windows, MacOS, and various wallet interfaces</li><li>Show minimal signs of compromise while maintaining persistence</li><li>Function as backdoors to execute arbitrary commands</li><li>Download and execute additional malicious payloads</li><li>Manipulate what users see in their interfaces</li></ul><p><a href="https://github.com/tayvano/lazarus-bluenoroff-research">Each successful compromise</a> has allowed the RGB to refine their tools and techniques. They’re not starting from scratch with each target - they’re executing a tested playbook that’s specifically engineered to defeat standard cryptocurrency security controls when those controls are used in isolation.</p><p>Organizations below a certain security threshold are now at serious risk. Without comprehensive security controls including:</p><ul><li>Air-gapped signing systems</li><li>Multiple layers of transaction verification</li><li>Endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems like CrowdStrike or SentinelOne</li><li>Regular security training and war games</li></ul><p>They are likely to face an adversary that has already built and tested the exact tools needed to defeat their existing protections.</p><h2 id="the-new-reality-of-cryptocurrency-security">The New Reality of Cryptocurrency Security</h2><p>This attack highlights a fundamental truth: no single security control, no matter how robust, can protect against sophisticated attackers targeting operational security. While secure code remains crucial, it must be part of a comprehensive security strategy.</p><p>Organizations must adopt new processes and controls that operate under the assumption that their infrastructure will eventually face compromise:</p><ol><li><strong>Infrastructure Segmentation:</strong> Critical operations like transaction signing require both physical and logical separation from day-to-day business operations. This isolation ensures that a breach of corporate systems cannot directly impact signing infrastructure. Critical operations should use dedicated hardware, separate networks, and strictly controlled access protocols.</li><li><strong>Defense-in-Depth:</strong> Security controls must work in concert - hardware wallets, multi-signature schemes, and transaction verification tools each provide important protections, but true security emerges from their coordinated operation. Organizations need multiple, overlapping controls that can detect and prevent sophisticated attacks.</li><li><strong>Organizational Preparedness:</strong> Technical controls must be supported by comprehensive security programs that include:<ul><li>Thorough threat modeling incorporating both technical and operational risks</li><li>Regular third-party security assessments of infrastructure and procedures</li><li>Well-documented and frequently tested incident response plans</li><li>Ongoing security awareness training tailored to specific roles</li><li>War games and attack simulations that test both systems and personnel</li></ul></li></ol><p>These principles aren’t new - they represent hard-won lessons from years of security incidents in both traditional finance and cryptocurrency. Trail of Bits has consistently advocated for this comprehensive approach to security, providing concrete guidance through several key publications:</p><ul><li><a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2018/11/27/10-rules-for-the-secure-use-of-cryptocurrency-hardware-wallets/">10 Rules for the Secure Use of Cryptocurrency Hardware Wallets</a> (2018) - Our foundational guidance on hardware wallet security that specifically warned about the risks of hardware wallet compromise and the need for high-assurance workstations - precisely the type of issues exploited in today’s attack.</li><li><a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/06/24/managing-risk-in-blockchain-deployments/">Managing Operational Risk in Blockchain Deployments</a> (2022) - A comprehensive framework highlighting the risks of centralized infrastructure and providing concrete guidance for implementing defense-in-depth approaches to protect high-value cryptocurrency operations.</li><li><a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/08/14/can-you-pass-the-rekt-test/">The Rekt Test - our simple framework for assessing basic security controls</a> (2023) - Our simple but thorough framework for assessing basic security controls, emphasizing the critical importance of proper key management, infrastructure separation, and incident response planning - all factors that proved critical in today’s incident.</li><li><a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2025/02/05/preventing-account-takeover-on-centralized-cryptocurrency-exchanges-in-2025/">Preventing Account Takeovers in Cryptocurrency Exchanges</a> (2025) - A detailed analysis of attack patterns targeting cryptocurrency exchanges that predicted the industry’s pivot from technical exploits toward operational attacks.</li></ul><p>These publications show a clear pattern that’s echoed by recent attacks: sophisticated attackers are increasingly targeting operational security vulnerabilities rather than technical flaws.</p><p>The cryptocurrency industry’s resistance to implementing traditional corporate security controls, combined with the high value of potential targets and this group’s sophisticated capabilities, suggests these attacks are likely to continue unless significant changes are made to how cryptocurrency companies approach operational security.</p><h2 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h2><p>The Bybit hack marks a new era in cryptocurrency security. Industry participants need to recognize the evolving threat landscape and invest additional resources in improving their operational security. No one understands this reality better than the security researchers who have been tracking these attacks.</p><p>Tay <a href="https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1847877033701122395">@tayvano_</a>, a renowned security researcher known for exposing on-chain thefts, dissecting DPRK crypto hacks, and fiercely advocating for better blockchain security practices, summarized the current reality bluntly:</p><blockquote><p>For all these reasons and more, it’s my opinion that once they get on your device, you’re fucked. The end.
If your keys are hot or in AWS, they fuck you immediately.
If they aren’t, they work slightly harder to fuck you.
But no matter what, you’re going to get fucked.</p></blockquote><p>Organizations must protect themselves through a comprehensive defense strategy combining isolation, verification, detection, and robust operational security controls. However, the time for basic security measures has passed. Organizations holding significant cryptocurrency assets must take immediate action:</p><ul><li>Conduct a thorough operational risk assessment using established frameworks like our “<a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/06/24/managing-risk-in-blockchain-deployments/">Managing Operational Risk in Blockchain Deployments</a>”</li><li>Implement dedicated, air-gapped signing infrastructure</li><li>Engage with security teams experienced in defending against sophisticated state actors</li><li>Build and regularly test incident response plans</li></ul><p>The next billion-dollar hack isn’t a matter of if, but when. The only question is: will your organization be ready?</p></div></article></main></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true" aria-labelledby="file-name-id-wide file-name-id-mobile"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><strong>FFmpeg Assembly Language Lesson One</strong></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Welcome to the FFmpeg School of Assembly Language. You have taken the first step on the most interesting, challenging, and rewarding journey in programming. These lessons will give you a grounding in the way assembly language is written in FFmpeg and open your eyes to what's actually going on in your computer..</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Required Knowledge</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Knowledge of C, in particular pointers. If you don't know C, work through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language" rel="nofollow">The C Programming Language</a> book</li>
<li>High School Mathematics (scalar vs vector, addition, multiplication etc)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>What is assembly language?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Assembly language is a programming language where you write code that directly corresponds to the instructions a CPU processes. Human readable assembly language is, as the name suggests, <em>assembled</em> into binary data, known as <em>machine code</em>, that the CPU can understand. You might see assembly language code referred to as “assembly” or “asm” for short.</p>
<p dir="auto">The vast majority of assembly code in FFmpeg is what's known as <em>SIMD, Single Instruction Multiple Data</em>. SIMD is sometimes referred to as vector programming. This means that a particular instruction operates on multiple elements of data at the same time. Most programming languages operate on one data element at a time, known as scalar programming.</p>
<p dir="auto">As you might have guessed, SIMD lends itself well to processing images, video, and audio which have lots of data ordered sequentially in memory. There are specialist instructions available in the CPU to help us process sequential data.</p>
<p dir="auto">In FFmpeg, you'll see the terms “assembly function”, “SIMD”, and “vector(ise)” used interchangeably. They all refer to the same thing: Writing a function in assembly language by hand to process multiple elements of data in one go. Some projects may also refer to these as “assembly kernels”.</p>
<p dir="auto">All of this might sound complicated, but it's important to remember that in FFmpeg, high schoolers have written assembly code. As with everything, learning is 50% jargon and 50% actual learning.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Why do we write in assembly language?</strong><br>
To make multimedia processing fast. It’s very common to get a 10x or more speed improvement from writing assembly code, which is especially important when wanting to play videos in real time without stuttering. It also saves energy and extends battery life. It’s worth pointing out that video encode and decode functions are some of the most heavily used functions on earth, both by end-users and by big companies in their datacentres. So even a small improvement adds up quickly.</p>
<p dir="auto">You’ll often see, online, people use <em>intrinsics,</em> which are C-like functions that map to assembly instructions to allow for faster development. In FFmpeg we don’t use intrinsics but instead write assembly code by hand. This is an area of controversy, but intrinsics are typically around 10-15% slower than hand-written assembly (intrinsics supporters would disagree), depending on the compiler. For FFmpeg, every bit of extra performance helps, which is why we write in assembly code directly. There’s also an argument that intrinsics are difficult to read owing to their use of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation" rel="nofollow">Hungarian Notation</a>”.</p>
<p dir="auto">You may also see <em>inline assembly</em> (i.e. not using intrinsics) remaining in a few places in FFmpeg for historical reasons, or in projects like the Linux Kernel because of very specific use cases there. This is where assembly code is not in a separate file, but written inline with C code. The prevailing opinion in projects like FFmpeg is that this code is hard to read, not widely supported by compilers and unmaintainable.</p>
<p dir="auto">Lastly, you’ll see a lot of self-proclaimed experts online saying none of this is necessary and the compiler can do all of this “vectorisation” for you. At least for the purpose of learning, ignore them: recent tests in e.g. <a href="https://www.videolan.org/projects/dav1d.html" rel="nofollow">the dav1d project</a> showed around a 2x speedup from this automatic vectorisation, while the hand-written versions could reach 8x.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Flavours of assembly language</strong><br>
These lessons will focus on x86 64-bit assembly language. This is also known as amd64, although it still works on Intel CPUs. There are other types of assembly for other CPUs like ARM and RISC-V and potentially in the future these lessons will be extended to cover those.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are two flavours of x86 assembly syntax that you’ll see online: AT&amp;T and Intel. AT&amp;T Syntax is older and harder to read compared to Intel syntax. So we will use Intel syntax.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Supporting materials</strong><br>
You might be surprised to hear that books or online resources like Stack Overflow are not particularly helpful as references. This is in part because of our choice to use handwritten assembly with Intel syntax. But also because a lot of online resources are focused on operating system programming or hardware programming, usually using non-SIMD code. FFmpeg assembly is particularly focused on high performance image processing, and as you’ll see it’s a particularly unique approach to assembly programming. That said, it’s easy to understand other assembly use-cases once you’ve completed these lessons</p>
<p dir="auto">Many books go into a lot of computer architecture details before teaching assembly. This is fine if that’s what you want to learn, but from our standpoint, it’s like studying engines before learning to drive a car.</p>
<p dir="auto">That said, the diagrams in the later parts of “The Art of 64-bit assembly” book showing SIMD instructions and their behaviour in a visual form are helpful: <a href="https://artofasm.randallhyde.com/" rel="nofollow">https://artofasm.randallhyde.com/</a></p>
<p dir="auto">A discord server is available to answer questions:<br>
<a href="https://discord.com/invite/Ks5MhUhqfB" rel="nofollow">https://discord.com/invite/Ks5MhUhqfB</a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Registers</strong><br>
Registers are areas in the CPU where data can be processed. CPUs don’t operate on memory directly, but instead data is loaded into registers, processed, and written back to memory. In assembly language, generally, you cannot directly copy data from one memory location to another without first passing that data through a register.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>General Purpose Registers</strong><br>
The first type of register is what is known as a General Purpose Register (GPR). GPRs are referred to as general purpose because they can contain either data, in this case up to a 64-bit value, or a memory address (a pointer). A value in a GPR can be processed through operations like addition, multiplication, shifting, etc.</p>
<p dir="auto">In most assembly books, there are whole chapters dedicated to the subtleties of GPRs, the historical background etc. This is because GPRs are important when it comes to operating system programming, reverse engineering, etc. In the assembly code written in FFmpeg, GPRs are more like scaffolding and most of the time their complexities are not needed and abstracted away.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Vector registers</strong><br>
Vector (SIMD) registers, as the name suggests, contain multiple data elements. There are various types of vector registers:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>mm registers - MMX registers, 64-bit sized, historic and not used much any more</li>
<li>xmm registers - XMM registers, 128-bit sized, widely available</li>
<li>ymm registers - YMM registers, 256-bit sized, some complications when using these</li>
<li>zmm registers - ZMM registers, 512-bit sized, limited availability</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Most calculations in video compression and decompression are integer-based so we’ll stick to that. Here’s an example of 16 bytes in an xmm register:</p>
<markdown-accessiblity-table><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>a</th>
<th>b</th>
<th>c</th>
<th>d</th>
<th>e</th>
<th>f</th>
<th>g</th>
<th>h</th>
<th>i</th>
<th>j</th>
<th>k</th>
<th>l</th>
<th>m</th>
<th>n</th>
<th>o</th>
<th>p</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table></markdown-accessiblity-table>
<p dir="auto">But it could be eight words (16-bit integers)</p>
<markdown-accessiblity-table><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>a</th>
<th>b</th>
<th>c</th>
<th>d</th>
<th>e</th>
<th>f</th>
<th>g</th>
<th>h</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table></markdown-accessiblity-table>
<p dir="auto">Or four double words (32-bit integers)</p>
<markdown-accessiblity-table><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>a</th>
<th>b</th>
<th>c</th>
<th>d</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table></markdown-accessiblity-table>
<p dir="auto">Or two quadwords (64-bit integers):</p>
<markdown-accessiblity-table><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>a</th>
<th>b</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table></markdown-accessiblity-table>
<p dir="auto">To recap:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>b</strong>ytes - 8-bit data</li>
<li><strong>w</strong>ords - 16-bit data</li>
<li><strong>d</strong>oublewords - 32-bit data</li>
<li><strong>q</strong>uadwords - 64-bit data</li>
<li><strong>d</strong>ouble <strong>q</strong>uadwords - 128-bit data</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The bold characters will be important later.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>x86inc.asm include</strong><br>
You’ll see in many examples we include the file x86inc.asm. X86inc.asm is a lightweight abstraction layer used in FFmpeg, x264, and dav1d to make an assembly programmer's life easier. It helps in many ways, but to begin with, one of the useful things it does is it labels GPRs, r0, r1, r2. This means you don’t have to remember any register names. As mentioned before, GPRs are generally just scaffolding so this makes life a lot easier.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>A simple scalar asm snippet</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Let’s look at a simple (and very much artificial) snippet of scalar asm (assembly code that operates on individual data items, one at a time, within each instruction) to see what’s going on:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="mov  r0q, 3  
inc  r0q  
dec  r0q  
imul r0q, 5"><pre><span>mov</span><span>  r0q</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>  </span>

<span>imul</span><span> r0q</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>5</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">In the first line, the <em>immediate value</em> 3 (a value stored directly in the assembly code itself as opposed to a value fetched from memory) is being stored into register r0 as a quadword. Note that in Intel syntax, the source operand (the value or location providing the data, located on the right) is transferred to the destination operand (the location receiving the data, located on the left), much like the behavior of memcpy. You can also read it as “r0q = 3”, since the order is the same. The “q” suffix of r0 designates the register as being used as a quadword. inc increments the value so that r0q contains 4, dec decrements the value back to 3. imul multiplies the value by 5. So at the end, r0q contains 15.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that the human readable instructions such as mov and inc, which are assembled into machine code by the assembler, are known as <em>mnemonics</em>. You may see online and in books mnemonics represented with capital letters like MOV and INC but these are the same as the lower case versions. In FFmpeg, we use lower case mnemonics and keep upper case reserved for macros.</p>

<span>    movu  </span><span>[</span><span>srcq</span><span>],</span><span> m0</span>

<span>    </span><span>RET</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Let’s go through it line by line:</p>

<p dir="auto">This is a “header” developed in the x264, FFmpeg, and dav1d communities to provide helpers, predefined names and macros (such as cglobal below) to simplify writing assembly.</p>

<p dir="auto">This denotes the section where the code you want to execute is placed. This is in contrast to the .data section, where you can put constant data.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=";static void add_values(const uint8_t *src, const uint8_t *src2);  
INIT_XMM sse2"><pre><span>;static void add_values(const uint8_t *src, const uint8_t *src2);  </span>
<span>INIT_XMM sse2</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The first line is a comment (the semi-colon “;” in asm is like “//” in C) showing what the function argument looks like in C. The second line shows how we are initialising the function to use XMM registers, using the sse2 instruction set. This is because paddb is an sse2 instruction. We’ll cover sse2 in more detail in the next lesson.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cglobal add_values, 2, 2, 2, src, src2"><pre><span>c</span><span>global</span> <span>add_values</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> src</span><span>,</span><span> src2</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This is an important line as it defines a C function called “add_values”.</p>
<p dir="auto">Let’s go through each item one at a time:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The next parameter shows it has two function arguments.</li>
<li>The parameter after that shows that we’ll use two GPRs for the arguments. In some cases we might want to use more GPRs so we have to tell x86util we need more.</li>
<li>The parameter after that tells x86util how many XMM registers we are going to use.</li>
<li>The following two parameters are labels for the function arguments.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">It’s worth noting that older code may not have labels for the function arguments but instead address GPRs directly using r0, r1 etc.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="    movu  m0, [srcq]  
    movu  m1, [src2q]"><pre><span>    movu  m0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>srcq</span><span>]</span><span>  </span>
<span>    movu  m1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>src2q</span><span>]</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">movu is shorthand for movdqu (move double quad unaligned). Alignment will be covered in another lesson but for now movu can be treated as a 128-bit move from [srcq]. In the case of mov, the brackets mean that the address in [srcq] is being dereferenced, the equivalent of *<em>src in C.</em> This is what’s known as a load. Note that the “q” suffix refers to the size of the pointer *(*i.e in C it represents *sizeof(*src) == 8 on 64-bit systems, and x86asm is smart enough to use 32-bit on 32-bit systems) but the underlying load is 128-bit.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that we don’t refer to vector registers by their full name, in this case xmm0,but as m0, an abstracted form. In future lessons you’ll see how this means you can write code once and have it work on multiple SIMD register sizes.</p>

<p dir="auto">paddb (read this in your head as <em>p-add-b</em>) is adding each byte in each register as shown below. The “p” prefix stands for “packed” and is used to identify vector instructions vs scalar instructions. The “b” suffix shows that this is bytewise addition (addition of bytes).</p>

<p dir="auto">This is what’s known as a store. The data is written back to the address in the srcq pointer.</p>

<p dir="auto">This is a macro to denote the function returns. Virtually all assembly functions in FFmpeg modify the data in the arguments as opposed to returning a value.</p>
<p dir="auto">As you’ll see in the assignment, we create function pointers to assembly functions and use them where available.</p>

I managed to install android with microg and it has worked flawlessly for 4 years now. There are many options to do this of course, but they all require a lot of time to set up. Still a better alternative than being locked up under Google.</p>

                  <p>There's already 10% tariff on cars from US imported into Europe. 
But somehow I have feeling that even if it would be reduced to 0%, it wouldn't make a big difference Cars of US brands are generally terrible, not sure how they fulfill EU emission standards, have poor MPG which with EU gas prices are very expensive in maintenance.
Maybe Japanese, Korean or EU brands manufactured US could do better.</p>

                  <p>Tesla FSD should never have been authorized in the US tbh. The safety record is horrifying.

So Europe can have their LLMs as well: the important thing is to relax this stupid AI act, that the biggest countries in Europe didn't want (Germany, France, Italy) but that somewhat passed (and it is not impossible that there are external influences and corruptions). About the search engine: Google at this point is almost a joke, to the point it is simpler to redo it right than trying to fix it from the internal. Remember that a lot of key technologies are created by europeans: from Python to Linux, to MySQL and so on. Europe has all the potential needed <i>if the right choices are made</i> to do everything needed.</p>

                  <p>I believe that certain drives for certain regulations that are clearly shooting themselves in the feet were approved with less clear processes than needed (remember corruption cases of certain European politicians recently for the Olympics? If it happens for minor stuff like that... go figure). This was acceptable even if many countries were unhappy as long as the US were believed to be a strong partner. Now this changed, and it is likely that certain regulations will be relaxed.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="articleBody"><section><p>TALLAHASSEE — While Florida insurers claimed to be losing money in the wake of hurricanes Irma and Michael, their parent companies and affiliates were making billions of dollars, according to a study obtained by the Times/Herald.</p><p>The start of the state’s insurance market meltdown came on the heels of those two storms between 2017 and 2019, as companies justified big rate increases to cover their losses.</p><p>But those financial hardships don’t tell the full story, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25540452-affiliated-fee-analysis-executive-summary/" target="_blank">according to the 2022 study</a> that has never been made public and was released to the Times/Herald after a two-year wait for public records.</p><p>The report, the most in-depth dive into the byzantine finances of Florida’s homeowners insurance market, reveals that as the industry was ailing and companies were losing money, executives distributed $680 million in dividends to shareholders while diverting billions more to affiliate companies.</p><p>Executives with most Florida-based insurers were removing so much money from<b> </b>their companies that they violated state regulations, the study’s author concluded.</p><p>The result left some insurers financially weaker — and potentially unable to pay claims — heading into the depths of the state’s insurance crisis.</p><p>State lawmakers never saw the report.</p><p>The state’s then-insurance commissioner and Gov. Ron DeSantis focused on legal reforms making it harder to sue insurers.</p><p>And regulators have not repeated the study since, despite <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25540452-affiliated-fee-analysis-executive-summary/" target="_blank">a recommendation from the report’s author</a>.</p><p>The findings are a “smoking gun” that confirms what <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2022/12/11/property-insurance-compensation-executives-legislature-special-session/" target="_blank">has long been suspected in Florida’s market</a>, said Doug Quinn, executive director of the watchdog American Policyholder Association.</p><p>“These companies are crying poverty in order to raise premiums or justify insolvency: ‘It’s litigation, it’s fraud,‘” Quinn said. “This is money shifting from their left pocket to the right, and crying poverty while their right pocket bulges.”</p><p>State regulators say the insurance market is different today. In recent years, Florida Insurance Commissioner Mike Yaworsky <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2023/04/28/florida-legislature-insurance-insolvencies-premiums-profits/" target="_blank">has pushed for more oversight of affiliate companies</a>. This year, he’s asking lawmakers to change how insurers pay affiliates.</p><p>While the report is an incomplete picture of insurers' money,<b> </b>Florida’s Office of Insurance Regulation said in a statement, the study affirms that the reforms the office wants are warranted.</p><p>But<b> </b>Paul Handerhan, founder of the trade group Federal Association for Insurance Reform, whose members include insurance companies,<b> </b>disputed the idea that executives were deliberately moving money around.</p><p>“This notion that they’re fleecing their policyholders and offshoring the money to their affiliates is just not happening,” Handerhan said. “None of these guys did this as a strategy.”</p><p>During debates in the Legislature over how best to respond to the insurance crisis between 2018 and 2023, some lawmakers asked what role affiliate companies played.</p><p>Rep. Hillary Cassel, R-Dania Beach, said lawmakers and observers had a lack of data about affiliates, known in the industry as “managing general agents,” when they were voting on legislation.</p><p>“All of us informed on the issues knew (managing general agents) were a problem,” said Cassel, a former lawyer for insurance companies who now sues them.</p><p>The Office of Insurance Regulation said in a statement that the study was not given to lawmakers because it was “not a formal examination report.”<b> </b>It was produced months before lawmakers met in emergency legislative sessions in 2022 and left in a “draft” status.</p><p>“Our office does not release every internal analysis of companies to the Legislature,” the office said.</p><p>The Times/Herald requested the report in November 2022, but the office did not turn over the executive summary until December 2024.</p><p>The affiliate structure is nothing new in Florida.</p><p>Profits of insurance companies are limited by regulators to about 4.5% — hardly enticing to investors, considering the risk of hurricanes.</p><p>However, insurance executives in Florida have used financial workarounds to reward investors and themselves.</p><p>While the profits and executive compensation of the insurance company are capped, the profits of affiliate and parent companies are not.</p><p>So executives create sister companies that charge the insurance company for basic services, such as claims handling, underwriting, accounting and issuing policies. (Large national insurers typically handle all of those services internally.)</p><p>Arrangements between insurance companies and affiliates must be approved by the state, and regulations say they must be “fair and reasonable,” which isn’t defined in state law.</p><p>Company structures can appear like a spiderweb of entities. When FedNat Insurance went insolvent in 2022, it was <a href="https://myfloridacfo.com/docs-sf/rehabilitation-and-liquidation-libraries/rehab-documents/insolvency-reports/pc/fednat-insurance-company---2025.pdf?sfvrsn=61714f67_2" target="_blank">one of nine corporations under a parent company</a>.</p><p>When Southern Fidelity Insurance dissolved that year, it was <a href="https://myfloridacfo.com/docs-sf/rehabilitation-and-liquidation-libraries/rehab-documents/insolvency-reports/pc/southern-fidelity-insurance-company---2024.pdf?sfvrsn=52789be4_1" target="_blank">one of six companies under the same umbrella</a>, and its holdings included a hunting lodge maintained at a cost of $485,000 per year. State officials were investigating whether the company “took active measures to conceal these costs” from regulators, according to an October insolvency report.</p><p>Most insurers in Florida have similar arrangements, which are enormously lucrative for some executives who were the <a href="https://www.proquest.com/docview/2081759374?sourcetype=Trade%20Journals" target="_blank">highest-paid in the nation in some years</a>.</p><p>But this type of setup can be easily abused and requires greater regulatory scrutiny, according to the <a href="https://content.naic.org/sites/default/files/publications-fah.pdf" target="_blank">National Association of Insurance Commissioners</a>.</p><p>That’s because the owner of the insurance company also owns the affiliates, creating an incentive for executives to overcharge the insurance company for services.</p><p>Such abuses have been <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2022/12/11/property-insurance-compensation-executives-legislature-special-session/" target="_blank">repeatedly found by state officials as the reason why companies go insolvent</a>. In one 2009 insolvency, auditors wrote that executives were “stripping the company of cash” as it was going out of business. The ratings agency AM Best last year found that affiliate relationships<b> </b>were the third-leading cause of insolvencies nationwide between 2000 and 2022, <a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2024/12/18/805231.htm" target="_blank">after catastrophe losses and fraud, Insurance Journal reported</a>.</p><p>Still,<b> </b>it’s unlikely Florida<b> </b>regulators knew the full scope of insurance money-shifting arrangements until 2021, when lawmakers <a href="http://laws.flrules.org/files/Ch_2021-077.pdf" target="_blank">gave them the ability</a> to demand more information from insurers and affiliates.</p><p>Using that power,<b> </b>the state’s then-commissioner, David Altmaier, paid a Connecticut-based consultant<b> </b>nearly $150,000<b> </b>to parse through the information the companies provided. Several companies turned over incomplete data, according to the study.</p><p>Between 2017 and 2019, the insurers in the study (minus a couple of outliers) showed a net loss of $432 million.</p><p>Their affiliate companies showed a net income of $1.8 billion.</p><p>With all 53 companies included, the industry recorded $61 million in net income, and affiliates made about $14 billion in net income, according to the study. Those figures likely include national carriers that also provide auto insurance.</p><p><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25540452-affiliated-fee-analysis-executive-summary/" target="_blank">The author noted</a> that the affiliates of Florida-based companies were profitable even after they injected<b> </b>$485 million back into the insurers and<b> </b>waived $208 million in fees during the three years, steps made to help keep the insurers afloat.</p><p>In the author’s opinion, 19 of the 30 Florida-based companies that provided data were paying fees<b> </b>to their affiliate companies that were “not fair and reasonable.”</p><p>The numbers in the study are “eye-popping” and raise questions about why regulators would allow such financial arrangements, said Birny Birnbaum, executive director of the Center for Economic Justice and a former chief economist at the Texas Department of Insurance.</p><p>“It’s unclear why (the Office of Insurance Regulation) isn’t doing anything about it,” Birnbaum said.</p><p>Regulators this year are asking lawmakers to define “fair and reasonable” to include the actual cost of the service provided, the overall health of the insurer and how much in dividends were paid out. Regulators asked for that in 2023 <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2023/04/28/florida-legislature-insurance-insolvencies-premiums-profits/" target="_blank">but lawmakers rejected it</a>, claiming it would “upset the apple cart” of Florida’s insurance industry.</p><p>The office’s proposed legislation would also require fees to affiliates be paid in dollar amounts, instead of percentages. Affiliates will typically charge the insurance company fees of between 20% and 34% of premiums, which results in more money for the affiliates when premiums go up.</p><p>The office has canceled or modified some companies’ agreements. In 2023, for example, one company’s contract with an affiliate was canceled after regulators discovered that the affiliate was charging the insurer additional fees on top of the cost of the services being provided, according to the office.</p></section></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>After another round of mass layoffs and reports of slashed stock options for remaining employees, Meta has like clockwork opted to reward its top executives with a substantial bonus increase.</p>
<p>The Facebook giant revealed in a government <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000132680125000021/meta-20250213.htm" rel="nofollow">filing</a> that its Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee (CNGC) approved a target annual bonus increase for its top executive officers bar CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The bonus was raised from 75 percent of base salary to a whopping 200 percent, effective with the 2025 annual performance period.</p>
<p>"Following this increase, the target total cash compensation for the named executive officers (other than the CEO) falls at approximately the 50th percentile of the Peer Group Target Cash Compensation," the filing notes. It added that prior to the adjustment, those executives were only at or below the 15th percentile in total cash compensation compared to their peers.&nbsp;</p>

    

<p>According to Meta's April 2024 proxy <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001326801/8c7f110d-9cc4-4034-b356-ece89d4cb1c5.pdf" rel="nofollow">statement</a> [PDF], CTO Andrew Bosworth's base salary was $945,000. His actual eligible earnings were slightly lower due to the timing of his raise. However, factoring in a 75 percent target bonus and Meta's 150 percent company performance multiplier for 2023, his total bonus payout amounted to about $1.05 million.</p>

        


        

<p>Assuming Bosworth's salary remains the same, and Meta's company performance percentage stays at 150 percent in 2025, the new 200 percent target bonus would push his bonus to nearly $3 million. That's before any stock-based compensation and other add-ons. And he's not even the highest-paid member of Meta's named executive team.</p>
<p>For balance's sake, and some might find this hard to swallow but, $3 million annual cash compensation for a CTO in Bosworth's position is about right for Silicon Valley; it's nothing outrageous, relatively speaking. The vast majority of his pay package is in shares; in 2023 for instance, he was awarded more than $20 million in stock. The salary, like for many in his role, is the cherry on top of an enormous cake.</p>

        

<p>Some of that bonus cash, though, might be coming from Meta's latest round of layoffs, which saw <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/10/meta_to_toss_5_of/">around 3,700 people</a> - about five percent of its workforce - axed this month. The cut reportedly targeted low performers, and followed a year in which the biz reported a net income of $62.36 billion, a 59 percent year-over-year increase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This comes <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/67a4c030-a7f6-47af-bab0-a998f0a09506" rel="nofollow">reports</a> surfaced this week that Meta has cut back on its yearly distribution of stock options by 10 percent to most staff, though we do note that the corp's share price has climbed 10 percent in the past month, and 46 percent for the past year.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Meta to confirm reports of the stock option cut.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zuckerberg started 2025 by describing Meta's plans for the year as "intense," with massive AI investments lined up as the Facebook maker shifts focus beyond its struggling <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/10/meta_metaverse_report/">metaverse</a> ambitions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following OpenAI's announcement that it and its partners plan to invest up to <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/22/openai_stargate_ai_datacenter_company/">$500 billion</a> in an AI infrastructure project dubbed Stargate, Zuckerberg announced his own AI spending plans - Meta would pour $60 billion or more to expand its AI infrastructure in 2025.&nbsp;</p>

        

<p>"This is a massive effort, and over the coming years it will drive our core products and business, unlock historic innovation, and extend American technology leadership," Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/pfbid0219ude255AKkmk4JAueXZeZ9zpjNYio2tBkd7bNmCaRbJ6iJaVVjypUgDg78CNdq5l" rel="nofollow">said</a> of the effort. Hopefully it will prove more successful than that Metaverse shift for the sake of those executives' bonuses.&nbsp;®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="c1"><p>When I was still a professional programmer, my office-mate once asked out of the blue, "Do you really want to be doing this kind of work when you're fifty?"</p><p>I have to say that made me stop and think.</p><p>To me, there's an innate frustration in programming. It doesn't stem from having to work out the solutions to difficult problems. That takes careful thought, but it's the same kind of thought a novelist uses to organize a story or to write dialog that rings true. That kind of problem-solving is satisfying, even fun.</p><p>But that, unfortunately, is not what most programming is about. It's about trying to come up with a working solution in a problem domain that you don't fully understand and don't have time to understand.</p><p>It's about skimming <a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/129.html">great oceans of APIs</a> that you could spend years studying and learning, but the market will have moved on by then and that's no fun anyway, so you cut and paste from examples and manage to get by without a full picture of the architecture supporting your app.</p><p>It's about reading between the lines of documentation and guessing at how edge cases are handled and whether or not your assumptions will still hold true two months or two years from now.</p><p>It's about the constant evolutionary changes that occur in the language definition, the compiler, the libraries, the application framework, and the underlying operating system, that all snowball together and keep you in maintenance mode instead of making real improvements. </p><p>It's about getting derailed by hairline fractures in otherwise reliable tools, and apparently being the first person to discover that a PNG image with four bits-per-pixel and an alpha channel crashes the decoder, then having to work around that.</p><p>One approach is to dig in and power through all the obstacles. If you're fresh out of school, there are free Starbucks lattes down the hall, and all your friends are still at the office at 2 AM, too...well, that works. But then you have to do it again. And again. It's always a last second skid at 120 miles per hour with brakes smoking and tires shredding that makes all the difference between success and failure, but you pulled off another miracle and survived to do it again.</p><p>I still like to build things, and if there's no one else to do it, then I'll do it myself. I keep improving the <a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/77.html">the tiny Perl script</a> that puts together this site, because that tiny Perl script is unobtrusive and reliable and lets me focus on writing. I have a handy little image compositing tool that's less than 28 kilobytes of C and Erlang source. I know how it works inside and out, and I can make changes to it in less time than than it takes to coax what I want out of ImageMagick.</p><p>But large scale, high stress coding? I may have to admit that's a young man's game.</p><p><a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/154.html" id="perm">permalink</a> <i>October 3, 2012</i></p><h2>previously</h2><ul><li><a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/153.html">Digging Out from Years of Homogeneous Computing</a></li><li><a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/152.html">What's Your Hidden Agenda?</a></li><li><a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/151.html">Minimalism in an Age of Tremendous Hardware</a></li><li><a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/150.html">The Goal is to be Like a Bad Hacker Movie</a></li><li><a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/149.html">Hopefully More Controversial Programming Opinions</a></li></ul></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Michael is in his late 50s and is among the millions of people in the UK who cannot or do not want to use mobile apps, and feels he is being penalised for his choice.</p><p>He does own a smartphone – an Apple iPhone he bought secondhand about three years ago – but says: “I don’t use apps at all. I don’t download them for security reasons.”</p><p>Apps have burrowed their way into seemingly every aspect of our lives and there are lots of reasons why companies are pushing us to use them. With an app, it is often “one click and you’re in”, rather than having to faff around online finding the website and remembering passwords. It is also for the “push notifications” that mobile apps send to grab our attention and get us to buy stuff. Many tech experts also argue that apps are generally more secure than websites and allow banks and others to carry out sophisticated ID verification using face, voice and fingerprint biometrics.</p><p>But millions of people who cannot afford a smartphone or have an older device that does not support some services are increasingly being locked out of deals, discounts and even some vital services, say digital exclusion and pro-cash campaigners.</p><p>They are missing out on everything from savings on their weekly shop, to some of the best interest rates for their cash. And not signing up to the app revolution is making activities including paying for parking and going to concerts increasingly challenging.</p><p>“It’s the tyranny of the apps,” says Ron Delnevo, the chair of the campaign committee at lobby group the <a href="https://www.paymentchoicealliance.org/" data-link-name="in body link">Payment Choice Alliance</a>. “In this country we’re being treated like sheep,” he says. “We’re always being told there’s no alternative.” But when a new smartphone can set you back hundreds of pounds, it is “an expensive passport to participate”, Delnevo says.</p><p>According to the latest data from the telecoms regulator Ofcom, 8% of people aged 16 or over do not have a smartphone, which for the UK translates into just under 4.5 million people. Among those aged 75-plus, the proportion is said to be 28%. Add in all those who don’t or can’t use apps and the total number of people affected is a lot bigger.</p><p>Lots of retailers offer enhanced or exclusive deals to their app users, and some run loyalty schemes through them. This is potentially a big deal as those schemes often give you access to discounts that are not otherwise available.</p><p>“Some people are missing out on lower prices offered by loyalty schemes as they do not have access to phones or smart devices to download apps,” Reena Sewraz, the retail editor at Which? says.</p><p>The consumer group is among those to have highlighted Lidl’s loyalty scheme, Lidl Plus, as one that is only accessible via an app, with an email address also required. That means the “big savings” available via the scheme’s weekly offers – at the time of writing these included 25% off tinned tuna and 20% off microwave rice and grain pouches – plus various coupons and rewards, are off-limits to those who cannot or do not wish to go digital.</p><p>Delnevo says Lidl is “disenfranchising” many of its customers, adding: “The people who probably need the discounts most are the people who can’t afford or don’t have a smartphone.”</p><p>In response, the supermarket chain says the Lidl Plus scheme “forms part of our commitment to providing customers with the best value. Nonetheless, we remain mindful of those who don’t have access to a smartphone or tablet and continue to offer in-store promotions through our ‘pick of the&nbsp;week’ offers.”</p><p>Rival supermarket Asda also runs a scheme, Asda Rewards, where you have to download an app and there is no physical card available. This scheme does not offer price promotions – instead, you earn Asda “pounds” when you shop, which you convert into vouchers to spend in-store and online.</p><p>Some retailers have gone further down the app path than others. The Boots Advantage card scheme, one of the UK’s most popular, still lets you use a physical plastic card, although there are “tailored offers” available via the app.</p><figure id="71b82c96-b4ae-45cb-905e-4e30a50a1b58" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23d3e6d6a058e57eb942e300c1f0d54f9cecc3a4/0_233_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23d3e6d6a058e57eb942e300c1f0d54f9cecc3a4/0_233_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23d3e6d6a058e57eb942e300c1f0d54f9cecc3a4/0_233_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23d3e6d6a058e57eb942e300c1f0d54f9cecc3a4/0_233_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23d3e6d6a058e57eb942e300c1f0d54f9cecc3a4/0_233_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23d3e6d6a058e57eb942e300c1f0d54f9cecc3a4/0_233_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Customers with pastries and coffee in a Greggs bakery" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23d3e6d6a058e57eb942e300c1f0d54f9cecc3a4/0_233_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="267" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>At Greggs you get a free hot drink just for downloading the app.</span> Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>And at the bakery chain Greggs, you can collect loyalty “stamps” for free food and drink and&nbsp;get “exclusive app-only gifts”.&nbsp;You currently get a free hot drink just for downloading the app.</p><p>Meanwhile, the online clothes retailer Asos and the tools and hardware specialist Screwfix are just two of those that are or have recently been running “app exclusive” campaigns.

This year marks 40 years since a talented rookie by the name of Michael Jordan wore his signature shoes at the 1985 All-Star Dunk Contest in a colorway that is now firmly ingrained in sneaker culture lore. To mark the occasion, Jordan Brand recreated the shoe in what they say is the closest to OG spec ever. Sneakerheads have been anticipating the drop for months and the demand was predictably crazy.</p><p>At first, everything appeared to be going smoothly. Thousands of entries were rolling in, bots were being neutralized, winners were being picked and notified, but as we started notifying non-winners that they’d missed out, things got weird.</p><p>We started seeing reports of people being told that they had <em>won and lost in the same email…</em> the Schrödinger’s cat of bug reports. What on earth was going on??</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63f4b950d4ba499d292a5807/67b6501b3cd8c968f609f0d6_Screenshot1.webp" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63f4b950d4ba499d292a5807/67b650268e295d42fbd80cf9_Screenshot2.webp" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Now, we’re accustomed to a baseline level of crazy – it comes with the territory of running some of the hottest product launches on the internet. Having a 24/7 support team who can bring calm to the chaos is big reason why brands work with EQL. But even for us, this one felt odd.</p><p>Fans were reporting that their email app was listing ”You’ve been selected” but when they clicked on the email it displayed the heartbreaking “SORRY” non-winner message. Sneaker fans are a passionate bunch, and online launches often trigger the full range of human emotions - to put it mildly! People were understandably mad about the confusing messaging.</p><p>When things heat up, it’s helpful to have a community you can turn to. We operate in a space where people sometimes troll for fun – or profit, like the <a href="https://x.com/EQLofficial/status/1632861398425559041">time</a> someone tried to pretend they’d won 750 pairs of the <a href="https://tiffany.runfair.com/en-GB/us/niketiffany-air-force-1-1837">Nike/Tiffany Air Force 1 1837</a> to pump a cookgroup.</p><p>We reached out to our <a href="https://discord.com/servers/eql-1136853080487514182">Discord community</a>, who confirmed that the issue was real and shared some more screenshots:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63f4b950d4ba499d292a5807/67b6505e233e0e61481beccc_Screenshots3.webp" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The bizarre thing is that our winner emails don’t actually say “You’ve been selected”. As an on-call engineer, this is the point when you start questioning your life choices. You know that the issue is affecting thousands of users, but the offending phrase doesn’t appear anywhere in EQL’s codebase, aside from some very old launches several years ago.</p><p>As more screenshots poured in, another odd thing jumped out – the winning phrase seemed to change from email to email. Some said “selected <em>to purchase </em>JORDAN AJ1”, others said “selected <em>for the </em>JORDAN AJ1”:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63f4b950d4ba499d292a5807/67b6507dc983919b3c85a7df_Screenshot4.webp" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>By this point, we’d narrowed down the affected users to a single email client - <strong>Yahoo Mail</strong>, which is where we got suspicious. Had Yahoo Mail introduced any features lately that might be causing this…?</p><p>As it turns out, yes, yes they had. A quick Google search revealed that a few months ago Yahoo jumped on the AI craze with the launch of ”<a href="https://www.yahooinc.com/press/yahoo-mail-launches-a-new-app-experience-with-mobile-first-ai-features"><strong>AI-generated, one-line email summaries”</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>At this point, the penny dropped. Just like Apple AI <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/16/media/apple-ai-news-fake-headlines/index.html">generating fake news summaries</a>, Yahoo AI was hallucinating the fake winner messages, presumably as a result of training their model on our old emails. Worse, they were putting an untrustworthy AI summary in the exact place that users expect to see an email subject, with no mention of it being AI-generated 🤯</p><p>Some people use Yahoo Mail to read emails from other providers like Gmail, so this issue hit a broad range of sneaker fans. And it’s worth mentioning that as of the time of writing, <strong>this AI feature is still live in Yahoo Mail</strong>, so more confusion is expected in future – not just for sneaker fans receiving launch results, but for anyone reading important emails in Yahoo Mail.</p><p>For EQL users, if you’re ever in doubt, you can always double-check your launch results in the <a href="https://app.eql.com/">fans app</a>, contact our support team (support@eql.com) or join our helpful <a href="https://discord.com/servers/eql-1136853080487514182">Discord community</a>. Until then, we’ll continue fighting the good fight to put products into the hands of real fans and trying to prevent bad AI from ruining your day! 🤖</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>WHAT IS A COMPUTER CLUB?</h2>
<p>a computer club is where a group of people hang out and do computer together</p>

<h2>WHAT IS "DOING COMPUTER"?</h2>
<p>doing computer is whatever you want...on computers, together. our bias is towards programming and <span dir="ltr" lang="en"> diy </span> shared computing infrastructure. but there's also art and music and open data science and circuit-bending and a million other things we don't know about</p>

<h2>WHY SHOULD I START A COMPUTER CLUB?</h2>
<p>the political economy of computing is awful. have you read <a dir="ltr" lang="en" href="https://bookwyrm.social/book/525851/s/palo-alto"> palo alto</a>? me neither. we should read it. we deserve better than the <span dir="ltr" lang="en"> darpa-funded </span> visions of <span dir="ltr" lang="en"> xerox parc </span> technologists</p>
<p>make the political economy of computing less awful and bring it home to you and yours by starting a computer club in the place that you live</p>

<h2>RULES</h2>
<p>we can't make you do anything, so do whatever you want. but these are the things we think are really important</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>hang out in real life:</strong> online has rude vibes, real life has kinder vibes. hang out in real life for trust and strength and to ground your computer club in your actual local context</li>
    <li><strong>reject corporate sponsorship:</strong> corporate sponsorship constrains behavior and undermines collective ownership. computer club isn't yours if a corporate sponsor might get upset by something you do</li>
    <li><strong>computer club is a collective project:</strong> you don't need a mission statement, but you might have an ethos that defines your computer club. computer club is beholden only to that ethos and the people who show up</li>
</ul>

<h2>GUIDELINES</h2>
<p>we still can't make you do anything, so continue doing whatever you want. but these are things we think are important to think about</p>
<ul>
    <li>computing is political, so let computer club be political too</li>
    <li>the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/social-rules"><span dir="ltr" lang="en"> recurse center </span> social rules</a> foster collaboration and psychological safety, consider using them</li>
    <li>be inspired by permaculture</li>
    <li>be inspired by small web</li>
    <li>be inspired by <span dir="ltr" lang="en"> diy </span> culture</li>
    <li>be inspired by computing as a medium through which better things are possible</li>
    <li>try to host computer club's stuff on your own computers in the place that you live</li>
    <li>be open to interdisciplinary computing</li>
    <li>be open to different histories and "skill levels" with computing</li>
</ul>

<h2>HOW SHOULD I START THE COMPUTER CLUB</h2>
<p>there are lots of ways to start a computer club; how you start will be unique to yours. but you could try</p>
<ul>
    <li>talk about what used to excite you about doing computer. talk about how the political economy of computing could be better. talk about these things publicly. the computer club might already be breathing in the communities you're in</li>
    <li>attend preexisting computing meetups and find like-minded people. meetups about "how to <span dir="ltr" lang="en"> node.js </span> apolitically" are sidelining people who want "how to <span dir="ltr" lang="en"> node.js </span> pro-socially." don't try to be a recruiter -- just be excited at events and find people who are also excited</li>
    <li>does your city have a food coop? food coops and computer clubs have a similar ethos; and food coops are a great place to get your food for the same reasons that a computer club is a great place to do computer. make friends at your food coop and find the computer-doers</li>
    <li>join a project or start a project and talk to people there about starting a computer club. are you or someone you know doing<ul>
        <li>web design for a <span dir="ltr" lang="en"> diy </span> venue? work together!</li>
        <li>technical support for a cool local project? work together!</li>
        <li>communications for your neighborhood's nascent mesh network? work together!</li>
        <li>analysis for local open data projects? work together!</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>talk to existing computer clubs!</li>
</ul>
