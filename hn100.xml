<p>With currently reviewing the HP Z6 G5 A workstation powered by the new 96-core <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-linux-threadripper-pro-7995wx">AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 7995WX</a> Zen 4 processor, one of the areas I was curious about was how well HP's tuned Microsoft Windows 11 compares to that of Linux. In this article is looking at how the Microsoft Windows 11 performance is out-of-the-box with the HP Z6 G5 A workstation as configured by HP versus a clean install of Ubuntu 23.10 with the Linux 6.5 kernel.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=threadripper-7995wx-windows-linux&amp;image=threadripper_windows_1_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=threadripper-7995wx-windows-linux&amp;image=threadripper_windows_1_med" alt="Windows 11 on Threadripper PRO 7995WX"></a></p>
<p>Going back to the original AMD Ryzen Threadripper processors, Linux has long possessed a performance lead over Microsoft Windows. With Linux typically being the dominant OS of HPC systems and other large core count servers, the Linux kernel scheduler has coped better than various flavors of Windows when dealing with high core count processors. Paired with some early Windows issues that Microsoft and AMD has since worked through. Linux has gained a reputation of handling these HEDT systems better than Windows.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=threadripper-7995wx-windows-linux&amp;image=threadripper_windows_3_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=threadripper-7995wx-windows-linux&amp;image=threadripper_windows_3_med" alt="AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 7995WX processor"></a></p>
<p>In being curious about the difference for these new Zen 4 Threadrippers and now being able to push things to the extreme with the Threadripper PRO 7995WX 96-core / 192-thread processor, I set out for some fresh benchmarks. The HP Z6 G5 A review unit was preloaded with Microsoft Windows 11 Pro as configured by HP and so it makes for a nice perspective of looking at the Windows performance as validated by the hardware vendor. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=threadripper-7995wx-windows-linux&amp;image=threadripper_windows_2_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=threadripper-7995wx-windows-linux&amp;image=threadripper_windows_2_med" alt="Windows 11 on Threadripper PRO 7995WX"></a></p>
<p>After running through all of the Windows benchmarks of tests relevant to HEDT/workstations and that work similarly on Windows and Linux, I then set out to do the Linux benchmarks. Ubuntu 23.10 was run for providing a clean, out-of-the-box look at this common desktop/workstation Linux distribution. Benchmarks of other Linux distributions will come in time in follow-up Phoronix articles. But for the most part the Ubuntu 23.10 performance should be largely similar to that of other modern Linux distributions with the exception of Intel's Clear Linux that takes things to the extreme or those doing non-default tinkering to their Linux installations.</p>
<p><img type="image/svg+xml" width="100%" height="auto" src="https://phoronix.com/benchmark/result/amd-ryzen-threadripper-pro-7995wx---windows-11-vs-ubuntu-linux/result.svgz" alt="AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 7995WX - Windows 11 vs. Ubuntu Linux"></p>
<p>The HP Z6 G5 A for all testing was configured with the Ryzen Threadripper PRO 7995WX at default frequencies, 8 x 16GB DDR5-5200 Hynix RDIMMs, Samsung MZVL21T0HCLR-00BH1 NVMe SSD, NVIDIA GeForce RTX A4000 16GB graphics. A full review on the HP Z6 G5 A Threadripper workstation will be published in a separate article on Phoronix in early December.</p>
<p>From there the up-to-date Windows 11 Pro Build 22631 (H2'23) was tested against Ubuntu 23.10 with its stable release updates. Let's see how Windows and Ubuntu Linux perform on this 96-core / 192-thread Zen 4 workstation with 128GB of RAM.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Language models only really need to use an exponential fraction of their neurons for individual inferences. As proof, we present UltraFastBERT, a BERT variant that uses 0.3% of its neurons during inference while performing on par with similar BERT models. UltraFastBERT selectively engages just 12 out of 4095 neurons for each layer inference. This is achieved by replacing feedforward networks with fast feedforward networks (FFFs). While no truly efficient implementation currently exists to unlock the full acceleration potential of conditional neural execution, we provide high-level CPU code achieving 78x speedup over the optimized baseline feedforward implementation, and a PyTorch implementation delivering 40x speedup over the equivalent batched feedforward inference. We publish our training code, benchmarking setup, and model weights.

<p><a href="https://watabou.itch.io/cave-generator">Watabou’s Cave Generator</a> is one in a series of RPG-ready map generators that Watabou has created over the years. <a href="https://watabou.itch.io/">All his work</a> oozes style, but the cave generator was always the one I found most mysterious.</p>



<p>I discovered that the entire thing was exported with extremely readable javascript, so naturally I started to poke and prod. Let’s go over how it works.</p>












<p>We’ll focus on how this map is generated for version 2.0.2:</p>





<h2><span id="Getting_started"></span>Getting started<span></span></h2>



<p>The main thing to initialize are tags. These are randomly picked, but can also be set by the user.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="285" height="300" src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tags-285x300.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tags-285x300.png 285w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tags.png 550w" sizes="(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px"></figure></div>


<p>Tags control the later generation steps. Sometimes they switch between different algorithms, but more commonly they act as presets for numeric parameters. I’ll refer to tags <kbd>like this</kbd> when they are referenced. Some tags are mutually exclusive – e.g. only one of <kbd>small</kbd> / <kbd>medium</kbd> / <kbd>large</kbd> can be chosen.</p>



<p>Some other global parameters are randomly chosen at the start, such as chamber size and connectedness preference for area growth. This gives each dungeon a more consistent feel across the map.</p>



<p>Like all procedural generators, there is a seed parameter that controls all sources of randomness. This enables permalinks for maps by storing the seed.</p>



<h2><span id="The_hidden_grid"></span>The hidden grid<span></span></h2>



<p>It’s not obvious, but in fact everything in the generator is done on a hex grid. Let’s see the final output again, this time with all the graphical details turned off – no wobbly lines, no random rocks, no water, no superimposed square gridlines.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="891" src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_6-1024x891.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_6-1024x891.png 1024w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_6-300x261.png 300w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_6-768x668.png 768w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_6-1536x1337.png 1536w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_6-2048x1783.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>Now you can see the actual specifics of the map. But how is the layout actually achieved?</p>



<h2><span id="Grid_To_Mesh"></span>Grid To Mesh<span></span></h2>



<p>After creating the hex grid, it is immediately converted into a data structure called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_connected_edge_list">Doubly connected edge list</a>, which is essentially a fancy way of representing a mesh of polygons and their neighbours. Everything in the generator operates on this mesh data structure – it’s not tied to hexes at all. I was able to hack in square grids without much difficulty, the author just didn’t find a use for this feature.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="252" height="300" src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/square_cave_generator-252x300.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/square_cave_generator-252x300.png 252w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/square_cave_generator-768x914.png 768w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/square_cave_generator.png 835w" sizes="(max-width: 252px) 100vw, 252px"><figcaption>An output created using a square grid</figcaption></figure></div>


<h2><span id="Seed_Growth"></span>Seed Growth<span></span></h2>



<p>The majority of the map is generated with an algorithm called seed growth<sup data-fn="8b84f512-06eb-431d-9cd4-7fa20b515d17"><a href="#8b84f512-06eb-431d-9cd4-7fa20b515d17" id="8b84f512-06eb-431d-9cd4-7fa20b515d17-link">1</a></sup>. It picks a random starting location and then adds adjacent cells at random until a predetermined size has been met. This is then repeated to give several areas. Areas are not permitted to touch each other. </p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="891" src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_1-1024x891.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_1-1024x891.png 1024w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_1-300x261.png 300w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_1-768x668.png 768w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_1-1536x1337.png 1536w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_1-2048x1783.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>Most of the details of the generation are determined by tags:</p>



<p>The number of areas is 9-19 for a <kbd>large</kbd> map, 3-8 for a <kbd>medium</kbd> and 2-3 for a <kbd>small</kbd>. If no tags are present has a 1 in 20 chance of picking 2 or 20, otherwise it uses a random formula.</p>



<p>The size of each area is also a random function. For <kbd>hub</kbd> generations, there is one area of size 60-79, and other areas of size 8-13. For <kbd>chamber</kbd>, a random chamber size is chosen between 11-14, and then each area is randomly offset from that by 0-2. And for <kbd>burrow</kbd>, it uses formula <code>10 + 80 * pow((rand() + rand() + rand()) / 3, 3)</code> which gives rooms around size 23, but occasionally much larger.</p>



<p>When choosing which cell to add to the area, they are weighted differently according to various algorithms. By default, it weights each cell as <code>pow(c, gamma)</code> where c is the number of adjacent cells already in the area, and gamma is a random variable indicating the preference for connection. High gamma tends to cause rounder areas with fewer jutting pieces. <kbd>cavities</kbd> fixes the gamma of 6, while <kbd>coral</kbd> uses a negative gamma so each area prefers narrow tendrils. <kbd>chaotic</kbd> prefers cells with 2 connections.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="250" src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_coral-300x250.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_coral-300x250.png 300w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_coral-1024x853.png 1024w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_coral-768x640.png 768w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_coral-1536x1280.png 1536w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_coral.png 1777w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"><figcaption><kbd>coral</kbd> is probably the most distinctive style.</figcaption></figure></div>


<h2><span id="Building_doorways"></span>Building doorways<span></span></h2>



<p>Now its time to connect up all the areas. First, the algorithm identifies all cells that border two elements.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="891" src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_2-1024x891.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_2-1024x891.png 1024w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_2-300x261.png 300w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_2-768x668.png 768w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_2-1536x1337.png 1536w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_2-2048x1783.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>The possible area-pairs are then culled. For <kbd>tree</kbd>, a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search">depth first search</a> ensures each area is only reachable a single way (no loops). For <kbd>connected</kbd>, if it finds 3 areas all adjacent, it disconnects one pair. Otherwise, all pairs are kept.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="891" src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_3-1024x891.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_3-1024x891.png 1024w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_3-300x261.png 300w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_3-768x668.png 768w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_3-1536x1337.png 1536w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_3-2048x1783.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>For each pair, a single door cell is randomly chosen from amongst the possibilities and added to the map.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="891" src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_5-1024x891.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_5-1024x891.png 1024w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_5-300x261.png 300w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_5-768x668.png 768w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_5-1536x1337.png 1536w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_5-2048x1783.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<h2><span id="Building_Corridors"></span>Building Corridors<span></span></h2>



<p>Some areas are randomly chosen to shrink to corridors. It prefers areas with a large number of doors for the area, and some tags, particularly <kbd>burrows</kbd>, greatly increase the chances.</p>



<p>To shrink an area, points are repeatedly removed, and flood-fill is used to ensure that the doors are all still connected, which I describe more in <a href="https://www.boristhebrave.com/2022/03/20/chiseled-paths-revisited/">Chiseled Paths Revisited</a>.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="891" src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_6-1024x891.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_6-1024x891.png 1024w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_6-300x261.png 300w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_6-768x668.png 768w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_6-1536x1337.png 1536w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_6-2048x1783.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>At this point, exits are chosen too, which are randomly selected from eligible border cells. Cells further from the center get higher weights. The exact number of exits can be controlled with tags <kbd>sealed</kbd>, <kbd>entrance</kbd>, <kbd>passage</kbd>, <kbd>junction</kbd>.</p>



<h2><span id="Water"></span>Water<span></span></h2>



<p>The water is simply an independent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise">Perlin noise</a>, which is compared against a threshold. It’s more obvious in v2.1.0, where you can play with a slider.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="602" height="662" src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_water_anim.gif" alt=""></figure>



<h2><span id="Rough_outlines"></span>Rough outlines<span></span></h2>



<p>The hexagonal nature of the walls is hidden via several steps:</p>



<ul>
<li>Every edge is subdivided</li>



<li>The outline is smoothed (“bumpiness”)</li>



<li>Vertices in corridors are moved towards the face center.</li>



<li>The points are randomly offset (“irregularity”)</li>



<li>Two more iterations of subdivision and randomness (“roughness”)</li>



<li>The boundary is converted to curves with <a href="https://observablehq.com/@pamacha/chaikins-algorithm">Chaikin’s Algorithm</a> (not shown in gif)</li>
</ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1077" height="746" src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_geometry.gif" alt=""></figure>



<h2><span id="Cosmetics"></span>Cosmetics<span></span></h2>



<p>Some random small polygons are dropped on the map to make stones and rubble. <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/hatching-in-1pdg-31716880">Dyson hatching</a> is applied near the boundary.</p>



<h2><span id="Title"></span>Title<span></span></h2>



<p>The title of each map is generated using a <a href="https://tracery.io/">Tracery</a> script. Many features contribute to the choices – “demonic” names are more likely for certain tags, and the presence of water increases the chance of damp names like “Bog”.</p>



<p>The top-level rule gives you an idea of what it’s like:</p>



<pre><code>	"name" : [
		"#compound_noun# #noun#",
		"#adj# #noun#",
		"0.2?-#noun# of #fantasy#",
		"!LARGE&amp;0.2?-#person#'s #noun#",
		"!SMALL&amp;0.1?-#noun# of #epic_noun#"],</code></pre>



<h2><span id="Glade_Mode"></span>Glade Mode<span></span></h2>



<p>Glade mode re-purposes the entire generator for making forest clearings. The main differences are the trees randomly drawn along the border, and the name generator switches to a different script. I love how you can switch it on and see the same map completely re-interpreted.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="891" src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_glade-1024x891.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_glade-1024x891.png 1024w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_glade-300x261.png 300w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_glade-768x668.png 768w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_glade-1536x1337.png 1536w, https://www.boristhebrave.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/razorfall_hollows_glade-2048x1783.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h2><span id="Summary"></span>Summary<span></span></h2>



<p>Oleg’s generator illustrates a common maxim in procedural generation. Great results don’t come from applying a super advanced algorithm, but rather by combining several simple rules effectively, and with an eye to the look and style you are aiming for.</p>



<p>In my opinion, Some of the rules used here, notably seed growth, and path chiseling offer a nice balance of simplicity to useful results and are generally underappreciated as techniques.</p>


<ol><li id="8b84f512-06eb-431d-9cd4-7fa20b515d17">We’ve seen “seed growth” before in my <a href="https://www.boristhebrave.com/2020/09/12/dungeon-generation-in-binding-of-isaac/">Binding of Isaac</a> article. But there’s no widely known name for this technique that I’m aware of.  <a href="#8b84f512-06eb-431d-9cd4-7fa20b515d17-link" aria-label="Jump to footnote reference 1">↩︎</a></li></ol>			</div><!-- .entry-content -->

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Federal Trade Commission has approved an omnibus resolution authorizing the use of compulsory process in nonpublic investigations involving&nbsp;products and services that use or claim to be produced using artificial intelligence (AI) or claim to detect its use.</p>

<p><span><span><span>The omnibus resolution will streamline FTC staff’s ability to </span></span></span><span><span><span>issue civil investigative demands (CIDs), which are a form of compulsory process similar to a subpoena</span></span></span>, in investigations relating to AI, while retaining the Commission’s authority to determine when CIDs are issued. The FTC issues CIDs to obtain documents, information and testimony that advance FTC consumer protection and competition investigations. The omnibus resolution will be in effect for 10 years.</p>

<p>AI includes, but is not limited to, machine-based systems that can, for a set of defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments. Generative AI can be used to generate synthetic content including images, videos, audio, text, and other digital content that appear to be created by humans. Many companies now offer products and services using AI and generative AI, while others offer products and services that claim to detect content made by generative AI.</p>

<p>Although AI, including generative AI, offers many beneficial uses, it can also be used to engage in fraud, deception, infringements on privacy, and other unfair practices, which may violate the FTC Act and other laws. At the same time, AI can raise competition issues in a variety of ways, including if one or just a few companies control the essential inputs or technologies that underpin AI.</p>

<p>The Commission voted 3-0 to approve the omnibus resolution&nbsp;authorizing compulsory process in investigations related to the use of AI.</p>

<p>The lead FTC staffers on this matter are Nadine Samter and Ben Halpern-Meekin in the FTC’s Northwest Region office.</p>

              <p>AUSTIN, Texas — Scientists have discovered that bacteria can create something like memories about when to form strategies that can cause dangerous infections in people, such as resistance to antibiotics and bacterial swarms when millions of bacteria come together on a single surface. The discovery — which has potential applications for preventing and combatting bacterial infections and addressing antibiotic-resistant bacteria — relates to a common chemical element bacterial cells can use to form and pass along these memories to their progeny over later generations.</p>
<p>Researchers at The University of Texas at Austin found that E. coli bacteria use iron levels as a way to store information about different behaviors that can then be activated in response to certain stimuli.</p>
<p>The findings are published in the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2309082120"><em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em></a>.</p>
<p>Scientists had previously observed that bacteria that had a prior experience of swarming (moving on a surface as a collective using flagella) improve subsequent swarming performance. &nbsp;The UT-led research team set out to learn why. Bacteria don’t have neurons, synapses or nervous systems, so any memories are not like the ones of blowing out candles at a childhood birthday party. They are more like information stored on a computer.</p>
<p>“Bacteria don’t have brains, but they can gather information from their environment, and if they have encountered that environment frequently, they can store that information and quickly access it later for their benefit,” said Souvik Bhattacharyya, the lead author and a provost early career fellow in the Department of Molecular Biosciences at UT.</p>
<p>It all comes back to iron, one of the most abundant elements on Earth. Singular and free-floating bacteria have varying levels of iron. Scientists observed that bacterial cells with lower levels of iron were better swarmers. In contrast, bacteria that formed biofilms, dense, sticky mats of bacteria on solid surfaces, had high levels of iron in their cells. Bacteria with antibiotic tolerance also had balanced levels of iron. These iron memories persist for at least four generations and disappear by the seventh generation.</p>

<p>“Before there was oxygen in the Earth’s atmosphere, early cellular life was utilizing iron for a lot of cellular processes. Iron is not only critical in the origin of life on Earth, but also in the evolution of life,” Bhattacharyya said. “It makes sense that cells would utilize it in this way.”</p>
<p>Researchers theorize that when iron levels are low, bacterial memories are triggered to form a fast-moving migratory swarm to seek out iron in the environment. When iron levels are high, memories indicate this environment is a good place to stick around and form a biofilm.</p>
<p>“Iron levels are definitely a target for therapeutics because iron is an important factor in virulence,” Bhattacharyya said. “Ultimately, the more we know about bacterial behavior, the easier it is combat them.”</p>
<p>The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health. Rasika Harshey, a professor of molecular biosciences and Mary M. Betzner Morrow Centennial Chair in Microbiology, is the senior corresponding author on the paper. Nabin Bhattarai, Dylan M. Pfannenstiel and Brady Wilkins, along with Abhyudai Singh of University of Delaware, also contributed to the research.</p>

Readers don't like adverts, and they like being tracked around the web even less. It's not great for publishers either - they need huge amounts of traffic, and associated ad clicks to make producing content worthwhile.</p><p>One solution is for publishers to erect a hard paywall. This means that if you want to read <em>any </em>articles on a website, you have to have a subscription and log into the site. Nothing and no-one can get past without a subscription. There are some sites that require you to create a 'free' account to make it easier to target and track your usage.</p><p>There are a few websites that operate this way. <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">The Times</a> is notably one hard holdout. While publishers using hard paywalls often have a more reliable revenue stream, there are disadvantages to operating a completely solid paywall. Search engines can't access your content, which means that your SEO is shot.</p><p>Soft paywalls operate differently, and whether or not, and how they allow you to view content depends on factors such as how many articles you've viewed this month, whether you're a bot, the source of your click, and other such metrics.</p><p>Click through from the wrong source, have the wrong user agent string, or read too many gift articles? Tough shit. It's time to buy a raft of subscriptions. Unless, of course, the articles are so-called 'buyers guides', lists of tech you can buy, best-of reviews, or other such crappy content designed to shift stock through affiliate links. In this case, you can probably read as much as you want.</p><p>The kind of paywall that shows up if your browser is using an adblock, is especially disliked.</p><h2 id="h-there-are-workarounds-for-soft-paywalls">There are workarounds for soft paywalls</h2><figure><img src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/scooterman.png" alt="Someone driving past a brick wall on a scooter" width="1680" height="840" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/scooterman-xs.webp 300w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/scooterman-sm.webp 480w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/scooterman-md.webp 768w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/scooterman-lg.webp 1024w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/scooterman-xl.webp 1360w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/scooterman-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p>As soft paywalls usually kick in based on who you are, where you've come from, and what you've already read, you can fake fake some of these factors.</p><p>If you want to read a Financial Times article, for instance, you'll need to set your browser user agent to spoof as googlebot - or just go and read Google's cached version.</p><p>For other sites, you have to stop assets being loaded from certain domains or subdomains.</p><p>Of course, the simplest soft paywall relies on cookies, so it's a simple thing to right-click on links, and open them in spanky new private windows, and close the window when you're done. Some sites will even let you in if you preface the URL with "<strong>https://facebook.com/l.php?u</strong>=".</p><p>There are other hacks, and we even have a spreadsheet somewhere with a list.</p><p>But it's a chore.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The experiment offered clear evidence that, in addition to other cells, “glial cells can also sense physical forces” through this mechanosensory channel, said <a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/labs/vassilis-pachnis">Vassilis Pachnis</a>, the head of the nervous system development and homeostasis laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute. Then, having sensed the change in force, they can shift the activity of neural circuits to trigger muscular contractions. “It’s a wonderful piece of work,” he said.</p>
<p>Hub cells are only one of many glial subtypes that play functional roles in the gut. Scavuzzo’s new six subtypes, added to those <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32888429/">characterized in previous research</a><u>,</u> together reveal 14 known subgroups of glia across the duodenum, ileum and colon. More are likely to be discovered in coming years, each with new potential to better explain how digestion works and enable researchers to develop treatments for a variety of gastrointestinal disorders.</p>
<h2><strong>A Pain in the Gut</strong></h2>
<p>Gastrointestinal diseases often come with a dose of pain, in addition to disruptive digestive issues. Eating the wrong food, or too much of the right one, can cause a stomachache. Those gut feelings are driven by enteric nerve cells, including glia. Because glia are now known to control the activity of immune cells, they are suspected to play a role in many gastrointestinal disorders and diseases, making them good potential targets for treatments.</p>
<p>Several years ago, Pachnis and his group found that glia are among the first cell types to respond to injury or inflammation in the mouse gut, and that tampering with enteric glial cells can also create an inflammatory response. In the gut glia seem to perform roles similar to those of true immune cells, Pachnis said, and so their dysfunction can lead to chronic autoimmune disorders and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304394023002744">inflammatory bowel diseases</a>, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. “Glial cells definitely play a role in the initiation, the pathogenesis and the progression of the various diseases of the gut,” he said.</p>

<p>Glia are likely involved because of their central role in communicating between the microbiome, immune cells and other gut cells. Healthy glia strengthen the intestines’ epithelial barrier, a layer of cells that keeps out toxins and pathogens and absorbs nutrients. But in patients with Crohn’s disease, glial cells don’t function properly, resulting in a weaker barrier and inappropriate immune response.</p>
<p>“Different subtypes of glia can be functioning differently or dysfunctioning in a wide range of diseases and disorders where motility is impacted,” Scavuzzo said. They have also been linked to neural inflammation, hypersensitivity in the organs and even neuron death.</p>
<p>For instance, Gulbransen and his team recently discovered that <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scisignal.adg1668">glia contribute to gut pain</a> by secreting molecules that sensitize neurons. This is likely an adaptive response intended to draw the gut’s attention to damaging substances to dispose of them, Gulbransen said, which as a side effect causes pain.</p>
<p>The findings, published today in <em>Science Signaling</em>, suggest that targeting glia could help alleviate some of the pain created by inflammatory disorders of the gut.</p>

<p>Glia themselves can also become stressed by genetic problems, exposure to metabolites from the microbiome, bad diet or other factors. Fattahi has observed that, no matter the cause, stressed enteric glia influence the entire tissue, and sometimes even damage neighboring neurons or recruit immune cells, causing additional inflammation and pain.</p>
<p>These new studies in enteric glia will go a long way toward explaining many gastrointestinal disorders that researchers have struggled to understand and treat, Sharkey said. “I’m really excited to see how these cells have evolved to become central figures in enteric neurobiology over the years.”</p>
<p>It’s becoming ever clearer that the neuron doesn’t act alone in the enteric system, he added. “It’s got these beautiful partners in glia that really allow it to do its thing in the most efficient and effective way.”</p>

<h3>
Why does the moon change size when you snipe it?
</h3>


<div id="post-body-654466784851103966">
<p>The artists gave me a texture for the moon in III. I placed the moon in the sky, made sure it was visible at night and that it was a reasonable size.</p><p>A few days later 4 artists were at my desk asking me to change the size of the moon.</p><p>"No problem" I said.</p><p>It turned out they couldn't decide what the size of the moon should be. 2 of them wanted it smaller to be more realistic. The other 2 wanted it larger to be more cinematic.</p><p>This went on a bit and I suggested to make the size of the moon changeable in the game. This way they could decide in their own time and let me know the conclusion. Since I was working on the sniper rifle, I made it so that the moon toggled through 3 sizes (small, medium, large) as the player sniped it.</p><p>The artists never got back to me so I just left it in. It was still there in SA.</p>

<div>
<p>
There was a 6 weeks gap between finishing gta3 and the release. This was needed for burning the cd and distribution. In those days you couldn't patch so there was no point hanging around. The company gave the team some time off and most people took some extra time also. After the release, we started on Vice City. It was RockStar New York's idea to set the game in the 80s in Miami. Originally it was supposed to be a mission pack to gta3. Only once gta3 did as well as it did and Vice City started to look sufficiently different from gta3 was the decision made to make it a standalone game. This was quite far into the project. (maybe 6 months or so) We did the PC conversion of gta3 ourselves. This took the programmers about 6 months. In the mean time the artists and level designers were able to get straight onto Vice City. This worked well as there aren't that many code changes from gta3 to Vice whereas it did involve building a whole new city and new missions. The artists and l

<h3><a href="https://insiderockstarnorth.blogspot.com/2023/11/the-trouble-with-cheats.html">The trouble with cheats</a></h3>

<div>
<p>
(Warning: techy) The cheats in the trilogy were activated by simply typing a sequence of characters. On PC the sequence would be something like ILOVESCOTLAND to make it rain or GUNSGUNSGUNS to give the player loads of weapons. The game remembers the last 20 or so keypresses and every time a new key is pressed, these keypresses are compared with the cheats. If there is a match, the cheat will activate. The straightforward way of doing this would be to compare the string "ILOVESCOTLAND" with the string of keypresses. This approach would mean that the strings for the cheats would be in memory as readable text. Any hacker could easily find the cheats and they would all be discovered on the day of release. This is why I used 'hash codes' to store the cheats. A hash code is a number that is calculated from a string. As an example; a simple hash algorithm could add up the ASCII values of each character of the string. The hash code for ILOVESCOTLAND would be 983. For GUNSGUNS

Source: Wikipedia Commons</p></div><div><p><a href="https://www.cnu.org/node/9983">RAHUL  REJEEV</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOV. 13, 2023</p></div><div property="content:encoded" id="journal-main-content"><p><em>“Why don’t children leave the house?”</em></p>

<p>Childhood in America is losing its charm. The lack of effective transit, coupled with the lack of kid-friendly destinations and the feeling of more dangerous neighborhoods, means that today’s youth find it harder than ever to go outside, meet up with friends, and form more meaningful relationships.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A fundamental truth about American society is our heavy reliance on cars. The average American will spend over six months of their life behind a traffic light. American suburbs are dominated by wide streets, catering to cars and not people. Beyond the walkability concerns associated with car-centric urban planning, there's the fact that obtaining a driver’s license is only possible at the age of 16. Moreover, recent trends show a delay in teenagers’ pursuit of driver’s licenses. In 1983, 46.2 percent of 16-year-olds were licensed, compared to 25.1 percent in 2020. This shift can be partly due to the financial burdens of car ownership, insurance, and maintenance. Thus, for many young individuals, their desire to drive is overridden by these barriers.</p>

<p>Lack of mobility coupled with large distances means that kids are far from the places where they want to hang out. As described by Ray Oldenburg, “third places” are locations where locals can meet, interact, and relax in a place that isn’t their home or place of work. In these locations, kids get the chance to socialize and develop intellectually. American suburbs don’t have these places. I&nbsp; am currently a rising senior in high school in the US, here after spending my freshman and sophomore years in England. My friends and I lived within 10 minutes of each other and all the parks. It was easy to meet up, easy to be around people. We could meet at the local park and drink slushies by the neighborhood corner shop. It was a place where we could expect to see people we knew and have a chat. Our lack of a driver’s license didn’t hold us back.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In England, housing is often characterized by closely situated semi-detached or terraced structures built under flexible zoning regulations. This environment allows small businesses to coexist harmoniously with residential areas, in contrast to the rigid industrial zoning common in the United States. Notably, green spaces and corner stores are thoughtfully incorporated into English neighborhoods, encouraging residents to step out of their homes. This foot traffic contributes to enhanced safety, aligning with Jane Jacobs' observation that more eyes on the streets cultivate secure environments. Parents are sometimes scared to let their kids go out in non-walkable environments, especially in America.</p>

<figure><img alt="" src="https://www.cnu.org/sites/default/files/Rahul_SemiDetatched%20PC%20Wikipedia%20Commons.png"><figcaption>Examples of semi-detached, terraced, and corner shop urbanism. Source: Wikipedia Commons</figcaption></figure><p>It’s said that people will walk up to five minutes, before they would rather drive. With this in mind, points of interest like small green spaces or bodega-type shops are essential to weave into suburbs. Having a small grocery shop or cafe close to&nbsp;home improves quality of life and encourages&nbsp;people&nbsp;of all ages&nbsp;to get out more. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Many American suburbs currently employ what’s called “Euclidean zoning” where land is zoned for one use, whether it be for single-family housing or industrial zones. Suburbs must move towards mixed-use zoning where housing, small businesses, offices, and parks can co-exist. Mixed zoning often enables multi-story and more high-density housing. Mixed zoning has the potential promise of creating housing for all ranges of people, an inclusive community with amenities within walking distance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Housing diversity near transit stops could help alleviate traffic. With more people within walking distance of public transport, ridership rises, increasing funding. This allows mass transport to run more often and new lines to be created, promoting&nbsp;transport system use that&nbsp;reduces&nbsp;congestion and commute times. Public transport is the only guaranteed way for a young person to be free and enjoy mobility. In England, my peers and I would ride from town to town, allowing us to meet up with people from other parts of the country at skateparks and public events. American youth don’t experience this level of freedom until they get their driver’s license and can afford a car, the maintenance, and insurance that comes with it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Through mixed-use zoning, the creation of pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, and better public transport, we can improve the lives of young people. Envision a new norm for American children, where they can more easily create friendships and interact with the broader world. With our lives becoming increasingly entrenched in the virtual world, it’s more important than ever that we create neighborhoods that make connecting with people in the physical world easy.&nbsp;</p>
