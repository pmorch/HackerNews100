According to Valeo's complaint, Mohammad Moniruzzaman, an engineer for NVIDIA who used to work for its company, had mistakenly showed its source code files on his computer as he was sharing his screen during a meeting with both firms in 2022. Valeo's employees quickly recognized the code and took screenshots before Moniruzzaman was notified of his mistake.</p><p>To note, Valeo and NVIDIA are working together on an advanced parking and driving assistance technology offered by a manufacturer to its customers. Valeo used to be in charge of both software and hardware sides of the manufacturer's parking assistance tech. In 2021, however, the the bigger corporation won the contract to develop its parking assistance software. Valeo wrote in its lawsuit that its former employee, who helped it develop its parking and driving assistance systems, had realized that his exposure and access to its proprietary technologies would make him "exceedingly valuable" to NVIDIA.</p><p>Moniruzzaman allegedly gave his personal email unauthorized access to Valeo's systems to steal "tens of thousands of files" and 6GB of source code shortly after that development. He then left Valeo a few months later and took the stolen information with him when he was given a senior position at NVIDIA, the complaint reads. He also worked on the very same project he was involved in for Valeo, which is why he was present at that video conference.</p><p>Valeo said its former employee admitted to stealing its software and that German police found its documentation and hardware pinned on Moniruzzaman's walls when his home was raided.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Have you heard of the ‘Dunning-Kruger effect’? It’s the (apparent) tendency for unskilled people to overestimate their competence. Discovered in 1999 by psychologists <a target="_blank" href="https://www.avaresearch.com/files/UnskilledAndUnawareOfIt.pdf" rel="noopener">Justin Kruger and David Dunning</a>, the effect has since become famous.</p>
<p>And you can see why.</p>
<p>It’s the kind of idea that is too juicy to <em>not</em> be true. Everyone ‘knows’ that idiots tend to be unaware of their own idiocy. Or as John Cleese <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvVPdyYeaQU" rel="noopener">puts it</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
If you’re very very stupid, how can you possibly realize that you’re very very stupid?
</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, psychologists have been careful to make sure that the evidence replicates. But sure enough, every time you look for it, the Dunning-Kruger effect leaps out of the data. So it would seem that everything’s on sound footing.</p>
<p>Except there’s a problem.</p>
<p>The Dunning-Kruger effect also emerges from data in which it <em>shouldn’t</em>. For instance, if you carefully craft random data so that it does not contain a Dunning-Kruger effect, you will <em>still find the effect</em>. The reason turns out to be embarrassingly simple: the Dunning-Kruger effect has nothing to do with human psychology.<a target="_blank" href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener"><sup>1</sup></a> It is a statistical artifact — a stunning example of autocorrelation.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-autocorrelation">What is autocorrelation?</h3>
<p>Autocorrelation occurs when you correlate a variable with itself. For instance, if I measure the height of 10 people, I’ll find that each person’s height correlates perfectly with itself. If this sounds like circular reasoning, that’s because it is. Autocorrelation is the statistical equivalent of stating that 5 = 5.</p>
<p>When framed this way, the idea of autocorrelation sounds absurd. No competent scientist would correlate a variable with itself. And that’s true for the <em>pure</em> form of autocorrelation. But what if a variable gets mixed into both sides of an equation, where it is forgotten? In that case, autocorrelation is more difficult to spot.</p>
<p>Here’s an example. Suppose I am working with two variables, <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>. I find that these variables are completely uncorrelated, as shown in the left panel of Figure <a href="#fig-auto">1</a>. So far so good.</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/economicsfromthetopdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/autocor.png?w=723&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption><strong>Figure 1: Generating autocorrelation.</strong> The left panel plots the random variables <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>, which are uncorrelated. The right panel shows how this non-correlation can be transformed into an autocorrelation. We define a variable called <em>z</em>, which is correlated strongly with <em>x</em>. The problem is that <em>z</em> happens to be the sum <em>x + y</em>. So we are correlating <em>x</em> with itself. The variable <em>y</em> adds statistical noise.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, I start to play with the data. After a bit of manipulation, I come up with a quantity that I call <em>z</em>. I save my work and forget about it. Months later, my colleague revisits my dataset and discovers that <em>z</em> strongly correlates with <em>x</em> (Figure <a href="#fig-auto">1</a>, right). We’ve discovered something interesting!</p>
<p>Actually, we’ve discovered autocorrelation. You see, unbeknownst to my colleague, I’ve defined the variable <em>z</em> to be the sum of <em>x + y</em>. As a result, when we correlate <em>z</em> with <em>x</em>, we are actually correlating <em>x</em> with itself. (The variable <em>y</em> comes along for the ride, providing statistical noise.) That’s how autocorrelation happens — forgetting that you’ve got the same variable on both sides of a correlation.</p>
<h3 id="the-dunning-kruger-effect">The Dunning-Kruger effect</h3>
<p>Now that you understand autocorrelation, let’s talk about the Dunning-Kruger effect. Much like the example in Figure <a href="#fig-auto">1</a>, the Dunning-Kruger effect amounts to autocorrelation. But instead of lurking within a relabeled variable, the Dunning-Kruger autocorrelation hides beneath a deceptive chart.<a target="_blank" href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Let’s have a look.</p>
<p>In 1999, Dunning and Kruger reported the results of a simple experiment. They got a bunch of people to complete a skills test. (Actually, Dunning and Kruger used several tests, but that’s irrelevant for my discussion.) Then they asked each person to assess their own ability. What Dunning and Kruger (thought they) found was that the people who did poorly on the skills test also tended to overestimate their ability. That’s the ‘Dunning-Kruger effect’.</p>
<p>Dunning and Kruger visualized their results as shown in Figure <a href="#fig-dk">2</a>. It’s a simple chart that draws the eye to the difference between two curves. On the horizontal axis, Dunning and Kruger have placed people into four groups (quartiles) according to their test scores. In the plot, the two lines show the results within each group. The grey line indicates people’s average results on the skills test. The black line indicates their average ‘perceived ability’. Clearly, people who scored poorly on the skills test are overconfident in their abilities. (Or so it appears.)</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/economicsfromthetopdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dunning_kruger_chart.png?w=723&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption><strong>Figure 2: The Dunning-Kruger chart.</strong> From <a target="_blank" href="https://www.avaresearch.com/files/UnskilledAndUnawareOfIt.pdf" rel="noopener">Dunning and Kruger (1999)</a>. This figure shows how Dunning and Kruger reported their original findings. Dunning and Kruger gave a skills test to individuals, and also asked each person to estimate their ability. Dunning and Kruger then placed people into four groups based on their ranked test scores. This figure contrasts the (average) percentile of the ‘actual test score’ within each group (grey line) with the (average) percentile of ‘perceived ability’. The Dunning-Kruger ‘effect’ is the difference between the two curves — the (apparent) fact that unskilled people overestimate their ability.</figcaption></figure>
<p>On its own, the Dunning-Kruger chart seems convincing. Add in the fact that Dunning and Kruger are excellent writers, and you have the recipe for a hit paper. On that note, I recommend that you read their article, because it reminds us that good rhetoric is not the same as good science.</p>
<h3 id="deconstructing-dunning-kruger">Deconstructing Dunning-Kruger</h3>
<p>Now that you’ve seen the Dunning-Kruger chart, let’s show how it hides autocorrelation. To make things clear, I’ll annotate the chart as we go.</p>
<p>We’ll start with the horizontal axis. In the Dunning-Kruger chart, the horizontal axis is ‘categorical’, meaning it shows ‘categories’ rather than numerical values. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with plotting categories. But in this case, the categories are actually numerical. Dunning and Kruger take people’s test scores and place them into 4 ranked groups. (Statisticians call these groups ‘quartiles’.)</p>
<p>What this ranking means is that the horizontal axis effectively plots test score. Let’s call this score <em>x</em>.</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/economicsfromthetopdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dk_label_4.png?w=723&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption><strong>Figure 3: Deconstructing the Dunning-Kruger chart.</strong> In the Dunning-Kruger chart, the horizontal axis ranks ‘actual test score’, which I’ll call <em>x</em>.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, let’s look at the vertical axis, which is marked ‘percentile’. What this means is that instead of plotting actual test scores, Dunning and Kruger plot the score’s ranking on a 100-point scale.<a target="_blank" href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Now let’s look at the curves. The line labeled ‘actual test score’ plots the average percentile of each quartile’s test score (a mouthful, I know). Things seems fine, until we realize that Dunning and Kruger are essentially plotting test score (<em>x</em>) against itself.<a target="_blank" href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener"><sup>4</sup></a> Noticing this fact, let’s relabel the grey line. It effectively plots <em>x</em> vs.&nbsp;<em>x</em>.</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/economicsfromthetopdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dk_label_3.png?w=723&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption><strong>Figure 3: Deconstructing the Dunning-Kruger chart.</strong> In the Dunning-Kruger chart, the line marked ‘actual test score’ is plotting test score (<em>x</em>) against itself. In my notation, that’s <em>x</em> vs.&nbsp;<em>x</em>.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Moving on, let’s look at the line labeled ‘perceived ability’. This line measures the average percentile for each group’s self assessment. Let’s call this self-assessment <em>y</em>. Recalling that we’ve labeled ‘actual test score’ as <em>x</em>, we see that the black line plots <em>y</em> vs.&nbsp;<em>x</em>.</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/economicsfromthetopdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dk_label_2.png?w=723&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption><strong>Figure 3: Deconstructing the Dunning-Kruger chart.</strong> In the Dunning-Kruger chart, the line marked ‘perceived ability’ is plotting ‘perceived ability’ <em>y</em> against actual test score <em>x</em>.</figcaption></figure>
<p>So far, nothing jumps out as obviously wrong. Yes, it’s a bit weird to plot <em>x</em> vs.&nbsp;<em>x</em>. But Dunning and Kruger are not claiming that this line alone is important. What’s important is the difference between the two lines (‘perceived ability’ vs.&nbsp;‘actual test score’). It’s in this difference that the autocorrelation appears.</p>
<p>In mathematical terms, a ‘difference’ means ‘subtract’. So by showing us two diverging lines, Dunning and Kruger are (implicitly) asking us to subtract one from the other: take ‘perceived ability’ and subtract ‘actual test score’. In my notation, that corresponds to <em>y – x</em>.</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/economicsfromthetopdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dk_label_1.png?w=723&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption><strong>Figure 3: Deconstructing the Dunning-Kruger chart.</strong> To interpret the Dunning-Kruger chart, we (implicitly) look at the difference between the two curves. That corresponds to taking ‘perceived ability’ and subtracting from it ‘actual test score’. In my notation, that difference is <em>y – x</em> (indicated by the double-headed arrow). When we judge this difference as a function of the horizontal axis, we are implicitly comparing <em>y – x</em> to <em>x</em>. Since <em>x</em> is on both sides of the comparison, the result will be an autocorrelation.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Subtracting <em>y – x</em> seems fine, until we realize that we’re supposed to interpret this difference as a function of the horizontal axis. But the horizontal axis plots test score <em>x</em>. So we are (implicitly) asked to compare <em>y – x</em> to <em>x</em>:</p>
<p><span data-katex-display="false"> \displaystyle  (y - x) \sim x </span>
</p>
<p>Do you see the problem? We’re comparing <em>x</em> with the negative version of <em>itself</em>. That is textbook autocorrelation. It means that we can throw random numbers into <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> — numbers which could not possibly contain the Dunning-Kruger effect — and yet out the other end, the effect will still emerge.</p>
<h3 id="replicating-dunning-kruger">Replicating Dunning-Kruger</h3>
<p>To be honest, I’m not particularly convinced by the analytic arguments above. It’s only by using real data that I can understand the problem with the Dunning-Kruger effect. So let’s have a look at some real numbers.</p>
<p>Suppose we are psychologists who get a big grant to replicate the Dunning-Kruger experiment. We recruit 1000 people, give them each a skills test, and ask them to report a self-assessment. When the results are in, we have a look at the data.</p>
<p>It doesn’t look good.</p>
<p>When we plot individuals’ test score against their self assessment, the data appear completely random. Figure <a href="#fig-xy">7</a> shows the pattern. It seems that people of all abilities are equally terrible at predicting their skill. There is no hint of a Dunning-Kruger effect.</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/economicsfromthetopdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/x_y_plot.png?w=723&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption><strong>Figure 7: A failed replication.</strong> This figure shows the results of a thought experiment in which we try to replicate the Dunning-Kruger effect. We get 1000 people to take a skills test and to estimate their own ability. Here, we plot the raw data. Each point represents an individual’s result, with ‘actual test score’ on the horizontal axis, and ‘self assessment’ on the vertical axis. There is no hint of a Dunning-Kruger effect.</figcaption></figure>
<p>After looking at our raw data, we’re worried that we did something wrong. Many other researchers have replicated the Dunning-Kruger effect. Did we make a mistake in our experiment?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we can’t collect more data. (We’ve run out of money.) But we can play with the analysis. A colleague suggests that instead of plotting the raw data, we calculate each person’s ‘self-assessment error’. This error is the difference between a person’s self assessment and their test score. Perhaps this assessment error relates to actual test score?</p>
<p>We run the numbers and, to our amazement, find an enormous effect. Figure <a href="#fig-xz">8</a> shows the results. It seems that unskilled people are massively overconfident, while skilled people are overly modest.</p>
<p>(Our lab techs points out that the correlation is surprisingly tight, almost as if the numbers were picked by hand. But we push this observation out of mind and forge ahead.)</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/economicsfromthetopdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/x_z_plot.png?w=723&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption><strong>Figure 8: Maybe the experiment <em>was</em> successful?</strong> Using the raw data from Figure <a href="#7">7</a>, this figure calculates the ‘self-assessment error’ — the difference between an individual’s self assessment and their actual test score. This assessment error (vertical axis) correlates strongly with actual test score (horizontal) axis.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Buoyed by our success in Figure <a href="#fig-xz">8</a>, we decide that the results may not be ‘bad’ after all. So we throw the data into the Dunning-Kruger chart to see what happens. We find that despite our misgivings about the data, the Dunning-Kruger effect was there all along. In fact, as Figure <a href="#fig-dk-sim">9</a> shows, our effect is even bigger than the original (from Figure <a href="#fig-dk">2</a>).</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/economicsfromthetopdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dk_plot.png?w=723&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption><strong>Figure 9: Recovering Dunning and Kruger.</strong> Despite the apparent lack of effect in our raw data (Figure <a href="#7">7</a>), when we plug this data into the Dunning-Kruger chart, we get a massive effect. People who are unskilled over-estimate their abilities. And people who are skilled are too modest.</figcaption></figure>
<h3 id="things-fall-apart">Things fall apart</h3>
<p>Pleased with our successful replication, we start to write up our results. Then things fall apart. Riddled with guilt, our data curator comes clean: he <em>lost</em> the data from our experiment and, in a fit of panic, replaced it with <em>random numbers</em>. Our results, he confides, are based on statistical noise.</p>
<p>Devastated, we return to our data to make sense of what went wrong. If we have been working with random numbers, how could we possibly have replicated the Dunning-Kruger effect? To figure out what happened, we drop the pretense that we’re working with psychological data. We relabel our charts in terms of abstract variables <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>. By doing so, we discover that our apparent ‘effect’ is actually autocorrelation.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig-xyz">10</a> breaks it down. Our dataset is comprised of statistical noise — two random variables, <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>, that are completely unrelated (Figure <a href="#fig-xyz">10</a>A). When we calculated the ‘self-assessment error’, we took the difference between <em>y</em> and <em>x</em>. Unsurprisingly, we find that this difference correlates with <em>x</em> (Figure <a href="#fig-xyz">10</a>B). But that’s because <em>x</em> is autocorrelating with itself. Finally, we break down the Dunning-Kruger chart and realize that it too is based on autocorrelation (Figure <a href="#fig-xyz">10</a>C). It asks us to interpret the difference between <em>y</em> and <em>x</em> as a function of <em>x</em>. It’s the autocorrelation from panel B, wrapped in a more deceptive veneer.</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/economicsfromthetopdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/xyz_combine.png?w=723&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption><strong>Figure 10: Dropping the psychological pretense.</strong> This figure repeats the analysis shown in Figures <a href="#7">7</a> – <a href="#9">9</a>, but drops the pretense that we’re dealing with human psychology. We’re working with random variables <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> that are drawn from a uniform distribution. Panel A shows that the variables are completely uncorrelated. Panel B shows that when we plot <em>y – x</em> against <em>x</em>, we get a strong correlation. But that’s because we have correlated <em>x</em> with itself. In panel C, we input these variables into the Dunning-Kruger chart. Again, the apparent effect amounts to autocorrelation — interpreting <em>y – x</em> as a function of <em>x</em>.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The point of this story is to illustrate that the Dunning-Kruger effect has nothing to do with human psychology. It is a statistical artifact — an example of autocorrelation hiding in plain sight.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is how long it took for researchers to realize the flaw in Dunning and Kruger’s analysis. Dunning and Kruger published their results in 1999. But it took until 2016 for the mistake to be fully understood. To my knowledge, Edward Nuhfer and colleagues were the first to exhaustively debunk the Dunning-Kruger effect. (See their joint papers in <a target="_blank" href="https://digitalcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1188&amp;context=numeracy" rel="noopener">2016</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://digitalcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1215&amp;context=numeracy" rel="noopener">2017</a>.) In 2020, Gilles Gignac and Marcin Zajenkowski published a similar <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/iq/2020-gignac.pdf" rel="noopener">critique</a>.</p>
<p>Once you read these critiques, it becomes painfully obvious that the Dunning-Kruger effect is a statistical artifact. But to date, very few people know this fact. Collectively, the three critique papers have about 90 times <em>fewer</em> citations than the original Dunning-Kruger article.<a target="_blank" href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener"><sup>5</sup></a> So it appears that most scientists still think that the Dunning-Kruger effect is a robust aspect of human psychology.<a target="_blank" href="#fn6" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="no-sign-of-dunning-kruger">No sign of Dunning Kruger</h3>
<p>The problem with the Dunning-Kruger chart is that it violates a fundamental principle in statistics. If you’re going to correlate two sets of data, they must be measured independently. In the Dunning-Kruger chart, this principle gets violated. The chart mixes test score into both axes, giving rise to autocorrelation.</p>
<p>Realizing this mistake, Edward Nuhfer and colleagues asked an interesting question: what happens to the Dunning-Kruger effect if it is measured in a way that is statistically valid? According to Nuhfer’s evidence, the answer is that the effect disappears.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig-nuhfer">11</a> shows their results. What’s important here is that people’s ‘skill’ is measured independently from their test performance and self assessment. To measure ‘skill’, Nuhfer groups individuals by their education level, shown on the horizontal axis. The vertical axis then plots the error in people’s self assessment. Each point represents an individual.</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/economicsfromthetopdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/nuhfer_2017.png?w=723&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption><strong>Figure 11: A statistically valid test of the Dunning-Kruger effect.</strong> This figure shows Nuhfer and colleagues’ 2017 test of the Dunning-Kruger effect. Similar to Figure <a href="#8">8</a>, this chart plots people’s skill against their error in self assessment. But unlike Figure <a href="#8">8</a>, here the variables are statistically independent. The horizontal axis measures skill using academic rank. The vertical axis measures self-assessment error as follows. Nuhfer takes a person’s score on the SLCI test (science literacy concept inventory test) and subtracts it from the person’s self assessment, called KSSLCI (knowledge survey of the SLCI test). Each black point indicates the self-assessment error of an individual. Green bubbles indicate means within each group, with the associated confidence interval. The fact that the green bubbles overlap the zero-effect line indicates that within each group, the averages are not statistically different from 0. In other words, there is no evidence for a Dunning-Kruger effect.</figcaption></figure>
<p>If the Dunning-Kruger effect were present, it would show up in Figure <a href="#fig-nuhfer">11</a> as a downward trend in the data (similar to the trend in Figure <a href="#fig-xy">7</a>). Such a trend would indicate that unskilled people overestimate their ability, and that this overestimate decreases with skill. Looking at Figure <a href="#fig-nuhfer">11</a>, there is no hint of a trend. Instead, the average assessment error (indicated by the green bubbles) hovers around zero. In other words, assessment bias is trivially small.</p>
<p>Although there is no hint of a Dunning-Kruger effect, Figure <a href="#fig-nuhfer">11</a> does show an interesting pattern. Moving from left to right, the <em>spread</em> in self-assessment error tends to decrease with more education. In other words, professors are generally better at assessing their ability than are freshmen. That makes sense. Notice, though, that this increasing accuracy is different than the Dunning-Kruger effect, which is about systemic <em>bias</em> in the average assessment. No such bias exists in Nuhfer’s data.</p>
<h3 id="unskilled-and-unaware-of-it">Unskilled and unaware of it</h3>
<p>Mistakes happen. So in that sense, we should not fault Dunning and Kruger for having erred. However, there is a delightful irony to the circumstances of their blunder. Here are two Ivy League professors<a target="_blank" href="#fn7" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener"><sup>7</sup></a> arguing that unskilled people have a ‘dual burden’: not only are unskilled people ‘incompetent’ … they are <em>unaware</em> of their own incompetence.</p>
<p>The irony is that the situation is actually reversed. In their seminal paper, Dunning and Kruger are the ones broadcasting their (statistical) incompetence by conflating autocorrelation for a psychological effect. In this light, the paper’s title may still be appropriate. It’s just that it was the <em>authors</em> (not the test subjects) who were ‘unskilled and unaware of it’.</p>

<p>Science fiction’s so-called New Wave era began in approximately 1964. Writing in 2003 about that “cusp” year, Michael Moorcock noted: “It will [soon] be 40 years since JG Ballard published <em>The Terminal Beach</em>, Brian Aldiss published <em>Greybeard</em>, William Burroughs published <em>Naked Lunch</em> in the UK, I took over <em>New Worlds</em> magazine and Philip K Dick published <em>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</em>.” The era lasted through approximately 1983 — giving way to the cyberpunk era, the kickoff of which we might as well date to the 1984 publication of William Gibson’s <em>Neuromancer</em>.</p>
<p>What is New Wave science fiction? Moorcock describes it as the era during which the genre “rediscovered its visionary roots and began creating new conventions which rejected both modernism and American pulp traditions.” Right! The best sf adventures published during the Sixties (1964–1973) and Seventies (1974–1983) — my 75 favorites are listed on this page, but this is by no means an exhaustive list — are characterized by an ambitious, self-consciously artistic sensibility; they often concern themselves, at the level of content and form, with the nature of perception itself; and they will blow your mind.</p>
<p>This page is a work in progress, subject to revision.</p>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2011/10/05/philip-k-dick/">Philip K. Dick</a>’s <em>Martian Time-Slip</em> (1964)</strong>. One of my top favorite PKD novels, <em>Martian Time-Slip</em> is set in an arid Martian colony where Establishment-approved information is crammed into youthful heads by teaching machines. Forget the plot, which involves time travel… or a vision/hallucination of time travel, anyway. Dick presents the book’s action through flash-forwards and from the perspectives of the three main characters. At the level of form, we’re confronted with the question: What is reality? Ten-year-old Manfred Steiner, is labeled autistic because he doesn’t properly respond to the machines; in fact, he has precognition abilities. Jack Bohlen, a repairman, is hired to develop a device for communicating with Manfred; Bohlen, too, is disturbed by the teaching machines —&nbsp;because his schizophrenia reveals to him the machine-like quality of normal, well-adjusted people; and because he, like Manfred, perceives the passage of time in an unconventional way. A third character, union leader Arnie Kott, wants to use Manfred’s abilities to get the edge on a business deal. Meanwhile, the oppressed native Martians recognize the malleability of time — and therefore understand the value of Manfred’s gifts. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> The novel was first published under the title <em>All We Marsmen</em>, serialized in the August, October and December 1963 issues of <em>Worlds of Tomorrow</em> magazine.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2010/02/05/hilo-hero-william-burroughs/">William Burroughs</a>’s <em>Nova Express</em> (1964)</strong>. Beginning in 1961, William Burroughs and Brion Gysin experimented with a “dreamachine” producing complex patterns of color behind one’s eyelids. As the user entered something like a hypnagogic state, the patterns would “read” as intensely meaningful — even if that meaning was inarticulable. The effect of Burroughs’s Nova Trilogy (1961’s <em>The Soft Machine</em>, 1962’s <em>The Ticket That Exploded</em>, and <em>Nova Express</em>) on readers is dreamachine-like; you don’t read it so much as soak in it. Even if you could un-do the “fold-in” technique that Burroughs employed, you wouldn’t discover a coherent plot: Instead, there are characters (Sammy The Butcher, The Brown Artist, Izzy The Push, and other members of the viral Nova Mob; Inspector Lee of the Nova Police), comedy bits, drug-induced hallucinations, and language experiments. All wired together by an overarching paranoia regarding the cultural, social, biological, and neurological mechanisms via which the many are conditioned and controlled by the few. The Nova Mob are “control addicts”; can Inspector Lee —&nbsp;who sees conspiracies everywhere — dismantle their diabolical word-and-imagery machine, aka culture itself? <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Together with <em>The Soft Machine</em> (1961) and <em>The Ticket That Exploded</em> (1962), this novel is part of The Nova Trilogy. Luc Sante sums up the message of the trilogy like so: “You are the host of a virus; the virus is life; you are fucked.”</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2009/08/28/hilo-hero-jack-kirby/">Jack Kirby</a>’s pre-Fourth World sci-fi comics (1964–1970).</strong> Kirby’s proto-psychedelic photo collages were first seen in ’64; so we’ll date his pioneering contributions to New Wave science fiction to that year. Of course, Kirby was also a pioneering Golden Age science fiction artist —&nbsp;in the early ’40s he drew The Blue Beetle and Captain America; and he drew <em>Challengers of the Unknown</em> for DC, before co-ushering in (with Stan Lee) Marvel Comics’ Silver Age with, e.g., <em>The Fantastic Four</em> (1961), <em>The Incredible Hulk</em> (1962), <em><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2009/02/24/we-are-iron-man-a-hilobrow-literary-mystery/">Iron Man</a></em> (1963), and <em>The X-Men</em> (1963). Beginning in 1964, Kirby introduced an ambitious, self-consciously artistic sensibility to his Marvel Comics work; he began to blow readers’ minds through his formal experimentation. Kirby’s proto-psychedelic energy fields, known to fans as the “<a href="http://www.twomorrows.com/kirby/articles/33krackle.html">Kirby Krackle</a>,” which were first seen in ’66, are a signifier of his boundless, cosmic imagination. Kirby would end up writing, in addition to drawing, some terrific Marvel titles before leaving in 1970 for DC —&nbsp;who would publish his era-defining, multiple-series <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2018/01/28/new-wave-sci-fi-75-18/">Fourth World</a> epic. A prolific New Wave sci-fi genius!</li>

<li><strong>Brian Aldiss’s <em>Greybeard</em> (1964).</strong> At age 56, Algy Timberlane —&nbsp;our titular greybeard, is one of the world’s youngest men. At the beginning of this story, he and his wife, Martha, are living in an isolated community, in fairly primitive conditions, somewhere in southern England; a violent incident sends them fleeing along the Thames towards London — which they never reach. Along the way, Algy and Martha and their companions pass through the ruins of twentieth-century civilization, encounter various cults and communes populated by elderly survivors, and struggle —&nbsp;intellectually, emotionally — to comprehend the end of humanity. Via flashbacks, we discover that a nuclear-testing accident, a half century earlier, in 1981, has sterilized most higher mammals on the planet. Stoats have become a menace! Aldiss, who coined the term “cosy catastrophe” to describe post-apocalyptic novels in which the survivors are contented with their lot, because there are abundant resources for the taking, and the mechanized, organized, deodorized modern world has given way to a rural, human-scale one, has his characters debate whether or not they should mourn their fate. Algy broods over his bitter memories of civilization’s rapid decline, after the Accident — martial law, famine and disease, anarchy — but ultimately hopes that humankind will not die off. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> Michael Moorcock has described <em>Greybeard</em> as one of the first British New Wave sci-fi novels. When P.D. James’s novel <em>The Children of Men</em> was published in 1992, many sci-fi fans noted that the points of similarity between the novels are astonishing.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2012/11/15/j-g-ballard/">J.G. Ballard</a>‘s <em>The Burning World</em> (1964).</strong> A difficult book to read, in many respects — with the saving grace that it is <em>not</em> a Golden Age sci-fi “cozy catastrophe,” i.e., in which the apocalypse proves to be a kind of wish fulfillment for an alienated male protagonist. As the story begins, a British suburb begins to grapple with the fact that an unending drought — brought on by human pollution — will result in rivers running dry, crops failing, and humankind succumbing to famine and disease. Some years later, a small band of survivors from that suburb traverses vast salt plains in search of potable water. As in Beckett’s <em><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2016/10/30/golden-age-sci-fi-75-57/">Endgame</a></em>, our post-apocalyptic protagonist, the resigned and taciturn Dr. Ransom, and his companions — including a deranged architect who takes to wearing jeweled robes; and a crippled man who walks on stilts — discover that everything they’ve ever believed is meaningless. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> An expanded version, retitled <em>The Drought</em>, was published in 1965. Ballard’s other early catastrophe novels include <em>The Wind from Nowhere</em> (1961), <em>The Drowned World</em> (1962), and The <em>Crystal World</em> (1966).</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2009/10/08/hilo-hero-frank-herbert/">Frank Herbert</a>’s <em>Dune</em> (1965).</strong> In the far future, interstellar travel is made possible thanks to the spice melange — the psychoactive properties of which allow pilots to safely route faster-than-light travel. Melange is also responsible for the witchy powers of the Bene Gesserit, an ancient sisterhood that has carried out a breeding program designed to produce the Kwisatz Haderach (a messiah-like figure). <em>Dune</em>, the first in a series of six best-selling novels, recounts how young Paul Atreides arrives on Arrakis, the only planet where spice is mined, only to see his father — the new governor of the planet — killed and his family’s (awesome) retainers scattered. With the help of his Bene Gesserit mother, not to mention the Fremen, the planet’s giant-worm-riding natives, Paul seeks revenge against the evil Baron Harkonnen… while discovering the truth about the Kwisatz Haderach. <em>Dune</em> is: a potboiler about a family’s declining empire, a fantasy about the founding of a new social order, a band-of-brothers yarn, and a criticism of humankind’s despoliation of nature. Wow! <strong>Fun fact:</strong> One of science fiction’s all-time best-selling titles; parts of it were first serialized in <em>Analog</em>. <em>Dune</em> was adapted into David Lynch’s cult 1984 movie of the same title. It won the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2011/10/05/philip-k-dick/">Philip K. Dick</a>’s <em>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</em> (1965).</strong> The Earth is badly over-heated, and the UN — the global governing body — is conscripting settlers to colonize unpleasant nearby planets. Mars’s settlers have become addicted to Can-D, a drug that allows them to escape into a collective Barbie-and-Ken-esque hallucination, the contours of which are shaped by figures and “layouts” they purchase…&nbsp;from Perky Pat, a corporate empire run by the ruthless Leo Bulero (who also secretly manufactures Can-D). Bulero’s hired telepaths discover that merchant adventurer Palmer Eldritch has returned from a crash on Pluto with Chew-Z, a superior drug, one which can put Perky Pat out of business. However, when Bulero attempts to assassinate Eldritch, he is plunged into a nightmarish odyssey of nested hallucations… which causes him to question the very nature of reality itself. What’s up with Eldritch’s three “stigmata” — and where did he get Chew-Z? Plus: double agents, time travel, devolution, alien possession, and Gnostic musings about the notion of an evil demiurge! <strong>Fun fact:</strong> A freaky classic of psychedelic literature. Considered one of Dick’s most important books.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2014/04/01/samuel-r-delany/">Samuel R. Delany</a>’s <em>Babel-17</em> (1966).</strong> This short, psychedelic, linguistics-inspired space opera describes a distant future in which humanity has spread itself —&nbsp;for better and worse — throughout the galaxy. An alien culture called The Invaders is up to something that could prove potentially catastrophic to the (human) Alliance… but what? Starship captain, codebreaker and telepath Rydra Wong discovers that a software code used by the Invaders’ hackers is actually a language… one which alters perception and thought, enhancing your abilities but turning you into a traitor! Wong is assisted by a kick-ass crew of genetically modified adventurers —&nbsp;including some who are essentially ghosts in the machine. <em>Babel-17</em> is an adventure yarn —&nbsp;including everything from hand-to-hand combat to full-scale spaceship battles — but at the same time it’s a philosophical novel challenging the reader to imagine what kind of culture might speak a language lacking a pronoun for “I.” <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Babel-17 was joint winner of the Nebula Award in 1966 — along with <em>Flowers for Algernon</em>.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2011/10/05/philip-k-dick/">Philip K. Dick</a>’s <em>The Unteleported Man</em> (1966).</strong> War between the US and the Soviet Union has led to UN rule of the planet, renamed Terra. Theodoric Ferry, a capitalist mogul, is teleporting millions to Whale’s Mouth, the universe’s only other inhabitable planet, a Garden of Eden where Terrans can start over. Freya Holm, an agent with the private police agency Listening Instructional Educational Services (LIES), Inc., speculates that Ferry may be an alien… and that Whale’s Mouth may not be all that it seems. (See: Edgar Rice Burroughs’s <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2015/09/13/radium-age-100-30/"><em>The Gods of Mars</em></a>.) Rachmael Ben Applebaum, owner of an outer-space freighter company that has been disintermediated by teleportation technology, decides to travel to Whale’s Mouth the old-fashioned way… i.e., he will be the only unteleported man. The UN, meanwhile, attempts to defeat Ferry via a mind-control device of their own: a pulp sci-fi novel! <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Originally published as a novella, in 1964, by <em>Fantastic</em>. I’ve written more about this novel in my essay <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2011/07/13/the-black-iron-prison/">“The Black Iron Prison”</a> (<em>n+1</em>, July 2004).</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2012/11/15/j-g-ballard/">J.G. Ballard</a>’s <em>The Crystal World</em> (1966).</strong> Some readers find this novel too “action-adventurey” for their liking, others find it too surgical and psychological; I think it strikes a provocative balance between these tendencies. In an African colony, Sanders, a British doctor, discovers that entrance to the forest is being discouraged. Seeking his friends, who run a leper colony (to which he is strangely attracted), he travels upriver — echoes of <em>Heart of Darkness</em> are intentional — and discovers that trees, grass, water, animals and men are slowly being encased in glittering crystals. The universe, its myriad of possibilities, is crystallizing into sameness! Which, in a way, is just a literalization of a process already underway — the separation of alienated individuals from one another, industrial capitalism forcing everything and everyone to become the same. If leprosy is about entropy and decay, this crystallization is a kind of antidote…&nbsp;right? Ballard’s descriptions are eerily beautiful. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Serialized in the first Moorcock-edited issue of <em>New Worlds</em>. This is Ballard’s third psychedelic-apocalyptic work, the first two being <em>The Drowned World</em> (1962) and <em>The Burning World</em> (1964).</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2011/10/05/philip-k-dick/">Philip K. Dick</a>’s <em>Now Wait for Last Year</em> (1966).</strong> In the near future, Terra —&nbsp;a unified Earth, the elected dictator of which is UN Secretary General Gino “the Mole” Molinari — has become entangled in a war between an insect race (the reegs) and a humanoid race (the ’Starmen, from the planet Lilistar). Terra is on the wrong side of the war; their allies, the fascistic ’Starmen, may be out to exploit Terra’s natural resources. Dr. Eric Sweetscent, an organ-transplant surgeon asked to secretly tend to Molanari, who has developed a psychosomatic ailment in which he suffers along with anyone near who him who is in any kind of pain, gets involved in Terra-Lilistar politics. His wife Kathy, meanwhile, becomes addicted to JJ-180, a new hallucinogen (which may have been invented by the reegs as a chemical weapon) that causes her to move forwards, backwards, and sideways through time…&nbsp;and she is forced to spy on Sweetscent —&nbsp;by the ’Starmen. Sweetscent and Molinari time-travel, as well… leading them to wonder how valuable the intel they’re picking up from alternative past and present histories is for their current situation. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Dick was very fond of his Molinari character, whom he described as a blend of Christ, Lincoln, and… Mussolini, for whom he harbored a certain (non-fascist) sympathy.</li>

Rocannon sets out to find the enemy’s secret base on the planet —&nbsp;so he can infiltrate it, and use their “ansible” to communicate with galactic authorities. As he journeys across the planet, he encounters various Tolkien-esque species, including the dwarfish Gdemiar, the elven Fiia, and the nightmarish Winged Ones; his advanced technology makes him a Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court-type wizard. As he travels, and engages in various battles, Rocannon becomes a figure of legend. However, when he reaches the enemy base he must revert to a sophisticated interstellar op. Fans of Iain M. Banks: the Culture begins here. A fun foray into <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2016/11/05/golden-age-sci-fi-75-59/"><em>Three Hearts and Three Lions</em></a>-esque science-fantasy, for Le Guin. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> This is the debut installment in Le Guin’s Hainish Cycle. Other authors, including Orson Scott Card, Vernor Vinge, and Kim Stanley Robinson, would borrow the “ansible” tech from this book.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2014/04/01/samuel-r-delany/">Samuel R. Delany</a>’s <em>The Einstein Intersection</em> (1967).</strong> Love it or hate it (Delany’s eighth novel has zealous fans and detractors), <em>The Einstein Intersection</em> is fascinating. Forty thousand years in the future, Lobey, a village herder and musician, goes on an Orpheus-like quest into the underworld —&nbsp;in search of his slain lover, Friza. As it turns out, this is a puppet-show of sorts: Lobey is a member of a (three-gendered) alien race who’ve taken on (two-gendered) human forms, and inherited human cultural myths as well. Of the latter, the aliens have made a hodge-podge: the stories of Orpheus, the Minotaur, Billy the Kid, Jean Harlow, Ringo Starr, Jesus Christ — these and other traditions of all dead generations weigh like a nightmare on the brains of the living. This conceit alone might have made for a terrific mythopoetic sci-fi novel; however, Delaney introduces myriad other issues: genetics, radiation, identity and difference, rural and urban ways of life, perception and reality, life and death, dragons…&nbsp;too much, perhaps, for a relatively short novel. Delany’s prose style, too, confounds: sometimes improvisational and snappy, sometimes ham-fisted pulp fiction. <em>The Einstein Intersection</em> is pretentious — but in the best possible way. Don’t give up on it! Once you encounter Kid Death, you’ll be hooked. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Winner of the 1967 Nebula Award for Best Science Fiction Book.</li>

<li><strong>Roger Zelazny’s <em>Lord of Light</em> (1967).</strong> On a planet colonized long ago by the South Asian crew and passengers of the spaceship <em>Star of India</em> (hailing from “vanished Urath”), some of the humans artificially evolve themselves into immortal, godlike beings —&nbsp;who conquer the planet’s indigenous races (characterized as “demons”) and force the descendants of the un-evolved crew and colonists into a Hindu-like caste system. All of this occurs over a vast span of time; the book is epic in scope — in fact, two of the chapters were first published as stand-alone novellas in the <em>Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction</em>. Eventually, the crew members assume the powers and names of Hindu deities; their main concern is preventing enlightenment, and scientific or technological advancement among their human subjects. However, one of the crewman rejects godhood, and —&nbsp;again, over time — introduces Buddhism to the masses as a liberatory wake-up call. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Winner of the 1968 Hugo Award for Best Novel. Gordon Dahlquist <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2013/07/03/lord-of-light/">describes</a> Lord of Light as “dedicated to dragging all wizards out from behind their curtains.”</li>

<li><strong>Harlan Ellison’s (ed.) <em>Dangerous Visions</em> (1967).</strong> This is not a novel, but a collection of original science fiction stories by 30+ contributors. I include it on this list because it was influential on the genre’s New Wave movement; however, by the time I read it, in the mid-1980s, what was most shocking about these stories was the sexism and racism. Still, Philip K. Dick’s “Faith of Our Fathers” is a fascinating mashup about Chinese communism, psychedelics, and the truth of religion; Robert Silverberg’s graphic “Flies,” in which aliens experiment on a spaceman in order to learn about what makes humanity tick — and get it wrong, is a fun thriller; Samuel R. Delany’s “Aye, and Gomorrah…” conjures up a new sexual perversion involving a neutered astronaut; and Ellison’s own “The Prowler in the City at the Edge of the World” is something of a tour de force — about Jack the Ripper’s disappointment when he escapes to the 31st century. Fritz Leiber’s “Gonna Roll the Bones” is a chilling, funny fable…&nbsp;but Leiber wasn’t a New Wave writer, nor were some of the collection’s other contributors (Pohl, Anderson). I should also mention John T. Sladek’s “The Happy Breed,” which presciently describes our emotional dependence on apps. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> “Gonna Roll the Bones” won both a Hugo Award and a Nebula Award for Best Novelette; and “Aye, and Gomorrah…” won the Nebula for Best Short Story. Ellison published a sequel, <em>Again, Dangerous Visions</em>, in 1972; a third, as yet unpublished sequel, is now infamous.</li>

<li><strong>Anna Kavan’s <em>Ice</em> (1967).</strong> Brian Aldiss writes, of Kafka’s oeuvre: “the baffling atmosphere, the paranoid complexities, the alien motives of others, make the novels a sort of haute sf.” Anna Kavan’s cult classic, <em>Ice</em>, closes the gap in that equation. As a new Ice Age dawns (sparked by a nuclear holocaust?), western civilization finds itself hemmed in by advancing ice-scapes. War and revolution break out everywhere. Against this apocalyptic backdrop, an unnamed narrator — a globe-trotting, Indiana Jones-esque anthropologist-explorer-soldier, as far as we can make out —&nbsp;pursues an unnamed woman with whom he has long been obsessed. He intends to rescue her, first from her brutal husband, then from a Ruritanian-ish despot who is on his way to becoming one of the world’s new tyrants; however, the “girl” doesn’t want to be rescued —&nbsp;and seems terrified of the narrator. Plot possibilities unfurl, only to furl back up again; is the narrator insane? A hallucinatory, image-rich adventure that doesn’t omit guns and car chases. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> “The book’s nearest cousins,” writes Jonathan Lethem in his introduction to the Penguin Classics reissue of <em>Ice</em>, “are <em>Crash</em>, Ballard’s most narratively discontinuous and imagistic book, or cinematic contemporaries like Alain Resnais’s <em>Last Year at Marienbad</em>.”</li>

<li><strong>Chester Anderson’s <em>The Butterfly Kid</em> (1967).</strong> In this metafictional cult classic, set in the near future, not long after the Bicentennial, when video phones and personal hovercraft are common, a ragtag group of Greenwich Village hippies discover that their acid trips are beginning to come true. In fact, everyone in New York is hallucinating, and all of their hallucinations are made manifest —&nbsp;it’s chaos! Chester Anderson, who shares the author’s name, and Michael Kurland, who shares the name of another hippie sci-fi author, discover that New York’s water supply has been laced with a drug —&nbsp;brought to Earth by giant blue lobster-esque aliens — designed to make Earthlings easy to conquer. Can these drug-addled pacifists thwart the alien invasion? <strong>Fun fact:</strong> The blog io9.com listed <em>The Butterfly Kid</em> as No. 1 on the list of “weirdest science fiction novels that you’ve never read.” Its sequels are <em>The Unicorn Girl</em>, by Michael Kurland, and <em>The Probability Pad</em>, by T.A. Waters. Anderson later moved to San Francisco, invested his royalties from this novel in a mimeograph machine, and founded The Diggers’ publishing outfit, Communications Company.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2014/04/01/samuel-r-delany/">Samuel R. Delany</a>’s <em>Nova</em> (1968).</strong> In the year 3172, interstellar human society is divided into three constellations — each of which was originally colonized by different Earth socio-economic classes. Draco, which includes Earth and other wealthy planets, is an aristocratic constellation ruled by the (caucasian) Red family, whose Red-Shift Limited is the sole manufacturer of faster-than-light drives; the Pleiades Federation, a middle-class constellation, is the home of operations for the rival (mixed-race) Von Rays. The Outer Colonies, settled by working-class Earthlings, are the source of the important energy source illyrion, a superheavy element essential to starship travel and terraforming planets. Our protagonist is Lorq Von Ray, a playboy who — years earlier — was attacked and scarred by Prince Red. Now a nihilistic, revenge-obsessed adventurer, Lorq puts together an Argonauts-inflected squad of hippie-ish misfits — the Mouse, Lynceos, Idas, Tyÿ, Sebastian, Katin — and takes them on a demented voyage to the heart of an imploding star… in order to capture an enormous amount of illyrion, and in so doing destroy Draco’s control of the Outer Colonies. Though the plot is only intermittently thrilling (in a space-opera way), the language is gorgeous, the meta-textual references (to <em>Moby Dick</em>, Arthurian mythos, and more) are pretty fun, and there’s a whole Tarot-really-works conceit that’s almost persuasive. If Delany weren’t an experimentalist, this could have been a <em>Dune</em>; I’m glad it isn’t. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> There’s a cyberpunk tech aspect to the book that I can’t get into, here; William Gibson’s <em>Neuromancer</em> alludes to <em>Nova</em>. After this book, Delany didn’t publish again until <em>Dhalgren</em> appeared in 1975.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2009/09/24/hilo-hero-john-brunner/">John Brunner</a>’s <em>Stand on Zanzibar </em> (1968).</strong> Borrowing the kaleidoscopic narrative technique of John Dos Passos’ <em>U.S.A.</em>, Brunner paints a comprehensive portrait of the over-populated America of 2010. There is a central story line, with recurring characters (including Shalmaneser, a super-computer). For example, Norman Niblock House, an African-American VP of General Technics, is negotiating for his company to assume management of an African country; his roommate is a spy. Meanwhile, a Southeast Asian country has achieved a breakthrough in genetic engineering. We briefly meet many other characters, via fragmented, information-rich chapters devoted solely to world-building. Political slogans, advertising, song lyrics, journalism, and slang (recorded in a glossary titled <em>The Hipcrime Vocab</em>, by sociologist Chad C. Mulligan), help us experience the social, economic, and cultural consequences of unchecked population growth. Social programming, interactive TV, genetically modified microorganisms… many of Brunner’s predictions are disturbingly prescient. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Winner of the 1969 Hugo Award for Best Novel. In 1968, the prolific Brunner also published <em>Bedlam Planet</em>, <em>Catch a Falling Star</em>, <em>Father of Lies</em>, and <em>Into the Slave Nebula</em>, as well as a story collection.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2011/10/05/philip-k-dick/">Philip K. Dick</a>’s <em>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</em> (1968).</strong> In a post-apocalyptic San Francisco, bounty hunter Rick Deckard is charged with “retiring” six escaped androids —&nbsp;one of whom, named Pris, moved into a derelict apartment building inhabited only by John Isidore, an intellectually challenged man who attempts to befriend her. Although there are plenty of thrills and chills here (for example, Deckard is seduced by an android whose mission it is to make it impossible for him to kill Pris), this is as much a philosophical novel about empathy as it as an adventure. The androids have no emotions — the only way that Deckard can tell them apart from humans is by giving them empathy tests. The androids, meanwhile, are on a mission to disprove a popular pseudo-religion called “Mercerism,” in which grasping the handles of an electronic Empathy Box allows you to “encompass every other living thing.” (“Mercerism is a swindle,” the androids insist. “The whole experience of empathy is a swindle.”) Deckard must prove them wrong…&nbsp;though he begins to wonder whether he, too, is an android. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> The theatrical-release version of <em>Blade Runner</em>, Ridley Scott’s souped-up adaptation of Dick’s novel, doesn’t lead viewers to question Deckard’s humanity (<a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2012/01/06/shocking-blocking-28/">or does it</a>). And the 2017 sequel, <em>Blade Runner 2049</em>, further muddies the waters.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2010/01/30/hilo-hero-richard-brautigan/">Richard Brautigan</a>’s <em>In Watermelon Sugar</em> (1968).</strong> Our unnamed narrator, a writer, lives outside an unnamed town, on the fringes of a commune called iDEATH. The commune features a trout hatchery (which produces oil used to light their lamps) and a watermelon works (which produces multicolored sugars used to fashion every sort of commodity), not to mention huge statues of vegetables, and shacks to which those who want to spend time alone can retreat. The setting is idyllic, but also somehow post-apocalyptic. The sun shines a different color each day; reference is made to talking, singing, yet violent “tigers” who used to inhabit the area; and there is a vast junkyard — the Forgotten Works — of objects manufactured before… whatever happened. There isn’t much of a plot: a drunkard named inBOIL leads a short-lived rebellion against iDEATH (Is he right about everything?, this reader wonders); the narrator falls in love with Pauline, the commune’s cook, which may or may not cause his former lover, Margaret, to go off the rails. The mood is elegiac, light-hearted, sad, and critical all at the same time. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> <em>In Watermelon Sugar</em> is an important reference in Ray Mungo’s 1970 back-to-the-land chronicle <em>Total Loss Farm</em>; it’s also the inspiration for Neko Case’s 2006 song “Margaret versus Pauline.”</li>

<li><strong>Thomas M. Disch’s <em>Camp Concentration</em> (1968).</strong> In an authoritarian near-future America, President Robert McNamara —&nbsp;Secretary of Defense, at the time Disch was writing — has embroiled the country in an illegal war…&nbsp;against the world. We are reading the diary of an imprisoned conscientious objector, the poet Louis Sacchetti, who has been sent to Camp Archimedes, the inmates of which are dosed (unwittingly) with a strain of syphilis as part of a military experiment. (With Ignatius J. Reilly, Sacchetti is one of the great obese fictional characters.) The treatment increases the patients’ intelligence, while shortening their lives. Does God exist? Does alchemy work? Do we humans create Hell for ourselves? If genius is a matter of breaking down the mind’s rigid categories, then are all geniuses insane? Sacchetti,&nbsp;an erudite wordsmith and deep thinker, has much to say on these and other topics…&nbsp;particularly as his own mind’s rigid categories begin to break down. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Serialized in <em>New Worlds</em> in 1967. In 1972, Philip K. Dick wrote a paranoid letter to the FBI suggesting that there were coded messages in <em>Camp Concentration</em>.</li>

<li><strong>Anne McCaffrey’s <em>The Ship Who Sang</em> (1969).</strong> Before Iain M. Banks’s (or Becky Chambers’ or Ann Leckie’s) independent AI starships there was <em>The Ship Who Sang</em>. Our protagonist is Helva, who was born with an exceptional brain and severe physical disabilities… so she was raised as an indentured servant destined to be a starship brain. One with a lamentable tendency to fall in love with her human co-pilot (known as the “brawn” to her “brain”) as they travel the galaxy on various missions of mercy. What happens if the brawn loves her back…&nbsp;and wants to have sex with her? Helva’s feelings of love and loss are poignant; however, the whole set-up is also a bit creepy and offensive! If you think about the sex scenes in McCaffrey’s Dragonriders of Pern series, you’ll begin to see why. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> The book’s first five chapters were originally published as “The Ship Who Sang” (1961; McCaffrey’s own favorite story), “The Ship Who Mourned” (1966), “The Ship Who Killed” (1966), “Dramatic Mission” (1969), and “The Ship Who Disappeared” (1969); the sixth chapter is original to the novel. In the 1990s, McCaffrey and co-authors produced six sequels.</li>

<li><strong>Vladimir Nabokov’s <em>Ada, or Ardor</em> (1969).</strong> When he is fourteen, Van Veen, who will grow up to be a psychologist and renegade scholar, falls in love with his eleven-year-old cousin, Ada; they begin a life-long sexual affair, despite later discovering that they are half-siblings. The story begins in the early 19th century, though characters discuss airplanes, motion pictures, and other anachronistic technologies; everything is powered by water, and it is forbidden to mention electricity. Reference is made to an historical catastrophe referred to as “the L disaster,” which has somehow “everted” (I borrow the term from a 1975 essay about this novel in <em>Science Fiction Studies</em>) time, earth, and sexual gender. Van and Ada — who are maybe somehow, respectively, Eve and Adam — live on a planet known as Antiterra, which is geographically similar to Earth, although politically England has conquered most of it, and American culture is influenced by Russia. Nineteen-Sixties culture is, somehow, a myth from the past. Trippy! <strong>Fun facts:</strong> Ted Gioia has compared <em>Ada</em> to Philip K. Dick’s <em>The Man in the High Castle</em> and other alternate-history works of science fiction. I might include works by Samuel R. Delany and Michael Moorcock in which the Beatles become mythical figures.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2011/10/05/philip-k-dick/">Philip K. Dick</a>’s <em>Ubik</em> (1969).</strong> Joe Chip works for Runciter Associates, which employs “inertials” —&nbsp;telepaths and precogs with the ability to block the powers of other, less scrupulous telepaths and precogs — to protect the privacy of their clients. He’s one of Dick’s “minor men,” unable to manage his own life; in fact, he owes money to his own front door! Joe has a thing for his new colleague, Pat, who can change the past in such a way that people don’t realize it. Sent to Luna in search of criminal telepaths, Joe and Pat and the rest of their team is caught in an explosion… after which nothing is ever the same again. Are they moving backwards in time? Are they in some other reality? Are they caught up in a cosmic battle between the forces of light and the forces of darkness — and if so, what is the ultimate source of these forces? Every interpretation that they posit is frustrated; meaning remains elusive. Each chapter is prefaced with an advertisement for Ubik, salvation in a spray can. This is, perhaps, the ultimate example of one of Dick’s apophenic sci-fi potboilers. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> <em>Ubik</em> inspired France’s <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2010/09/08/alfred-jarry/">Alfred Jarry</a>-inspired Collège du Pataphysique to elect Dick as an honorary member. John Lennon, at one point, was interested in adapting the film version.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2013/11/11/kurt-vonnegut/">Kurt Vonnegut</a>’s <em>Slaughterhouse-Five, or The Children’s Crusade: A Duty-Dance with Death</em> (1969).</strong> Much like the bumbling protagonist of Jaroslav Hašek’s pioneering antiwar novel <em>The Good Soldier Švejk</em> (1921–1923), Billy Pilgrim is an ill-trained, disoriented, cowardly chaplain’s assistant. During the Battle of the Bulge in 1944, he is captured and transported to Dresden. In 1945, as British and American bombers dropped several thousand tons of high-explosive bombs and incendiary devices on the city, Pilgrim and his fellow prisoners and their guards take refuge in a cellar beneath Schlachthof-fünf, the titular “slaughterhouse five”; they are among the only survivors of the (still-controversial) attack. We experience all of this in flash-backs or flash-forwards, because Billy has become “unstuck in time,” not to mention in space. At one point, years later, on his daughter’s wedding night, Billy is captured by aliens and transported to Tralfamadore, the fatalistic residents of which can observe all points in the space-time continuum simultaneously. Like them, Billy becomes a philosophical ironist because — thanks to his time-traveling — the entire human experience strikes him as absurd. Is he crazy, or a visionary? <strong>Fun facts:</strong> As a prisoner of war in 1945, Vonnegut experienced the Dresden firebombing; the narrator of <em>Slaughterhouse-Five</em> is the author, speaking in his own voice. The 1972 film adaptation, directed by George Roy Hill (in between directing <em>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</em> and <em>The Sting</em>), won the <em>Prix du Jury</em> at the 1972 Cannes Film Festival.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2009/10/21/hilo-hero-ursula-k-le-guin/">Ursula K. Le Guin</a>’s <em>The Left Hand of Darkness</em> (1969).</strong> This is the second of the author’s so-called Hainish Cycle, set in a galaxy whose human population evolved on Hain, then spread outwards to many other planets (including Earth) before, at some distant point in the past, losing contact. Efforts have been mounted to re-establish a galactic civilization; some eighty planets have organized themselves into a union called the Ekumen. In this novel, Genly Ai, an agent of The Ekumen, has spent a frustrating couple of years as an envoy to the frozen planet Gethen. Ai’s efforts to recruit Gethen into the Ekumen have failed… because his supposedly enlightened worldview is structured by binary oppositions. Gethenians, because they are ambisexual —&nbsp;they only adopt sexual attributes once a month, during a period of sexual receptiveness and high fertility —&nbsp;see the world in an entirely different way. Ai only begins to empathize with the Gethenian worldview once he escapes from prison with Estraven, an exiled Gethenian politician, who not only helps Ai survive a trek across the planet’s wintry wilderness, but helps him understand his own deep-seated prejudices and assumptions about gender and gender roles. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> <em>The Left Hand of Darkness</em> is one of the first feminist sci-fi novels, though some feminists have argued that it does not go far enough in critiquing gender stereotypes. Harold Bloom said, of this book, which won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards: “Le Guin, more than Tolkien, has raised fantasy into high literature, for our time.”</li>

<li><strong>Jane Gaskell’s <em>A Sweet, Sweet Summer</em> (1969).</strong> Enormous alien spacecrafts are hovering over London, Birmingham, and Manchester, sealing Britain off from the outside world; one of the aliens’ first demonstrations of power was the public execution of Ringo Starr. It’s a weird scene: “People rush under [the alien craft] when the rain starts so municipal authorities have erected seats and slot-machine arcades under them and charge you for using them.” The country descends into anarchy, as communist and fascist militias battle in the streets, and hoodlums terrorize the defenseless. Our narrator, Rat, is an unpleasant, misogynistic character who runs a tiny London boarding house and brothel. The alien invasion is the best thing that ever happened to him, so when his charismatic, gender-ambiguous, proto-punk cousin, Frijja, shows up and attempts to free London from alien oppression, Rat does what he can to thwart her —&nbsp;while also strugling to defend his turf from a marauding gang… with whose thuggish leader he is disturbingly fascinated. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> An exceedingly difficult book to find! China Miéville says that <em>A Sweet, Sweet Summer</em> “perfectly combines psychological perspicacity and social critique in an unusual dystopian future London.” Gaskell also wrote a seminal YA vampire novel: 1964’s freaky <em>The Shiny Narrow Grin</em>.</li>

<li><strong>Brian Aldiss’s <em>Barefoot in the Head</em> (1969).</strong> A far-out, experimentalist novel — many readers find it too much so —&nbsp;set in a future Europe devastated by Acid Warfare. Muslims, it seems, have released “psycho-chemical aerosols” into the environment, and now tens of thousands of Europeans (except the neutral French) are tripping constantly, veering between extreme joy and abject terror…&nbsp;and talking in gorgeous, <em>Finnegans Wake</em>-esque word salads (see also: Disch’s <em>Camp Concentration</em>). Social norms have collapsed. Colin Charteris, a young Serbian who has been working in UN refugee camps in Italy, travels to England… where he falls under the influence of the hallucinogenics and finds himself hailed as a prophet by the pharmaceuticalized populace. Preaching a trippy Gurdjieffian gospel, Charteris could usher in a utopian social order… or perhaps his movement will help European civilization utterly devolve. Peppered with poems and song lyrics from the characters, it’s reminiscent of the excellent 1968 youthsploitation movie <em>Wild in the Streets</em>, as well as Richard Fariña’s <em>Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me</em> (1966), though more world-historical than these. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> The novel was assembled from Aldiss’s stories in <em>New Worlds</em> and elsewhere. One of the inside jokes, here, is running meta-commentary on the works of Aldiss’s fellow sci-fi writers.</li>

<li><strong>Josephine Saxton’s <em>The Hieros Gamos of Sam and An Smith</em> (1969).</strong> In this experimentalist, poetic work, a 14-year-old boy rescues a baby girl when her mother dies in childbirth. He raises her in a world devoid of other humans. What has happened? Buildings remain, food dispensers dispense food, store shelves are replete with supplies… but Sam and An are, more or less, this Eden-like post-apocalyptic space’s only inhabitants. (The few individuals who make an appearance inhabit the outskirts of town, and they are phantom-like figures —&nbsp;are they hallucinations? Are Sam and An being studied by them? Who is leaving them messages — and what do the messages mean?) This is, in some respects, a <em>Bildungsroman</em>; we watch Sam mature, as he cares for his charge, and we’re interested to discover what books — Nietzsche, Jung, Blake, science fiction — he reads. As An grows older, sexuality introduces itself to this strange idyll. Anachronistically, it could be described as <em>The Truman Show</em> and <em>Lost</em> mashed up with <em>Blue Lagoon</em>. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> The first novel by Saxton, who is also remembered for <em>Vector for Seven: The Weltanschaung of Mrs Amelia Mortimer and Friends</em> (1970), <em>Group Feast</em> (1971), and the super-unsettling <em>Queen of the States</em> (1986).</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2011/10/05/philip-k-dick/">Philip K. Dick</a>’s <em>A Maze of Death</em> (1970). </strong> “My books (&amp; stories) are intellectual (conceptual) mazes,” Dick would later reflect in his <em>Exegesis</em>, “&amp; I am in an intellectual maze in trying to figure out our situation (who we are &amp; how we look into the world, &amp; world as illusion, etc.) because the situation is a maze.” This proto-gnostic apophenic thriller, written in 1968 and inspired in part by the author’s only LSD trip, is perhaps Dick’s maze-iest. One by one, fourteen human colonists, none of whom understands their collective mission, are transferred to the planet Delmak-O — which is populated by gelatinous cubes who offer advice in the form of I Ching-like anagrams. A naturalist, a linguist, a geologist, a theologian, a physician, a pyschologist, and so forth: They are each eccentric and disgruntled, particularly once they begin to die off. What is the factory-like building towards which they are drawn? Are they trapped in a maze — being observed and experimented upon? Or are they perhaps dead —&nbsp;or in some kind of limbo state? <em>Lost</em> fans, read this one. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Except for <em>Ubik</em>, this is the book Dick most frequently references in his <em>Exegesis</em>.</li>

<li><strong>John Sladek’s <em>The Müller-Fokker Effect</em> (1970).</strong> In the near future Bob Shairp, writer and dreamer and government worker, agrees to be a guinea-pig in a military experiment — to determine whether a human being can be reconstituted like orange juice. However, as his persona is being uploaded to computer tapes in the form of data, his body is accidentally destroyed. Shairp’s persona-data then becomes a computer virus, which leads to a series of absurd, paranoia-inducing scenarios. Sladek’s novel satirizes right-wing military, evangelical, militantly anticommunist forces in late-Sixties America —&nbsp;where Ronald Reagan, of all people, is president! —&nbsp;who seek to control the tapes. The book, which doesn’t have much of a plot, abounds with racists, conspiracy theorists, and eccentric millionaires, so yeah…&nbsp;it all too accurately predicts today’s America. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> The book’s title is an obscene pun. When asked, in 1982, whether he’d considered what trouble he caused young people asking librarians for the book, Sladek replied, tongue-in-cheek: “Young persons have no business reading such a book, which contains sex, violence and anagrams.”</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2012/11/15/j-g-ballard/">J.G. Ballard</a>’s <em>The Atrocity Exhibition</em> (written 1967, published 1970).</strong> Less a novel than a collection of linked stories or novellas, <em>The Atrocity Exhibition</em> confronts us with surreal fantasies, absurdities, and grotesqueries —&nbsp;“Plans for the Assassination of Jacqueline Kennedy,” “Love and Napalm: Export USA,” “Why I Want to Fuck Ronald Reagan” — recounted by an unstable narrator, a mental-hospital psychiatrist whose name keeps changing (Talbert, Traven, Travis, Talbot, etc.). Like the French philosopher and theorist Jean Baudrillard, who started publishing in the late Sixties, and who can himself be considered a New Wave sci-fi author <em>manqué</em>, in <em>The Atrocity Exhibition</em> we find Ballard writing proleptically. That is to say, the book represents future social and cultural developments — for instance, the death of affect (because of prolonged exposure to sex and violence via pop culture and advertising); the triumph of kitsch culture; the banalization of celebrity; disaster porn; endless movies about the Vietnam War — as if they’ve happening now (in the late Sixties). The protagonist’s ultimate goal? To start a World War III… of the mind! <strong>Fun fact:</strong> The pieces collected here had appeared elsewhere, in various forms, previously. William Burroughs, a writer whom Ballard admired and emulated, wrote the book’s introduction. The first US edition was published in 1972 by Grove Press, after an earlier edition was cancelled because the publisher feared lawsuits. The book inspired the Joy Division song of the same name from their 1980 album <em>Closer</em>.</li>

A tall tale in which the space explorer Ijon Tichy, whose previous exploits Lem chronicled in <em>The Star Diaries</em> (1957), attends a shambolic World Futurological Congress held at an absurdly luxurious hotel in San Jose, Costa Rica. As riots break out in the streets, the government introduces psychoactive drugs into the drinking water; Tichy escapes to the sewers beneath the hotel, only to be evacuated several times — each of which turns out to be a hallucination — and then shot, and placed by doctors into a cryogenic coma. He wakes up in a transformed world; Lem is affectionately parodying H.G. Wells’s 1899 technocratic utopian novel <em>When the Sleeper Wakes</em>, here. Tichy is introduced to this brave new world — in which most people take a drug that instills a strong work-ethic, not to mention drugs that mask the true nature of reality; and the inhabitants of which speak a language he can’t understand —&nbsp;in stages. Has the world become an overpopulated hellscape threatened by a new Ice Age? Or is this, too, all one of Tichy’s hallucinations? <strong>Fun facts:</strong> First published along with a collection of short stories (shown above). Ari Folman’s 2013 live-action/animated movie <em>The Congress</em>, starring Robin Wright, was a pretty great adaptation.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2009/10/21/hilo-hero-ursula-k-le-guin/">Ursula K. LeGuin</a>’s <em>The Lathe of Heaven</em> (1971).</strong> Operating under the influence of Philip K. Dick, LeGuin wrote an uncanny, thought-provoking novella about George Orr, a Portland, Oregon man who has begun self-medicating in an attempt to prevent himself from dreaming. Why? Because some of his dreams have been altering reality —&nbsp;and George is the only one who notices. (For everyone else, things have always been the way they are now.) Visiting the well-meaning psychologist and sleep researcher Dr. Huber, George is persuaded to embark on a program of “effective dreaming” aimed at improving the state of the world. Unforeseen consequences ensue. (This will not surprise fans of LeGuin’s fantasy and science fiction, which stresses the ambiguity of every utopian ideal, and the dark forces at work within even the noblest soul.) For example, in an effort to dream about peace on Earth, Orr conjures up a fleet of invading alien spacecraft… which does unite humankind, but at what cost? Also —&nbsp;does the “real world” exist at all, or did Orr dream it up after a 1998 nuclear war? <strong>Fun fact:</strong> First serialized in <em>Amazing Science Fiction Stories</em>, March 1971 and May 1971. The book has sci-fi elements — it’s set in 2002, Dr. Huber employs a device called the Augmentor —&nbsp;but it’s fantastical. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Anl0nKLABWo&amp;list=PL1DBDD99BCEB5455A">1980 PBS production</a> of <em>The Lathe of Heaven</em> was well-regarded; LeGuin was closely involved.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2010/05/28/walker-percy/">Walker Percy</a>’s <em>Love in the Ruins</em> (1971).</strong> The protagonist of this proto-postmodernist philosophical novel, Dr. Tom More, a hard-drinking psychiatrist in the affluent town of Paradise, Louisiana, has diagnosed his fellow Americans with the malady of “angelism/bestialism” —&nbsp;an extremist tendency towards either spirit-like abstraction or animal appetite, brought on by contemporary America’s sociocultural placidity and flacidity. In the near future of the 1990s, politics have become fragmented to the point of neo-tribalism, mainline churches have become secularized to the point of banality or else overly dogmatic, and liberals and conservatives alike are prone to shocking acts of (what they imagine to be justified) violence. In an effort to restore a sense of moderation, More invents the Ontological Lapsometer, a handheld device that can not only diagnose precisely how spiritually screwed-up you are…&nbsp;but also, with the twist of a dial, treat you for it. Meanwhile, African Americans stage an armed uprising, and college-educated young whites gather in swamp communes. When chaos engulfs Paradise, More retreats to an abandoned motel… with three beautiful women. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> “Beware Episcopal women who take up with Ayn Rand and the Buddha. A certain type of Episcopal girl has a weakness that comes on them just past youth…. They fall prey to Gnostic pride, commence buying antiques, and develop a yearning for esoteric doctrine.”</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2009/08/28/hilo-hero-jack-kirby/">Jack Kirby</a>‘s Fourth World comics (1971–1974).</strong> When Jack Kirby left Marvel Comics for DC in 1970, he launched a science-fictional epic revolving around aliens with superhuman abilities arriving on Earth. Hailing from the planets Apokolips and New Genesis, the ontogeny of the so-called New Gods —&nbsp;their fantastic powers, even their names —&nbsp;recapitulated Kirby’s imaginative billion-year phylogeny, during which three previous eras (“worlds”) had seen the rise and fall of the Old Gods, legends of whom live on in humankind’s mythologies. So sweeping was Kirby’s <em>weltanschauung</em> that it couldn’t be contained in the <em>New Gods</em> comic (#1–11 written and illustrated by Kirby, 1971–72). So he also wrote and illustrated <em>Forever People</em> (#1–11, 1971–72) and <em>Mister Miracle</em> (#1–18, 1971–74), not to mention a reimagined <em>Superman’s Pal Jimmy Olsen</em>. These proto-postmodernist comics are a volatile admixture of religion (the character Izaya evokes the biblical Isaiah), ancient-astronaut theories, sci-fi technology (the Boom Tube, the Mobius Chair, the Mother Box), and 1960s culture (the Forever People are cosmic hippies). Kirby’s 1940s-era teen characters, the Newsboy Legion, were resurrected; and Don Rickles made a cameo appearance. Truly awesome. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> The Fourth World storyline was intended to be a finite series, which would end with the deaths of the characters Darkseid and Orion.</li>

<li><strong>M. John Harrison’s <em>The Pastel City</em> (1971).</strong> In the distant future, a medieval-style way of life has risen from the ashes of civilization. There is a barbarian Queen of the North; and, ruling over Viriconium, the ever-changing Pastel City, a beautiful Queen of the South. Scavengers scour the ruins for power blades, energy cannons, and airboats. When news comes that the North plans to deploy scavenged alien automata against the South, a brooding poet-warrior, Lord tergeus-Cormis, travels with a mercenary, Birkin Grif, in search of a mad dwarf who is expert in ancient weaponry. The adventurers encounter mechanical birds, brain eaters, and a wizard of sorts; and they discover that a complex, lethal technology from the past lives on. This is an affectionate, but also sardonic reimagining of the fantasy genre — nothing is resolved, things get murkier instead of more clear, heroes are unheroic. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Harrison’s Viriconium series —&nbsp;it includes <em>A Storm of Wings</em> (1980), <em>In Viriconium</em> (also known as <em>The Floating Gods</em>, 1982), and the story collection <em>Viriconium Nights</em> (1985) —&nbsp;has been aptly described as “fantasy without the magic and science fiction without the ‘future’.”</li>

<li><strong>Arkady and Boris Strugatsky’s <em>Пикник на обочине</em> (1972; <em>Piknik na obochine</em>; translated as <em>A Roadside Picnic</em>).</strong> Near the (fictitious) Canadian town of Harmont, a five-square-kilometer “Zone” has been off-limits ever since unexplained phenomena occurred there some years earlier. After the incidents, universally assumed to have been an alien visitation, bizarre artifacts have been discovered. The novel’s title comes from an analogy proposed, by one of the characters, that the extraterrestrials may have just been on a “picnic,” and left trash behind. The United Nations has attempted to keep the Zone sealed off, but Red Schuhart and other “stalkers” sneak in to steal whatever they can find, for profit…&nbsp;despite the risk that they may pass mutated genetic material on to their children. Red smuggles “hell slime” out of the Zone, and sells it to arms dealers, because he needs money to care for his daughter, “Monkey,” a devolved humanoid. Once he gets out of prison, Red discovers that the bodies of those buried within the Zone — including his father’s — have become reanimated! So he embarks on one last mission, a quixotic effort to make everything come out right. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> <em>Roadside Picnic</em> was refused publication in book form in the Soviet Union for eight years due to government censorship. The 1979 Soviet sci-fi art film <em>Сталкер</em> (<em>Stalker</em>), directed by Andrei Tarkovsky, is loosely based on the novella; the screenplay was written by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky.</li>

<li><strong>Gene Wolfe’s <em>The Fifth Head of Cerberus</em> (1972).</strong> Three subtly interlinked stories set on Ste. Anne and Ste. Croix — twin Earth-colony planets circling one another. The first tale is a memoir narrated unreliably by “Number 5,” the son of an insane genius, who recounts how he and his brother were raised in a brothel by a robot teacher, and how he was eventually forced to reckon with his own identity — and challenge his father. The second story, written by a visiting anthropologist from Earth studying the planets’ supposedly extinct race of shapeshifters, is narrated in the style of an aboriginal folktale about estranged brothers; the protagonist embarks on a quest, traveling between real world and dreamworld… though the reader can’t always tell them apart. The third story also concerns the anthropologist, who runs afoul of local authorities and is imprisoned for years —&nbsp;we learn the bizarre details through snippets from his increasingly unhinged (or truthful) journals — and from interrogation tapes being revised by a bored police agent. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> The first story, “The Fifth Head of Cerberus,” was included in the 1973 anthology <em>Nebula Award Stories Eight</em>. Though not his first novel, Wolfe considered it his first good one.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2009/09/24/hilo-hero-john-brunner/">John Brunner</a>’s <em>The Sheep Look Up</em> (1972).</strong> Brunner wrote a lot of forgettable pot-boilers, and a couple of terrific books —&nbsp;this proto-cyberpunk eco-catastrophe is one of the latter. Raw materials are running out, and insects and micro-organisms have become resistant to efforts to eradicate them. Disaster could be averted if world governments and the wealthy were willing to make sacrifices; instead, the rich live obliviously in gated communities while the right-wing US administration, headed by an idiot president, is in thrall to corporations seeking only to maximize shareholder value. The media, meanwhile, focuses on entertainment and delivers fake news. Environmental and social-justice activists are dismissed as un-American hippies. (Yes, it’s almost too prescient.) We learn all of this through fractured vignettes about multiple characters, headlines, reports. As both government and corporate services break down, and as food is poisoned, rioting and civil unrest sweep the United States. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> The novel’s title is a quotation from Milton’s “Lycidas.” “The hungry sheep look up, and are not fed,/But swollen with wind and the rank mist they draw,/Rot inwardly, and foul contagion spread…”</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2009/12/18/hilo-hero-michael-moorcock/">Michael Moorcock</a>’s <em>The English Assassin</em> (1972).</strong> The third of Moorcock’s four novels featuring dandy, scientist, rock star, and adventurer (Buckaroo Banzai, eat your heart out) Jerry Cornelius is subtitled <em>A Romance of Entropy</em>. This is true in two senses: Cornelius is an agent of the cosmic force that opposes culture, civilisation, empire, religion, and other manifestations of order; and the book itself is entropic —&nbsp;a pastiche of stories working at cross-purposes. Cause and effect are out of whack, here; ambiguity is the whole point. Unlike running, jumping, shooting action heroes, Jerry Cornelius is an idler; at the beginning of <em>The English Assassin</em>, he is fished out of the ocean —&nbsp;dead (eat your heart out, Jason Bourne) — and he can barely be bothered to get out of bed, despite such goings-on as a nuclear attack on India and a Scottish war of independence fought with zeppelins… each apocalyptic scenario set on a different version of the Earth. He does stop a peace conference — violently — though. We spend a lot of time with Cornelius’s coterie, including the titular assassin (IMHO) Una Persson. The book’s message, if any, is delivered by Catherine: “Goodbye, England.” <strong>Fun fact:</strong> The Cornelius Quartet includes <em>The Final Programme</em> (1968), <em>A Cure for Cancer</em> (1971), and <em>The Condition of Muzak</em> (1977). There are other Cornelius stories, too.</li>

<li><strong>Robert Silverberg’s <em>Dying Inside</em> (1972).</strong> This brilliantly written sci-fi yarn/<em>bildungsroman</em> set in (then-)present-day New York concerns David Selig, a middle-aged telepath who has squandered his abilities. He’s spent his life prying into other people’s hearts and minds, probing their secrets for his own pleasure; and also for (minor) profit: he reads the minds of college students so that he can ghost-write reports on their behalf. Now, Selig’s power is beginning to fade. Silverberg imaginatively depicts what the lived experience of telepathy might be like, for better or worse; in the tradition of <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2010/04/12/radium-age-telepaths/">Radium Age sci-fi telepath stories</a>, it’s mostly worse. Selig has failed to develop meaningful relationships, or to carve a purposeful place for himself in society. The novel’s plot is beside the point; and Selig is a loser — not only neurotic and directionless, but prejudiced. Stick around for wild scenarios, including a telepath’s vicarious experience of: his girlfriend’s acid trip, a young couple having sex, a hen laying an egg… and a very spiritual farmer. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> Silverberg is perhaps most famous today for his science-fantasy Majipoor series, beginning with <em>Lord Valentine’s Castle</em> (1980). But I’m more a fan of his New Wave sci-fi, including <em>Thorns</em> (1967), <em>To Open the Sky</em> (1967), <em>The Masks of Time</em> (1968), <em>To Live Again</em> (1969), <em>Downward to the Earth</em> (1970), and <em>The World Inside</em> (1971).</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2011/07/24/barry-n-malzberg/">Barry N. Malzberg</a>’s <em>Beyond Apollo</em> (1972).</strong> A two-man mission to Venus fails, and its captain is killed; NASA inters Harry M. Evans, the surviving astronaut, in an insane asylum — and interrogates him. <em>What went wrong?</em> We’ll never know: Evans’s story shifts constantly. He killed the Captain; the Captain tried to kill him; Venusians killed the Captain; there are no Venusians; he <em>is</em> the Captain, disguised as Evans. (Was there a Captain, in the first place)? Humankind, the reader begins to infer, isn’t mentally equipped to cope with the claustrophobia and dislocation of space exploration. Evans, or “Evans,” who confesses to wanting to write a novel, has become a story-generating machine, recounting memories (or fabricated memories), dream conversations, possible explanations and endings, sexual fantasies (or realities), and cryptograms. Is Evans’s approach to truth/reality — playful, evasive, inconclusive, a thousand flashes of illumination rather than a reliable source of light — a step forward in human evolution? Or is he just insane? Don’t read this book for the plot; read it for the exercise. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> <em>Beyond Apollo</em> won the inaugural John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel. Detractors claimed that this was an insult to the memory of Campbell, the Golden Age sci-fi author and editor whose name was synonymous with the wonder of space exploration.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2012/01/08/david-bowie/">David Bowie</a>‘s <em>The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars</em> (1972).</strong> Bowie’s fifth studio effort wasn’t originally intended to be a concept album, but over the course of its recording the idea of “Ziggy Stardust” — an androgynous rock star who may or may not be an extraterrestrial — metastasized from a single song into first a publicity stunt and then, ultimately, an enduring mythos. The album’s tremendous first track, “Five Years,” announces the imminent destruction of Earth; “Moonage Daydream” introduces a “space invader” who preaches a cosmo-religious message of sex, love, and rock’n’roll; and the “Over the Rainbow”-ish “Starman” describes a teenager’s discovery — via late-night radio — that a starman waiting in the sky approves of youthful rebellion and pleasure-seeking. On side two, we meet Ziggy Stardust himself: Is this kabuki cat truly “the Naz” (Lenny Bruce’s hipster slang for Jesus), or merely a <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2016/04/22/planet-of-peril-3/">Vince Taylor</a>-esque teen idol who (in his band’s estimation, anyway) has developed delusions of grandeur? The album’s bricolage mythography encourages us to actively participate in parsing the Ziggy myth for ourselves. Philip K. Dick, whose 1981 novel <em>VALIS</em> features a Ziggy-inspired character, took Bowie up on the challenge; so did the inspired prankster who’s recently pointed out that Kanye West, whose name seems to float above Bowie’s head on the cover of <em>Ziggy Stardust</em>, was born five years after the release of “Five Years.” Yes! <strong>Fun facts:</strong> The album features contributions from the Spiders from Mars, Bowie’s backing band: Mick Ronson, Trevor Bolder, and Mick Woodmansey. A “Ziggy Stardust” concert film, directed by D. A. Pennebaker, was recorded in 1973; it’s well worth viewing.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2012/11/15/j-g-ballard/">J.G. Ballard</a>’s <em>Crash</em> (1973).</strong> If Ballard’s early novels —&nbsp;1964’s <em><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2017/10/01/new-wave-sci-fi-75-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Burning World</a></em>, for example — were sardonic inversions of survivalist cozy catastrophes, then <em>Crash</em> might be read as a sardonic inversion of another Adventure genre: the picaresque. In fact, the episodic, shambolic plot of <em>Crash</em>, in which the protagonist falls under the influence of a charismatic, wildly unconventional kook, and immerses himself in an automobile-centric world of transgressive kicks, feels to this reader like a pessimistic, avant-garde response to the all-American optimism of Kerouac’s <em>On the Road</em>. (Ballard himself described <em>Crash</em> as a “warning against that brutal, erotic, and overlit realm that beckons more and more persuasively to us from the margins of the technological landscape.”) In this anti-optimistic morality play, “James Ballard” is maimed in a car crash, which leaves the other driver dead; he is subsequently drawn into the orbit of Dr. Vaughan, a car-wreck enthusiast who heads up a kind of sex cult of fellow fetishists. Vaughan, Ballard, and others —&nbsp;Seagrave, a crossdressing stuntman; Gabrielle, a lesbian opium-addict and amputee; Helen, the widow of Ballard’s victim —&nbsp;engage in Sadean sex rites in crashed and about-to-be-crashed cars. If Ballard’s earlier novels are cataclysms set in the future; <em>Crash</em> takes place in a cataclysmic present, i.e., one in which catastrophe has become normalized. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> The Normal’s 1978 song <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2016/08/14/quirk-your-enthusiasm-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Warm Leatherette”</a> was inspired by <em>Crash</em>; Gary Numan’s 1979 song “Cars” may have been, as well. In 1996, <em>Crash</em> was adapted as a film of the same name by David Cronenberg; it stars James Spader, Deborah Kara Unger, Elias Koteas, Holly Hunter, and Rosanna Arquette.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2014/05/08/thomas-pynchon/">Thomas Pynchon</a>’s <em>Gravity’s Rainbow</em> (1973).</strong> Set during the waning days of WWII, Pynchon’s infamous masterpiece —&nbsp;considered by some to be one of the greatest American novels; considered by others to be unreadable —&nbsp;is an apophenic espionage adventure revolving around the quest to uncover the secret of a mysterious device, or MacGuffin, which is to be installed in a German V-2 rocket. (The book’s title refers to the parabolic trajectory of a V-2, as well as to the introduction of randomness into physics via quantum mechanics.) <em>Gravity’s Rainbow</em> is also a picaresque adventure, featuring over 400 characters, which follows Tyrone Slothrop, a naive Allied Intelligence operative, as he wanders — under covert surveillance, by his own comrades, who are interested in his sexual activities — around London, then a casino on the recently liberated French Riviera, and then in “The Zone,” which is to say, Europe’s post-war wasteland. What does Margherita Erdmann, former star of a traveling sado-masochistic sex show, know about the device? Why do the Schwarzkommando, African rocket technicians brought to Europe by German colonials, worship the V-2? Why is Slothrop being tailed by Major Duane Marvy, a sadistic American, and Vaslav Tchitcherine, a drug-addled Soviet intelligence officer? Slothrop discovers that he may have been experimented on, as an infant; does this have something to do with German occult warfare shenanigans? Plus: silly songs, 1940s pop culture references, kazoos. Here’s the key: “If there is something comforting —&nbsp;religious, if you want — about paranoia,” we read, “there is still also anti-paranoia, where nothing is connected to anything, a condition not many of us can bear for long.” <strong>Fun facts:</strong> Winner of the National Book Award for 1974, and nominated for both a Pulitzer Prize and a Nebula Award.</li>

<center><span size="5">NEW WAVE SF: 1974–1983</span></center>
<p>If adventure novels in the Sixties troubled their readers’ faith in fixed, universal categories, and in certainty, Seventies adventure replaced these relics with difference, process, anomaly. The science fiction of the era — Ursula K. LeGuin’s <em>The Dispossessed</em>, Samuel R. Delany’s <em>Trouble on Triton</em>, Philip K. Dick’s <em>A Scanner Darkly</em>, Christopher Priest’s <em>Inverted World</em>, Olivia E. Butler’s <em>Wild Seed</em> —&nbsp;was as far-out as it gets, the final flourish of New Wave before the advent of cyberpunk. All binary oppositions (past/present, liberal/conservative, innocent/guilty, utopian/anti-utopian) are overthrown. Ambivalence, indeterminacy, and undecidability of things: In Seventies adventures, these are the anti-anti-utopian new normal.</p>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2011/10/05/philip-k-dick/">Philip K. Dick</a>’s <em>Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said</em> (1974).</strong> A typically dystopian, disorienting, and dashed-off Philip K. Dick joint — but one which is more emotionally resonant than his Fifties and Sixties oeuvre; in this sense, <em>Flow My Tears</em> points the way forward to Dick’s late masterpieces, <em>A Scanner Darkly</em> (1977) and <em>VALIS</em> (1981). The year is 1988; in the aftermath of a Civil War, the USA has become a police state; African-Americans have been all but exterminated; college students have become underground guerrillas; people use their smartphones to seek hook-ups (via the Phone-Grid Transex Network) and advice (via Cheerful Charlie, an app); and recreational drug use has been normalized. When a crazed ex-lover sics a “gelatinlike Callisto cuddle sponge” on Jason Taverner, the famous pop star (“Nowhere Nuthin’ Fuck-up” is his latest hit) and TV host wakes up in a motel to discover that… no one knows who he is. Taverner takes drugs, seeks assistance from a series of women —&nbsp;an unstable old flame; a leather-clad lesbian; a sweet-tempered potter — and desperately attempts to figure out what might have caused him to become a non-person. The titular policeman? He’s the twin brother and lover of the leather-clad lesbian, and a powerful authority figure who learns an important lesson in humility and empathy for others. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Winner of the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 1975. Dick would later paordy this novel, in <em>VALIS</em>, as <em>The Android Cried Me a River</em>.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2009/10/21/hilo-hero-ursula-k-le-guin/">Ursula K. Le Guin</a>’s <em>The Dispossessed</em> (1974).</strong> Shevek, a brilliant young physicist, lives on the peaceful anarchistic planet Anarres, whose inhabitants value voluntary cooperation, local control, and mutual tolerance. This is a richly imagined world — with a language, for example, that cannot readily express “propertarian” or “egoist” concepts. The downside of this utopia is an entrenched bureaucracy that stifles innovation, particularly if it seems to challenge the prevailing political and social ethos. Shevek’s new temporal theory, and the resulting “Ansible” that he hopes to develop (which will allow instantaneous communication between any two points, no matter how many light-years apart; and which will therefore make possible a galactic network of civilizations), may never see the light of day. So he relocates to Urras, a nearby world (Annares is its moon) where disruptive new theories and technologies are welcomed. Once there, however, Shevek is dismayed and disgusted by Urras’s two largest states: the USA-like A-Io, which is capitalist, sexist, wasteful, exploitative, and tumultuous —&nbsp;forever on the verge of revolution or war; and the authoritarian, USSR-like Thu. While the author is clearly sympathetic to the ideals of Annares, <em>The Dispossessed</em> is a pointed critique of typical utopian narratives; the dichotomies that Le Guin describes are not readily surmounted — it’s a negative-dialectical romance. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Although this was the fifth novel published in Le Guin’s Hainish Cycle, chronologically it is the first. <em>The Dispossessed</em> won the Nebula and Hugo Awards for Best Novel. Later editions of the book are subtitled “An Ambiguous Utopia.”</li>

<li><strong>Christopher Priest’s <em>Inverted World</em> (1974).</strong> Having reached the mature age of “650 miles,” Helward Mann becomes an apprentice Future Surveyor — which means that he must help choose the best route for his city, “Earth,” which appears to be an Earth colony on an alien world. The city is winched along, at about eight miles per day, along tracks that are then picked up and re-used; the city’s goal is a perhaps nonexistent “optimum” destination somewhere to the north. Many of the city’s citizens (including Helward’s wife, Victoria) are unaware that the city is mobile; a decrease in the birthrate obliges the city to capture native women from the villages they pass en route. When Helward leaves the city, he discovers how truly strange the outside world is; time itself works differently, within the city vs. outside, and to the north vs. the south. Also, he finds himself pulled southward by a mysterious, ever-increasing force. Eventually, he meets a woman who claims to have come from England recently; in fact, she claims that they’re on Earth! What is actually going on? <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Expanded from a short story by the same title included in <em>New Writings in SF 22</em> (1973). <em>The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction</em> calls <em>Inverted World</em> “one of the two or three most impressive pure-sf novels produced in the United Kingdom since World War II.”</li>

<li><strong>John Crowley’s <em>The Deep</em> (1975).</strong> A checkerboard-like medieval kingdom is housed on a circular plane balanced atop a pillar that emerges from The Deep, an abyss inhabited by an entity known as The Leviathan. Although Crowley’s first novel is not a particularly long one, its scope is truly epic. Through the eyes of a strange visitor from off-world, a genderless android who immediately loses its memory, we witness a complex War of the Roses-esque struggle between “Red” and “Black” factions, not to mention musket-wielding rebels (The Just) and a fractured nobility (The Protectors); there are many characters, each of whom will interact with every other character before all is said and done. The Visitor is a kind of recording angel; was it sent here by Leviathan (God)? If not, what is its purpose? What’s outside this world? Is this all some kind of puppet show or game? One is reminded not only of George R.R. Martin’s Westeros series, but of the recent <em>Westworld</em> remake. Crowley’s writing is lyrical, and there are thrills and chills galore: swords and sorcery, a rooftop escape, a journey through a marsh, a climb towards the edge of the world! <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Crowley is best known for his amazing 1981 novel <em>Little, Big</em>, which has been called “a neglected masterpiece” by Harold Bloom, and other works of fantasy. His earliest novels, however, including <em>Beasts</em> (1976) and <em>Engine Summer</em> (1979), were science fictions.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2009/07/11/hilo-hero-cordwainer-smith/">Cordwainer Smith</a>‘s <em>Norstrilia</em> (1975, in complete form).</strong> In the far future, as we know from Smith’s other stories (collected in the volume <em>The Rediscovery of Man</em>), once all of humankind’s needs have been met — thanks to advanced technology, peace and prosperity, and the use of animal-derived “underpeople” for the few remaining physical jobs — a galaxy-wide administrative body known as the Instrumentality will intervene, in order to make life worth living again. How? By reintroducing cultural and language differences, for example, or even by encouraging the underpeople to revolt. Rod McBan the 151st, a young farmer on the planet Norstrilia — which had long ago been colonized by Australians, and which alone produces the immortality drug <em>stroon</em> — comes to the attention of the Instrumentality because of his unusually powerful, yet difficult-to-control psionic abilities. They help save him from a Norstrilian rite of passage that could otherwise have proven fatal, and when Rod uses an ancient, illegal computer to corner the galactic market for <em>stroon</em>, they help smuggle him back to Earth, humankind’s homeworld, before he can be assassinated or kidnapped. Rod is disguised as an underperson —&nbsp;a cat-man — and C’mell, Earth’s most beautiful cat-woman, becomes his protector. Sympathizing with the underpeople, Rod sacrifices his fortune for them. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> <em>Norstrilia</em> is the only novel published by Paul Linebarger, a scholar and diplomat expert in psychological warfare, as “Cordwainer Smith.” Its two parts were published, separately, in <em>Galaxy</em> in 1964; both were then published as novellas. They weren’t combined into one volume until 1975.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2014/04/01/samuel-r-delany/">Samuel R. Delany</a>’s <em>Dhalgren</em> (1975)</strong>. <em>Dhalgren</em> is set in Bellona, somewhere in the American Midwest (Kansas?) — where a very local, very strange catastrophe has happened. A city block burns down, but a week later it’s intact again; time passes differently for different people; there seem to be two moons in the night sky. Although most of Bellona’s inhabitants have abandoned the bewildering, surreal city, various marginalized Americans — including the Kid, a multiracial, bisexual, possibly schizophrenic drifter — find themselves drawn to it. Some readers (including Philip K. Dick, who threw it away) have found <em>Dhalgren</em>‘s meandering, apophenic, and epic plot boring or maddening; if you hated Richard Linklater’s 2001 movie <em>Waking Life</em>, in which a man discusses the meaning of the universe as he shuffles through a hallucinatory landscape, then you’ll hate this book. Other readers have enjoyed the text’s postmodernist twists and turns, its digressions on the nature of poetry and art, and its pursuit of wonder and beauty in the face of disaster, even if they find the foul language and explicit sex scenes distasteful or (at this point) dated. Note that the Kid — an Orpheus-like figure, whose only hope of making sense of his experiences is to become an author of the book we’re reading, or at least a version of it — would most likely agree with both sorts of readers. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> <em>Dhalgren</em> is Delany’s most popular book. William Gibson has referred to it as “A riddle that was never meant to be solved”; other commentators have noted the book’s debt — cf., mythological resonances, Moebius-strip plot form — to James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em>. Someone should make a movie!</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2012/11/15/j-g-ballard/">J.G. Ballard</a>’s <em>High-Rise</em> (1975).</strong> Philip K. Dick’s notion of a “conapt” — a densely populated, self-sufficient human habitat, isolated and isolating — was already a dystopian one, when he introduced it in <em>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</em> in 1965. Here, Ballard offers a kind of blood-spattered parable built around a pun: When the social order of his high-rise London apartment complex becomes violently dysfunctional, Richard Wilder, a documentary film-maker who lives on one of the building’s lower floors, literally becomes a social climber — scaling his way upward, to the luxurious penthouse suite. Anthony Royal, the building’s architect, perches there, awaiting his fate with a certain oblivious detachment. Our protagonist, Robert Laing, lives in-between these two characters; although he aspires to be as coolly uninvolved as Royal, Laing gets caught up in and enjoys the regressive mayhem: fighting in gangs, raiding and vandalizing other floors, killing pets, taking women. (It’s all straight out of David Bowie’s 1974 song “Diamond Dogs.”) As in <em>Crash</em> (1973) and <em>Concrete Island</em> (1974), Ballard is concerned about the deleterious effects of our advanced mode of life; note that life outside the titular high-rise goes on as usual. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> <em>High-Rise</em> was one of Joy Division singer Ian Curtis’s favorite books. It was adapted into a 2015 film of the same name, starring Tom Hiddleston, Jeremy Irons, and Sienna Miller, by director Ben Wheatley.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2014/04/01/samuel-r-delany/">Samuel R. Delany</a>‘s <em>Trouble on Triton: An Ambiguous Heterotopia</em> (1976).</strong> Part novel, part treatise, <em>Triton</em> brilliantly (if sometimes maddeningly) deploys post-structuralist theory in order to both illuminate and subvert the story of an unpleasant protagonist’s struggle to acculturate himself to life in a utopian colony on Triton, Neptune’s largest moon. Bron Helstrom, who had previously worked on Mars as a male prostitute, should be happy on Triton — where no one goes hungry, and where one can change one’s physical appearance, gender, sexual orientation, and even specific patterns of likes and dislikes. Helstrom’s problem is that he is an unregenerate individual, an asshole even, in a culture that deprioritizes the notion of the individual. (Shades of Stanislaw Lem’s <em>Return from the Stars</em>.) But <em>Triton</em> is less about Bron, in the end, than it is a critique of utopia, an exploration of the Foucauldian notion of heterotopia, and a semiotic intervention into science fiction’s unexamined ideologies. Should we feel sympathy for Bron, and reject Triton’s social order; or the other way around? Yes and no. PS: Almost forgot to mention that there is a destructive interplanetary war, between Triton and Earth, too. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Originally published under the title <em>Triton</em>, the novel’s themes and formal devices are also explored in Delany’s 1977 essay collection, <em>The Jewel-Hinged Jaw</em>.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2014/02/22/joanna-russ/">Joanna Russ</a>’s <em>We Who Are About To…</em> (serialized 1976; in book form, 1977).</strong>. A brutal, nihilistic —&nbsp;but beautifully written — novella that might perhaps best be categorized as an anti-Robinsonade. When a spaceship crash-lands on an uninhabitable and uncharted planet, the crash survivors rally and begin to make plans for starting an impromptu colony; even if they aren’t rescued, perhaps their descendants will be. Our unnamed protagonist, however, refuses to buy into this nonsense. Not only will the group not survive, she realizes, but — as a fertile woman —&nbsp;she will essentially become a breeding slave. In fact, the others do beat her, tie her up, and make plans to forcibly impregnate her via rape if she doesn’t come around to their way of thinking. What the would-be colonists fail to realize is that our protagonist is a bad-ass who cannot be controlled. She escapes —&nbsp;taking less than her fair share of rations and supplies with her, because she doesn’t intend to prolong the agony of her own inevitable death by starvation. When the others pursue her, she opens up a can of whoop-ass. Finally, she records recollections of her life — and feminist musings on the nature of subjectivity — among other things, as she wastes away. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Samuel R. Delany has described this novella as “a damningly fine analysis of the mechanics of political and social decay,” and a refutation of the notion that reproduction — as opposed to the quality of your life — is the point of living.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2015/05/08/moebius/">Moebius</a>‘s <em>Le Garage Hermétique</em> (The Airtight Garage, 1976–1979).</strong> <em>Le Garage Hermétique</em> is one of the two great capricious comic strips of the Seventies (1974–1983); <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2012/09/23/dal-tokyo/">Gary Panter’s <em>Dal Tokyo</em></a>, which first appeared in 1983, is the other. Over a four year period, Moebius cranked out two to four pages per month; each month, he challenged himself to solve continuity problems that he’d playfully introduced previously, while also creating new problems. The main plot, to the extent that there is one, concerns the efforts of Major Grubert to prevent outside entities from invading the Garage Hermétique —&nbsp;an asteroid housing a pocket universe, which features, e.g., desert and forest biomes, a city, and a world made of machines. One of these invaders is Jerry Cornelius, a trickster figure whom Moebius lifted from Michael Moorcock’s sci-fi novels; Grubert and Cornelius join forces, eventually, to face a threat to the Airtight Garage. Each installment of the strip, many of which focus on Grubert and Cornelius’s hapless allies, is its own self-contained epic; they don’t necessarily add up to anything larger. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> <em>Le Garage Hermétique</em> first appeared, from 1976–1979, in issues 6 through 41 of the Franco-Belgian comics magazine <em>Métal Hurlant</em>; Americans first read it in the magazine <em>Heavy Metal</em>, starting in 1977.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2011/10/05/philip-k-dick/">Philip K. Dick</a>’s <em>A Scanner Darkly</em> (1977).</strong> Set in a barely futuristic Los Angeles of 1994, <em>Scanner</em> tells the story of “Fred,” an undercover narc who gets a kick out of the counter-cultural addicts with whom — as “Bob” — he dwells. Fred’s abuse of Substance D (street name: “Death”) contributes to a brain psychosis complicated by his latest assignment… spying on Bob! Whose motivations Fred finds opaque. Dick mines humor and pathos out of the druggies’ lifestyle: paranoid conversations among low-lifes who actually are being spied on; crack-ups that feel like break-throughs. Also, this is a neo-noir crime novel — one in which we sympathize with the criminals, who are spirited free-thinkers, and despise the manipulative, cold-hearted cops. When Fred is sent to a detox facility, he cracks the secret of Substance D… too late? The book ends with a dramatic dedication to Dick’s many friends who’d been killed or permanently damaged by drug abuse; the author’s own name is on the list. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> In 2006, I wrote <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/summer_movies/2006/06/watching_the_detectives.html">a Slate essay</a> about the novel and Richard Linklater’s adaptation.

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2012/12/01/gary-panter/">Gary Panter</a>’s comic <em>Jimbo</em> (serialized 1977–present).</strong> Panter’s “ratty line” illustrations helped define the style of L.A. punk. But the appeal of Jimbo — an all-American, snub-nosed, freckle-faced punkoid wandering through Dal Tokyo, a planet-wide sprawl of a city founded on Mars by Japanese and Texans — is timeless. Jimbo is a high-lowbrow antihero, equally at home in the pages of the L.A. music zine <em>Slash</em>, where he first appeared, and in the artsy <em>RAW</em>. The early post-apocalyptic/surrealist comics (has Jimbo’s girlfriend been kidnapped by giant cockroaches?) have since given way to elaborate graphic novels that employ the character as an Everyman puzzling his way through religious/pop culture allegorical landscapes. But don’t try to understand the plot of Panter’s stories; the medium is the message. Panter’s protean style — which changes from page to page, sometimes exploding into sheer abstraction — demands that the reader participate actively in making sense of Jimbo’s… mission? <strong>Fun facts:</strong> Jimbo comics have been collected in <em>Jimbo</em> (1982), <em>Invasion of the Elvis Zombies</em> (1984), <em>Jimbo: Adventures in Paradise</em> (1988), and <em>Jimbo’s Inferno</em> (2006). Panter is now working on a collection of his Jimbo mini-comics.</li>

<li><strong>John Varley’s <em>The Ophiuchi Hotline</em> (1977).</strong> Before William Gibson, Iain M. Banks, and the Cornershop album <em>When I Was Born for the 7th Time</em>, there was… this oddball achievement. In the year 2618, four hundred years after the human race was displaced from the Earth by alien invaders (who consider aquatic mammals more advanced), humankind scrabbles for survival on the Moon and other off-world colonies. Thanks to the Hotline, a stream of data from a distant star system, the human survivors have mastered bioengineering techniques such as cloning, memory recording, adding and subtracting body parts, changing one’s sex whenever one chooses, and forming new life forms with intelligent symbiotes. Lilo, a rebel geneticist, faces execution for violating laws of humankind’s Eight Worlds; she escapes — or does she commit suicide, while a clone with her memories downloaded take her place? Lilo and her clones are soon embroiled in a plot to battle the invaders… using a black hole! Meanwhile, whoever has been sending information via the Hotline suddenly demands payment. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> This is the author’s first book, and the first (novel-length) installment in his Eight Worlds series.</li>

<li><strong>Vonda N. McIntyre’s <em>Dreamsnake</em> (1978).</strong> In the far future, many years after a devastating nuclear war, genetic manipulation of plants and animals is routine, and humankind has reverted (evolved) into a neo-tribalist social order. Snake, a healer immune to snakebites, carries with her three snakes — Grass, Sand, and Mist —&nbsp;whose venom she uses in her potions. When fearful nomads cripple Grass, a small and rare “dreamsnake” from off-world, whose venom is capable of inducing heroin-like torpor and LSD-like hallucinations, Snake embarks, across a desert of black sand on a quest. Along with a patient who is suffering from radiation sickness — there are pockets of radiation left here and there —&nbsp;Snake heads to the city of Center, in hopes of persuading the Otherworlders who visit there to sell her a new dreamsnake. Hers is a picaresque journey involving a desert-dwelling dreamsnake-venom addict, a handsome young lover, an abused 12-year-old girl, a giant bandit, a character whose sex is never specified, and many hallucinations. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> <em>Dreamsnake</em> started as a story called “Of Mist, and Grass, and Sand,” which won a Nebula Award. The novel version won the 1979 Hugo Award.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2015/08/24/james-tiptree-jr/">James Tiptree Jr.</a>‘s <em>Up the Walls of the World</em> (1978).</strong> Where to begin? Here on Earth, a group of troubled men and women with telepathic abilities are being studied like lab rats by the (paranoid, drug-addicted) Dr. Dann, as part of a US Navy experiment; Dr. Omaili, with whom Dr. Dann falls in love, is a computer scientist of African descent who has been unable to make meaningful connections since her teens, due to a ritual cliterodectomy administered by her stepfather. Meanwhile, Tivonel, a manta ray-like young female on a far-off planet (Tyree), resents the males of her powerfully psionic species —&nbsp;who are charged with the all-important task of parenting, while the females freely sail the air currents; she is more concerned, however, when Tyree’s scientists report that a wave of death is spreading across the galaxy and headed their way. And then there’s The Destroyer, a solar system-sized, network-structured, sentient inhabitant of deep space, which muses sadly (IN ALL CAPS) on its solitude and inability to fulfill its mysterious duty…&nbsp;while absent-mindedly destroying the galaxy. In an effort to save her species, Tivonel “invades” Earth — telepathically. The minds of Dr. Dann, Dr. Omaili, and their test subjects are transported into the bodies of Tivonel’s inhabitants…&nbsp;where they are uniquely able to flourish. But what can they do to stop the Destroyer? <strong>Fun facts:</strong> “James Tiptree Jr.” was the pen name of pioneering female sci-fi author Alice Sheldon. In the 1940s, she was an officer in the Air Force’s photo-intelligence group; in the ’50s and ’60s, she earned a doctorate in Experimental Psychology. Already well-known for her sci-fi stories, <em>Up the Walls of the World</em> was her first novel.</li>

<li><strong>John Crowley’s <em>Engine Summer</em> (1979).</strong> A beautifully written, trippy novella set in a post-apocalyptic America, where relics of the past confound and amaze our protagonist, young Rush That Speaks. He’s grown up in Little Belaire, an idyllic, tribalist community of “true speakers” who fled society’s collapse (specifically, they appear to have fled Bel Air, California) in the distant past. This reader could have happily explored Little Belaire and its traditions along with Rush That Speaks for a longer stretch, but when Once a Day, the girl he loves, absconds to live with a cat-like society called Dr. Boots’s List, Little Rush heads out after her. First, however, he spends time living with Blink, a “saint,” in a treehouse, gathering more intel about the high-tech, unhappy prelapsarian world of the vanished “angels.” Once he’s taken in by Dr. Boots’s List, Rush That Speaks undergoes a mind-meld with Dr. Boots — from which he will never fully recover. At which point, an “angel” drops from the sky, and much is made clear to us. As with <em>Riddley Walker</em>, published the following year, <em>Engine Summer</em> is among other things a riddle, requiring readers to puzzle out secrets of the past (our near-future, perhaps) that the book’s characters themselves will never truly understand. The book’s ending is a deeply poignant one. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> Crowley is best known as the author of <em>Little, Big</em> (1981), a much-admired fantasy novel, and for his Ægypt series of novels (1987–2007). I like these books, too, but strongly urge science fiction fans to revisit his early work.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2009/06/22/hilo-hero-octavia-e-butler/">Octavia E. Butler</a>‘s <em>Kindred</em> (1979).</strong> In this realistic (visceral, even) sci-fi/fantasy hybrid yarn, which Butler modeled on grim North American slave narratives by the likes of Harriet Tubman, Dana, a young, educated African-American woman in contemporary Los Angeles, finds herself shunted back in time to an antebellum Maryland plantation. (Unless she’s just hallucinating?) Dana, who is married to a white man in the present, discovers in the past her own ancestors — a white planter and a black freewoman who has been forced into slavery. Her ontogeny — as a black woman fully conscious of slavery’s legacy in contemporary America — recapitulates the phylogeny of her ancestor, who loses her innocence, faces harsh punishment, develops strategies of resistance, and ultimately develops the ability to escape from a repressive, racist white society. <em>Kindred</em> unflinchingly interrogates the intersection of power, gender, and race, but the narrative is far from simple: Dana’s ancestors, Rufus and Alice, were childhood friends, and Dana ends up developing sympathy for Rufus, despite the fact that he grows up to be a monster. She also encounters Sarah, an angry slave who only appears to be a submissive “mammie,” and other characters who fail to conform to previous depictions of slavery, from <em>Gone with the Wind</em> to <em>Roots</em>. The time travel narrative is also complex, as Dana — and, sometimes, her husband — ricochets back and forth from the present to various points in Alice and Rufus’s life stories. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> <em>Kindred</em> was a bestseller, and remains popular today; it is often chosen as a text for community-wide reading programs and high school and college courses. It was adapted as a 2017 graphic novel by Damian Duffy and John Jennings.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2011/02/07/alejandro-jodorowsky/">Alejandro Jodorowsky</a> and <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2015/05/08/moebius/">Jean Giraud</a> (Moebius)’s graphic novel <em>The Incal</em> (1980–1988).</strong> In the capital city of a planet within a galactic empire dominated by humans (and humanoid aliens known as Bergs), a mercurial private investigator, John DiFool, is nearly murdered by masked assassins. They’re seeking a crystal of enormous power, the Light Incal, which has gone missing; and so is: Animah, the keeper of the Light Incal; Tanatah, leader of a rebel group (and Animah’s sister); the city’s corrupt government; the Bergs; and the Technopriests, a cult that worships a different crystal, the Dark Incal. Jodorowsky’s space opera — drawn brilliantly by Giraud — is a satirical, dystopian admixture of intergalactic travel, political conspiracy, sex, drugs, and messianism. (If this description reminds you of <em>Dune</em>, it should: in 1975, Giraud provided concept art for Jodorowsky’s never-made film adaption of Frank Herbert’s novel.) Accompanied by Deepo, his loyal “concrete seagull,” and the Metabaron, a mercenary super-warrior, DiFool embarks on a quest to prevent the Technopriests from launching a sun-eating Dark Egg. It’s also a recursive mystic parable, of sorts. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> Originally published in installments in <em>Métal Hurlant</em> (1980–1988); <em>The Incal</em> was followed by <em>Before the Incal</em> (1988–1995, with Zoran Janjetov), <em>After the Incal</em> (2000, with Jean Giraud), and <em>Final Incal</em> (2008–2014, with José Ladrönn).</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2009/06/22/hilo-hero-octavia-e-butler/">Octavia E. Butler</a>’s <em>Wild Seed</em> (1980).</strong> In this prequel to Butler’s Patternist epic, a 1976–1984 series of novels recounting the rise of a mutant species of networked telepaths who will —&nbsp;in the far future — come to enslave “mute” humankind (while struggling against the Clayarks, a species of extraterrestrial plague-mutated humanoids), our protagonist is Anyanwu, a 350-year-old shapeshifter living peacefully in Africa… until she meets Doro, a telepathic spirit so powerful that he can possess any body. Doro, who was born in Egypt during the reign of the Pharaohs, intends to breed a race of telepaths under his control; he has been collecting people with unusual abilities and breeding them, and Anyanwu is his next target. Although she vehemently disagrees with Doro’s contemptuous, utilitarian treatment of his experimental subjects, Anyanwu is persuaded to leave her home for America… where she will struggle to rebel against Doro’s manipulative coercion. The book’s timeline begins in the late 17th century and ends in the early 19th century, and Anyanwu and Doro take the Middle Passage to the New World aboard a slave ship…&nbsp;yet Butler complicates this quasi-slave narrative by showing how Doro protects his “seeds” from Indian attacks and White racism alike. In the end, it’s a book about a woman who fights to protect her family from a cruel, paternalistic man —&nbsp;using love and self-sacrifice, not violence. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> The other Patternist books, in order of publication, are <em>Patternmaster</em> (1976), <em>Mind of My Mind</em> (1977), <em>Survivor</em> (1978), and <em>Clay’s Ark</em> (1984).</li>

<li><strong>Russell Hoban’s <em>Riddley Walker</em> (1980).</strong> “Our woal life is a idear we dint think of nor we dont know what it is.” Although its degraded dialect is not to every reader’s taste, and although it’s not particularly action-packed, <em>Riddley Walker</em> is one of the greatest of all post-apocalyptic adventures — and a brilliant, deep, mysterious, tragicomic piece of writing that amply rewards re-reading. When twelve-year-old Riddley’s father dies, he becomes his community’s “connexion man” — tasked with teasing out the social, religious, and political implications of the ever-evolving puppet shows staged — in primitive towns across “Inland” (England) — by church/government propagandists. A cataclysm happened, a couple of thousand years ago, reducing the world to an Iron Age level of technology — leaving nothing but myths, turns of phrase (“hes getting his serkits jus that little bit over loadit”), and artifacts to be puzzled over by inquisitive types. A power struggle is going on, we discover — one whose outcome may lead to humankind’s progress forward out of the ashes, or to utter ruin. The chance finding of an ancient relic gets Riddley involved in this momentous struggle… and sends him on the run! Though it’s often compared to <em>A Clockwork Orange</em> and <em>A Canticle for Leibowitz</em>, I’d describe <em>Riddley Walker</em> as a sequel to Cicely Hamilton’s <em><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2018/09/04/theodore-savage-intro/">Theodore Savage</a></em>, and a companion-piece to John Crowley’s <em><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2018/12/16/new-wave-sci-fi-75-63/">Engine Summer</a></em>. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> Harold Bloom included this book in his list of works comprising the Western Canon; and George Miller’s 1985 movie <em>Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome</em> pays homage to <em>Riddley Walker</em>. Hoban is best known as the author of <em>Bedtime for Frances</em> (1960, ill. Garth Williams) and sequels, as well as for the older children’s novel <em>The Mouse and His Child</em> (1967).</li>

Fat, it seems, has received a beam of pure reason from “God” — perhaps an alien satellite orbiting Earth — which has allowed him to see that 1970s California is an illusion; actually, we’re all slaves blindly toiling in a <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2011/07/13/the-black-iron-prison/">Black Iron Prison</a>. So…&nbsp;the ancient Gnostics were right! (Right?) The true nature of the universe is a Vast Active Living Intelligence System. Superhumans living anonymously among us use pop culture to stay in touch with one another; the pulp novels of Philip K. Dick may be on to something; the writings of Heraclitus, Schopenhauer, Freud and Jung must now be recontextualized. (Right?) Fat sets off, with a few friends, to find answers: about God, suffering, art, the mind, the secret history of humankind, and — naturally — about David Bowie, particularly his 1976 movie <em>The Man Who Fell to Earth</em>. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> <em>VALIS</em> is the first installment in a never-completed trilogy of novels fictionalizing the philosophical explorations Dick made into this experience via a rambling treatise, <em>The Exegesis</em>. It isn’t necessary, in order to enjoy <em>VALIS</em>, to know this, but: in 1974 Dick experienced a series of hallucinations which presented themselves as encounters with a gnostic version of the divine.</li>

<li><strong>John Wagner, Alan Grant, and Carlos Ezquerra’s Judge Dredd adventures “Block Mania” (serialized 10/31/1981 to 12/26/81) and “The Apocalypse War” (1/2/82 to 6/26/82).</strong> In 1977, writer John Wagner and artist Carlos Ezquerra created Judge Dredd —&nbsp;a violent sci-fi comic strip spoofing American action movies (military, cop, western, vigilante) of the Seventies — for British readers of the weekly magazine <em>2000 AD</em>. In the 22nd century, the titular judge-jury-and-executioner character and his colleagues police Mega-City One, which is subdivided into gigantic towers known as City Blocks stretching from Boston to Key West. In “The Apocalypse War,” Russkies from East Meg One, a Soviet citystate, invade Mega-City One. Hundreds of millions of Mega-City One citizens are killed, and ninety percent of the city is captured — while Dredd tries to organize a guerrilla resistance movement. Failing that, he must consider the option of completely obliterating East Meg One! “Block Mania,” the prologue to “The Apocalypse War,” demonstrates how Mega-City One was softened up for invasion: a massive conflict between City Blocks is engineered by an East Meg One agent, Orlok, who infects the water supply with a psychotropic drug. Orlok also kills Dredd’s sidekick, Judge Giant, in an almost casual way —&nbsp;which was shocking to even the shock-proof readers of <em>2000 AD</em>. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Via his excellent <a href="http://dreddreviews.blogspot.com/search?q=apocalypse">Dredd Reckoning blog</a>, Douglas Wolk notes just how dark the humor of this storyline is: “It’s a story about genocide with comedy relief interludes — the Walter-and-Maria slapstick routines, the Country Joe-type folksinger getting splattered by a missile.” In 1987, Games Workshop produced a board game, set in the Judge Dredd universe, called <em><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/330/block-mania">Block Mania</a></em>; players take on the role of rival City Blocks — and use spray paint, guns, flamethrowers and heavy lasers to vandalize and destroy neighboring blocks.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2013/11/18/alan-moore/">Alan Moore</a>’s dystopian graphic novel <em>V for Vendetta</em> (serialized 1982–1989). Illustrated by David Lloyd.</strong> In the near future, following a nuclear war, the United Kingdom has become a fascist state run by the Norsefire Party. V, a flamboyant anarchist terrorist and vigilante whose face is never seen — he wears a Guy Fawkes mask — begins a campaign to bring down the government (and all governments); it’s like <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em> with a happy ending. V, we discover over the course of the graphic novel, was imprisoned in a Norsefire concentration camp and experimented upon… which led him to develop superhuman strength, reflexes, and endurance. He blows up the Old Bailey and the CCTY surveillance buildings, kidnaps the propaganda minister, and murders a bishop — what will his final act be? He’s pursued by Eric Finch, the secretly decent head of Norsefire’s police. The Robin to V’s Batman is Evey, a young woman whom he saves from a rapist and grooms as his successor — through very dubious methods. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> Mostly published in black and white, in the British comics magazine <em>Warrior</em>; when the magazine folded, DC Comics reprinted and completed the story in color. In one of HILOBROW’s most frequently viewed posts, Molly Sauter <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2012/04/30/mask/">traces</a> the adoption of the Guy Fawkes mask by Anonymous, following the marketing blitz for the (lame) 2006 film adaptation of the comic.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2009/07/07/hilo-hero-robert-a-heinlein/">Robert Heinlein</a>‘s <em>Friday</em> (1982).</strong> Heinlein fans were relieved to see the master return — after a seven-year hiatus and the worst book of his career, 1980’s <em>The Number of the Beast</em> — to kiss-kiss bang-bang form. This is a fun spy novel, featuring a kick-ass combat courier, Friday Jones, who struggles to conceal her status as an “artificial person” genetically engineered to be stronger, faster, and smarter than the rest of us —&nbsp;because of prejudice and opprobrium. Heinlein was fond of reimagining what “family” could mean, and Friday’s group family, composed of several husbands and wives and many children, is a semi-intriguing idea. At the same time, critics are absolutely correct to point out that Heinlein is at his sex-positive skeeviest here… and that there really isn’t anything resembling a plot. What makes this novel worth mentioning in the context of New Wave sci-fi, I think, is the ingenious means by which Friday’s agency activates her highly advanced <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2010/11/03/meet-the-semionauts/">abductive reasoning</a> ability — that is to say, her capacity for making imaginative excogitations of hypotheses on the unknown causes of resulting facts. (For example, Friday accurately predicts the second coming of the Black Plague.) I’ve emulated these methods — archive binges, asking myself questions while in a hypnogogic state — in my own commercial semiotics practice. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> Science fiction author Jo Walton has called <em>Friday</em> “the worst book I love.” I think that’s more or less how I feel about it, too. Though I love even worse books.</li>

<li><strong>Katsuhiro Otomo’s manga series <em>Akira</em> (1982–1990).</strong> Some forty years after after “a new type of bomb” has supposedly exploded over Tokyo, in 1982, triggering World War III, vocational school student and bōsōzoku gang leader Kaneda gets caught up in a struggle between Neo-Tokyo’s military leader, Colonel Shikishima, and a resistance movement who’ve discovered that Shikishima’s scientists are secretly developing a super-weapon of some kind: “Akira.” While Kaneda  and Kei, a female member of the resistance, investigate the Akira project, which may in fact have caused the 1982 destruction of Tokyo, Tetsuo — an already unstable member of Kaneda’s gang —&nbsp;develops powerful telekinetic abilities after a motorcycle crash. Tetsuo becomes leader of a rival gang, the Clowns, who start a violent citywide turf war; Shikishima then persuades Tetsuo to join his secret project — which involves wizened young “espers” with equally powerful abilities. All of which happens in the first action-packed volume of the <em>Akira</em> series — there are six, in total. What will happen when the increasingly deranged Tetsuo encounters the other espers — not to mention Akira? Can Kaneda and Kei prevent Shikishima from unleashing greater destruction? Who or what is Akira? <strong>Fun facts:</strong> Serialized in Japan’s weekly <em>Young Magazine</em> from 1982–1990. The full 2,000-page series was translated, colored, and published in the US by Marvel/Epic from 1988–1995. The 1988 animated movie, directed by Katsuhiro Otomo, is considered one of the greatest animated films of all time. I saw it on the big screen, in ’89 — it was mid-blowing, at the time.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2012/12/01/gary-panter/">Gary Panter</a>‘s comic strip <em>Dal Tokyo</em> (1983–2007).</strong> Panter’s <em>Dal Tokyo</em> — which is set on Mars, in a semi-dystopian city whose culture is a Dallas-Tokyo mashup —&nbsp;first appeared as a weekly strip in the <em>L.A. Reader</em> from 1983–1984, then as a monthly strip in a Japanese reggae magazine from 1996 to 2007. The sidewalks and alleys of Dal Tokyo teem with punks, aliens, mutants, Sepaloids, Cubist girls, and adorable manga characters. Rival advertising agencies engage in bloody combat; freelance peeping toms snap pho-toms of rich smog monsters having sex; and ant-men excavate classic cars from the surrounding desert, then melt them for the minerals they require to speak. Several plot-lines develop, over time: ex-dinosaur Nurse Barbie is at the center of a plot involving the university hospital and its evolution experiments; Sybig Nabcig, a juvenile smog monster, is the protagonist of a story about Dal Tokyo’s street culture, e.g., its skaters and radio-controlled robot fights; and we also follow car-hating fiend Dareiter Pictox, who early on in the series records an exploding Mustang for a Ballardian crash-porn moving-picture magazine, into a wild tangle of monsters, mutants, and media. There are many other characters and happenings, but the medium is the message, here: Panter sometimes uses his four panels to tell a serialized, Flash Gordon-type adventure; other times, he spreads a single scene or image or explosion across the entire frame; and other times, it’s impossible to tell what’s going on! Did Panter invent cyber-punk? <strong>Fun fact:</strong> I have written about Dal Tokyo <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2012/09/23/dal-tokyo/">at greater length</a> for <em>The Comics Journal</em>, on the occasion of Fantagraphics’ 2012 publication of a <em>Dal Tokyo</em> collection.</li>

<li><strong>John Sladek’s <em>Roderick at Random</em> (1983).</strong> In the sequel to Sladek’s <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2015/12/02/10-best-adventures-of-1980/"><em>Roderick, or The Education of a Young Machine</em></a> (1980), our Candide-like robot protagonist takes a low-paying job and attempts to navigate such human, all-too-human institutions as academia, government, the military, the media, the art world, the publishing industry, and above all, religion. Thanks to Roderick’s hard-wired objectivity, this is a darkly satirical take-down of everything from trendy Zen Buddhism and a Scientology-like celebrity “church” to humankind’s propensity to fear, reject, and persecute those who don’t go along to get along. Life itself, Roderick discovers, is absurd; there is no inherent meaning in the world, no overarching purpose to our lives. Computers, meanwhile, are developing their own consciousness — which doesn’t make Roderick feel any less alone; in fact, he’s scared of the emerging AIs. If the book’s human characters are two-dimensional, and its narrative structure Rube Goldberg-like, it’s largely because Sladek was experimenting with the Oulipian possibilities of artificial constraints and mathematical possibilities. In the end, Roderick is revealed as the most truly human character in the story. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> Sladek was closely involved with the UK New Wave sci-fi movement in the 1960s–1970s; for example, he co-edited the short lived poetry magazine <em>Ronald Reagan</em>, where work by J.G. Ballard, Thomas M. Disch and other sci-fi writers appeared. The two Roderick books were intended to be parts of a single novel; and in 2001, they were published in one volume as <em>The Complete Roderick</em>.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2013/01/27/frank-miller/">Frank Miller</a>‘s graphic novel <em>Rōnin</em> (1983–1984).</strong> A six-issue DC miniseries written and drawn by Miller, who a couple of years earlier had earned a brilliant reputation as a writer and penciller on <em>Daredevil</em>. While researching martial-arts movies and Japanese samurai manga for that comic, Miller became fascinated with the medieval figure of the <em>ronin</em> —&nbsp;a rootless samurai whose master has been killed. Drawn in a weird, expressionistic style synthesizing manga and Moebius, Miller’s <em>Rōnin</em> tells the story of Billy Challas, a limbless and abused mutant with telekinetic powers who — while testing cutting-edge prosthetic limbs for the biocircuitry company Aquarius, located in a post-apocalyptic New York — appears to be possessed by a ronin from feudal Japan. Virgo, the artificial intelligence at the heart of the Aquarius Complex, is a major character in this enthralling, often wordless yarn; other players include Peter McKenna, inventor of biocircuitry, his wife, Casey McKenna, Aquarius’ bad-ass head of security, and Taggart, who funded and controls Aquarius (and who is replaced by the ronin’s almost-immortal enemy, the demon Agat). The action spills out into the streets of New York — where Billy/Ronin must confront a neo-Nazi gang, sewer-dwelling cannibals, and Virgo’s lethal robots! <strong>Fun facts:</strong> Artwork painted by Lynn Varley. Genndy Tartakovsky has stated that <em>Ronin</em> was one of the major influences on his animated TV series <em>Samurai Jack</em>.</li>

	<p>If you've ever had dialup internet service, or still do, or just know someone that does, you have probably heard terms like "56k modem". "56k" has become almost synonymous with dialup Internet access. But it's such an arbitrary number. It's not divisible by ten, it's not a power of two... so why was it chosen as the fastest dialup speed? For the answer, we will have to travel back in time quite a while. </p>
	<p>Our visitors from Google should be warned that this is not a "stripped down" explanation; it is intended for relatively technical readers. But if you really want to know where this magic number comes from, you need to understand some of the technical background. As we shall see, "56k" was not just pulled out of a hat. </p>

    </div>    
	<h2><a name="base"></a>Setting the baseline</h2>
	<p>First, let's be specific about what we mean. A "56k" (sometimes the 'k' is capitalized and sometimes not; the reasons are not really relevant here) dialup modem can download data at up to 56 kilobits per second. That is a theoretical maximum of the hardware; for various reasons (and yes, we'll get there) this speed can never actually be achieved. Upload speeds are considerably slower.</p>
	<p>This was all codified in 1998 in the ITU V.90 recommendation, which merged two competing standards (X2 from 3COM and K56flex from Rockwell Semiconductor). V.92 came slightly later, and introduced various tweaks; mostly, it increased the maximum upload speed. Any modern dialup modem will conform to one of these standards. </p>
	<p>Got all that?</p>
	<h2><a name="long"></a>Long, long ago </h2>
	<p>Bur story starts much earlier. Long ago, when the phone networks were still completely analog, when the first real phone networks were being built, the  engineers that were designing them faced a decision. They needed to determine how much bandwidth their networks had to have in order to ensure adequate voice quality. Too little bandwidth, and users wouldn't be able to recognize the voice of the person on the other end. But the more bandwidth the system was specified for, the more difficult (and expensive) the network was to build.</p>
	<p>Ultimately, they settled on approximately 3.2 kHz. The implementation for this is pretty simple: the phone lines in individual houses run to boxes owned by the phone company, which pass all voice traffic through a lowpass filter. This filter has a passband of 3.2 kHz, and a stopband starting at 4 kHz. The entire signal  at 3.2 kHz and below is preserved, everything above 4 kHz is attenuated heavily, and as for the frequencies in between, well, we just don't worry about those. Problem solved.</p>
	<h2><a name="dig"></a>Digitization</h2>
	<p>Fast-forward to 1962.  Ma Bell begins using T-1s to connect its switching centers. T-1s are a digital communications link, not analog. The entire phone network goes digital. In a modern phone network, the only analog communication is between an individual house's phone line and the phone company's box.</p>
	<p>T-1s are a particular form of DS-1 (Digital Signal 1).  They implement the DS-1 protocol, with an AMI line code (alternate mark inversion; a "0" is 0 volts, "1"s alternate between logic high and logic low), over twisted pair cable, for a distance of up to 6000 feet (very roughly 1 mile). Now that we've gotten all precise, I'm going to play a bit loose with terminology and call this "a DS-1" because it makes what follows easier to understand. And it's very nearly correct. </p>
	<p>A DS-1 is made by multiplexing 24 DS-0 streams. Each DS-0 corresponds to a single phone line; that is, a typical house gets one DS-0. Why 24 of them in each DS-1? No idea. Most likely that was that was the maximum possible without overstressing the equipment that was available at the time. The most comparable European standard, E-1, multiplexes 32 channels together (1 is used for internal signaling purposes).</p>
	<p>In order to get your voice data onto this digital network, it must first be digitized. So now instead of just going through a lowpass filter, it goes through a lowpass filter, then is sampled, and then is run into an analog-to-digital converter that assigns a numerical value to the amplitude of the signal at the instant it is sampled.  Simple, right?</p>
	<p>As we've said, the lowpass filter cuts off all frequencies above 4 kHz. This means that the filtered signal can be sampled at 8 kHz (which is to say, it is sampled 8000 times per second) with  no fidelity loss. This is the Nyquist Rate; any signal sampled at a rate equal to twice its highest frequency component can be completely reconstructed. So now we have turned our analog signal into a discrete-time signal running along at 8000 samples/second.</p>
	<p>Next we want to quantize our signal so that we have a purely digital signal. For this, an 8-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is used. Here there is some fidelity loss, but not enough to be detectable to human ears. Fidelity could be improved by using, say, a 16-bit ADC. But that would cost more to manufacture (at the time, a <em>lot</em> more) , and would mean that all the other hardware has to be built to transmit twice as much data. So 8-bit it is.</p>
	<p>For those of you keeping score at home, that means we now have a signal that transmits data 8000 times each second, and transmits 8 bits of data for each of those samples. 8 bits/sample * 8000 samples/second yields 64 kbit/s (64 kilobits per second). So why can't dialup modems go up to 64 kbit/s? The short answer would be "historical reasons".</p>
	<h2><a name="band"></a>We're with the band </h2>
	<p>The more complete answer is "control data". Most communications networks need to transmit two kinds of information. The first is data; for phone networks, this is voice data. The second is signaling information, the control data that lets the network communicate status information with itself. There are two ways to send control data: "in band" (where it is packed in with the data) and "out of band" (where it gets its own separate channel, possibly in an entirely different physical medium).</p>
	<p>After we've created the 64 kbit/s data stream that fills up our DS-0, it needs to be multiplexed into a DS-1 for longer-distance transmission to the phone company's switching station. And the DS-1 has control data to carry. The Bell engineers decided to send that information in band.</p>
	<p>But how do we go about packing this data in? One way is to "steal" some data bits and replace them with control data. And that is exactly what the Bell engineers did.</p>
	<h2><a name="theft"></a>Petty theft </h2>
	<p>A DS-1 transmits data in frames. Each frame contains one complete sample from each DS-0, plus a framing bit. Since there are 24 DS-0s multiplexed to make each DS-1, and a single sample from a DS-0 is 8 bits of data. 24 * 8 makes 192 bits. Toss in the framing bit and you have 193 bits.</p>
	<p>So we have our 193-bit frame, and we want to pack some control data into it. How? Every 6 frames, the least significant bit of each voice channel is "stolen". The data bit is thrown out, and control data is sent instead. Because it is the <em>least</em> significant bit that is lost, this very slight alteration to the voice signal is not detectable by human ears. Everybody's happy.</p>
	<h2><a name="modem"></a>Enter the modem</h2>
	<p>That system worked  fine until people wanted to transmit more than just voice on these networks.   If you're sending voice, losing the least significant bit of every sixth byte is no big deal. If you are sending data, it is a very big deal. Neither modem has any way to know which bytes will be affected. Maybe this sample, maybe the next one. This is a problem.</p>
	<p>The solution is simple enough: assume you are always going to lose that least significant bit. Assume that you can only reliably send or receive 7 bits with each sample. When the receiver gets its data, it simply throws away the least significant bit of every byte. That yields a maximum data rate of 7 bit/sample * 8000 samples/s, or 56 kbit/s.</p>
	<p>And <strong>that</strong> is where the term "56k" comes from.</p>
	<h2><a name="fcc"></a>So why can't I actually connect at 56 kbit/s?</h2>
	<p>Anyone that has ever used a dialup modem knows full well that they don't actually get to connect at that speed, though. And that their connection speed varies each time they dial in. There are two factors at work here.</p>
	<p>The first is the FCC. If you are in the United States, the FCC places a restriction on the power output of devices connected to the phone network. The result is that you will never be able to connect at a speed faster than 53.3 kbit/s.</p>
	<p>The second is the overall complexity of the phone network. 56 kbit/s (or 53.3 kbit/s) requires very good operating conditions, as it is really operating beyond the paramaters of what the phone network is required to be capable of. Operating at these speeds requires that there only be one ADC between the user and their ISP (which is not guaranteed to be true, but typically is), and that the copper wiring in the user's "local loop" have very good electrical properties. Part of the dialup process that is used to initiate a connection is an evaluation of the overall quality of the connection; if it is determined to be lacking, the modem will automatically drop down to a lower data rate. </p>

cat <| ls      Same as above
ls &amp;> StdErr   Redirect stdout of `ls` to wherever stderr is going.
StdErr <&amp; ls   Same as above
ls &amp;!> StdOut  Redirect stderr of `ls` to wherever stdout is going.
StdOut <!&amp; ls  Same as above"><pre><code>ls |&gt; cat      Pipe the stdout of `ls` into stdin of `cat`
cat &lt;| ls      Same as above
ls &amp;&gt; StdErr   Redirect stdout of `ls` to wherever stderr is going.
StdErr &lt;&amp; ls   Same as above
ls &amp;!&gt; StdOut  Redirect stderr of `ls` to wherever stdout is going.
StdOut &lt;!&amp; ls  Same as above
</code></pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Globbing</h2>
<p dir="auto">Currently Shh does not have any built in globbing support. Rather, it is
currently suggested to use another library to do globbing. For example,
using the <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Glob" rel="nofollow">Glob</a> package, it is
possible to do something like</p>

<p dir="auto">Certainly more verbose than the Bash equivalent, however, also more explicit,
which is probably a good thing. If this turns out to be too cumbersome, we
might introduce a more succinct globbing feature, though it will always be
explicit, and thus always more verbose than most other shells.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">String Interpolation/Expansion/Substitution</h2>
<p dir="auto">String interpolation, much like globbing, is left to an external library.
I lightweight, zero-dependency solution is to use <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/PyF" rel="nofollow">PyF</a>,
which, since 0.10.0.1, has no dependencies other than ones included with GHC.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="greet =  do
    user <- getEnv &quot;USER&quot;
    echo [fmt|Hello, {user}!|]"><pre>greet <span>=</span>  <span>do</span>
    user <span>&lt;-</span> getEnv <span><span>"</span>USER<span>"</span></span>
    echo [<span>fmt</span>|Hello, {user}!|]</pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2>
<p dir="auto">Some of the features in Shh require that you use the threaded runtime.
Please compile with the <code>-threaded</code> flag to avoid deadlocks.</p>
<p dir="auto">Enable Template Haskell and load the environment. It is also strongly
recommended to use <code>ExtendedDefaultRules</code>. This is especially important
if you want to use <code>OverloadedStrings</code>.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}
{-# LANGUAGE ExtendedDefaultRules #-}
$(loadEnv SearchPath)"><pre><code>{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}
{-# LANGUAGE ExtendedDefaultRules #-}
$(loadEnv SearchPath)
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You now have all your executables available as simple Haskell
functions. If you don't want to load your entire environment you
can load specific commands directly:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="load SearchPath [&quot;echo&quot;, &quot;grep&quot;, &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;ls&quot;]"><pre><code>load SearchPath ["echo", "grep", "cat", "ls"]
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">If you want to check that all the dependencies still exist, you can use
<code>missingExecutables :: IO [String]</code>, which will tell you if anything is
missing.</p>
<p dir="auto">For use in a project, it makes sense to have a dedicated module for your
project which does the template Haskell above. This will prevent recompilation
of all the executables, and also allow you to easily namespace them to
avoid collisions with normal Haskell functions.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage in GHCi</h3>
<p dir="auto">If you want <code>^D</code> to be recognised as a EOF marker (when running commands
that read from stdin) when running in GHCi, you will need to run the
<code>initInteractive</code> function. This sets the line buffering appropriately and
ensures the terminal is in canonical mode.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Shh as a Shell</h3>
<p dir="auto">There is a tool called <code>shh</code> which is a fairly small wrapper around launching
GHCi which automatically loads your environment and allows you to have custom
config when using GHCi as a shell.</p>
<p dir="auto">To install it, one option is to use <code>cabal new-install</code></p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cabal new-install --lib shh
cabal new-install --lib shh-extras"><pre>cabal new-install --lib shh
cabal new-install --lib shh-extras</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The <code>shh</code> binary will look in your <code>$SHH_DIR</code> (defaults to <code>$HOME/.shh</code>) for
a <code>Shell.hs</code>, <code>init.ghci</code> and <code>wrapper</code> files. If these don't exist default
ones will be created.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>Shell.hs</code> file should contain any top level definitions that you would
like to be available in your Shell. By default it loads your environment.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>init.ghci</code> file is loaded by GHCi after your <code>.ghci</code> files. This lets
you specify settings that you want to take effect when using GHCi as a shell.
By default it sets a shell-like prompt.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>wrapper</code> file is an executable that is called with the command that is
to be executed. By default it just calls <code>exec</code> with the arguments passed to
it. The use-case for this is to be able to set up the environment for <code>shh</code>.
You might, for example, wrap the execution in a <code>nix-shell</code>. Either way,
it is up to you to make sure that the compiler, and packages you require are
available, either globally, or provided by the <code>wrapper</code> script.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Faster Startup</h4>
<p dir="auto"><code>shh</code> precompiles your <code>Shell.hs</code> file so that starting up <code>shh</code> is very
quick on subsequent launches. Unfortunately, <code>shh</code> isn't quite able to detect
this perfectly. If you see GHCi telling you that it is <code>Compiling Shell</code>,
and you notice the delay when starting <code>shh</code>, try manually forcing a rebuild
by passing in the <code>--rebuild</code> argument to <code>shh</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is particularly likely to happen if you upgrade your GHC, or installed
packages, or even <code>shh</code> itself.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Nix Wrapper Example</h4>
<p dir="auto">The following snippet could act as a <code>wrapper</code> file to set up a suitable
environment using <code>nix-shell</code></p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="#! /usr/bin/env nix-shell
#! nix-shell -i bash -p &quot;(haskellPackages.ghcWithPackages (p: with p; [shh shh-extras]))&quot;
exec &quot;$@&quot;"><pre><code>#! /usr/bin/env nix-shell
#! nix-shell -i bash -p "(haskellPackages.ghcWithPackages (p: with p; [shh shh-extras]))"
exec "$@"
</code></pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Script Usage</h3>

<p dir="auto">There are quite a few players in the "shell programming for Haskell" field.</p>
<p dir="auto">This table attempts to summarise some of the differences.</p>

<p dir="auto">DO NOT CLOSE THIS ISSUE BECAUSE YOU THINK IT DOEN'T MEET THE CRITERIA OF A VALID ISSUE! THERE ARE SOME VERY SALIENT ISSUES BEING RAISED IN THIS ISSUE.....</p>
<p dir="auto">I have reported issues as far back as Feb, 2022, and of as now, many of these reported issues remain unfixed. This is really a poor situation where I have to open an issue to complain about issues not being fixed. The lack of response to issues <strong>IS</strong> the issue.</p>
<p dir="auto">I reported an issue (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1137585916" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/dotnet/maui/issues/4672" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/dotnet/maui/issues/4672/hovercard" href="https://github.com/dotnet/maui/issues/4672">#4672</a>) and here we are at .NET 8 and this VERY BASIC thing remains unfixed. <a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/davidortinau/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/davidortinau">@davidortinau</a> I know I have been critical of the lack of desktop support and I do applaud your efforts in shoring up this deficiency in the latest releases, but how long do we have to wait for the most basic MAUI stuff to work properly?</p>
<p dir="auto">When I open a window that has frames, it almost NEVER draws correctly. You have to resize the window to force a layout recalculation for things to correct themselves. Here is a picture of an app that has a flyout strip and it never draws correctly until a window resizes:</p>

<p dir="auto">I reported this almost 2 years ago and you (David) even added comments to the original issue: Controls/Layout does not draw controls correctly in first-time view. <a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1137585916" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/dotnet/maui/issues/4672" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/dotnet/maui/issues/4672/hovercard" href="https://github.com/dotnet/maui/issues/4672">#4672</a></p>
<p dir="auto">It has been in the backlog ever since and I would think that something that makes a MAUI app look like total s&amp;#t would be a concern of the MAUI team.</p>
<p dir="auto">Also, I reported the fact that easy controls like Switch cannot have its basic colors changed (at least at the time I reported the issue: There is no way to set the text color of a Switch control <a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1315936359" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/dotnet/maui/issues/8965" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/dotnet/maui/issues/8965/hovercard" href="https://github.com/dotnet/maui/issues/8965">#8965</a>). Gerold V just took it upon himself to close my issue by telling me, in essence, we are not going to do stuff like this. I should go write platform-specific code. That's ridiculous because what is platform-specific about the Switch control??? In WPF EVERYTHING was stylable... Why is it the responsibility of the development community to do your work by writing handlers and such to get something simple to work?</p>
<p dir="auto">Also, take a look at the screenshots above. Notice the minimize, maximize, and close buttons are double-drawn. How does this stuff pass QA??????</p>
<p dir="auto">I am getting ready to roll this out to 2000 perspective users and I will not be proud of 99.99999% of the app because of the visual aspects of MAUI. I looked at UNO and Avalon back when I was deciding to go cross-platform and I decided to stick with Microsoft all the way for everything: .NET, MAUI, gRPC, ASPNETCORE, etc... I wanted the whole stack to be Microsoft, but I am ruing my decision... MAUI is great in concept, but not in implementation. Simply upgrading Xamarin to MAUI did not buy the community much in the whole product delivery. You guys have focused far too much effort on sapping milliseconds out of performance while glaring visual bugs persist. I think 90% of the attention should be placed on fixing bugs and performing better QA. I know stuff breaks from release to release and I would think that decent regression testing would catch stuff like this. I also think you guys need to look at WPF and figure out how to achieve the functionality that existed there before developing new stuff. I would love a WYSIWIG XAML editor so we can see what we are designing without having to run the app. This brings me to Hot Reload which RARELY works! It does work on straight XAML, but not XAML in templates. I see it work there, but as I said, rarely.</p>
<p dir="auto">I have been a developer since 1984 and have focused much of my career on UI design. WinForms was great and WPF was even greater. MAUI isn't even making the charts... I sometimes spend hours trying to get something that was easy in WPF to work in MAUI and that is time I don't have...</p>
<p dir="auto">Yes, this rant is probably misplaced here in the issues log, but how else can somebody truly vent their frustrations about developing with MAUI? I spoke via a TEAMS meeting early last year with both David and Maddy and I let my opinions be known then. Here it is almost two years later, and nothing is even slightly easier to develop in MAUI... I would love for David to be made aware of this "issue" and have him contact me directly. This doesn't even scratch the surface of my frustrations...</p>
<p dir="auto">I really want to talk to <a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/davidortinau/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/davidortinau">@davidortinau</a> directly. Please pass this on to him.</p>

All that, of course, in a project where the founders and the first generation of developers moved on and fled ?</p><p>Guess !</p><h2 id="degrading-basic-features">Degrading basic features<a href="#degrading-basic-features" title="Permanent link to this section"><i></i></a></h2><p>The 2020’s are 40 years too late to re-invent interaction paradigms between user and computer, being it how we use a keyboard and a mouse to drive the interface or the behaviour of a file browser. Since the 1980’s, all the general-audience computer appliances have converged toward more or less unified semantics, where the <kbd>escape</kbd> key closes the current application, double-click opens files and the mouse wheel scrolls the current view. Darktable<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> takes an ill-placed pleasure to ignore all that and the recent changes worsen things : it is now mandatory to read the documentation to achieve tasks as simple as sorting files or assigning keyboard shortcuts to GUI&nbsp;actions.</p><h3 id="module-groups">Module groups<a href="#module-groups" title="Permanent link to this section"><i></i></a></h3><p>Everything begins with the overhaul of the <a href="https://docs.darktable.org/usermanual/4.0/en/darkroom/organization/manage-module-layouts/" title="" target="_blank">modules groups</a>, in 2020, which hides the decision of <a href="https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/pull/5322" title="" target="_blank">not deciding</a> of an unified module order.</p><p><img src="https://ansel.photos/posts/module-groups.jpg" alt=""></p><p><a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/darktable-dev@lists.darktable.org/msg03402.html" title="" target="_blank">Since 2018</a>, I fight to clean up the graphical interface of Darktable, and in particular the module organization. A&nbsp;graphical interface should promote best practices by laying out tools in the typical order they should be used. Bad practices are those which increase the risk of colorimetric inconsistencies or of circular editing, where one must go back to repercute changes made later, even though bad practices can work in simple cases. In the context of image processing, highly-technical task where a lot of things are hidden to the end-users beneath the GUI, best practices also enable poorly-qualified persons to use the software in a way that reduces the probability of mistakes.</p><p>This order of using is mostly dictated by technical considerations like the order of application of modules in the pipeline sequence and the use of drawn and parametric masks, which effect depends on upstream modules. Ignoring these considerations is equivalent to looking for trouble, even though the hot trend in the 2010’s and 2020’s is to believe that digital technologies work detached of any material reality for the sole happiness of the user.</p><p>For example, the constrained imposed upon the pipeline design to allow an arbitrary order of module use <a href="https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/pull/8673" title="" target="_blank">creates mathematically unsolvable problems</a> regarding the computation of mask nodes coordinates, and no programmed solution is possible (aside from relaxing that constraint) because maths said no.</p><p>Except that a significant part of the programmer-users revolving around the project on Github and on the dev mailing-list stay convinced that there is no good or bad workflow, only personal preferences, which is probably true when you practice an art without time constraint, budget constraint or result constraint. As such, modules should be able to be reordered at will, being in the pipeline or in the workflow. The confusion comes from the fact that non-destructive editing is wrongfully seen as asynchronous (which would <em>almost</em> be the case if we didn’t use masks nor blending modes) whereas the pixel pipeline is sequential and closer to a layer logic, as we find it in Adobe Photoshop, Gimp, Krita, etc.</p><p>Decoupling the modules order in the GUI&nbsp;from the pipeline order is equivalent to enabling every use, even pathological, and forces to write <a href="https://docs.darktable.org/usermanual/4.0/en/darkroom/pixelpipe/the-pixelpipe-and-module-order/#changing-module-order" title="" target="_blank">pages and pages</a> of documentation to warn, explain what to do, how and why ; documentation that nobody will read to end up asking in loop the same questions every week on every forum.</p><p>In this story, everyone looses their time thanks to an interface design trying to be so flexible that it can’t be made safe and robust by default. In the human body, every joint as <em>some</em> degrees of freedom along certains axes ; if every joint could revolve 340 ° around each axis of the 3D space, the structure would be instable for being too flexible, and unable to work with high loads. The metaphor holds in industry software. We swim in the FLOSS <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult" title="" target="_blank">cargo cult</a>, where people love to have the illusion of choice, that is being offered many options of which most are unusable or dangerous, at the expense of simplicity (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle" title="" target="_blank">KISS</a>), and where the majority of users don’t understand the implications of each option (and don’t have the slightest desire to understand).</p><p>In the absence of a consensus over the interface module ordering, a complicated tool, brittle and heavy was introduced at the end of 2020 to allow each user to configure the layout of modules in tabs. It provides many useless options and stores the current layout in the database, using the translated name of modules, meaning changing the UI language makes you loose your presets. Entirely configurable, it lets user decide how to harm themselves, without any best practices guide. This garbage is coded with 4000 lines <a href="https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/blob/darktable-4.2.x/src/libs/modulegroups.c#L3499-L3616" title="" target="_blank">cheerfully mixing SQL requests in the middle of interface GTK code</a>, and presets are created through <a href="https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/blob/darktable-4.2.x/src/libs/modulegroups.c#L1533-L1768" title="" target="_blank">redundant compiler macros</a>, whereas modules have had a <a href="https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/blob/darktable-4.2.x/src/iop/borders.c#L196" title="" target="_blank">binary flag</a> forever, allowing to set their default group… modularly.</p><p>More important, it replaces a simple and efficient feature, available until Darktable 3.2 :</p><p><img src="https://ansel.photos/posts/more-modules.png" alt=""></p><p>One click over the module name enables it, a second adds it to the column of favorites, a third hides it from the interface. Everything allowing presets and storing the current layout in simple text into the <code>darktablerc</code> file. Simple and robust, <a href="https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/blob/darktable-3.2.x/src/libs/modulegroups.c" title="" target="_blank">coded over 688&nbsp;lignes</a> of legible and well-structured code, the feature was therefore not amusing enough for the middle-aged dilettante developer, and it was urgent to replace it by a labyrinthine system.</p><h3 id="keyboard-shortcuts">Keyboard shortcuts<a href="#keyboard-shortcuts" title="Permanent link to this section"><i></i></a></h3><p>In 2021 has been added what I call the great MIDI <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turducken" title="" target="_blank">turducken</a>. The goal is to extend the interface of keyboard shortcuts (already extended in 2019 to support “dynamic shortcuts”, allowing to combine mouse and keyboard actions), to support MIDI&nbsp;devices and… video game controllers.</p><p>At the end of 2022, that is one and half year after this feature, in the <a href="https://www.poll-maker.com/S-Quiz-Results?qp=2539714x3792Bf5e-98#" title="" target="_blank">survey I&nbsp;conducted</a>, less than 10 % of users own a MIDI&nbsp;device, and only 2 % use it with Darktable. To compare with the 45 % of users who own a graphic tablet (Wacom-like), which support in Darktable is still so flawed that only 6 % use it. Notwithstanding the poor priority management, what I&nbsp;don’t tolerate here is the edge effects introduced by this change and the global cost it had, starting with the fact that it doesn’t import user-defined shortcuts from versions ealier than 3.2, and it makes the configuration of new shortcuts terribly complicated.</p><p>Before the great turducken, only a limited list of GUI actions could be mapped to keyboard or mixed (keyboad + mouse) shortcuts. This list was manually curated by developers. The great MIDI&nbsp;turducken allows to map <em>every</em> GUI&nbsp;actions to shortcuts, presenting users with a list of several thousands of configurable entries, in which it’s difficult to find the only 3 you really need, and the text search engine is too basic to be helpful :</p><p><img src="https://ansel.photos/posts/shortcuts.png" alt=""></p><p>Note the use of “effects”, on which the <a href="https://docs.darktable.org/usermanual/4.0/en/preferences-settings/shortcuts/" title="" target="_blank">documentation</a> is of no help. It’s only by deduction (<a href="https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/blob/master/src/gui/accelerators.c#L101-L164" title="" target="_blank">because the code is not commented either</a>) that I&nbsp;ended up understanding they are emulations of typical desktop interactions (mouse and keyboard) destined to be used with MIDI&nbsp;devices and gamepad controllers (but you still need to explain to me what <code>Ctrl-Toggle</code>, <code>Right-activate</code> or <code>Right-Toggle</code> mean in terms of typical destkop interaction).</p><p>What is unacceptable is that the use of the numeric keypad is broken <a href="https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/issues/10628#issuecomment-994795922" title="" target="_blank">by design</a>, noticeably to attribute numbered ratings (stars) to thumbnails in lighttable. Indeed, the key modifiers (numlock and capslock) are not properly decoded by the thing, and numbers are treated differently whether they are input from the typical “text” keyboard or from the numeric keypad. So the <code>1</code> from the numpad is decoded <code>Keypad End</code>, no matter the state of the numlock. This is how I&nbsp;had to configure number shortcuts on a French BÉPO keyboard and to duplicate the configuration for the numpad :</p><p><img src="https://ansel.photos/posts/shortcuts-broken.png" alt=""></p><p>You just have to remember that <code>Shift+"</code> and <code>Kp End</code> both mean <code>1</code> and remember to duplicate all shortcuts for the numpad and the rest of the keyboard.

Hunting bugs in this shithole is sewer’s bottom archaelogy, all the more considering that Darktable does not have a developer documentation and, in the absence of meaningful comments in the code, any modification of the aforementionned code will necessarily start with a reverse-engineering phase becoming harder and harder as time goes by.</p><p>The true problem of this kind of code is that you can’t improve it without rewriting it more or less entirely : to fix it, you first need to understand it, but the reason why it needs to be fixed is precisely that it’s not understandable and dangerous long-term. We call that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt" title="" target="_blank">technical debt</a>. In short, all the work invested on this feature will create extra work because it is unreasonable to keep that kind of code in the middle of a code base of several hundreds of thousands of lines and expect it to not blow up in our face one day.</p><p>It’s all the more ridiculous in the context of an open-source/free application where the bulk of the staff is non-trained programmers. Clever developers write code understandable by idiots, and the other way around.</p><h3 id="collection-filters">Collection filters<a href="#collection-filters" title="Permanent link to this section"><i></i></a></h3><p>Until Darktable 3.8, the collection filters, at the top of the lighttable, were used to temporarilly restrict the view on a collection. The collection is an extraction of the photo database based on certain criteria, the most common being extracting the content of a folder (which Darktable calls “filmroll” to confuse everybody, because a filmroll is actually a folder’s content displayed as a flat list instead of a tree - many people wrongfully thing that Darktable has no file manager).</p><p>Having been a Darktable user for more than a decade, I&nbsp;have a database of more than 140.000 entries. Extracting a collection among these 140.00 pictures is a slow operation. But my folders rarely contain more than 300 pictures. Filtering, for example, the pictures rated 2 stars or more, in a collection of 300 files, is fast because it is a subset of 300 elements. And switching from a filter to another is fast too. The filter is only a partial or total view of a collection, optimized for a fast and temporary start-and-go usage.</p><p>Under the pretense of refactoring the filtering code, which took all in all <a href="https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/blob/darktable-3.6.x/src/libs/tools/filter.c" title="" target="_blank">550 lines</a>, the chief <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaston_%28comics%29#Props,_inventions_and_other_running_gags" title="" target="_blank">Gaston Lagaffe</a> made it a vocation to break this model to turn collection filters into basic collections, by mean of <a href="https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/tree/darktable-4.2.x/src/libs/filters" title="" target="_blank">more than 6.000 lines of code</a>, not counting the countless bugfixes that only added more lines<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.

Many users still haven’t understood the difference 4 years later. We therefore have the default view (file manager), the zoomable lighttable (that nobody uses), the static culling, the dynamic culling, and the preview mode (a single full-screen picture).</p><p>Then, more display options are added to thumbnails in lighttable, allowing to define overlays : basic permanent overlays, extended EXIF permanent overlays, the same but only on hover, and finally the timed hovered overlays (with a configurable timer).</p><p>The UI code rendering thumbnails and their overlays must therefore take into account 5 different views and <a href="https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/blob/darktable-4.2.x/src/dtgtk/thumbnail.h#L38-L48" title="" target="_blank">7 display variants</a>, that is 35 possible combinations.

How bad is it ? I had the idea of measuring the CPU&nbsp;use of my system when idle, with the Linux tool <code>powertop</code>. The protocol is quite simple : a laptop (CPU&nbsp;Intel Xeon Mobile 6th generation), working on battery in powersave mode, backlighting set to minimum, open the app and touch nothing for 4 min, then monitor the global CPU&nbsp;consumption of the system as reported by <code>powertop</code> during the 5th minute :</p><ul><li>Base system (no app opened except for <code>powertop</code> runing in a terminal) : <strong>3.0 to 3.5 % CPU</strong></li><li>Ansel :<ul><li>opened on lighttable : <strong>2.9 to 3.4 % CPU</strong>,</li><li>opened on darkroom : <strong>3.8 to 4.5 %</strong> (before reverting module groups to Darktable 3.2),</li><li>opened on darkroom : <strong>3.0 to 3.5 %</strong> (after reverting module groups),</li></ul></li><li>Darktable :<ul><li>opened on lightable : <strong>6.6 to 7.1 % CPU</strong>,</li><li>opened on darkroom : <strong>30.9 to 44.9 % CPU</strong> <em>(no, it’s not a coma mistake)</em>,</li></ul></li></ul><p>I don’t understand what Darktable computes when we leave it open without touching the computer, because there is nothing to compute. Darktable in lighttable consumes by itself as much as the whole system (Fedora 37 + KDE desktop + password manager and Nextcloud client running in background), and it consumes 10 times as much as the whole system when opened in darkroom.</p><p>All this points towards very buggy graphical interface code. In Ansel, I removed a great part of the dirty code, without optimizing anything else, and these figures are only validating my choice : dirty code hides problems undetectable by reading it, and we simply can’t continue on this path.</p><p>I’m apparently the only one thinking it’s unacceptable to deprive the pixel pipeline of a third to a half of the CPU&nbsp;power to paint a stupid interface.

Yet the fact that the manpower in open-source projects doesn’t ask for compensation should not hinder the fact that the time spent (lost ?) on the software, its use, its development, its maintenance, is in itself a non-refundable cost.</p><p>The few examples above give an overlook of the complexification of the source code, but also of its degradation over time in terms of quality, because basic and robust features get replaced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code" title="" target="_blank">spaghetti code</a>, confusing and sneakily bugged. Behind this issue of legibility, the real problem is making the mid-term maintainability harder, which promises a gloomy future for the project, with the maintainer’s approval.</p><p>Since 4 years that I&nbsp;work full-time on Darktable, 2022 is the first year that I&nbsp;find myself practically unable to identify the cause of most interface bugs, because the working logic has become very obfuscated and the code incomprehensible.

The ratios of pull requests (actual work done) versus issues closed (actual problems solved) is simply ridiculous.</p><p>Between Darktable 3.0 and 4.0, the GUI code grew by 53 %, from 49 k to 75 k lines<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> (discarding comments and white lines), and reached 79 k lines in 4.4. Letting the poor quality of it aside, I’m really not sure it improved the usability of the software by 53 %. In fact, I’m quite convinced of the contrary. In Ansel, I&nbsp;have so far reduced the GUI&nbsp;code to 53 k lines while removing little functionnality.</p><p>All this is just too much too fast for a bunch of hobbyists working on evenings and week-ends without structure and planning. The Darktable team works against itself by trying to bite more than it can chew, supporting too many different options, producing code which outcome depends on too many environment variables, being able to interact in too many different ways. All that to avoid making design decisions that could offend some guys by limiting features and available options. On the end-user side, this results in contextual bugs impossible to reproduce on other systems, so impossible to fix at all.</p><p>It’s simple : the work done costs more and more work, and the maintenance is not assured, as the decline of closed issues shows, because it’s simply too much. In a company, this is the time where you need to stop the bleeding before having emptied the vaults. But a team of amateurs bound to deliver no result can sustain an infinite amount of losses. Only the work created by the work is more tedious, frustrating and difficult as time goes by, and end-users are taken hostage by a gang of self-serving pricks and will pay it in terms of GUI&nbsp;complexity, needless CPU load, and need to relearn how to achieve basic tasks with the software at least once a year.</p><p>Actually, I’m expecting the current mass-destruction team to conveniently find less and less freetime to contribute to the project as they realize they trapped themselves in a one-way with a tractor-trailer, leaving their shit to the next ones. But the sooner they give up, the less damage they will cause.</p><p>The debauchery of options and preferences, which is the Darktable go-to strategy to (not) manage design disagreements, creates super contextual use cases where no user has the same options enabled and where it’s impossible to reproduce bugs in a different environement. And to ask users to attach the <code>darktablerc</code> configuration file to bug reports would not help either since that file has currently 1287 lines practically unlegible.</p><p>Weird and hardly reproduceable bugs pile up, even on <a href="https://system76.com/" title="" target="_blank">System 76</a> computers designed specifically for Linux, where we can’t invoke drivers issues. Many inconsistent and random bugs I have witnessed while giving editing lessons are not listed on the bug tracker, and it’s rather clear that they lie somewhere in the intricacies of the <code>if</code> and <code>switch case</code> debauchery that are added at an alarming rate since 2020.</p><p>Fixing these strange and contextual bugs can only be made by simplifying the control flow of the program and therefore by limiting the number of user parameters. But the pack of geeks flapping their arms on the project won’t hear about it and, worse, the bug “fixes” generally only add more lines to deal with pathological cases individually.</p><p>In fact, Darktable suffers several issues :</p><ol><li>An hard core of rather mediocre developers who have a lot of free time on their hands to do random stuff, driven by the best intents in the world but oblivious of the damages they make, (mediocre people are always the more available)</li><li>The complacency of the maintainer, who lets dirty code through to be nice,</li><li>A critical lack of skills in pure mathematics, algorithmics, signal processing, color science and generally in abstract thinking, which are required beyond pixel processing code to simplify and factorize features,</li><li>A&nbsp;despicable habit of “developing” by copy-pasting code fetched elsewhere in the project or in other FLOSS projects that may used a different pipeline architecture but without adapting it accordingly (adapting implies understanding, and that’s too much to ask…),</li><li>A fair and square refusal to prune features to make room to new ones and keep a certain balance,</li><li>A sampling bias, where the only users interacting with the development through Github are programmers and English-speaking. Fact is the general audience doesn’t understand what a code forge is and it’s difficult to encourage non-programmers to open a Github account to report bugs. We are talking of a users sample <a href="https://eng.aurelienpierre.com/2023/01/who-are-the-darktable-users/#Conclusion-of-this-part" title="" target="_blank">made of more than 44 % of programmers</a> and of more than 35 % of university-graduated people (they are respectively 6 % and 15 % in the general population).</li><li>A forced-march development style, without planning or dialogue, where every Github user can pollute discussions with a non-educated opinion on current work. Fact is image processing looks easy and is harmless, so much so that any person able to compute a logarithm feels competent. But the fundamental mistakes in Darkable colorimetry chain are there to remind us everday of the contrary.</li><li>A lack of project-wise priorities regarding what features to refactor, stabilize or extend : all projects are open at the same time, even if they conflicts with each other.</li><li>An amount of activity (emails and notifications) impossible to follow, between comments, off-topic discussions, bugs that are not, code change proposals, actual code changes that may impact your own work in progress, which means you have to be all over the place all the time ; there is a lot to read, very little to keep, discussion for the sake of discussion hinders productivity and the lack of working structure is the main cause of all that,</li><li>Non-blocking bugs hastily hidden before we are done understanding them, instead of fixing them for real and tackling them at their root, which moves or even aggravates issues long-term without leaving traces into any kind of documentation,</li><li>A release schedule that we keep no matter the price even when it’s not realistic, whereas nobody imposes it upon ourselves,</li><li>Code changes that can happen anytime anywhere, meaning we work on quicksand and that we have to work as fast and as bad as the others to not be left behind the volume and frequency of the changes (<em>commits</em>),</li><li>New features that degrade usability and complicate usage without solving a definite problem, that serves as recreational projects to developers untrained in design/engineering.</li></ol><p>But the most infuriating is this obstinacy to replace simple and functional features with horrors of over-engineering destined to please deviant and marginal uses while making everybody’s life more difficult with never-ending lists of thoughtless options. The best place to hide a tree is in the middle of the forest, and many still haven’t learned it.</p><h2 id="mistaking-agitation-with-activity">Mistaking agitation with activity<a href="#mistaking-agitation-with-activity" title="Permanent link to this section"><i></i></a></h2><p>Any elector likes to criticize the deviance that, in politics, consists in issuing circumstancial laws, ill-written, to appease the public opinion after a special event, to show off that we act, while similar laws already exist and are not or not fully applied for lack of means. We call that agitation : this looks like action, this sounds like action, this has the cost of action, but that leads to nothing tangible or practical.</p><p>The team of amateurs without project management getting agitated over Darktable produces only future problems. In the past, Darktable was released once every year with around 1500 to 2000 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commit_%28version_control%29" title="" target="_blank">commits</a> ahead of the previous version. That’s now the volume of change achieved in 6 months. A “work” volume increasing that fast without leading to teamwork methods, including clear priorities for each release and task repartition, and without software quality control based on objective metrics (number of steps or elapsed time to achieve a particular task), it’s only dudes stepping on each other’s feet while pushing their own agenda with no care for others, nor the project, nor users.</p><p>Darktable has become the highschool computer club, where geeks have their fun. It’s globally a sum-up of all the worst stories of IT companies, with the difference that the project doesn’t make a penny, which makes it urgent to ask ourselves why we impose that upon ourselves : there are no profits to share, but everybody shares the costs. It’s a chaotic and toxic working environment which would only manufacture burn-out if the part-time amateurs were bound to deliver results and had to work full-time. Being the only full-time dude on it, I let you imagine the amount of stress and lost energy to stay up-to-date with the permanent cacophony, only to be sure to not miss the 2 % actually relevant to me in the amount of noise produced by unregulated discussions.</p><p>On the user side, we praise the effervescence of the Darktable project (yes, there is motion), without realizing that the commits runaway is not activity but agitation, and in particular technical debt which will have to be paid we-don’t-know-when by we-don’t-know-who. The beauty of a project where nobody has to take responsibility for their horseshit because nobody is accountable for nothing : it’s written in the GNU/GPL license. We can therefore screw up the work of the previous ones with total impunity.</p><p>We have the beginning of a quality control, through the integration tests, which measure the perceptual error over reference image processings, but they don’t trigger any response when we see an average error delta E of 1.3 (small) when the nature of the change should have a strictly zero delta E. If <strong>the only</strong> test passes (because we test a single SDR image over a studio shot), no question is asked on whether the theory is sound and robust. We turned the test into a discharge, as long as the metric stays under the validation threshold…</p><p>With the release of Darktable 4.0 —&nbsp;<em>Geektable</em>&nbsp;—, I saw on Youtube people starting to complain that this release was not very exciting. After years of dosing people with superlative releases, packed with new features we don’t have time to properly test (6-8 guys who piss 38-50 k lines every 6 months while working only evenings and week-ends, you still dreaming ?), we made them addict to the overpacked Christmas Tree to ensure that, the day we start being responsible and releasing stable versions (thus boring), that will be held against us.</p><p>The reason for this frenetic release pace is the pull requests older than 3 monthes are systematically in conflict with the master branch, given that this one is shaken every month for “generalized tests”. But the rare users who build the master branch have no idea what they need to test in particular, unless the dissected the commit history of Git, which implies to understand both the C language and the impact of the changes in practice on the software.</p><p>To limit long-lived branches, which will invariably end in conflict with the master, we found a brilliant solution : we release 2 versions each year, making forced-march development based on unfinished and barely-tested code a way of life, without ever realizing that the core problem is first the lack of planning, but also that contributors start coding before being done defining the problem to solve (when there is a real problem to solve, not just a guy who woke up like “it would be cool if…”), working in parallel on both parts without communication.</p><p>The dust doesn’t have time to settle that we are already shaking the code base again, without enforcing stabilisation phases where we only clean-up bugs (and I’m not talking of the month of feature-freeze prior to release, but of releases dedicated only to code cleaning). The bug tracker implodes in the 3 weeks following each release, because a significant part of users only uses the pre-built packages, which coincide with Christmas and Summer hollidays, where I&nbsp;personnaly have better things to do after the already-stressful sprint that is the month prior to release.</p><p>Since 2021, when I update my Git repository with the last changes of Darktable master, it’s always asking myself what they broke <strong>this time</strong>. We break faster than we fix, and most of the time, the fixes break something else. The only users finding Darktable stable are actually the ones making a very basic use of it, which is ironical for an app whose selling point is to be advanced.</p><p>And then, I’m being served the fact that it’s free work as if it was an excuse. But it is actually an aggravating circumstance : why do we impose such working conditions upon ourselves if it’s not even profitable ??? In addition to the fact that this free work gives me a post-release burn-out per year, it costs more and more in maintenance and the maintenance is more and more despicable to do. It’s not free work, it’s worse : it’s work that costs without paying.</p><p>Anyway, the work is provided by people who have limited time and energy. If the resource is limited, cut the bullshit : we are in the same profitability constraints as a business, minus social contributions, except our exchange money is time and it’s not refundable. Without priority management, we will get overtaken by technical debt that we will not have the resource to maintain.</p><h2 id="what-are-we-waiting-for-to-be-happy">What are we waiting for to be happy ?<a href="#what-are-we-waiting-for-to-be-happy" title="Permanent link to this section"><i></i></a></h2><p>The fact that Darktable is a steamroller in runaway mode and without a driver, which generates an increasing amount of work, is a bad smell for a 15 years-old project. Normally, a mature project slows-down because it’s complete enough to be usable and because people working on it found their cruising speed and efficient working methods.</p><p>I’m full-time on it since 2018, for a monthly income between 800 and 900 €, and it’s an understatement to say that it’s ill-payed to endure the desastrous consequences of disorganized amateurs trying to have their fun at the expense of the quality of the final product and its usability by computer Muggles. Besides, Muggles are despised too, as a principle.</p><p>If I’m crawling under a rock for a month to develop a perceptual color space, when I&nbsp;get out, it’s to discover the new labyrinthine system violating a bit more the view-model-controller paradigm and being told that I&nbsp;come too late to oppose it. If I&nbsp;take 3 weeks of vacation in August, it’s to discover that the maintainer bypassed (one more time) my review on a mathematical change over the aforementionned color space, which requires to sit down calmly and think, all this because… we needed to move fast ? For what emergency, exactly ?</p><p>I probably got the notification somewhere in the middle of the 2234 emails Github sent me between January and August 2022 (in 2021, it was 4044), without mentionning users who ping me everywhere, on Youtube, Reddit, Matrix, Github, Telegram, directly by emails, and previously on pixls.us (693 emails in 2022, 948 in 2021). All this for people completely out of step who don’t realize that I’m doing this all week, that photography may be their hobby but is my job, and that I&nbsp;would just appreciate people off my back during week-ends and hollidays. You can guess that the most annoying are not the ones financially supporting my work. People respect work only if they got billed an high price for it.</p><p>I don’t have time to be researcher, designer, on top of secretary, while doing technical baby-sitting for a team of Gaston Lagaffe who need both to be trained and to be watched because they are unable to :</p><p>1. make a development planning with a list of priorities of new features to work on,
2. provide a specicifications book of needs and issues, with a real use case, <strong>before</strong> hurrying up on their code editor and doing whatever to develop a new feature in search for a problem to solve.
3. evaluate the maintenance cost of the change before inventing the bionic bacon pump using reversed osmosis which only works on even days if Jupyter is out of phase with Saturn,
4. limit the expenses and cut down the losses when they trap themselves into design one-ways introducing regressions worse than the hypothetical benefits expected,
5. take upon themselves and delay a release if the code is obviously not ready (or I&nbsp;didn’t understand anything and the shareholders will ask for our heads if we release late ???).</p><p>Management (or team management) is overhead that costs some work, but the Darktable team has reached a scale where the lack of management costs actually more work, especially since none of the project founders are still in the team and the initial design blueprints need to be reverse-engineered with <code>grep</code> in the code everytime something needs change. That was sustainable with a reduced team where everybody knew each other, but Darktable has become an high-traffic project during Covid lock-downs and this way of working is not sustainable with current personnel.</p><p>Just go see the code ! Compare the branche <code>darktable-2.6.x</code> with <code>darktable-4.2.x</code>, file by file, and enjoy !</p><p>All I have heard so far are canned sentences like “it’s like many other opensource projects” and “there is nothing we can do about it”. People are afraid by the amount of work that a fork is (I&nbsp;got emails trying to convince me it was dividing productivity), without realizing the amount of resources currently wasted by the Darktable project and the permanent stress of having to base your work on an unstable code base shaken up all the time. So far, Ansel cost me less fatigue <a href="https://ansel.photos/en/doc/special-topics/from-darktable/" title="">and I&nbsp;solved a significant number of problems</a> among which some were reported since 2016 without signs of interest from the bloody “community”.</p><p>Besides, Ansel provides automatically-built nightly packages for Linux (.AppImage) and Windows (.exe), as to allow <strong>real</strong> generalized tests, including by people unable to build the software themselves. <a href="https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/issues/3925" title="" target="_blank">I&nbsp;asked for that back in 2019</a>, but apparently, geeks have better things to do, and I had to invest 70 h myself to make that happen. The operation is already a success and allowed to fix in a matter of days Windows bugs that would have taken weeks to spot in Darktable. (And Darktable grabbed 3 weeks later my AppImage build script without proper credits, but that’s a detail).</p><p>Talking about productivity, let us recall that the lighttable was rewritten almost entirely twice since 2018 (and the last version is not better nor faster) and the big change if collection filters introduced in <a href="https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/pull/11066" title="" target="_blank">April 2022</a> has overwritten another similar change (but only using 600 lines instead of 6000) introduced in <a href="https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/pull/10694" title="" target="_blank">February 2022</a> (the February version is the one in Ansel). We can’t decently utter the word “productivity” when the work of one contributor litterally erases previous work of another’s in a timeframe of one month, for simple lack of project management. It’s called stepping on each other’s feet.</p><p>So what are we doing to solve the issue ? Suffering in silence ? Living in denial ? Keeping on fixing stuff that another one will break in the next year when we will not be watching ? Keeping on making the Muggle believe, at photo forum length, that opensource is just as good as proprietary, while keeping as joker the fact that it’s free so you get no right to complain ? Isn’t that a bit too easy and dishonest, this double speech ?</p><p>Wouldn’t you like to stop making habits pass as experience and mistaking fatalism with wisdom, but rather tackle the problem at its core ? Don’t you think that you and me deserve better than software designed by amateurs whose sole talent is to have spare time and can afford to work for free since they moved to management and the kids are off to the university ?</p><p>Or I got mistaken since the beginning, and opensource is about giving over-complicated tools to geeks who don’t really need them, while trying to convince the rest of the world that open-source is not an hyper-niche for developers ?</p><h2 id="4-years-of-work-to-get-there">4 years of work to get there<a href="#4-years-of-work-to-get-there" title="Permanent link to this section"><i></i></a></h2><p>After 4 years of working on Darktable full-time for 70 % of minimal wage, and 2 years bearing the chronic dissatisfaction of staining my name by contributing to shit, I&nbsp;forked Ansel and will not go back.</p><p>In 4 years, I&nbsp;brought to this software something that sorely lacked : an unified workflow, based on a set of modules <strong>designed</strong> to work together, but acting each on a distinct aspect, where Darktable modules were rather a collection of disparate plugins. We are talking about :</p><ul><li>filmic,</li><li>tone equalizer,</li><li>the physically-accurate blurs module,</li><li>both versions of the color balance,</li><li>color calibration, including the GUI to profile with color checkers straight in darkroom and the white balancing using CIE standards,</li><li>the negadoctor module to invert film negatives based on Kodak Cineon,</li><li>the diffuse and sharpen module for addition and removal of blur based on thermal diffusion,</li><li>the guided laplacian reconstruction of highlights.</li></ul><p>I also developed more fundamental tools providing bases for the previous modules :</p><ul><li>a 4th order anisotropic partial differential equations solver in wavelets space for diffuse and sharpen,</li><li>an adaptation of the predious as the guided laplacian for RGB signal reconstruction by gradients propagation,</li><li>a perceptual color appearance model taking the Helmholtz-Kohlrausch effect into account in the saturation computation, to limit the “fluo” effect that typically comes with intense saturation settings, in color balance,</li><li>a theoritical help in developing the exposure-invariant guided filter (EIGF), in tone equalizer,</li><li>a linear vector equations solver by Choleski method,</li><li>various interpolation methods of order 2, 3 and radial-based.</li></ul><p>In the GUI, I notably did :</p><ul><li>refactor style declaration, removing styling from C code to map them to the CSS stylesheet, allowing to have multiple themes for the UI, including user-defined ones,</li><li>introduce the preview mode <a href="https://docs.darktable.org/usermanual/4.0/en/module-reference/utility-modules/shared/focus-peaking/" title="" target="_blank">focus-peaking</a> and <a href="https://docs.darktable.org/usermanual/4.0/en/module-reference/utility-modules/darkroom/color-assessment/" title="" target="_blank">ISO 12&nbsp;646 color assessment mode</a>,</li><li>introduce the color vocabulary <a href="https://docs.darktable.org/usermanual/4.0/en/module-reference/utility-modules/darkroom/global-color-picker/" title="" target="_blank">in the global color picker</a>, allowing to name the picked color from its chromaticity coordinates, targetting color-blind photographers.</li></ul><p>After this, I&nbsp;wrote dozens of documentation pages in 2 languages, published articles and dozens of hours of video on YouTube to demonstrate how to use modules, in what context and for what benefit, including quick edits using only 3 to 5 modules to process 75 to 80 % of pictures, no matter their dynamic range. In the open-source world, except perharps for projects backed-up by foundations (like Krita and Blender), this level of support and documentation simply doesn’t exist, and it’s not the developers themselves who handle this work.</p><p>Despite all this, I never had more than 240 donators, to compare with roughly 1800 unique respondents <a href="https://eng.aurelienpierre.com/2023/01/who-are-the-darktable-users/#Conclusion-of-this-part" title="" target="_blank">who participated in the 2020 and 2022 Darktable surveys</a>, and who declare spending <a href="https://www.poll-maker.com/S-Quiz-Results?qp=2539714x3792Bf5e-98#" title="" target="_blank">between 500 and 1000 €/an</a> on photography.</p><p>I will not watch them destroy the usability of this software while trying to convince myself that it’s progress and there is nothing we can do about it. Instead of progress, it’s the delusional vision of progress by a bunch of fifty-something dilettantes. It’s been 2 years that I shut up patiently, trying to be nice, but looking at the degradation of base features, complexified to comply with the fads of mad programmers, I should have been despicable earlier.

<p>Seven years ago, the largest civil engineering project in Europe broke ground in France. Now, it is finally taking shape. Here’s what it will mean for the City of Light.</p>
<hr>

<p>Whether or not people realize it, the contours of greater Paris are being redrawn beneath their feet. In France, they’re calling it the “construction site of the century.” And that’s not a stretch.</p>

<p>The new Paris métro, formally titled Grand Paris Express (GPE), will more than double the territory encircling France’s capital city with over 120 miles of new tracks, four new underground lines and 68 new metro stations. The idea is to better connect distant Paris suburbs to the city and to each other—and in so doing, improve the commercial viability of its connected neighborhoods, business districts and municipalities.</p>


<p>By 2030, it is expected to transport at least 2 million passengers daily, shifting the entire Île de France region away from cars toward clean public transportation. There is undeniably a huge environmental cost for construction on this scale. But, once in operation, the project is expected to become a very <a href="https://www.societedugrandparis.fr/worksites/environment" target="_blank" title="https://www.societedugrandparis.fr/worksites/environment" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.societedugrandparis.fr/worksites/environment" aria-label="powerful saver of carbon">powerful saver of carbon</a>, which is in part why <a href="https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/2022/12/grand-paris-express-wins-2023-veronica-rudge-green-prize-in-urban-design/" target="_blank" title="https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/2022/12/grand-paris-express-wins-2023-veronica-rudge-green-prize-in-urban-design/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/2022/12/grand-paris-express-wins-2023-veronica-rudge-green-prize-in-urban-design/" aria-label="Harvard University awarded">Harvard University awarded</a> the Grand Paris Express the 2023 Veronica Rudge Green Prize in Urban Design, recognizing “design that transforms cities and the lives of its inhabitants in unanticipated and extraordinary ways.”</p>
<figure role="presentation"><figcaption><fbs-accordion current="-1"><p>The Villejuif Institut Gustave-Roussy station is located in the Hautes-Bruyères park to the South of <span data-ga-track="caption expand">... [+]</span><span> Paris. It runs 164 feet deep.</span></p></fbs-accordion><small>© Michel Denancé. Dominique Perrault Architecte, ADAGP 2021</small></figcaption></figure>

<p>Of course, this has been years in the making. Construction began in 2016, five years after then-President Nicholas Sarkozy called for its implementation in a <a href="https://www.elysee.fr/front/pdf/elysee-module-12316-fr.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://www.elysee.fr/front/pdf/elysee-module-12316-fr.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.elysee.fr/front/pdf/elysee-module-12316-fr.pdf" aria-label="national address">national address</a> extolling the virtues of the new metropolis: “We want to rebuild the city on top of the city, remove the divide between Paris and its suburbs, reduce the divides which separate the neighborhoods, which separate the inhabitants, we want to restore unity, continuity and solidarity.”</p>

<p>His vision has survived three presidential administrations, despite running years late and billions <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-france-economy/massive-paris-metro-expansion-may-be-12-billion-euros-over-budget-audit-idUKKBN1F51VY/" target="_blank" title="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-france-economy/massive-paris-metro-expansion-may-be-12-billion-euros-over-budget-audit-idUKKBN1F51VY/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-france-economy/massive-paris-metro-expansion-may-be-12-billion-euros-over-budget-audit-idUKKBN1F51VY/" aria-label="over-budget">over-budget</a>. Costs have since reached €36 billion ($39 billion), according to <a href="https://www.societedugrandparis.fr/investing" target="_blank" title="https://www.societedugrandparis.fr/investing" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.societedugrandparis.fr/investing" aria-label="the Société du Grand Paris">the Société du Grand Paris</a> (Grand Paris Society), the state-owned infrastructure agency Sarkozy tasked with designing and implementing the project. Originally, it was meant to open in time for the Paris Summer Olympics in 2024.</p>


<p>Like other major transportation projects, delays seem inevitable. (We Manhattanites are still waiting for the completion of the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/second-avenue-subway-expansion-phase-2-east-harlem-biden-infrastructure-law/" target="_blank" title="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/second-avenue-subway-expansion-phase-2-east-harlem-biden-infrastructure-law/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/second-avenue-subway-expansion-phase-2-east-harlem-biden-infrastructure-law/" aria-label="multi-billion 2nd Avenue">multi-billion 2nd Avenue</a> subway, an epic urban tale of only one line, not four.) But Paris is another story. The world-wide exposure that comes with hosting the Olympics has put significant pressure on the Grand Paris Society to deliver the goods. Of the 68 stations, 40 are already underway, and they’re hustling to unveil the first new station hub at Orly Airport by June 2024.</p>
<h2>But First, A Museum Exhibit!</h2>
<p>In classic French style, culture comes first. This November, to educate the public, the architecture museum at Trocadéro, <a href="https://www.citedelarchitecture.fr/en" target="_blank" title="https://www.citedelarchitecture.fr/en" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.citedelarchitecture.fr/en" aria-label="Cité de l’architecture et du Patrimoine">Cité de l’architecture et du Patrimoine</a>, has unveiled a new exhibition titled “<a href="https://www.citedelarchitecture.fr/fr/agenda/exposition/metro-le-grand-paris-en-mouvement" target="_blank" title="https://www.citedelarchitecture.fr/fr/agenda/exposition/metro-le-grand-paris-en-mouvement" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.citedelarchitecture.fr/fr/agenda/exposition/metro-le-grand-paris-en-mouvement" aria-label="Métro! Le Grand Paris en mouvement">Métro! Le Grand Paris en mouvement</a>” running now through June 2, 2024.</p>
<p>It’s a breath of fresh futurism, taking space inside a monument to the past. The museum itself looks like something out of an Ayn Rand novel, a stone shrine glorifying centuries of French architecture, and with it the masterminds of the métropole. Grand Paris Express introduces new members into this elite club, heralding a new era of urban planning.</p>
<p>Co-commissioned by modernist architect Dominique Perrault and architectural critic Francis Rambert, the exhibition introduces visitors to the new map of ‘Greater Paris’ beyond its inner-city landscape, and invites them to reflect on the idea of a modern city and how its structure might engender new realities for its inhabitants. Consider it a future of cities master class in how a dense, spoken-for landscape becomes capable of moving 12 million people.</p><figure role="presentation"><figcaption><fbs-accordion><p>Architect Dominique Perrault in his Paris office. </p></fbs-accordion><small>© Alexandre Tabaste. Dominique Perrault Architecte. ADAGP, 2019 </small></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sitting in his firm’s glass-encased conference room in the 11th arrondissement, surrounded by models of districts yet-to-come, Perrault explained: “This infrastructure is very important because it changes the relationship between different parts of the metropole, connecting new railway stations with new districts. We are creating the double surface of Paris. The goal is to create a new skeleton, with the capacity and power to become a new structure for the metropole.”</p>
<p>Perrault Architecture has designed two integral sites for the Grand Paris network, one directly to the south of the city-center called <a href="https://www.societedugrandparis.fr/ligne-14-15/gare-villejuif-gustave-roussy" target="_blank" title="https://www.societedugrandparis.fr/ligne-14-15/gare-villejuif-gustave-roussy" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.societedugrandparis.fr/ligne-14-15/gare-villejuif-gustave-roussy" aria-label="Villejuif-Gustave Roussy">Villejuif-Gustave Roussy</a> station, as well as the Paris 2024 Athletes' Village to the north, which will erect 2,400 housing units and supporting facilities that link directly to the Saint-Denis-Pleyel station designed by Kengo Kuma in the suburb where France’s Olympic stadium is located.</p>
<p>The Villejuif-Gustave station is under construction within Hautes-Bruyères park, connecting Line 14 directly to the entrance of Europe’s leading oncology hospital, the <a href="https://www.gustaveroussy.fr/en/institute" target="_blank" title="https://www.gustaveroussy.fr/en/institute" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.gustaveroussy.fr/en/institute" aria-label="Gustave-Roussy Institute">Gustave-Roussy Institute</a>. Anticipated in 2025, the station’s opening will mark a major milestone, in that it introduces a wildly ambitious take on underground architecture — it runs about 164 feet deep — creating a massive, multi-level cylinder of open-air space bathed in natural light, by using a novel system of light boxes to illuminate space where there was only darkness.</p><figure role="presentation"><figcaption><fbs-accordion><p>A view from below. Villejuif-Gustave Roussy station in France. </p></fbs-accordion><small>© Michel Denancé. Dominique Perrault Architecte. ADAGP, 2021</small></figcaption></figure>
<p>It is a passion project for Perrault, who has set out to prove the viability of one of the deepest transportation infrastructures in France. “The ground and the territory below it, with its geography and its landscapes, offers the promise of extraordinary potential, and a possible response to the seemingly unsolvable questions raised by urban density,” writes Perrault in “Groundscapes” (2016), a book exploring the potential and possibility of subterranean architecture.</p>
<p>The Villejuif-Gustave station will also feature its own custom artwork, created by Chilean artist Ivan Navarro, who works with light and optical illusions. It is titled “Cadran Solaire,” resembling a starry sky made up of 60 illuminated boxes integrated into the ceilings at the exit of the platforms. Each of these boxes bears the name of a celestial body, playing on the concept of passage and giving the illusion of depth.</p>
<p>It’s a fantastic combination of art and architecture that is planned similarly for each and every one of the 68 stations, which must also technically coordinate with the existing SNCF Réseau commuter rail and RATP metro networks. But the ambition doesn’t stop there.</p>
<h2><strong>Form Meets Function </strong></h2>
<p>Early on, the Grand Paris Society decided to allocate a portion of its budget, roughly 35 million euros, to commission contemporary art for each station — creating a vast, connected gallery, made available to everyone with a subway ticket.</p>
<p>In practice, that means select teams of architects, engineers and artists are now working together not just to connect trains — but to reimagine metro stations as culturally relevant, public spaces. “In the 19th century, we had Hector Guillmard who designed the iconic art nouveau entrances of the Paris métro for all the stations. For GPE, we want to have a unique architecture for each urban context, because each community is very different. Our co-design program creates a real dialogue for each station,” said Pierre-Emmanuel Becherand, head of architecture, design and culture at Société du Grand Paris.</p>
<p>The station at Orly Airport, for example, tapped Portuguese artist <a href="https://www.culturenouveaumetro.fr/gare-aeroport-dorly-vhils-francois-tamisier" target="_blank" title="https://www.culturenouveaumetro.fr/gare-aeroport-dorly-vhils-francois-tamisier" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.culturenouveaumetro.fr/gare-aeroport-dorly-vhils-francois-tamisier" aria-label="Alexandre Farto">Alexandre Farto</a>, a.k.a. VHILS to work with French architect François Tamisier and design a monumental mural for the new space. Spanning 16 meters long and 12 meters high, it comprises 11,000 individual pieces of azulejos (traditional Portuguese ceramic tiles) depicting inhabitants’ faces blended into the fabric of the city as if each forms the identity of the other.</p><figure role="presentation"><figcaption><fbs-accordion><p>A mural of 11,000 porcelain tiles at Orly Airport, by artist Vhils.</p></fbs-accordion><small>Gare Aéroport d'Orly. Vhils Studio &amp; François Tamisier</small></figcaption></figure>
<h2><strong>The Politics Of Progress </strong></h2>
<p>Who benefits is a going concern. Perrault is the first to admit the project is “totally political.” Because it will directly serve specific constituents with low-cost transportation. With the same ticket, passengers will be able to take the new métro, change to a bus, then hop on a train to get where they need to go. It practically eliminates the need for a car, which has clear socio-economic and environmental benefits. So, who decides which neighborhoods to serve? And which firms land the contracts?</p>
<p>“The process is complex; the money comes from the state. And the state is more or less the architect of policy. On the other hand, you have two actors; one actor is the city of Paris, and then you have the regions. Mayors might have opinions about outcomes. But ultimately, it’s the state,” he adds, candidly. That tracks. Each person serving on Société du Grand Paris's Management Board was appointed by decree of the French president. Now, the public is demanding answers.</p>
<p>There have been significant delays and setbacks since the project was conceived, and now even the taxi drivers in Paris roll their eyes at mere mention of the subject. What’s worse, there have been five <a href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/conjoncture/grand-paris-express-pourquoi-le-chantier-du-siecle-est-il-si-meurtrier-20230407" target="_blank" title="https://www.lefigaro.fr/conjoncture/grand-paris-express-pourquoi-le-chantier-du-siecle-est-il-si-meurtrier-20230407" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.lefigaro.fr/conjoncture/grand-paris-express-pourquoi-le-chantier-du-siecle-est-il-si-meurtrier-20230407" aria-label="fatal accidents">fatal accidents</a> that occurred on Grand Paris Express construction sites. These accidents undermine the Société du Grand Paris, which had ensured worker safety was a priority.</p>
<p>Not all inner-city residents are happy about the project. Many fear increased violence and destruction by “les casseurs” (thugs) of hallowed ground will come with easy access into Paris. At Orly airport this month, a local retired couple declined to be named yet immediately blamed Macron for the project. “He’s letting everyone in. They don’t work, and live off our social support. Get out.”</p>
<p>Despite the naysayers, mobility and sustainability are the macro themes that will come to define the future of cities. As host of the 2024 Olympics, the city has no choice but to expand and modernize. And it will be richly economically rewarded for doing so. The new metro is like a tree; from its strong base, an extraordinary system of branches can grow. It will help develop new connections, foster investment, and allow for the circulation of both people and ideas.</p>
<p>For a city so exquisitely shaped by the past, Paris has found a way to shape its future.</p>

<p><b>Blogger</b> is a blog hosting service. On February 23, 2015, they announced that "sexually explicit" blogs would be restricted from public access in a month. But soon they withdrew their plan, and said they wouldn't change their existing policies.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>  In 2019, Google <a href="https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/Google_Plus_Comments_on_Blogspot" title="Google Plus Comments on Blogspot">removed Google+ comments placed on Blogger blogs</a>. In May 2020, Blogger announced a redesign of their on their <a rel="nofollow" href="https://blogger.googleblog.com/">official blog</a>, and posted <a rel="nofollow" href="https://support.google.com/blogger/thread/71956466">weekly updates on their community support forum</a> in August and September 2020. This redesign covered most of the Blogger experience, but pages related to user profiles, following blogs, cookie management, video management, and classic-style blog widget management still use the old Blogger design. No updates to Blogger have been documented since September 2020. Google has also moved away from Blogger for their own company blogs. For these reasons, Blogger may be at risk of shutting down.
</p><p>In May 2023, Google announced that inactive accounts would be deleted starting on <span title="2023-12-01">2023-12-01</span> across their platform, including Blogger blogs.
</p><p>Archive Team did a discovery between February and May 2015, but did not begin downloading actual content until November 2023.
</p>


<h2><span id="Strategy">Strategy</span></h2>
<p>Find as many <a rel="nofollow" href="http://foobar.blogspot.com/">http://foobar.blogspot.com</a> domains as possible and download them. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://archive.org/details/all_blogger_subdomains">Here is a full list</a> (as of February 2020) and a new list can be generated with <a href="https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/User:Trumad" title="User:Trumad">these instructions</a>. Otherwise, manual discovery can be attempted. Blogs often link to other blogs, which will help, so each individual blog saved will help discover others. Also a small-scale crawl of Blogger profiles (e.g. http://www.blogger.com/profile/{random number up to 35217655}) will provide links to blogs authored by each user (e.g. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/5618947">https://www.blogger.com/profile/5618947</a> links to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://hintergedanke.blogspot.com/">http://hintergedanke.blogspot.com/</a>) - Although note that this does not cover ALL bloggers or ALL blogs, and is merely a starting point for further discovery.
</p><p>Another strategy is to scrape Blogspot sites from Blogger profiles and vice versa (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://transfer.archivete.am/RAiXa/archive-blogspot.sh">example script</a>) and you will get an almost ever-expanding list. There will be captchas to deal with though, so you may need to distribute the scraping. There is <a rel="nofollow" href="https://transfer.archivete.am/XWpXt/blogspot.com-blogs.txt">a list</a> of blogs discovered using this method.

<h2><span id="How_to_help_if_you_have_lists_of_URLs">How to help if you have lists of URLs</span></h2>
<p>This project requires lists of URLs for content on the target website. If you have a source of URLs, please:
</p>
<ol><li>Use the regular expression <code>\S+\.(blogspot|blogger)\.\S+</code> for filtering.
<ul><li>Note that this regex is intentionally broad to cover many different URL formats. Please do not try to use a more narrow pattern as it may miss valid URLs. We can always filter or transform the results as needed later.</li>
<li>If you use <code>grep</code>, remember to include the <code>-a</code> (aka <code>--text</code> on GNU grep) option to ensure it will continue searching for matches when encountering binary data.</li>
<li>Example command (GNU grep): <code>grep -Pahoi '\S+\.(blogspot|blogger)\.\S+' FILENAME FILENAME...</code></li></ul></li>
<li>If the output exceeds a few megabytes, please compress it, preferably using <code>zstd -10</code>.</li>
<li>Upload the file to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://transfer.archivete.am/">https://transfer.archivete.am/</a>.</li>
<li>Share the resulting URL in the project IRC channel.
<ul><li>If you would like to keep the list non-public instead, e.g. for privacy reasons or for not wanting to be publicly associated with it, please get in touch with a channel op (e.g. <a href="https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/User:Arkiver" title="User:Arkiver">arkiver</a> or <a href="https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/User:JustAnotherArchivist" title="User:JustAnotherArchivist">JustAnotherArchivist</a>).

        <p>James Bond films have a certain formula to them. It is more interesting when seen from the perspective of the villain.</p><p>He has long been adjacent to money and power, but craves more. Several years ago, he successfully escaped his low-on-the-ladder job at an existing institution. He built a base of power that is independent of institutions. From it, he successfully puppets any organization he needs to. He and his organization are from elsewhere, everywhere, all at once. They have no passport and fly no flags; these concepts are thoroughly beneath them. They move around frequently and are always where the plot requires them to be, exactly when it requires them to be there. No law constrains them. Governments scarcely exist in their universe. To the limited extent they come to any government’s attention, no effective action is taken. The villain rises to the heights of influence and power.</p><p>This continues <em>for years</em>.</p><p>Then we suddenly hear E minor major 9. We begin the film, telling the end of the story, mostly from Bond’s perspective. The villain is just another weirdo who dies at the climax in act three.</p><h2 id="life-imitates-art">Life imitates art</h2><p><a href="https://x.com/patio11/status/979137571211980800?s=20">For</a> <a href="https://x.com/patio11/status/1337474851938811905?s=20">years</a> I have used the phrase “<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Apatio11%20bond%20villain%20compliance%20strategy&amp;src=typed_query" rel="noreferrer">Bond villain compliance strategy</a>” to describe a common practice in the cryptocurrency industry.&nbsp;</p><p>In it, your operation is carefully based Far Away From Here. You are, critically, not like standard offshore finance, with a particular address in a particular country which just happens to be on the high-risk jurisdiction list. You are <em>nowhere</em> because you want to be <em>everywhere</em>. You tell any lie required to any party—government, bank, whatever—to get access to the banking rails and desirable counterparties located in rich countries with functioning governments. You abandon or evolve the lie a few years later after finally being caught in it.</p><p>Your users and counterparties understand it to be a lie the entire time, of course. You bragged about it on your site and explained it to adoring fans at conferences. You created guides to have your CS staff instruct users on how to use a VPN to evade your geofencing. The more clueful among your counterparties, who have competent lawyers and aspirations to continue making money in desirable jurisdictions, will come to describe your behavior as an “open secret” in the industry. They will claim you’ve turned over a new leaf given that the most current version of the lie only merely rhymes with the previous version of the lie.</p><p>And then we begin the third act.</p><p>So anyhow, Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao (known nearly universally as CZ) have recently <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/binance-and-ceo-plead-guilty-federal-charges-4b-resolution">pleaded guilty</a> to operating the world’s largest criminal conspiracy to launder money, paying more than $4 billion in fines. This settles a long-running investigation involving the DOJ, CFTC, FinCEN, and assorted other parts of the U.S. regulatory state. Importantly, it does not resolve the SEC’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-101">parallel</a> <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-101.pdf">action</a>.</p><p>How’d we get here?</p><h2 id="a-brief-history-of-binance">A brief history of Binance</h2><p>Binance is, for the moment, the world’s largest crypto exchange. Its scale is gobsmacking and places it approximately the 100th largest financial institution in the world by revenue. The primary way it makes money is exacting a rake on cryptocurrency gambling, in particular, leveraged bets using cryptocurrency futures. To maintain its ability to do this, it runs a worldwide money laundering operation with the ongoing, knowing, active participation of many other players in the crypto industry, including Bitfinex/Tether, the Justin Sun empire, and (until recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/11/02/business/sam-bankman-fried-trial">changes in management</a>) FTX/Alameda.</p><p>In his twenties CZ worked in Japan (<em>waves</em>) and New York for contractors to the Tokyo Stock Exchange then Bloomberg. In about 2013 he got interested in crypto and then joined a few projects, including becoming CTO of OKCoin, another Bond villain exchange. Being a henchman is an odd job, so he decided to promote himself to full-fledged villain. In 2017 he did an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/10/05/how-binance-turned-its-failed-token-ico-into-a-billion-dollar-windfall/?sh=71b70fce529b">unregistered securities offering</a> (then commonly spelled “ICO”) for Binance.&nbsp;</p><p>Binance rose meteorically from then until recently, essentially gaining share at the expense of waning Bond villains. To <em>oversimplify greatly</em>, it carved up the less-regulated side of the crypto market with FTX, with Binance mostly taking customers in geopolitical adversaries of the U.S. (most notably greater China) and FTX mostly taking them in geopolitical allies (most notably, South Korea, Singapore, and the U.S.). But the cartels did not partition the globe in a way which fully insulated them from each other.</p><p>These operations were intertwined and coordinated. How intertwined? Binance was a part-owner of FTX until SBF decided successfully capturing U.S. regulators was a lot more likely if his cap table named more Californian trees and fewer Bond villains. How coordinated? The name of the Signal chat was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/rivals-worried-sam-bankman-fried-tried-to-destabilize-crypto-on-eve-of-ftx-collapse-11670597311">Exchange Coordination</a>.</p><p>This eventually led to grief as CZ (mostly accurately) perceived SBF was <a href="https://www.agriculture.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Testimony_Bankman-Fried_0209202211.pdf">using</a> the U.S. government as a weapon against Binance. He retaliated by <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/02/divisions-in-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-blur-on-his-trading-titan-alamedas-balance-sheet/">strategic leaking</a>, leading to a collapse in the value of FTX's exchange token, a run on the bank, and FTX's bankruptcy.</p><h2 id="where-was-binance-in-all-of-this"><em>Where</em> was Binance in all of this?</h2><p>Binance did a heck of a lot of business in Japan in the early years. This <em>officially</em> ended in March 2018 when the Financial Services Agency, Japan’s major financial regulator, made it <a href="https://www.fsa.go.jp/policy/virtual_currency02/Binance_keikokushilyo.pdf">extremely clear</a> that Binance was operating unlawfully in serving Japanese customers without registering in the then-relatively-new framework for virtual currency exchange businesses.</p><p>As an only-sometimes-following-crypto skeptic, this was the thing which brought Binance to my attention. Binance was piqued, saying that they had engaged the FSA in respectful conversations and then learned they were being kicked out of the country from a news report. Having spent roughly twenty years getting good at understanding how Japanese bureaucratic procedures typically work, I <a href="https://x.com/patio11/status/979137571211980800?s=20">surmised</a>&nbsp; “...that is a very plausible outcome if you start your getting-to-know-you chat with ‘Basically I am a James Bond villain.’” I think that was the first time the metaphor came to me.</p><p>The order expelling them listed their place of business as Hong Kong, with a dryly worded asterisk stating that this was taken from their statements on the Internet and “...there exists the possibility that [this information] is not accurate as of the present moment in time.”</p><p>That, Internets, is how a salaryman phrases “I am <em>absolutely</em> aware that you maintain a team and infrastructure in Japan.”</p><p>Did Binance exit Japan? Well, that depends. Did CZ personally return to Japan? Probably not. Does Binance continue to serve Japanese customers? Yes, though (Bond villain!) it pretends not to. Where does Binance’s exchange run as a software artifact? As a statement of engineering fact: in an AWS data center in Tokyo. ap-northeast-1, if you want to get technical.</p><p>&nbsp;(Someone needs to write an East Asian studies paper on how Tokyo became Switzerland for Asian crypto enthusiasts due to a combination of governance, network connectivity, latency, and geopolitical risk. I nominate anyone other than me.)</p><p>Binance also maintained an office in Shanghai, with many executives working there. It was raided by the Chinese police. Binance <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-denies-police-raids-very-existence-of-shanghai-offices"><em>denied</em></a><em> that the office existed</em>. The spokesman’s quote was pure Bond villain: “The Binance team is a global movement consisting of people working in a decentralized manner wherever they are in the world. Binance has no fixed offices in Shanghai or China, so it makes no sense that police raided on any offices and shut them down.”</p><p>This was a lie wrapped around a tiny truth. Internet-distributed workforces containing many mobile professionals do not <em>exactly</em> resemble a single building with all your staff and your nameplate on the door.</p><p><em>Of course, </em>on the actual substantive matter, it was a lie.</p><p>We know it was a lie, because (among many other reasons) we have the chat logs where the parts of their criminal conspiracy that operated in the U.S. complain that the parts of their criminal conspiracy that operated in Shanghai kept information from them that they needed to do their part to keep the crime operating smoothly. Coworkers, man.</p><p>Binance’s Chief Compliance Officer, one Samuel Lim, apparently is not a fan of The Wire and never encountered <a href="https://youtu.be/Ly82nabRRYc?si=51Zj1oyocxvq5t7S&amp;t=75">Stringer Bell’s dictum</a> on the wisdom of keeping notes on a criminal conspiracy. He writes great copy, most memorably “[We are] operating as a fking unlicensed security exchange in the U.S. bro.” He and many other Binance employees have helpfully documented for posterity that their financial operations teams were, for most of corporate history, working from Shanghai.</p><p>Binance also operated in the state of Heisenbergian uncertainty, sometimes known as Malta. Malta has a substantial financial services industry, which <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/finance-crypto-currency-binance/special-report-crypto-giant-binance-kept-weak-money-laundering-checks-even-as-it-promised-tougher-compliance-documents-show-idUSL8N2U065F/">welcomed Binance with open arms</a> in 2018 and then <a href="https://www.mfsa.mt/news-item/public-statement-2020/">pretended not to know him</a> in 2020. This continues Malta’s proud tradition of strategic ambiguity as to whether it is an EU country or rentable skin suit for money launderers. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqgSO8_cRio"><em>¿Por qué no los dos?</em></a> Despite this, Binance would continue claiming to customers and other regulators for a while that it was fully authorized to do business by Malta.</p><p>Binance operates in Russia, to enable its twin businesses of cryptocurrency speculation and facilitating money laundering. In 2023 it <a href="https://www.euronews.com/business/2023/09/28/worlds-largest-crypto-exchange-sells-russian-business#:~:text=Binance%20is%20selling%20its%20Russian,CommEX%2C%20a%20newly%20launched%20exchange.">pretended to sell its Russian operations</a>.</p><p>Binance operated in <em>many</em> jurisdictions. The U.K.: <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/consumer-warning-binance-markets-limited-and-binance-group">kicked out</a>. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-giant-binance-struggles-in-europe-82154b13">France</a>: <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/crypto/binance-probed-by-france-for-alleged-illegal-practices">under investigation</a>. Germany, the Netherlands, etc, etc, they required non-teams of non-employees at non-headquarters to keep track of all the places they weren’t registered doing their non-crimes.</p><p>A core cadre of the Binance executive team is currently in the United Arab Emirates, where CZ hopes to return. He professes that he will await sentencing there, and pinkie swears that he will totally get back on a plane to the U.S. to show up to it. For reasons which are understandable by anyone with more IQ than a plate of jello, the U.S. <a href="https://www.ccn.com/news/binances-cz-considered-flight-risk/">is skeptical</a> he will make good on this promise, and is currently, as of Thanksgiving 2023, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.328570/gov.uscourts.wawd.328570.34.0.pdf">attempting</a> to keep him in the U.S. He is physically present to sign what Binance advocates believe is the grand compromise to put all his legal worries behind them.</p><p>A defining characteristic of Bond villains is that they think they are very smart and everyone else is very stupid. To be fair, when you play back the movie of the last few years of their life, they keep winning and their adversaries look like nincompoops.</p><p>Then, they get extremely confident and begin to make poor life choices.</p><h2 id="how-did-this-work-for-so-freaking-long">How did this <em>work</em> for so freaking long?</h2><p>Much like the <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/optimal-amount-of-fraud/">optimal amount of fraud is not zero</a>, the global financial system institutionally tolerates (and <em>actively enables</em>) some shenanigans at the margin. You can think of Binance, Tether, FTX, and all the rest as talented amateurs capable of engaging the services of professionals. They followed advice and grew like a slime mold into the places where shenanigans are wink-and-a-nudge tolerated.</p><p>Why tolerate shenanigans? Some shenanigans are necessary to keep the world spinning.</p><p>China has grown into an economic superpower via capitalism while also at times officially having private property ownership be illegal. That circle cannot be squared. We, the global we, want Chinese people to not live in grinding poverty. That requires economic growth. Economic growth required making things the world wanted. Selling those things required integration into the global economic order. <em>That</em> required a willingness to ignore things the Communist dictatorship said were crimes, while simultaneously saying “Oh, bankers definitely, definitely shouldn’t facilitate billionaires committing crimes.”</p><p>As I’ve remarked previously, we similarly have complicated preferences with regards to Russian oligarchs. In some years, money laundering for them is, how might a gifted speaker phrase this, “[b]ringing our former adversaries, Russia and China, into the international system as open, prosperous and stable nations.” In other years, money laundering for them is described as funding Russia’s war machine.</p><p>Finance is messy because the world is messy.</p><p>Some of the shenanigans aren’t strictly necessary or planned, but society considers an expenditure of effort required to curtail them to be wasteful or to compromise our other goals. We had all the technology required to CC regulators on every banking transaction years before slow database enthusiasts decided all transactions would eventually be publicly readable and persisted forever. We simply chose not to implement it. It would have been quite expensive and infringed on the privacy of many ordinary people and firms.</p><p>But Binance, and others, forgot the critical step, to the annoyance of their engaged professionals: you have to eventually stop growing and keep to a low profile. You have to simply be content with being fantastically rich. If you do, you can continue showing up to the nicest parties in New York, owning expensive real estate in London, and commuting to a comfortable office in Hong Kong or the Bahamas or many other places.</p><p>But crypto kept growing until the control systems could not ignore them any longer. And the control systems cannot continue to avoid knowledge of the crimes.</p><p>So, so many crimes. Many of them are what crypto advocates consider as utterly inconsequential, like serially lying on paperwork. And also Binance gleefully and knowingly banked terrorists and child pornographers. That’s not an allegation; that has been confessed to. There is no line a Bond villain will not cross. They will cross them <em>performatively</em>.</p><p>And, surprising even me, some crypto characters <em>consciously adopt the aesthetic</em> of Bond villains. Le Chiffre, the villain in Casino Royale, owns a fictional house. That house exists in the physical world, where a location scout said “This certainly looks like the sort of place a Bond villain would live.” Jean Chalopin owned that literal, physical house. (c.f. Zeke Faux’s Number go Up, Kindle location 1175.) As <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/a-review-of-number-go-up-on-crypto-shenanigans/">previously discussed</a>, Chalopin is a professional bagman, and his largest client was previously Tether.</p><h2 id="what-happens-to-binance-now">What happens to Binance now?</h2><p>Some believe that Binance admitting to being a criminal conspiracy is actually good news, not merely in the memetic “good news for Bitcoin” sense, but because this upper-bounds Binance’s exposure somewhere below “The United States forcibly dismantles the most important crypto exchange and much of the infrastructure it touches.”</p><p>The immediate consequences are about $4 billion in fines. Despite being <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/us-attorney-announces-historic-336-billion-cryptocurrency-seizure-and-conviction">one of the world’s largest hodlers</a>, the U.S. will not accept payment in Bitcoin, and Binance has agreed to pay in installments over the next two years. CZ and Binance will be sentenced in February.</p><p>Some people think the grand bargain was to avoid him getting imprisoned. The actual text of the agreement says that Binance gets to walk away from some parts of it if he is sentenced to more than 18 months. (Senior officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/21/technology/binance-changpeng-zhao-pleads-guilty.html">told the NYT</a> they are contemplating asking for more than that.)</p><p>Probably more consequentially, the settlements are going to force Binance to install so-called monitors internally. Those monitors are effectively external compliance consultants, working at the expense of Binance in a contractual relationship with them, but whose true customer is the United States. The monitors have pages upon pages of instructions as to exactly how they are to reform Binance’s culture by implementing recommendations to bring onboarding, KYC, and AML processes into compliance with the law everywhere Binance does business, and sure, that is part of the job.</p><p>But the <em>other</em> part of the job is that they’re an internal gateway to any information Binance has ever had, or will ever have. This can be queried essentially at will by law enforcement, with Binance waiving substantially all rights to not cooperate.</p><p>You might reasonably ask “Hey, doesn’t the U.S. typically require a warrant to go nosing about in the business of people who haven’t been accused of a crime?” And, to oversimplify half a century of jurisprudence, one loses one’s presumption of privacy if one brings a business into one’s private affairs. All of Binance’s customers and counterparties gave up their privacy <em>to Binance</em> by transacting with it. The U.S. <em>has Binance’s permission</em> to examine all of Binance’s historical, current, and future records, at will, for at least the next three years. It also secured a promise that Binance would assist in any investigation.</p><p>And so, if one were hypothetically not yet indicted by the U.S., but one had hypothetically done business with one’s now-confessed money launderer, one’s own Fourth Amendment protections do not protect the U.S. from hoovering up every conversation and transaction with Binance.</p><p>All of this is certainly good news and we can put this messy chapter behind us, say crypto advocates.</p><h2 id="how-are-bond-villains-actually-regulated">How are Bond villains actually regulated?</h2><p>Was the Bond villain strategy <em>ever going to work</em>? Did Binance have a reasonable likelihood of prevailing on jurisdictional arguments, like telling the U.S. that the Binance mothership had no U.S. presence and so it should not be subject to U.S. law? No. Crikey, no. The system has to be robust to people lying or acting from less-salubrious jurisdictions, at least to the extent it cares about being effective, and at least some of the time it does actually care about being effective.</p><p>The U.S.’s point of view on the matter, elucidated at length in any indictment for financial crimes, is that if you have ever touched an electronic dollar, that dollar passed through New York, and therefore you’ve consented to the jurisdiction of the United States. Dollarization is <em>very intentionally</em> wielded like a club to accomplish the U.S.’s goals.</p><p>There exist some not-very-sympathetic people one could point to who ran afoul of this over the years who are still much more sympathetic than Binance. Binance intentionally used the U.S. market and infrastructure to make money. The U.S. was essential to their enterprise. Many peer nations can, and will, make a similar argument.</p><p>Binance had tens of percent of their book of business in the U.S. They were absolutely aware of this, knew that some of those users were their largest VIPs or otherwise important, and took steps to maximize for U.S. usage while denying they served Americans.</p><p>Their engineers didn’t accidentally copy the exchange onto AWS or deploy it to Tokyo by misclicking repeatedly. The crypto industry playbook for doing sales and marketing looks like everyone else’s playbook for doing sales and marketing. They get on planes, present at events, send mail, hire employees (or otherwise compensate agents), open offices, etc etc.</p><p>If having an email address meant you didn’t exist in physical reality anymore, the world would be almost empty.</p><p>CZ personally signed for bank accounts for some of his money laundering subsidiaries at U.S. banks, like Merit Peak and Sigma Chain. The SEC <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/binance-ceos-trading-firm-received-11-bln-via-client-deposit-company-sec-says-2023-06-07/">traced</a> more than $500 million through one of those accounts.</p><p>One major rationale for KYC legislation, as <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/kyc-and-aml-beyond-the-acronyms/">discussed previously</a>, is that it makes prosecuting Bond villains easier. Even if compliance departments at banks are utterly incompetent at detecting Bond villains at signup, having extracted the Bond villain’s signature on account opening documents is very useful to prosecutors a few years down the road. Why have to do hard work quantifying exactly how many engineers work on which days at Binance’s offices in San Francisco when you can do the easy thing and say “Hey, fax me the single piece of paper where the Bond villain signed up for responsibility for all the crimes, please.”</p><p>Why do Bond villains sign for bank accounts in highly regulated jurisdictions? Partly it is because of beneficial ownership KYC requirements to open bank accounts. Partly it is because finding loyal, trustworthy subordinates is very hard if you’re a Bond villain, and Bond villains (sensibly!) worry that if the only name on the paperwork is a henchman, eventually that henchman might say “You know, actually, I would like to withdraw the $500 million I have on deposit with you.”</p><p>(This is why Bond villains frequently have e.g. the mother of their children sign for bank accounts. Bond villains, again, think everyone else is stupid, and that no one will cotton onto this.)</p><p>A subgenre of challenges in people management for Bond villains: you have to hire experienced executives in the United States to run the U.S. fig leaf for your global criminal empire. The people you hire will, by nature, be experienced financial industry veterans who are extremely sophisticated and have access to good lawyers. This combination of attributes is the recipe for being the best in the world at filing whistleblower claims. I expect a few previously executives at Binance U.S. are eventually going to take home the most generous pay packages in the entire financial industry for a few years between 2018 and 2022.</p><p>To make this palatable to the American public, those whistleblower rewards are not courtesy of the taxpayer; they’re courtesy of money seized from previous Bond villains. A portion of Binance’s settlement(s) will go to pay the whistleblowers at <em>the next</em> Bond villain. It’s a circle of life.</p><h2 id="news-that-will-break-shortly">News that will break shortly</h2><p>Different regulators have differing ability to prosecute complex cases, but they basically all have the ability to read simple legal documents. That is one of the things they are best at doing.</p><p>Binance will suffer a wave of tag-along enforcement actions, in the U.S. and globally. Partly this will be for face saving; global peers of the U.S., which Binance has transacted billions of dollars in, will largely not want to signal “Oh we’re totes OK with money laundering for terrorists and child pornographers”, and so they’re going to essentially copy/paste the U.S. enforcement actions. They will then play pick-a-number with Binance’s new management team, who will immediately cave.</p><p>The earliest version of this is probably only weeks away, but Binance will deal with it for years.</p><p>More interestingly, and likely more expensively, the SEC is going to hit Binance like a ton of bricks. They were one of the few regulators which opted out of consolidating with the DOJ’s deal. They think they have Binance dead to rights (they do), and tactically speaking, the deal makes their life even easier. Binance has waived ability to contest some things the SEC will argue. The SEC can now proxy requests for evidence to Binance’s monitors through other federal agencies.</p><p>Binance has had the enthusiastic cooperation of many people who walk in light in addition to their co-conspirators who walk in shadow. Those people, lamentably inclusive of some in the tech industry who I feel a great deal of fellow-feeling for, are going to start cutting off access to Binance. Compliance departments at their corporate overlords, which were either entirely in the dark or willing to be persuaded that a new innovative industry required some amount of flexibility with regards to controls, are (<em>today</em>) having strongly worded conversations which direct people to lose Binance’s number.</p><p>Binance has <em>pre-committed to helping</em> with the efforts to cauterize them from the financial system. They also pre-committed to assisting in, <em>specifically</em>, the investigation of their sale of the Russia business. That investigation will conclude that the sale was a sham (a Bond villain <em>lied</em>?) designed to avoid sanctions enforcement. Ask your friends in national security Washington how well that is going to go over.</p><p>Binance is going to be slowly ground into a very fine paste.</p><p>Many crypto advocates believe the U.S. institutionally wants to see Binance reform into a compliant financial institution. They are delusional. The U.S. is already practicing their lines for the next press conference. This course of action allows them to deflate Binance gradually while minimizing collateral damage, which responsible regulators and law enforcement officials actually do care quite a bit about.</p><p>The U.S. is aware that many high-status institutions and individuals, which are within the U.S.’s circle of trust, actively collaborated with Binance. Most of <em>them</em> will escape serious censure.</p><p>A few examples will be made, especially in cases where it is easy to make an example, because the firm is no longer operating financial infrastructure. This will take ages to happen and be public but relatively quiet, insofar as senior U.S. regulators will not get on TV to make international headlines announcing it. It will be one of the stories quietly dribbled out on a Friday to the notice mostly of people who draft Powerpoint decks for Compliance presentations. If you want a flavor for these, join any financial firm and pay attention during the annual training; you’re stuck going to it, anyway.</p><h2 id="you-seem-a-little-smug-patrick">You seem a little smug, Patrick</h2><p>I’m not breaking out the Strategic Popcorn Reserves yet, but I will admit to a certain amount of schadenfreude here. The world was grossly disordered for many years. It has corrected <em>a relatively small amount</em>.</p><p>We are a nation of laws. I’d support reforming some of them; a lot of the AML/KYC regulatory apparatus harms individuals who have done no wrong. Much is not well-calibrated in terms of societal costs versus occasionally facilitating a Bond villain’s self-immolation.</p><p>However, in the interim, one cannot simply gleefully ignore the laws because the opportunity to do so allows you to become wealthy beyond the dreams of avarice. Even <a href="https://x.com/nic__carter/status/1727090868908396745?s=20">staunch crypto advocates</a> looking at Binance’s conduct see some things they are not happy to be associated with. Not all of the crimes were victimless crimes.</p><p>There exists the possibility that there is some salvageable licit business in crypto. People enjoy gambling. But if you factor out the crime, the largest casino in the world is not that interesting a business relative to the one that Binance et al ran the last few years.</p><p>I do not know if we’ll ever have a world with this scale of crypto businesses without the crime. The crime <em>was the product</em>. An opportunity to transform global financial infrastructure was greatly overstated and <em>has not</em> come to pass. I do not expect this to change.</p>
