<p>The Internet Archive was breached again, this time on their Zendesk email support platform after repeated warnings that threat actors stole exposed GitLab authentication tokens.</p>
<p>Since last night, BleepingComputer has received numerous messages from people who received replies to their old Internet Archive removal requests, warning that the organization has been breached as they did not correctly rotate their stolen authentication tokens.</p>
<p>"It's dispiriting to see that even after being made aware of the breach weeks ago, IA has still not done the due diligence of rotating many of the API keys that were exposed in their gitlab secrets," reads an email from the threat actor.</p>
<p>"As demonstrated by this message, this includes a Zendesk token with perms to access 800K+ support tickets sent to info@archive.org since 2018."</p>
<p>"Whether you were trying to ask a general question, or requesting the removal of your site from the Wayback Machine your data is now in the hands of some random guy. If not me, it'd be someone else."</p>

<p>The email headers in these emails also pass all DKIM, DMARC, and SPF authentication checks, proving they were sent by an authorized Zendesk server at&nbsp;192.161.151.10.</p>
<div>

<p>After publishing this story, BleepingComputer was told by a recipient of these emails that they had to upload personal identification when requesting a removal of a page from the Wayback Machine.</p>
<p>The threat actor may now also have access to these attachments depending on the API access they had to Zendesk and if they used it to <a href="https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/ticket-attachments/#show-attachment" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">download support tickets</a>.</p>
<p>These emails come after BleepingComputer repeatedly tried to warn the Internet Archive that their source code was stolen through a&nbsp;GitLab authentication token that was exposed online for almost two years.</p>
<h2>Exposed GitLab authentication tokens</h2>
<p>On October 9th, BleepingComputer reported that Internet&nbsp;Archive was <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/internet-archive-hacked-data-breach-impacts-31-million-users/" target="_blank">hit by two different attacks at once last week</a>—a data breach where the site's user data for 33 million users was stolen and a DDoS attack by a pro-Palestinian group named SN_BlackMeta.</p>
<p>While both attacks occurred over the same period, they were conducted by different threat actors. However, many outlets incorrectly reported that SN_BlackMeta was behind the breach rather than just the DDoS attacks.</p>
<div>
<figure><img alt="JavaScript alert on Internet Archive warning about the breach" height="300" width="665" data-src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/security/d/data-breaches/w/wayback-machine/js-alert.jpg" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/security/d/data-breaches/w/wayback-machine/js-alert.jpg"><figcaption><strong>JavaScript alert on Internet Archive warning about the breach</strong><br><em>Source: BleepingComputer</em></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>This misreporting frustrated the threat actor behind the actual data breach, who contacted BleepingComputer through an intermediary to claim credit for the attack and explain how they breached the Internet Archive.</p>
<p>The threat actor told BleepingComputer that the initial breach of Internet Archive started with them finding an exposed GitLab configuration file on one of the organization's development servers, <em>services-hls.dev.archive.org</em>.</p>
<p>BleepingComputer was able to confirm that this token has been exposed since at least December 2022, with it rotating multiple times since then.</p>
<div>
<figure><img alt="Exposed Internet Archive GitLab authentication token" height="600" width="860" data-src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/security/attacks/i/internet-archive/gitlab-tokens/gitlab-token.jpg" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/security/attacks/i/internet-archive/gitlab-tokens/gitlab-token.jpg"><figcaption><strong>Exposed Internet Archive GitLab authentication token</strong><br><em>Source: BleepingComputer</em></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The threat actor says this GitLab configuration file contained an authentication token allowing them to download the Internet Archive source code.</p>
<p>The hacker say that this source code contained additional credentials and authentication tokens, including the credentials to Internet Archive's database management system. This allowed the threat actor to download the organization's user database, further source code, and modify the site.</p>
<p>The threat actor claimed to have stolen 7TB of data from the Internet Archive but would not share any samples as proof.</p>
<p>However, now we know that the stolen data also included the API access tokens for Internet Archive's Zendesk support system.</p>
<p>BleepingComputer attempted contact the Internet Archive numerous times, as recently as on Friday, offering to share what we knew about how the breach occurred and why it was done, but we never received a response.</p>
<h2>Breached for cyber street cred</h2>
<p>After the Internet Archive was breached, conspiracy theories abounded about why they were attacked.</p>
<p>Some said&nbsp;Israel did it,&nbsp;the United States government, or corporations in their ongoing battle with the Internet Archive over copyright infringement.</p>
<p>However, the Internet Archive was not breached for political or monetary reasons but simply because the threat actor could.</p>
<p>There is a large community of people who traffic in stolen data, whether they do it for money by extorting the victim, selling it to other threat actors, or simply because they are collectors of data breaches.</p>
<p>This data is often released for free to gain <em>cyber street cred</em><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>increasing their reputation among other threat actors in this community&nbsp;as they all compete for who has the most significant and most publicized attacks.</p>
<p>In the case of the Internet Archive, there was no money to be made by trying to extort the organization. However, as a well-known and extremely popular website, it definitely boosted a person's reputation amongst this community.</p>
<p>While no one has publicly claimed this breach, BleepingComputer was told it was done&nbsp;while the threat actor was in a group chat with others, with many receiving some of the stolen data.</p>
<p>This database is now likely being traded amongst other people in the data breach community, and we will likely see it leaked for free in the future on hacking forums like Breached.</p>
<p><em>Update 10/20/24: Added information about how some people had to upload personal IDs when requesting removal from Internet Archive.</em></p>

                <p>Published by Martin Kleppmann on 08 Feb 2016.</p>
                

                <p>As part of the research for <a href="http://dataintensive.net/">my book</a>, I came across an algorithm called <a href="http://redis.io/topics/distlock">Redlock</a> on the
<a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a> website. The algorithm claims to implement fault-tolerant distributed locks (or rather,
<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a25e/ee836dbd2a5ae680f835309a484c9f39ae4e.pdf" title="Cary G Gray and David R Cheriton. Leases: An Efficient Fault-Tolerant Mechanism for Distributed File Cache Consistency. SOSP 1989">leases</a>&nbsp;[1]) on top of Redis, and the page asks for feedback from people who are into
distributed systems. The algorithm instinctively set off some alarm bells in the back of my mind, so
I spent a bit of time thinking about it and writing up these notes.</p>

<p>Since there are already <a href="http://redis.io/topics/distlock">over 10 independent implementations of Redlock</a> and we don’t know
who is already relying on this algorithm, I thought it would be worth sharing my notes publicly.
I won’t go into other aspects of Redis, some of which have already been critiqued
<a href="https://aphyr.com/tags/Redis">elsewhere</a>.</p>

<p>Before I go into the details of Redlock, let me say that I quite like Redis, and I have successfully
used it in production in the past. I think it’s a good fit in situations where you want to share
some transient, approximate, fast-changing data between servers, and where it’s not a big deal if
you occasionally lose that data for whatever reason. For example, a good use case is maintaining
request counters per IP address (for rate limiting purposes) and sets of distinct IP addresses per
user ID (for abuse detection).</p>

<p>However, Redis has been gradually making inroads into areas of data management where there are
stronger consistency and durability expectations – which worries me, because this is not what Redis
is designed for. Arguably, distributed locking is one of those areas. Let’s examine it in some more
detail.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-you-using-that-lock-for">What are you using that lock for?</h2>

<p>The purpose of a lock is to ensure that among several nodes that might try to do the same piece of
work, only one actually does it (at least only one at a time). That work might be to write some data
to a shared storage system, to perform some computation, to call some external API, or suchlike. At
a high level, there are two reasons why you might want a lock in a distributed application:
<a href="https://research.google.com/archive/chubby.html" title="Mike Burrows. The Chubby lock service for loosely-coupled distributed systems. OSDI 2006">for efficiency or for correctness</a>&nbsp;[2]. To distinguish these cases, you can ask what
would happen if the lock failed:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Taking a lock saves you from unnecessarily doing the same work twice (e.g. some
expensive computation). If the lock fails and two nodes end up doing the same piece of work, the
result is a minor increase in cost (you end up paying 5 cents more to AWS than you otherwise would
have) or a minor inconvenience (e.g. a user ends up getting the same email notification twice).</li>
  <li><strong>Correctness:</strong> Taking a lock prevents concurrent processes from stepping on each others’ toes
and messing up the state of your system. If the lock fails and two nodes concurrently work on the
same piece of data, the result is a corrupted file, data loss, permanent inconsistency, the wrong
dose of a drug administered to a patient, or some other serious problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both are valid cases for wanting a lock, but you need to be very clear about which one of the two
you are dealing with.</p>

<p>I will argue that if you are using locks merely for efficiency purposes, it is unnecessary to incur
the cost and complexity of Redlock, running 5 Redis servers and checking for a majority to acquire
your lock. You are better off just using a single Redis instance, perhaps with asynchronous
replication to a secondary instance in case the primary crashes.</p>

<p>If you use a single Redis instance, of course you will drop some locks if the power suddenly goes
out on your Redis node, or something else goes wrong. But if you’re only using the locks as an
efficiency optimization, and the crashes don’t happen too often, that’s no big deal. This “no big
deal” scenario is where Redis shines. At least if you’re relying on a single Redis instance, it is
clear to everyone who looks at the system that the locks are approximate, and only to be used for
non-critical purposes.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Redlock algorithm, with its 5 replicas and majority voting, looks at first
glance as though it is suitable for situations in which your locking is important for <em>correctness</em>.
I will argue in the following sections that it is <em>not</em> suitable for that purpose. For the rest of
this article we will assume that your locks are important for correctness, and that it is a serious
bug if two different nodes concurrently believe that they are holding the same lock.</p>

<h2 id="protecting-a-resource-with-a-lock">Protecting a resource with a lock</h2>

<p>Let’s leave the particulars of Redlock aside for a moment, and discuss how a distributed lock is
used in general (independent of the particular locking algorithm used). It’s important to remember
that a lock in a distributed system is not like a mutex in a multi-threaded application. It’s a more
complicated beast, due to the problem that different nodes and the network can all fail
independently in various ways.</p>

<p>For example, say you have an application in which a client needs to update a file in shared storage
(e.g. HDFS or S3). A client first acquires the lock, then reads the file, makes some changes, writes
the modified file back, and finally releases the lock. The lock prevents two clients from performing
this read-modify-write cycle concurrently, which would result in lost updates. The code might look
something like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>// THIS CODE IS BROKEN</span>
<span>function</span> <span>writeData</span><span>(</span><span>filename</span><span>,</span> <span>data</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>lock</span> <span>=</span> <span>lockService</span><span>.</span><span>acquireLock</span><span>(</span><span>filename</span><span>);</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>lock</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>throw</span> <span>'</span><span>Failed to acquire lock</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>try</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>var</span> <span>file</span> <span>=</span> <span>storage</span><span>.</span><span>readFile</span><span>(</span><span>filename</span><span>);</span>
        <span>var</span> <span>updated</span> <span>=</span> <span>updateContents</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>,</span> <span>data</span><span>);</span>
        <span>storage</span><span>.</span><span>writeFile</span><span>(</span><span>filename</span><span>,</span> <span>updated</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>finally</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>lock</span><span>.</span><span>release</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Unfortunately, even if you have a perfect lock service, the code above is broken. The following
diagram shows how you can end up with corrupted data:</p>

<p><img src="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2016/02/unsafe-lock.png" width="550" height="200" alt="Unsafe access to a resource protected by a distributed lock"></p>

<p>In this example, the client that acquired the lock is paused for an extended period of time while
holding the lock – for example because the garbage collector (GC) kicked in. The lock has a timeout
(i.e. it is a lease), which is always a good idea (otherwise a crashed client could end up holding
a lock forever and never releasing it). However, if the GC pause lasts longer than the lease expiry
period, and the client doesn’t realise that it has expired, it may go ahead and make some unsafe
change.</p>

<p>This bug is not theoretical: HBase used to <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/enissoz/hbase-and-hdfs-understanding-filesystem-usage" title="Enis Söztutar. HBase and HDFS: Understanding filesystem usage in HBase. HBaseCon 2013">have this problem</a>&nbsp;[3,4]. Normally,
GC pauses are quite short, but “stop-the-world” GC pauses have sometimes been known to last for
<a href="https://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2011/02/avoiding-full-gcs-in-hbase-with-memstore-local-allocation-buffers-part-1/" title="Todd Lipcon. Avoiding Full GCs in Apache HBase with MemStore-Local Allocation Buffers: Part 1. 2011">several minutes</a>&nbsp;[5] – certainly long enough for a lease to expire. Even so-called
“concurrent” garbage collectors like the HotSpot JVM’s CMS cannot fully run in parallel with the
application code – even they <a href="http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/java-garbage-collection-distilled.html" title="Martin Thompson. Java Garbage Collection Distilled. 2013">need to stop the world</a> from time to time&nbsp;[6].</p>

<p>You cannot fix this problem by inserting a check on the lock expiry just before writing back to
storage. Remember that GC can pause a running thread at <em>any point</em>, including the point that is
maximally inconvenient for you (between the last check and the write operation).</p>

<p>And if you’re feeling smug because your programming language runtime doesn’t have long GC pauses,
there are many other reasons why your process might get paused. Maybe your process tried to read an
address that is not yet loaded into memory, so it gets a page fault and is paused until the page is
loaded from disk. Maybe your disk is actually EBS, and so reading a variable unwittingly turned into
a synchronous network request over Amazon’s congested network. Maybe there are many other processes
contending for CPU, and you hit a <a href="https://twitter.com/aphyr/status/682077908953792512">black node in your scheduler tree</a>. Maybe someone
accidentally sent SIGSTOP to the process. Whatever. Your processes will get paused.</p>

<p>If you still don’t believe me about process pauses, then consider instead that the file-writing
request may get delayed in the network before reaching the storage service. Packet networks such as
Ethernet and IP may delay packets <em>arbitrarily</em>, and <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2655736" title="P Bailis and K Kingsbury. The Network is Reliable. ACM Queue 12(7), 2014.">they do</a>&nbsp;[7]: in a famous
<a href="https://github.com/blog/1364-downtime-last-saturday" title="Mark Imbriaco. Downtime last Saturday. 2012">incident at GitHub</a>, packets were delayed in the network for approximately 90
seconds&nbsp;[8]. This means that an application process may send a write request, and it may reach
the storage server a minute later when the lease has already expired.</p>

<p>Even in well-managed networks, this kind of thing can happen. You simply cannot make any assumptions
about timing, which is why the code above is fundamentally unsafe, no matter what lock service you
use.</p>

<h2 id="making-the-lock-safe-with-fencing">Making the lock safe with fencing</h2>

<p>The fix for this problem is actually pretty simple: you need to include a <em>fencing token</em> with every
write request to the storage service. In this context, a fencing token is simply a number that
increases (e.g. incremented by the lock service) every time a client acquires the lock. This is
illustrated in the following diagram:</p>

<p><img src="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2016/02/fencing-tokens.png" width="550" height="200" alt="Using fencing tokens to make resource access safe"></p>

<p>Client 1 acquires the lease and gets a token of 33, but then it goes into a long pause and the lease
expires. Client 2 acquires the lease, gets a token of 34 (the number always increases), and then
sends its write to the storage service, including the token of 34. Later, client 1 comes back to
life and sends its write to the storage service, including its token value 33. However, the storage
server remembers that it has already processed a write with a higher token number (34), and so it
rejects the request with token 33.</p>

<p>Note this requires the storage server to take an active role in checking tokens, and rejecting any
writes on which the token has gone backwards. But this is not particularly hard, once you know the
trick. And provided that the lock service generates strictly monotonically increasing tokens, this
makes the lock safe. For example, if you are using ZooKeeper as lock service, you can use the <code>zxid</code>
or the znode version number as fencing token, and you’re in good shape&nbsp;[3].</p>

<p>However, this leads us to the first big problem with Redlock: <em>it does not have any facility for
generating fencing tokens</em>. The algorithm does not produce any number that is guaranteed to increase
every time a client acquires a lock. This means that even if the algorithm were otherwise perfect,
it would not be safe to use, because you cannot prevent the race condition between clients in the
case where one client is paused or its packets are delayed.</p>

<p>And it’s not obvious to me how one would change the Redlock algorithm to start generating fencing
tokens. The unique random value it uses does not provide the required monotonicity. Simply keeping
a counter on one Redis node would not be sufficient, because that node may fail. Keeping counters on
several nodes would mean they would go out of sync. It’s likely that you would need a consensus
algorithm just to generate the fencing tokens. (If only <a href="https://twitter.com/lindsey/status/575006945213485056">incrementing a counter</a> was
simple.)</p>

<h2 id="using-time-to-solve-consensus">Using time to solve consensus</h2>

<p>The fact that Redlock fails to generate fencing tokens should already be sufficient reason not to
use it in situations where correctness depends on the lock. But there are some further problems that
are worth discussing.</p>

<p>In the academic literature, the most practical system model for this kind of algorithm is the
<a href="http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.852/08/papers/CT96-JACM.pdf" title="TD Chandra and S Toueg. Unreliable Failure Detectors for Reliable Distributed Systems. JACM 43(2):225–267, 1996">asynchronous model with unreliable failure detectors</a>&nbsp;[9]. In plain English,
this means that the algorithms make no assumptions about timing: processes may pause for arbitrary
lengths of time, packets may be arbitrarily delayed in the network, and clocks may be arbitrarily
wrong – and the algorithm is nevertheless expected to do the right thing. Given what we discussed
above, these are very reasonable assumptions.</p>

<p>The only purpose for which algorithms may use clocks is to generate timeouts, to avoid waiting
forever if a node is down. But timeouts do not have to be accurate: just because a request times
out, that doesn’t mean that the other node is definitely down – it could just as well be that there
is a large delay in the network, or that your local clock is wrong. When used as a failure detector,
timeouts are just a guess that something is wrong. (If they could, distributed algorithms would do
without clocks entirely, but then <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall07/cos518/papers/flp.pdf" title="MJ Fischer, N Lynch, and MS Paterson. Impossibility of Distributed Consensus with One Faulty Process. JACM 32(2):374–382, 1985">consensus becomes impossible</a>&nbsp;[10]. Acquiring a lock is
like a compare-and-set operation, which <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~mph/Herlihy91/p124-herlihy.pdf" title="Maurice Herlihy. Wait-Free Synchronization. TOPLAS 13(1):124–149, 1991">requires consensus</a>&nbsp;[11].)</p>

<p>Note that Redis <a href="https://github.com/antirez/redis/blob/edd4d555df57dc84265fdfb4ef59a4678832f6da/src/server.c#L390-L404">uses <code>gettimeofday</code></a>, not a <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/clock_gettime">monotonic clock</a>, to
determine the <a href="https://github.com/antirez/redis/blob/f0b168e8944af41c4161249040f01ece227cfc0c/src/db.c#L933-L959">expiry of keys</a>. The man page for <code>gettimeofday</code> <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/gettimeofday">explicitly
says</a> that the time it returns is subject to discontinuous jumps in system time –
that is, it might suddenly jump forwards by a few minutes, or even jump back in time (e.g. if the
clock is <a href="https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/html/clock.html">stepped by NTP</a> because it differs from a NTP server by too much, or if the
clock is manually adjusted by an administrator). Thus, if the system clock is doing weird things, it
could easily happen that the expiry of a key in Redis is much faster or much slower than expected.</p>

<p>For algorithms in the asynchronous model this is not a big problem: these algorithms generally
ensure that their <em>safety</em> properties always hold, <a href="http://www.net.t-labs.tu-berlin.de/~petr/ADC-07/papers/DLS88.pdf" title="C Dwork, N Lynch, and L Stockmeyer. Consensus in the Presence of Partial Synchrony. JACM 35(2):288–323, 1988">without making any timing
assumptions</a>&nbsp;[12]. Only <em>liveness</em> properties depend on timeouts or some other failure
detector. In plain English, this means that even if the timings in the system are all over the place
(processes pausing, networks delaying, clocks jumping forwards and backwards), the performance of an
algorithm might go to hell, but the algorithm will never make an incorrect decision.</p>

<p>However, Redlock is not like this. Its safety depends on a lot of timing assumptions: it assumes
that all Redis nodes hold keys for approximately the right length of time before expiring; that the
network delay is small compared to the expiry duration; and that process pauses are much shorter
than the expiry duration.</p>

<h2 id="breaking-redlock-with-bad-timings">Breaking Redlock with bad timings</h2>

<p>Let’s look at some examples to demonstrate Redlock’s reliance on timing assumptions. Say the system
has five Redis nodes (A, B, C, D and E), and two clients (1 and 2). What happens if a clock on one
of the Redis nodes jumps forward?</p>

<ol>
  <li>Client 1 acquires lock on nodes A, B, C. Due to a network issue, D and E cannot be reached.</li>
  <li>The clock on node C jumps forward, causing the lock to expire.</li>
  <li>Client 2 acquires lock on nodes C, D, E. Due to a network issue, A and B cannot be reached.</li>
  <li>Clients 1 and 2 now both believe they hold the lock.</li>
</ol>

<p>A similar issue could happen if C crashes before persisting the lock to disk, and immediately
restarts. For this reason, the Redlock documentation <a href="http://redis.io/topics/distlock#performance-crash-recovery-and-fsync">recommends delaying restarts</a> of
crashed nodes for at least the time-to-live of the longest-lived lock. But this restart delay again
relies on a reasonably accurate measurement of time, and would fail if the clock jumps.</p>

<p>Okay, so maybe you think that a clock jump is unrealistic, because you’re very confident in having
correctly configured NTP to only ever slew the clock. In that case, let’s look at an example of how
a process pause may cause the algorithm to fail:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Client 1 requests lock on nodes A, B, C, D, E.</li>
  <li>While the responses to client 1 are in flight, client 1 goes into stop-the-world GC.</li>
  <li>Locks expire on all Redis nodes.</li>
  <li>Client 2 acquires lock on nodes A, B, C, D, E.</li>
  <li>Client 1 finishes GC, and receives the responses from Redis nodes indicating that it successfully
acquired the lock (they were held in client 1’s kernel network buffers while the process was
paused).</li>
  <li>Clients 1 and 2 now both believe they hold the lock.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that even though Redis is written in C, and thus doesn’t have GC, that doesn’t help us here:
any system in which the <em>clients</em> may experience a GC pause has this problem. You can only make this
safe by preventing client 1 from performing any operations under the lock after client 2 has
acquired the lock, for example using the fencing approach above.</p>

<p>A long network delay can produce the same effect as the process pause. It perhaps depends on your
TCP user timeout – if you make the timeout significantly shorter than the Redis TTL, perhaps the
delayed network packets would be ignored, but we’d have to look in detail at the TCP implementation
to be sure. Also, with the timeout we’re back down to accuracy of time measurement again!</p>

<h2 id="the-synchrony-assumptions-of-redlock">The synchrony assumptions of Redlock</h2>

<p>These examples show that Redlock works correctly only if you assume a <em>synchronous</em> system model –
that is, a system with the following properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>bounded network delay (you can guarantee that packets always arrive within some guaranteed maximum
delay),</li>
  <li>bounded process pauses (in other words, hard real-time constraints, which you typically only
find in car airbag systems and suchlike), and</li>
  <li>bounded clock error (cross your fingers that you don’t get your time from a <a href="http://xenia.media.mit.edu/~nelson/research/ntp-survey99/">bad NTP
server</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that a synchronous model does not mean exactly synchronised clocks: it means you are assuming
a <a href="http://www.net.t-labs.tu-berlin.de/~petr/ADC-07/papers/DLS88.pdf" title="C Dwork, N Lynch, and L Stockmeyer. Consensus in the Presence of Partial Synchrony. JACM 35(2):288–323, 1988"><em>known, fixed upper bound</em></a> on network delay, pauses and clock drift&nbsp;[12]. Redlock
assumes that delays, pauses and drift are all small relative to the time-to-live of a lock; if the
timing issues become as large as the time-to-live, the algorithm fails.</p>

<p>In a reasonably well-behaved datacenter environment, the timing assumptions will be satisfied <em>most</em>
of the time – this is known as a <a href="http://www.net.t-labs.tu-berlin.de/~petr/ADC-07/papers/DLS88.pdf" title="C Dwork, N Lynch, and L Stockmeyer. Consensus in the Presence of Partial Synchrony. JACM 35(2):288–323, 1988">partially synchronous system</a>&nbsp;[12]. But is that good
enough? As soon as those timing assumptions are broken, Redlock may violate its safety properties,
e.g. granting a lease to one client before another has expired. If you’re depending on your lock for
correctness, “most of the time” is not enough – you need it to <em>always</em> be correct.</p>

<p>There is plenty of evidence that it is not safe to assume a synchronous system model for most
practical system environments&nbsp;[7,8]. Keep reminding yourself of the GitHub incident with the
<a href="https://github.com/blog/1364-downtime-last-saturday" title="Mark Imbriaco. Downtime last Saturday. 2012">90-second packet delay</a>. It is unlikely that Redlock would survive a <a href="https://aphyr.com/tags/jepsen">Jepsen</a> test.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a consensus algorithm designed for a partially synchronous system model (or
asynchronous model with failure detector) actually has a chance of working. Raft, Viewstamped
Replication, Zab and Paxos all fall in this category. Such an algorithm must let go of all timing
assumptions. That’s hard: it’s so tempting to assume networks, processes and clocks are more
reliable than they really are. But in the messy reality of distributed systems, you have to be very
careful with your assumptions.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I think the Redlock algorithm is a poor choice because it is “neither fish nor fowl”: it is
unnecessarily heavyweight and expensive for efficiency-optimization locks, but it is not
sufficiently safe for situations in which correctness depends on the lock.</p>

<p>In particular, the algorithm makes dangerous assumptions about timing and system clocks (essentially
assuming a synchronous system with bounded network delay and bounded execution time for operations),
and it violates safety properties if those assumptions are not met. Moreover, it lacks a facility
for generating fencing tokens (which protect a system against long delays in the network or in
paused processes).</p>

<p>If you need locks only on a best-effort basis (as an efficiency optimization, not for correctness),
I would recommend sticking with the <a href="http://redis.io/commands/set">straightforward single-node locking algorithm</a> for
Redis (conditional set-if-not-exists to obtain a lock, atomic delete-if-value-matches to release
a lock), and documenting very clearly in your code that the locks are only approximate and may
occasionally fail. Don’t bother with setting up a cluster of five Redis nodes.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you need locks for correctness, please don’t use Redlock. Instead, please use
a proper consensus system such as <a href="https://zookeeper.apache.org/">ZooKeeper</a>, probably via one of the <a href="http://curator.apache.org/curator-recipes/index.html">Curator recipes</a>
that implements a lock. (At the very least, use a <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">database with reasonable transactional
guarantees</a>.) And please enforce use of fencing tokens on all resource accesses under the
lock.</p>

<p>As I said at the beginning, Redis is an excellent tool if you use it correctly. None of the above
diminishes the usefulness of Redis for its intended purposes. <a href="http://antirez.com/">Salvatore</a> has been very
dedicated to the project for years, and its success is well deserved. But every tool has
limitations, and it is important to know them and to plan accordingly.</p>

Using Euro coins as standard weights
</b></span>
</p>


<p>
Here is a cheap way to obtain a set of standard weights, for measuring
weights up to about 100 gram, to an accuracy of about 0.5 gram :  Use
the coins of the currency of your country.  Thus one can make use of the
fact that these coins are fabricated in mass production, and because of
that have not only a constant shape and size, but also a constant and
accurately fixed weight.
</p><p>
Weights composed of these coins can be used to measure the weight of
small objects (e.g. letters).  The accuracy of the weight of the (Euro)
coins is good enough so that in measuring the weight of objects an
accuracy 0.5 gram is easily obtained in a cheap and quick way.(*)
</p><blockquote><span size="-1">
   (*) One cheap and quick way to construct things for weighing to 
   up to 0.5 gram accuracy with the Euro coins is as follows:<br> 
   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
   1. Use a very simple home-made scales, i.e. a balance, simply
   consisting of a straight rod suspended exactly in the middle, with
   hanging from each end a 'plate' (or 'pan') on which to place the
   object to be weighed and the standard weights.  A straight length of
   e.g. aluminium, two small identical pieces of board, and a small amount
   of supple thread suffice to construct a very serviceable scales.<br>
   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
   2. Create the weights by holding the combinations of Euro coins
   together with narrow paper bands glued around them.  The weight of the
   paper bands and the glue is much smaller than 0.5 g and is therefore
   negligible.  (A sheet of A4 copying paper weighs about 5 gram.)
</span></blockquote> 
<p>
In the rest of this text, I'll use the Euro coins, to illustrate the idea.
Also, I'll use the gram (abbreviated: 'g') as the unit of weight; that
is, I'll assume that the weight of the objects to be measured should be
determined in gram units.  The weight of the Euro coins is as follows:
</p><center>
<tt>

               http://www.euroswapper.com/euro_coins.html)</span>
</b></span>
</center>
<p>
Remarkably, the 1 Euro coin has a nice round weight of exactly 7.5 g;
but in general, the makers of the coins have obviously not used it as
a design criterion to give the coins a weight of a nice round number
of grams... &nbsp; These awkward numerical values of the weights of
the individual coins seems the biggest hurdle to easy use of coins as
standard weights (for weighing things cheaply and with a resolution of
better than 7.5 g).
</p><p>
However, it is easy (with the Euro coins at least) to combine small
numbers of coins together into combinations weighing a round number of
grams.  For example, the combination consisting of one 0.02 Euro coin
(3.06 g), two 0.05 Euro coins (3.92 g each), and one 0.10 Euro coin
(4,10 g), adds up to the round weight of exactly 15.00 g.  
</p><p>
It is possible (with the Euro coins) to compose in this way a
very satisfactory set of "standard weights", each consisting of a
combination of a small number of coins.  The following are the most
useful combinations:

Table 2: The most useful combinations of Euro coins<br>
to obtain weights of a round number of grams.<br>
An empty cell means that the coin is not used in the combination.
</b></span>
</center>
<p>
The combinations of 9.96 g and 10.04 g included in Table 2 above are the
closest it is possible to get to a weight of 10.00 g.  
</p><p>
In Table 2, the 15 g and 20 g weights are the mainstay of the weight set.
With them, by placing them both at the left and at the right side in
the scales, one can measure to a resolution of 5 g.  The, relatively
expensive, 25 g weight is not really strictly necessary, but I've added
it for convenience.
</p><p>
By adding the 17.5 g weight to one's set of weights, the resolution is
improved to 2.5 g.  (The two possible coin combinations for the 17.5
g weight, both shown in the table, differ in cost only by 0.01 Euro.)
</p><p>
The remaining weights in Table 2 are included for those who want to 
improve their weight measuring resolution to 1.0 or 0.5 g.
</p><p>
In general, the larger the (desired) weight of the combination, the
larger is the number of ways in which the coins can be put together to
yield that given total weight.  Small weights (made up of only a few
coins) can only be composed in one or a very few ways; for large weights
(made up of larger numbers of coins) of any given desired weight,
in general a larger number of coin combinations exists that sum to
that weight.
</p><p>
For desired weights of &nbsp; <i>n</i> * 0.5 g (where <i>n</i>
= whole number) <br>
&nbsp; -- that is, weights of a whole number
of grams or a whole number of grams plus 0.5 g --<br>
it is, with the Euro coins, not possible to find combinations under a
total weight of 10.50 g.  The smallest possible combinations summing
to &nbsp; <i>n</i> * 0.5 g are:
</p><blockquote>
	10.50<br>
	11.00<br>
	11.50<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;	15.00<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;	15.50<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;	16.00<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;	16.50<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;	17.00<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;	17.50<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;	18.00<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	20.00<br>
</blockquote>
From 20.00 g upwards, all combinations with a weight of &nbsp; <i>n</i>
* 0.5 g are possible.
<p>
To obtain weights of 30 g or larger with a weight of &nbsp; <i>n</i>
* 5 gram (<i>n</i> = whole number), that is, 30 g, 35 g, 40 g, 45 g,
50 g and so on, just put them together out of the combinations for 15
gram and for 20 gram (from Table 2).  For example,
</p><blockquote><pre> 50 g  =  (2 * 15 g) +      20 g        [ = 0.58 Euro ]
 75 g  =       15 g  + (3 * 20 g)       [ = 0.64 Euro ]
100 g  =                5 * 20 g        [ = 0.70 Euro ]
</pre></blockquote>
... and so on. 
<p>
Note (from Table 1), that the ratio of weight to monetary value of the
Euro coins drops uniformly with increasing monetary value of the coin.
That is, the smaller the coin, the more weight it gives you for the
smallest cost.  In order to keep things as cheap as possible, I have in
the above therefore preferably composed my weights from from the smaller
coins, as far as possible.  For the same reason, I've used none of the
coins of 1 Euro or more in my combinations.
</p><p>
When composing the larger &nbsp; <i>n</i> * 5 gram weights from the 15
g and 20 g combinations, note that the 20 g combination, composed in
relatively larger part from lower-value coins, is cheaper than the
15 g combination.  (The 20 g costing 0.14 Euro, and the 15 g costing
0.22 Euro.)

      was inspired by the Maxwell's daemon of physics and thermodynamics.  (My background is Physics.)  Maxwell's daemon was an
      imaginary agent which helped sort molecules of different speeds and worked tirelessly in the background.  We fancifully began to use the

          <p><span color="#008000" face="Comic Sans MS">I am interested in the origin of the word <i>daemon</i>.  I work in
          information technology and I have always heard of system processes referred to as daemons.  I assumed that it is an older spelling of

        </blockquote>
        <p><span color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Why certainly.  Someone give us some of those phosphorescent genes
        that have recently been spliced to mice DNA and we'll shed light like mad.
        <i>  Demon</i> and <i> daemon</i> were once used interchangeably.  The former
        came to English from medieval Latin, while the latter was from classical Latin.  The earliest use appears to have been in the phrase
        <i>daemon of Socrates</i>, which was his "attendant, ministering, or indwelling spirit; genius".  That was in the late 14th century.  It
        was a short time later that the term <i> demon</i> came to refer to "an evil
        spirit" by influence of its usage in various versions of the Bible. The Greek form was used to translate Hebrew words for "lords, idols"
        and "hairy ones (satyrs)".  Wyclif translated it from Greek to English <i>fiend</i> or
        <i>devil</i>.  This is how the evil connotation arose.  By the late 16th century, the general supernatural meaning was being distinguished
        with the spelling <i>daemon</i>, while the evil meaning remained with <i>demon</i>.
        Today <i> daemon</i> can mean "a supernatural being of a nature intermediate
        between that of gods and men" or "a guiding spirit".</span></p>
        <p><span color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">[Warning: This paragraph is about science so, if this topic causes you
        undue alarm, please close your eyes until you've finished reading it.] The 19th century scientist
        James Maxwell once daydreamed (the polite term is "thought experiment") about a problem in physics.  He imagined a
        closed container which was divided in half.  In the middle of the divider was a tiny gate, just large enough to admit one molecule of
        gas.  This gate, in Maxwell's imagination, was operated by a tiny daemon.  This daemon observed the speed (i.e. temperature) of the
        molecules heading for the gate and, depending on the speed, let them through.  If he let only slow molecules pass from side A to side B and
        only fast molecules pass from side B to side A, then A would get hot while B cooled.  Maxwell's daemon was only imaginary, of course, but
        as it seemed to evade the laws of thermodynamics it caused quite a stir.  Eventually, though, the theory of quantum mechanics showed why
        it wouldn't work.  [OK, you may open your eyes, now.]</span></p>
        <p><span face="Comic Sans MS"><span color="#000000">As you probably know, the "system processes" called
        <i> daemons</i> monitor other tasks and perform predetermined actions depending on their
        behavior.  This is so reminiscent of Maxwell's daemon watching his molecules that we can only assume that whoever dubbed these "system
        processes" had Maxwell's daemon in mind.  Unfortunately, we have found no hard evidence to support this.&nbsp;

    <p><span color="#800000" face="Comic Sans MS">Professor Jerome H. Saltzer, who also worked on
    Project MAC, confirms the Maxwell's demon explanation.&nbsp; He is
    currently working on pinpointing the origin of the erroneous acronym
    etymology for <i>daemon</i> in this sense.&nbsp; [We have edited Issue 129
    to reflect this confirmation of our original assumption.&nbsp; Isn't it

 <blockquote>
  <p><span face="Comic Sans MS" color="#354A2F">While <i>au jus</i> does mean literally "with juice", it is short for
  <i>sauce au
  jus [de beouf]</i>, meaning "sauce made with juice [of beef]", so, saying "with au jus", while admittedly awkward, is not as wrong as it seems at first
  glance.&nbsp; OK, so maybe I could be an anti-curmudgeon after all.  Is there some
  requirement out there that I be consistent?</span></p>

 <p><span color="#800000" face="Comic Sans MS">But do you say "with <i>a la

 </p><blockquote>
 <p><span color="#354A2F" face="Comic Sans MS">RE: "and etc." and Ken Williams' comment about "with au jus", close but no cigar.
 <i> Avec</i> is French for "with"; <i> au</i> is French for "in".&nbsp; But, silly me, I just learned that from a high
 school friend.</span>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p><span face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, Fred, but in this case <i>au</i> is
 usually translated as "with".&nbsp; Look at <i>cafe au lait</i>.&nbsp;
 You don't say "coffee in milk", do you?&nbsp; Tell your high school
 friend to study a bit harder, and don't believe everything you hear (the
 cardinal rule of critical thinking).</span></p><p><span face="Comic Sans MS">From
 Richard Hershberger:</span>
 </p><blockquote>
  <p><span color="#354A2F" face="Comic Sans MS">In the <i> Sez You</i> page of issue 145,  Ken Williams
  comments on the waitress who asked if he wanted his roast beef sandwich "with au jus", to which you
  responded with "Aaargh!"  While the waitress clearly was not fluent in French, her English was impeccable.&nbsp;
  English syntax requires a preposition in that construction.  "Au jus" lacks an English preposition,
  so she provided the one.  The fact that there is a French preposition in the phrase is irrelevant, since
  the construction as a whole has been adopted into English and reanalyzed to fit English syntax.  This is
  a normal process which has occurred innumerable times in the past.  It only seems incongruous because it is
  recent and because some of us have enough knowledge of French to recognize the original syntactical
  structure.</span>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p><span face="Comic Sans MS">Again, Barb and Malcolm ask, do you say
 "apple pie with <i>a la mode</i>"?&nbsp; They don't agree that the
 presence of a French preposition is irrelevant.&nbsp; To be consistent with
 constructions like "apple pie <i>a la mode</i>", one should not add
 an English preposition.&nbsp; The phrase <i>au jus</i> should be treated as an
 adjective if it isn't going to be parsed as a prepositional phrase.</span>

  <p><span color="#354A2F" face="Comic Sans MS">Slightly off topic regarding the discussion "and etc" and Ken Williams's
  comment about "with au juice" I would like to contribute these "Canadianisms" for your enjoyment.</span></p><p><span color="#354A2F" face="Comic Sans MS">In Canada all labels must be in both official languages. To save space,
  these labels often use one common word between a French and an English descriptive word. As a result I have heard people refer to  "The Jeux
  Canada Games"  (Jeux Canada being the French name for The Canada Games) Another more common one is "old fort cheese" which I admit to using. Old
  fort cheese has almost become legitimate now. It has been used on  the CBC national radio programme "This Morning" at least twice, and if the
  CBC sanctions it, it must be correct.&nbsp; Thanks for many amusing discussions.</span>

  <i>conejo</i>.  Do you know
  it the two are related?&nbsp; Thank you!  I love words and look forward to visiting your site
  each week.</span></p>

 <p><span color="#800000" face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks for the kind words!&nbsp;
 Read on.</span></p>
 <p><span color="#800000" face="Comic Sans MS">From Jeff Lee:</span></p>
 <blockquote>
  <p><span color="#354A2F" face="Comic Sans MS">In Issue 135 of TOWFI, you write:</span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Of course there are rabbits in Wales! The Welsh word is
    <i> cwningen</i> (feminine gender, plural is <i>cwningod</i>) but we don't expect many English rabbits would stop at the border just because they can't speak Welsh.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><span color="#354A2F" face="Comic Sans MS">This reminds me of an old joke (from
  <i>Wits Fittes &amp; Fancies</i>, by Anthony Copley, 1595) which runs:</span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span color="#354A2F" face="Comic Sans MS">A manie Schollers went to steale Conies, and by the
     way they warn'd a nouice among them to make no noise
     for feare of skarring the Conies away : At last he
     espying some, said aloud in Latine: "Ecce cuniculi multi."  And with that the Conies ranne into their
     berries : Wherewith his fellowes offended, and
     chyding him therefore, hee sayd: "Who (the Deu'll)
     would haue thought that Conies vnderstood Latine".</span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><span color="#354A2F" face="Comic Sans MS">Out of curiosity, my dictionary indicates that
  <i>cony</i> derives ultimately from <i>cuniculus</i>.  Is the Welsh <i>cwningen</i> related, or is it just a coincidence that they sound so similar?</span></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p><span face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, all of these rabbit words are related.&nbsp;
 The English and Welsh forms come from the Latin, and it is thought that Latin
 borrowed it from an ancient Iberian language.&nbsp; Good joke, by the way!</span></p>

  <p><span color="#354A2F" face="Comic Sans MS">I think you treated the one who offered this as the origin of the term
  <i>golf</i> very kindly... "In Scotland, a new game was invented. It was entitled Gentlemen Only Ladies
  Forbidden.... and thus               the word GOLF entered into the English language."&nbsp;
  ...but have you done so at your own expense?  I would have been impressed to hear you point out that none of the words "gentlemen", "only", "ladies", and
  "forbidden" existed with the familiar meanings at the time the game golf is thought to have been invented.&nbsp;</span></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p><span face="Comic Sans MS">We didn't think such explanations
 necessary.&nbsp; We already gave the etymology of <i> golf</i> and gave a link back to
 that <a href="https://www.takeourword.com/Issue055.html">discussion</a>.&nbsp; Going on about how the words
 that make up the acronym are anachronistic&nbsp; as far as the word's timeline
 go would be like beating a dead horse.&nbsp; Also, we believe that the reader
 who wrote with that etymology was aware that it was ridiculous and sent it
 because he knew we'd get a kick out of it.</span></p>
 <blockquote>
  <p><span face="Comic Sans MS"><span color="#354A2F">However, if the modern name
  <i>golf</i> was only given to the game (however long
  the game itself existed) in recent enough linguistic times to accommodate the acronym, then your reader may be on to something...&nbsp;</span>
  <span color="#354A2F">Got a final word on the subject? Love your stuff!</span></span></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p><span color="#800000" face="Comic Sans MS">Our final word: <i>golf</i> is
 not an acronym.&nbsp; Read our discussion of its etymology.&nbsp; A very
 important rule of etymology which we cannot repeat often enough: few English
 words derive from acronyms (<i>sonar</i>, <i>radar</i>, <i>scuba</i> are some
 examples); very few derive from acronyms before the 20th century (don't even
 try to suggest <i>posh</i>!.&nbsp; We don't count <i>okay</i> as an acronym: if
 it were one, it would be pronounced "ock"). Read our <a href="https://www.takeourword.com/Issue063.html#Spotlight">past

          pippali.</span></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><span size="3" face="Comic Sans MS" color="#354A2F">The most widely spoken language in Kenya, other than English, is Swahili. It's been a long, long time since I learned Swahili in the Peace Corps, but I still remember that the word for "pepper" is
        <i>pilipili</i>. It's easy to see how that could become <i>piripiri</i>. However, the term does not seem to have originated in Kenya's Indian community.</span></p>
        <p><span size="3" face="Comic Sans MS" color="#354A2F">The grammar of Swahili is
        Bantu. Most of its vocabulary is also Bantu, but it borrows many words from Arabic, Persian, Portuguese, German, and English, reflecting the region's trading and colonial history. According to the Oxford "Standard Swahili-English Dictionary,"
        <i> pilipili</i> is derived from a Persian word that I transliterate (with some difficulty, because I don't know the alphabet, and initial, medial, and final forms of letters are different) as
        <i> plpl</i> (vowels are not shown). Persian is closely related to Sanskrit, and the similarity to Sanskrit
        <i> pippali</i> is clear.</span></p>
        <p><i><span size="3" face="Comic Sans MS" color="#354A2F">Plpl</span></i> <span size="3" face="Comic Sans MS" color="#354A2F"> immediately reminded me of Hebrew pilpul, a form of Talmudic disputation that involves close examination of minute distinctions. Sure enough,
        <i> pilpul</i> is the Aramaic word, and cognate to the Hebrew word, for "pepper," from, I'm guessing, either the finely divided nature of the ground spice or its fiery taste.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>To start, if you haven’t heard about the <a href="https://x.com/search?q=%23wpdrama">#wpdrama</a> that’s taken over WordPress in the last month, congratulations 😊. I imagine you’ve had a comparatively stress-free October, and hopefully got to spend lots of time outdoors.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoTToRfM3iA&amp;t=1s">many</a>, <a href="https://ikius.com/blog/wordpress-drama">many</a>, <a href="https://bullenweg.com/">many</a> posts, videos, and commentaries about everything that’s happened.

<h4 id="wordpress"><a href="#wordpress">#</a>WordPress</h4>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> is an open-source software platform for building websites. It’s what this site is built with 🧡. <a href="https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/what-can-i-do-with-it/">WP Fusion</a> is a plugin (another piece of software) that runs on your WordPress website, and helps you connect your website with your email marketing software.</p>
<p>By some estimates WordPress powers 43% of websites, so it’s kind of a big deal.</p>
<p>WordPress was created in 2003, based on another older piece of blogging software, by two guys named Mike and <strong>Matt</strong>.</p>
<p>Matt <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/about/organization/">continues to oversee development of WordPress</a>. He chooses who is allowed to work on it, and what features are prioritized for development.</p>
<h4 id="the-wordpress-foundation"><a href="#the-wordpress-foundation">#</a>The WordPress Foundation</h4>
<p><a href="https://wordpressfoundation.org/">The WordPress Foundation</a> is a non-profit organization that was founded in 2010. Its main goal is to protect open-source software and ensure that WordPress remains freely available and developed by a global community.</p>
<p><strong>The foundation holds the trademarks</strong> to the WordPress logo <a href="https://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/">and the name “WordPress”</a>, as well as “<a href="https://central.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp</a>“. The stated goal of the Foundation is to maintain the open-source nature of WordPress, independent from commercial interests.</p>

<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress.org</a> is the home of the free and open-source WordPress project. It’s where anyone can go to download WordPress for free. It’s also where development on WordPress is organized, and conversations around WordPress happen <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">in the official Slack channel</a>, tied to each user’s account on WordPress.org.</p>
<p>WordPress.org is also the home of the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/">plugin repository</a>, which is a directory of over 60,000 free plugins that anyone can download and install on their WordPress website.</p>
<p>WordPress.org plays a critical role in <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/">ensuring plugins are secure and follow the open-source principles of the WordPress project</a> (free to use, modify, and distribute).</p>
<p>When a plugin author releases an update to a plugin on WordPress.org (like we regularly do with <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-fusion-lite/">the free WP Fusion Lite</a>), WordPress.org sends the update out to everybody else’s WordPress sites. It’s like the <em>App Store</em> of WordPress.</p>

<p><a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a> is a commercial website-building platform. It uses the free WordPress software, but it’s a hosted service. That means you don’t need to worry about setting up your own hosting or downloading the software—everything is managed for you. <strong>WordPress.com is run by a for-profit company called Automattic. </strong></p>
<p>Automattic is widely considered the largest hosting company in the WordPress space. It also <a href="https://automattic.com/about/">owns popular brands</a> such as <a href="https://woocommerce.com/">WooCommerce</a>, <a href="https://jetpack.com/">Jetpack</a>, <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>, and (I was surprised to learn) <a href="https://longreads.com/">Longreads</a>.</p>
<p>Automattic is a privately held company, and is <strong>backed by private equity firms</strong> such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tigerglobal.com/">Tiger Global Management</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://salesforceventures.com/">Salesforce Ventures</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://insightpartners.com/">Insight Venture Partners</a>, and <a href="https://automattic.com/press/">others</a>. They generate about US$700 million per year in revenue, and <strong>have been valued at US $7.5 billion</strong>.</p>
<p>The founder and CEO of Automattic is, <strong>you guessed it, Matt.</strong></p>
<h3 id="conflict-of-interest"><a href="#conflict-of-interest">#</a>Conflict of interest</h3>
<p>Some have raised concerns about the legality of this business arrangement. I won’t get into those here.</p>
<p><strong>I think it’s enough to point out the inherent conflict of interest</strong> in having the same person: a.) act as the public face of the WordPress community, b.) protect the WordPress trademarks, and b.) guide the development of the open-source WordPress project, all while c.) his majority stake in the for-profit Automattic has given him a net worth <a href="https://andsimple.co/cases/matt-mullenweg-net-worth/">close to US$400 million</a>.</p>
<p>Matt has styled himself as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life">Benevolent Dictator for Life</a>, and we’re expected to trust that his priorities are aligned with promoting open source, fostering community well-being, and ensuring a level playing field for independent companies to thrive—without the risk of preferential treatment for Automattic or any other affiliated entities.</p>
<p>The drama over the past month (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1frdo1m/why_gutenberg_was_added_to_the_wordpress_core/">some might say over the past six years</a>), basically comes down to this conflict of interest, and <strong>to what degree you trust Matt to do the right thing</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="how-this-affects-wp-fusion"><a href="#how-this-affects-wp-fusion">#</a>How this affects WP Fusion</h3>
<p>On October 12th, Matt <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/blog/acf-plugin-no-longer-available-on-wordpress-org/">shocked many people in the WordPress community</a> by forcibly taking over a popular plugin on the wordpress.org repository called Advanced Custom Fields, which was in use on over 2 million websites.</p>
<p>“ACF” is <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/">developed by WP Engine</a>, a <strong>competitor of Automattic</strong>.</p>
<p>The plugin was re-titled “<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/">Secure Custom Fields</a>“, but otherwise unchanged. The plugin code, URL, file names, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/#reviews">thousands of reviews</a>, and even links to documentation still referenced Advanced Custom Fields, which is <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=98321164&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch">trademarked by WP Engine</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Yes!</strong> The beautiful thing about WordPress, open source, and the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html">GPL license</a> is that everything we create is free to read, modify, and redistribute as you see fit. </p>
<p>We borrow lots of code and ideas from other plugins, many other plugins <a href="https://fusewp.com/" rel="nofollow">borrow code and ideas from us</a>.</p>
<p>This fosters a vibrant and competitive marketplace, allowing anyone with a good idea to launch a new product without having to worry about being similar to something that is copyrighted by an established player.</p>
<p>However, while our code is free to copy, <strong>our trademark protects our business in <em>trade</em></strong>.</p>
<p>It’s how, when you purchase from us, you know you are getting the real WP Fusion from the original company who created, maintains, and supports it.</p>
<p>Somebody could take our code, rename it “Awesome CRM Connector”, create their own website and documentation, and <strong>this would be perfectly legal</strong> ✅</p>
<p>However, if someone built a website at https://<em>better</em>wpfusion.com/ and sold our plugin using our name and logo, this would be a trademark violation, as it has the potential to deceive customers as to who they are purchasing from.</p>
<p>Our code is free, but the trademark protects the many years we’ve spent establishing a brand identity and a reputation as creators of <a href="https://verygoodplugins.com/">Very Good Plugins</a> (our company name 🤓).</p>
<p>As <strong>Matt</strong> has stated repeatedly, <a href="https://www.lodhs.com/blog/defend-your-trademark-or-you-could-lose-it/">you have to protect your trademarks</a>.</p>

<p>In September 2023 it came to our attention that WordPress.com (the for-profit hosting service) had copied all of the free plugins from WordPress.org and was now displaying them in a private directory, exclusive to WordPress.com hosting customers.</p>
<p>These pages were made public, indexed by search engines, and <strong>in some cases ranked higher than the free versions on WordPress.org</strong>.</p>

<figcaption>WP Fusion Lite was copied onto wordpress.com without permission, and used to sell premium hosting plans.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Further, it was no longer clear that the plugins were free. The text next to each plugin reads, “<em>Free on Business plan</em>“, and clicking the link prompts you to create an account at WordPress.com <strong>and sign up for premium hosting</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>This created confusion</strong> among users who would contact our support (for paying customers), and expect priority responses or premium features because they had “paid” for the plugin, when they hadn’t paid us anything— they’d only paid WordPress.com for hosting.</p>
<p>While we knew about this for some time, I didn’t quite know <em>what to do about it</em>.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to start a legal dispute with Automattic and possibly damage our reputation.</p>
<p>And, generally, <strong>I trusted Matt</strong>. I assumed he had a competent legal team that had already reviewed the legality of copying our plugins, and that he was acting in the best interest of the community.</p>
<h3 id="the-cease-and-desist"><a href="#the-cease-and-desist">#</a>The cease and desist</h3>
<p>The events of the past month have made me realize a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>I don’t trust Matt.</li>
<li>Matt doesn’t appear to be taking advice from legal counsel.</li>
<li>Always defend your trademarks.</li>
</ol>
<p>With those points in mind <a href="https://x.com/verygoodplugins/status/1845246925886353795">we sent a cease and desist letter to Automattic and WordPress.com</a> on October 12th, asking for WP Fusion Lite to be removed from WordPress.com due to the potential for confusion regarding the affiliation of the WP Fusion brand.</p>

<figcaption>Our letter to Automattic</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>This was a difficult decision to make, as Matt has been known to use the resources of WordPress.org <a href="https://bullenweg.com/">to personally retaliate</a> against perceived threats to Automattic.</p>
<p>There was a very real chance we would be removed from the free .org repository as well, blocked from the Make WordPress Slack, and/or banned from sponsoring future WordCamps (we sponsored WCAsia in 2024 and look forward to sponsoring WCEU in 2025).</p>
<p>Thankfully <strong>WP Fusion Pro <em>does not</em> require the free version</strong> to function, and we have been delivering updates to our paying customers via our own servers for many years.</p>
<p>We had a plan in place to begin delivering Lite updates via our own servers if the worst came to pass.</p>

<p>The top result in searches for “WP Fusion Lite” is again the WordPress.org listing, <strong>where anyone can download the plugin for free</strong>.</p>

<p>It seems like every week there is another unexpected move from Matt that throws the WordPress community into chaos.</p>
<p>I wish it were all over, but it doesn’t show any sign of ending soon.</p>
<p>I would like to imagine a future where Matt is either the CEO of Automattic, <em><span>or</span></em> the champion of the open source project.</p>
<p>I have nothing against him personally— I hear that he’s a great person to work for, and I’m appreciative of all the things he’s done for the open source movement. But as long as Matt’s motivations with WordPress are tied to his profits at Automattic, he can’t be trusted.</p>

    <h2>A Reading Note</h2>
  </header>

  

  <section>
    <p>In <em>The Unaccountability Machine,</em> Dan Davies argues that organizations form “accountability sinks,” structures that absorb or obscure the consequences of a decision such that no one can be held directly accountable for it. Here’s an example: a higher up at a hospitality company decides to reduce the size of its cleaning staff, because it improves the numbers on a balance sheet somewhere. Later, you are trying to check into a room, but it’s not ready and the clerk can’t tell you when it will be; they can offer a voucher, but what you need is a room. There’s no one to call to complain, no way to communicate back to that distant leader that they’ve scotched your plans. The accountability is swallowed up into a void, lost forever.</p>

<p>Davies proposes that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For an accountability sink to function, it has to break a link; it has to prevent the feedback of the person affected by the decision from affecting the operation of the system.</p>
  <cite><a href="https://aworkinglibrary.com/reading/unaccountability-machine">Davies, <em>The Unaccountability Machine</em>, page 17</a></cite>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you start looking for accountability sinks, you see them all over the place. When your health insurance declines a procedure; when the airline cancels your flight; when a government agency declares that you are ineligible for a benefit; when an investor tells all their companies to shovel so-called AI into their apps. Everywhere, broken links between the people who face the consequences of the decision and the people making the decisions.</p>

<p>That’s assuming, of course, that a person <em>did</em> make a decision at all. Another mechanism of accountability sinks is the way in which decisions themselves cascade and lose any sense of their origins. Davies gives the example of the case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_Voting_Systems_v._Fox_News_Network">Dominion Systems vs Fox News</a>, in which Fox News repeatedly spread false stories about the election. No one at Fox seems to have explicitly made a decision to lie about voting machines; rather, there was an implicit understanding that they had to do whatever it took to keep their audience numbers up. At some point, someone had declared (or else strongly implied) that audience metrics were the only thing that mattered, and every subsequent decision followed out from that. But who can be accountable to a decision that wasn’t actually made?</p>

<p>It’s worth pausing for a moment to consider what we mean by “accountable.” Davies posits that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The fundamental law of accountability: the extent to which you are able to change a decision is precisely the extent to which you can be accountable for it, and vice versa.</p>
  <cite><a href="https://aworkinglibrary.com/reading/unaccountability-machine">Davies, <em>The Unaccountability Machine</em>, page 17</a></cite>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is useful. I often refer back to <a href="https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/on-accountability">Sidney Dekker’s definition of accountability</a>, where an account is <em>something that you tell.</em> How did something happen, what were the conditions that led to it happening, what made the decision seem like a good one at the time? Who were all of the people involved in the decision or event? (It almost never comes down to only one person.) All of those questions and more are necessary for understanding how a decision happened, which is a prerequisite for learning how to make better decisions going forward.</p>

<p>If you combine those two frameworks, you could conclude that to be accountable for something you must have the power to change it <em>and</em> understand what you are trying to accomplish when you do. You need both the power <em>and</em> the story of how that power gets used.</p>

<p>The comparisons to AI are obvious, inasmuch as delegating decisions to an algorithm is a convenient way to construct a sink. But organizations of any scale—whether corporations or governments or those that occupy the nebulous space between—are already quite good at forming such sinks. The accountability-washing that an AI provides isn’t a new service so much as an escalated and expanded one. Which doesn’t make it any less frightening, of course; but it does perhaps provide a useful clue. Any effort that’s tried and failed to hold a corporation to account isn’t likely to have more success against an algorithm. We need a new bag of tricks.<img width="10" height="10" alt="" src="https://aworkinglibrary.com/img/stop.gif"></p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>QUIC is expected to be a game-changer in improving web application performance. In this paper, we conduct a systematic examination of QUIC's performance over high-speed networks. We find that over fast Internet, the UDP+QUIC+HTTP/3 stack suffers a data rate reduction of up to 45.2% compared to the TCP+TLS+HTTP/2 counterpart. Moreover, the performance gap between QUIC and HTTP/2 grows as the underlying bandwidth increases. We observe this issue on lightweight data transfer clients and major web browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera), on different hosts (desktop, mobile), and over diverse networks (wired broadband, cellular). It affects not only file transfers, but also various applications such as video streaming (up to 9.8% video bitrate reduction) and web browsing. Through rigorous packet trace analysis and kernel- and user-space profiling, we identify the root cause to be high receiver-side processing overhead, in particular, excessive data packets and QUIC's user-space ACKs. We make concrete recommendations for mitigating the observed performance issues.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <div>
            <p>Despite the huge variation in how autistic people experience the condition, they can be divided into just four subgroups, according to a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.15.24312078" target="_blank">preprint</a>. The people in these groups—who share similar traits and life outcomes—carry gene variants that implicate distinct biological pathways, the researchers found.</p>
<p>Each group is associated with specific genetic variants that influence gene expression at different stages of development, the investigation revealed. The work includes genetic and phenotypic data from more than 5,000 autistic children.</p>
<p>Identifying autism subtypes has been on the minds of autism researchers for many years, says <a href="https://www.jcu.edu/profile/thomas-frazier-phd" target="_blank">Thomas Frazier</a>, professor of psychology at John Carroll University, who was not involved in the work. “But what’s really cool is that they link that to the underlying biology. To my knowledge, this is the first study to do this in a comprehensive, replicable way.”</p>
<p>Autism traits vary dramatically from person to person, and that diversity is reflected in the hundreds of genetic variants linked to the condition. But in most cases, genetic differences haven’t been reliably mapped to autism traits, and two people with the same variant can show different phenotypes.</p>
<p>That lack of progress could stem from focusing on a single trait at the expense of the interactions among multiple genetic variants, says lead investigator <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/people/profile/ogt" target="_blank">Olga Troyanskaya</a>, professor of computer science and integrative genomics at Princeton University and deputy director for genomics at the Flatiron Institute. “It’s not as simple as a single variant associated with a single phenotype. It’s a highly complex process,” she says. (The Flatiron Institute, and the datasets Troyanskaya’s team used in the study, are funded by the Simons Foundation, <em>The Transmitter</em>’s parent organization.)</p>


<p>Instead, Troyanskaya and her colleagues investigated the variants associated with a person’s collection of characteristics. They applied a statistical model to data on the traits and behaviors of 5,392 autistic people from the <a href="https://www.sfari.org/resource/spark/" target="_blank">SPARK</a> research cohort. By adjusting the number of groups, the team found the most significant similarities among participants when the model sorted the cohort into four autism subtypes.</p>
<p>The largest group—consisting of 1,976 people—shows mild challenges in core autism traits, whereas the smallest—554 people—has severe difficulties across those same traits. The other two subtypes are somewhere in between: One group specifically experiences social challenges and disruptive behavior, and the other shows developmental delay and difficulties in select traits.</p>
<p>
    T</p><p>
he algorithm organized data from an independent cohort, the <a href="https://www.sfari.org/resource/simons-simplex-collection/" target="_blank">Simons Simplex Collection</a> (SSC), in a similar way, the team found. Considering the differences in the data—clinicians gather information for the SSC, whereas SPARK consists of parent-filled questionnaires—the consistency “is a very good sign that we’re finding true, clinically relevant biology here,” Troyanskaya says.</p>
<p>People belonging to the same subtype often share the same co-occurring diagnoses, further analysis found. Those with social difficulties and disruptive behavior, for instance, are more likely than the other groups to have a diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or anxiety, and those in the strongly affected group are more likely to show cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>People of the same subtype often harbor the same autism-linked common variants, according to a comparison of polygenic scores for 2,293 of the autistic children and 3,179 unaffected siblings from the SSC. And a search for rare mutations uncovered more spontaneous—or de novo—variants among the strongly affected group, whereas those with developmental delay harbor more inherited variants.</p>
<p>Variants associated with each subtype influence different biological pathways, hinting that distinct mechanisms underlie autism’s phenotypic differences. For example, the variants detected among the mildly autistic group alter histone methylation, whereas those identified in the developmental delay subtype affect neuronal action potentials.</p>
<p>
    T</p><p>
he variants contribute to changes in gene expression at different points in development, the study also found. The subtype characterized by developmental delay—which consisted of children diagnosed with autism at an early age—possesses variants that affect gene expression during fetal and neonatal development. And those with social problems and disruptive behavior—who are often diagnosed later in childhood—harbor variants that influence gene expression after birth.</p>
<p>The findings were posted on medRxiv in August.</p>
<p>The results suggest that a subtype’s genetic profile could—at least in part—determine clinical milestones, says study investigator <a href="https://lsi.princeton.edu/people/aviya-litman" target="_blank">Aviya Litman</a>, a Ph.D. candidate in Troyanskaya’s lab. Given more data, the team’s approach could inform parents and guardians of potential milestone delays, Litman and her colleagues say.</p>
<p>In fact, the researchers plan to train their model with more data as they become available, including noncoding and whole-genome sequences, says <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/natalie-sauerwald/" target="_blank">Natalie Sauerwald</a>, associate research scientist of computational genomics at the Flatiron Institute and an investigator on the study. More detailed genetic data could provide more insight into the mechanistic differences between autism subtypes, Sauerwald says.</p>
<p>And larger datasets may reveal more nuance between autism subtypes. “With more data and potentially even better phenotyping, there may be more than these four categories,” says <a href="https://anoushkajoglekar.com/" target="_blank">Anoushka Joglekar</a>, a computational biologist at the biotech company Immunai, who was not involved in the work. By analyzing whole genomes, the team may uncover important epigenetic mechanisms, she adds.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>After several years of keeping it going in semi-retired, keep-the-lights-on (KTLO) mode, I’ve decided to officially fully retire this blog. The ribbonfarm.com domain and all links will remain active, but there will be no new content after November 13th, 2024, which happens to be my 50th birthday. There will be one final roundup post before then, and perhaps a shortish epitaph post. And the main page will switch to a static landing page. But after that date, this will effectively be a museum site.</p>



<p>I’m not <em>personally </em>retiring of course (I neither want to, nor can I afford to), but this WordPress blog is. Sometime in the next few months, I’ll figure out how to move it to a lower-cost archival hosting model, probably as a static non-WordPress site, simplify the design as befits a retiree, and put up some sort of museum-like landing page with self-guided tour maps, a little museum shop selling books, directions to the service entrance for AI scraper-bots, and so on. If you get your updates via the Mailchimp newsletter, that will be shutting down sometime in the next few weeks. So if you’d like to continue hearing from me, sign up for my <a href="https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/">substack</a> (fair warning: It’s not a blog, and both the contents and style are distinctly different from what you’ve been used to here).</p>



<p>But in the meantime, in what is going to be the last significant post on here, let’s look back on what has been a 17-year journey.</p>



<p>It’s been 17 eventful years, and this blog has been my home online through some very interesting times, both for me personally and for the world, but it feels like the time is finally <em>just </em>right for it to retreat gracefully to the shadows. Not too early, not too late.</p>



<p>There is no specific reason to retire the blog right now. While the recent minor civil war in the WordPress ecosystem (if you don’t know about it, you probably don’t need to) felt like the portent I was unconsciously waiting for, this decision has been brewing for a couple of years now. </p>



<p>***</p>



<p>I do think that the end really <em>is </em>here for the blogosphere though. This time it really <em>is</em> different. I’ve weathered many ups and downs in the blogosphere over my 17 years in it, but now it feels like the end of the blogging era. And what has emerged to take its place is not the blogosphere (and really shouldn’t try to be), even though parts of it have tried to claim the word.</p>



<p>I don’t think there is any single heir to the blog, or to the public social media landscape it dominated, anymore than there was a single heir to the Roman empire when it collapsed. And this is as things should be. Emerging media should emerge into their own identities, not attempt to perpetuate the legacies of sundowning media, or fight over baggage. And of course, many architectural elements of the blog will live on in newer media, just as many patterns we live with today originated in the Roman empire. Chronological feeds, and RSS-like protocols are part of our collective technological vocabulary. So at least in a technological sense, nothing is dying <em>per se</em>. But in a cultural sense, we are definitely witnessing the end of an era.</p>



<p>But there’s no denying that the legacy we’re talking about is a powerful one that will cast a long shadow. The cultural reign of the blog, roughly 2000-20 or so, coincided with the second full chapter of the internet. Far more than aggregators, photo-sharing services, or social feeds, the blog <em>was </em>“Web 2.0.” Blogs didn’t produce the <em>most </em>Web 2.0 bytes, but they produced the most <em>significant </em>ones.</p>



<p>Perhaps it’s my blogocentric conceit, but it feels like the active lifespan of ribbonfarm in particular, 2007-24, coincides rather neatly with a very well-defined chapter in the grand narrative of civilization itself, with the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the 2024 US Presidential election serving as neat bookends. Whatever the outcome of the election, when this blog officially retires on November 13, we’ll be in some sort of new era. An era blogs helped usher in, but won’t be a part of. </p>



<p>Conceit or not, it’s hard for me to see the story of ribbonfarm as merely <em>my </em>story, or even merely the marginal story of the few dozens of contributors, or of the little subculture of a few hundreds that coalesced around it for the better part of a decade. The story of ribbonfarm has been, in a small one-of-a-million threads way, the story of civilization itself, through the 2007-24 period.</p>



<p>That thought feels nice, in the way I imagine carving my initials onto an ancient monument might feel nice. <em>VENKAT WAS HERE.</em> Actually, <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/06/13/ten-years-of-refactoring/">I kinda did that</a>, with a friend’s help.</p>



<p>I’d argue that the blogosphere, and the public social media landscape, represented the spirit of this civilizational chapter in a much truer way than old media. Through this period, old media strongholds seemed increasingly like grand and sad old ruins of the past, falling into ever-greater dereliction. While they still exerted a certain baleful influence over the cultural landscape, there was something dead about the gaze of old media on the new world. But public social media… it was <em>alive. </em>Its gaze on the new world was not just lively, it was <em>constitutive</em>. It helped <em>make </em>the world it observed. It was where the real action was. Even the dying old media types knew it, as they increasingly turned to new media not just for informational sustenance, self-disruption ideas, and talent, but for what we might call a sort of life-energy. Journalists didn’t just trawl the old Twitter for stories to print on dead trees. They tapped into it like it was a life-giving elixir they needed to stay spiritually alive. The came for the leads and personalities, stayed for the <em>elan vital.</em> They’ll deny it furiously if you ask of course. They’re a stuffy lot. Nice, but stuffy. And snobby. They’ll pretend it was access to the corridors of power that was keeping them alive all this time. It wasn’t. It was us.</p>



<p>For a couple of decades, public social media, with blogs serving as a sort of network of fortresses scattered across that feudal landscape, was where the <em>world</em> happened. A public, grand sort of world. It wreaked havoc too of course, but a grand sort of havoc. The maturing <a href="https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/the-extended-internet-universe">cozyweb</a> phase we’re in right now, while it has its own intimate charms, to be found in the warren of discords, slacks, and group DMs we all inhabit these days, lacks the raw grandeur of the public social media era.</p>



<p>Here on ribbonfarm, the era unfolded as a three-act story. The core 2012-2019 period, when <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/refactor-camp/">Refactor Camp</a> was an active event, is a good proxy for the “subcultural” phase of ribbonfarm. During those years, I had the social energy both to curate a lot of writing by others, and events of various sorts. I also tweeted up a storm. But perhaps more importantly, the zeitgeist itself had the right kind of energy to respond in a lively way to such curation. The periods before and after, 2007-12, and 2019-24 were more personal eras, defined by my own interests.</p>



<p>If you’ve been a long-time reader, you know that this three-act story corresponds roughly to my rather grandiose scheme of “Ages” for periodizing the ribbonfarm archives. The three ages of ribbonfarm (the Rust Age (2007-12), the Snowflake Age (2013-18), and the Charnel Age (2019-24)) constitute a story that’s perhaps 10% about me personally, perhaps 20% about the various intersecting milieus that gave rise to the short-lived subculture of the second act, and 70% about the world at large. </p>



<p>Throughout the life of this blog, an old world was dying, and a new world was struggling to be born. And this blog channeled the energy of that ongoing transformation for lulz and profit. Gramsci would have approved.</p>



<p>I have joked to friends, building on a very clever Drew Austin (an early ribbonfarm contributor) observation, that the entire three-age ribbonfarm story was a product of low interest rates. This blog was sponsored by ZIRP. The future historians who dive into these archives for archaeological research will likely be economic rather than cultural historians, trying to reconstruct the play-by-play impact of ZIRP. Many of the big hits of this blog, such as The Premium Mediocre Life of Maya Millennial, and The Locust Economy (a forgotten hit from 2013) had ZIRPy subtexts.</p>



<p>This is not an entirely flippant observation. The blog in its heyday was a product of open-source software, cheap hosting, and perhaps most importantly, essentially free global distribution. First through RSS, then through Twitter. This free distribution was in turn an artifact of cheap venture capital. It began to collapse when interest rates began to rise, forcing distribution deals with devils upon all of us, which only the most desperate and ambitious were willing to take. The rest of us began retreating to the cozyweb rather than pay up to the protection rackeeters who began taking over public distribution channels starting around 2017, culminating in Musk’s acquisition of Twitter in 2022. </p>



<p>***</p>



<p>The young cozyweb era currently taking shape and replacing public social media is equally a product of higher interest rates and paid distribution, but is at least not a distribution-channel protection racket. </p>



<p>I coined the term <em><a href="https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/the-extended-internet-universe">cozyweb</a></em> in 2019 (appropriately enough in my substack, rather than here), which is around when it was born. It was perhaps my last major meme. Equally appropriately, that essay has ended up part of a rather <a href="https://darkforest.metalabel.com/dfc?variantId=1">cozy little book from a cozy little publishing startup</a>.</p>



<p>The cozyweb anchors an era that’s threatening to be as long-lived as the public social media era, so it might last till 2035 or so. In fact, I don’t think we’ll see really low/zero/negative interest rates again in my lifetime. Which means we may not see anything like the blogosphere or the public social media era either. </p>



<p>It’s worth noting that the cozyweb is <em>already </em>5 years old. Maybe I should start a new periodization. I need a label for my own first age in the cozyweb, 2019-24. I ported over my old Breaking Smart list into what is now my main substack in 2019, started and finished the short-run Art of Gig newsletter as another substack, helped found the cozy Yak Collective Discord community,  got myself a 5-year Roam subscription, and (much to the dismay of some of you), went crypto-bro (crypto is a very cozyweb type part of the internet).</p>



<p>There have been structural signs of all this of course, and many of my tactical moves over the past few years, which I thought of in the moment as random acts of creative experimentation, were in hindsight preparations for an exit from both the blogosphere and the public social media landscape.</p>



<p>A few examples.</p>



<p>For example, in 2019, I deliberately shifted gears to writing what I’ve called blogchains, over stand-alone posts. These eschew theatricality and engagement farming, and adopt an intimate rhetorical style better suited to the cozyweb. They do not work well with blogs either structurally or thematically. They are really closer cousins to a much older medium: The monograph.</p>



<p>As another example, in 2020, I consciously stopped trying to write “viral hit” type posts, and even bent over backwards to try and write anti-viral posts. The <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/16/the-internet-of-beefs/">Internet of Beefs</a>, which I wrote in January 2020, was not just my last viral post, it was my last viral-<em>intent</em> post. I also kinda consciously intended it to serve as a sort of epitaph for the public social media era, which by that time I had come to see as being in irreversible decline. </p>



<p>Events since then have only strongly confirmed those early premonitions. Virality as such, is mostly dead as a cultural phenomenon in long-form writing. When it occurs these days, it feels somehow deadening and cheap. </p>



<p>The cozyweb zeitgeist favors a deeper, quieter sort of writerly ambition, with classier, more high-minded aspirations. Where the viral blog post of the last decade was something of a loud public-park pop-music performance, good 2024 longform feels more like chamber music performed for exclusive invite-only audiences. One under-appreciated reason for Substack’s success at taking over some of the blogosphere’s role is that it’s conducive to this chamber-music style of writing. One of my current operating theories is that this style is in fact the culturally load-bearing part of Substack, even though most of the attention is on high-profile refugees from old media. The proprietors of the platform don’t quite appreciate the chamber music scenes they harbor, which is one of the reasons I’m not convinced the platform will last.</p>



<p>I don’t read any of the old-media refugee substacks, but I do read a lot of chamber-music style substacks. And one of the reasons I don’t quite feel at home on Substack is that while I like reading the chamber-music style stuff, I don’t really do it well myself. I’m too much of a careless shitposter, and the chamber music style calls for a certain earnestness of approach. It calls for a certain amount of self-conscious gravitas (which can easily turn into humorless self-importance, the main failure mode on Substack; one that gives it decided LinkedIn overtones). </p>



<p>This sense of anxiously performed gravitas is perhaps the governing vibe of Substack. They’re sincerely trying to make <em>meaning </em>over there. We here in the blogosphere were just having fun watching the world burn for a couple of fiery decades. A kind of psychotic, nihilistic humor was the governing vibe of the blogosphere at its best.  So far I haven’t seen anything like it on Substack. I miss it of course, but one must move on with the times.</p>



<p>On Substack, the mere <em>prospect</em> of making money reliably (something the blogosphere was spectacularly shitty at, and remains so in its dotage) seems to get people to adopt a more respectable demeanor, and second-guess the shitposting instincts that would have served them well in the blogosphere at its peak. The blogosphere didn’t so much move to Substack as get gentrified by it, much as they’d like you to believe it did. And many of us transplanted bloggers got a shave and haircut, put on a suit, and went to work there, shoulder-to-shoulder with the old media types we once maintained ritual rivalries with, but are now increasingly indistinguishable from. </p>



<p>The rest of them, that is. Not me of course. I’m only wearing the Substack Suit ironically. Why can’t anyone see I’m only wearing the Substack Suit ironically!</p>



<p>But kidding aside, this is fine (and not in a burning-house dog gif sense). Mediums should grow into their own true natures. And if the message of the Substack medium (and subscription newsletters generally… there’s a handful of other contenders) is one of earnestness and gravitas, so be it. Let it get <em>good </em>at it, just as the blogosphere got good at shitposting. <em>Really </em>good.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most revealing example. Sometime around late 2021, thanks to my interests shifting steadily towards what I might call <em>studious </em>interests in things like storytelling, fermi estimation, and tinkering in my pandemic-born lab, my posting here began taking on the tenor of a semi-private notebook. Ribbonfarm began to resemble my private Roam notebooks more than its own past as a slovenly, loud, meme-making, virality-chasing, content junkyard. And it’s no accident that the notebook/digital garden type of medium began to emerge around 2019. A vast amount of good writing these days is happening <em>entirely </em>in private. A tiny fraction is shared (Sarah Constantin, a long-time friend of this blog, <a href="https://roamresearch.com/#/app/srcpublic/page/dUOCm_0cT">has a public Roam</a> for example), and a slightly larger fraction (including a lot of my own Roam content) is likely intended for eventual public sharing in some form. But much of the notebooking universe will remain private forever. It is interesting that a kind of semi-public notebooking is how my blogging story is wrapping up. A kind of semi-public notebooking is a good description of the <em>original </em>vibe of blogs, circa 2002-09. </p>



<p>But we’ve moved on to a deeper kind of notebooking now (deeper in the sense of much more richly and densely hyperlinked internally). A much deeper kind than blogs can sustain. Deep notebooking and content gardening too, aren’t blogging — and shouldn’t try to be. That would be selling <em>that</em> new medium short.</p>



<p>Fourth and final example: I quit actively posting on Twitter when Musk took over. Not directly related to the ribbonfarm story, but a key adjacent subplot. In the moment, it felt like a tactical reaction to the (political and cultural) writing that was clearly on the wall, and I’m glad I quit when I did. But in hindsight, the Muskening was not an independent story. It was just another chapter in the larger story of the rise and fall of the blogosphere and public social media.</p>



<p>Anyhow, where to next?</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Much of the appropriate subset of my nonfiction writing, of course, has already migrated to my <a href="https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/">substack</a>, which is already five years old (time flies, huh?), but still doesn’t quite feel like home, and I suspect never will. At least not in the way this blog has felt.</p>



<p>Mostly what I write there has to do with technology trends and serialized book-length projects. There’s not much left here that’s suitable for substacking. It’s mostly stuff that does not look good when it puts on a suit, so I probably won’t try to put it there.</p>



<p>These remaining active threads on this blog — narrative theory, fiction experiments, mediocrity musings, outtakes from my lab tinkering — don’t fit Substack and have never quite fit the blog medium either. They need transplanting to media where they can flourish. Lab tinkering really belongs in video, and in cozy conversations with small groups of co-conspirators, such as I’ve been able to find via the <a href="https://yakcollective.org/">Yak Collective</a> (also already 4 years old). Fiction <em>really </em>does not like the reverse-chronological tendency of the blog, and wants to create its own escaped reality, complete with its own temporality, in pre-temporal media spaces. I’m not yet sure where to take my fiction experiments. I suspect I’ll be parking ongoing efforts either in Roam or in novella-length ebook drafts. A few non-fiction threads — narrative theory, mediocrity — will likely eventually turn into monograph-style ebooks/books. They’re kinda done, really. They just need a round of editing and packaging.</p>



<p>That leaves a few loose ends which don’t really belong anywhere in the future at all. They feel like increasingly fussy footnotes, not just to my own archives here, but to the blogging era itself. The impulse to post here now feels like an archival impulse. An impulse to tend to the needs of a gradually settling and cooling past, rather than the needs of a restless and warming future. Garbage collector janitorial work in a memory palace where the temperature is dropping slowly to cold-storage levels. </p>



<p>I’ll be redirecting the energy fueling the memory-curation impulse towards gradually putting together a decent collection of book-length volumes from the archives. And perhaps a fine-tuned LLM that can serve as a ghostly era-bound after-image of myself too. And maybe a glossary and a set of footnotes too, why not. With my twitter archives (also sitting around) thrown in for good measure. They belong spiritually with this blog.</p>



<p>I look forward to chatting with the Ghost of Ribbonfarm+vgr-on-twitter in the metaverse, whenever that option is available and cheap enough to exercise. For now, I’m starting out on this memory curation project by working on a book of key posts spanning the entire life of the blog. A selection I hope will tell at least my subplot of the larger story this blog belongs to. Taxidermy-ing the twitter archives (particularly the threads, not so much the conversations) into a suitably mummified form is a tougher challenge I haven’t yet figured out.</p>



<p>But the memory curation is, to be frank, a backburner priority. Retiring this blog is a poignant moment for me, but I’m fundamentally a future-oriented guy.</p>



<p>These half-assed retirement plans still leave an important function of this blog unaccounted for: As the default outlet for all my random impulses for nearly two decades. What I’ve called my <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2023/03/01/salt-seeking/">salt-seeking</a> tendencies. Without this blog serving as a sort of /etc folder, I will be sort of cognitively homeless after November 13, since such impulses are probably my most primal ones. It might sound silly, but “where will I put my random 2x2s now” is a real and serious question for me. </p>



<p>I have no idea where I’m going to put my random hare-brained theories, 2x2s, crappy maps, bad cartoons, and so on. Substack and post-Twitter protocol media don’t feel right. Neither does a private notebook. There’s a decidedly social element to that kind of /etc salt-seeking thinking. It thrives best when embedded in global and public distributional media as shitposts, ready to trigger Cunningham’s Law dynamics (“the easiest way to get the right answer is to post a wrong answer”). It struggles along in freshwater publishing media like books and newsletters. And it wilts entirely in private media like notebooks. A bathtub is no place for ideas that yearn for the ocean. There’s no fun or dopamine in making a 2×2 if you can’t immediately share it, as publicly as possible. If you have to put it in a suit to send out via substack, or limit it to niche cozy media, or pay Elon to put it out in the post-apocalyptic sewage stream that is “public” social media, it doesn’t feel quite right.</p>



<p>I’m sure having no outlet for this core part of my thinking will drive me nuts, but that’s a good problem to have. You have to harbor a certain inner restlessness if you want to be a good homeless nomad. Maybe I’ll start putting certain thoughts down on paper, and tossing them into the ocean in plastic bottles. Luckily I live by the Pacific Ocean, the biggest tank of saltwater around. And I’m told they just cleaned up the garbage gyre, so we can start making a new one, and killing a whole new generation of turtles.</p>



<p>Speaking of nomadism, a curious inversion is underway in my life. I’ve been digitally at home here on ribbonfarm for 17 years, but a nomad in my physical life, having lived in 23 apartments in 10 cities over the last 27 years. If my cunning plans work out, that will flip. I’ll be digitally homeless once more (as I was 2000-2007), but hopefully manage to buy a <s>house</s> mansion within the next year if this damn housing market thaws soon. Ideally in the Seattle area. We’ll see.</p>



<p>As I said, I’ll post a final roundup sometime in the next month, and perhaps some sort of final epitaph post on the 13th itself (rather appropriately, I’ll be in Thailand that week, a country that will likely go down in history as a sort of blogger Mecca during the heyday of public social media, when blogosaurs ruled the Earth).</p>



<p>In the meantime, thanks for coming along with me on this long journey, and hope to see you at <a href="https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/">my rental apartment on Substack</a>. I’m somewhat active in the Notes section there, and also on Farcaster. I’m on Bluesky too, but not very active there (something isn’t quite working for me there).</p>
