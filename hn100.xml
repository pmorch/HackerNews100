<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><a href="https://www.noleary.com/blog"></a><div><p>America has a tungsten problem</p><p>The US will need a lot more tungsten in the future. Where will it come from?</p></div></div><div><p>The United States needs a better plan for tungsten. For many years, the US has relied on Chinese tungsten production, but that's an increasingly tenuous position. Relatively conservative growth projections in defense and semiconductors suggest an escalation in tungsten demand. But if fusion technologies materialize, the United States will simply not have sufficient tungsten.</p><p>About Tungsten</p><p>Tungsten is a metal with a unique mix of properties. It melts at a higher temperature than any other metal. It is very hard, extremely dense, and broadly inert. Unlike other refractory metals, tungsten conducts electricity and heat fairly well.</p><p>Tungsten's major applications include:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Cutting and drilling tools</strong>. Tungsten <em>carbide</em>'s extreme hardness and high heat tolerance make it a great material for drill bits; if you're boring through the earth for oil and gas, you're likely using tungsten carbide. This is the primary application for tungsten now; estimates suggest it's about 60% of total consumption.</li>
<li><strong>Munitions</strong>. Tungsten's high density and chemical inertness make it useful in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy_penetrator">armor piercing rounds</a> and certain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dense_inert_metal_explosive">specialized explosives</a>. It's an alternative in many cases to depleted uranium.</li>
<li><strong>Semiconductors</strong>. Tungsten's high melting point, inertness, adequate conductivity, and fluoride chemistry make it a useful metal for filling nanoscale connection gaps in semiconductors via chemical vapor deposition.</li>
<li><strong>Photovoltaic cells</strong>. Traditionally, photovoltaic cell manufacturing (i.e., making solar panels) used carbon steel wire to cut silicon wafers. Manufacturers increasingly use tungsten wire instead, because it allows them to get a much lower wire diameter, which in turn reduces the amount of silicon wasted with a given cut.</li>
</ul><p>Tungsten has an emerging application tied to the future of energy: it's an essential input for <strong>nuclear fusion reactors</strong>.</p><p>Tungsten is really good at resisting heat and erosion from neutron bombardment. It's a leading candidate for plasma-facing components and radiation shielding in fusion reactors. ITER<sup data-state="closed" data-slot="hover-card-trigger"></sup> has some good articles about why they use Tungsten, including <strong><a href="https://www.iter.org/node/20687/trial-fire">this one</a></strong> about the extreme heat conditions that parts need to endure.</p><p>Tungsten is a weird and mostly forgotten element. It just doesn't command the same attention as rare earth metals. But it's really important for major industrial technologies!</p><p>Tungsten demand</p><p>In steady state, United States needs to import about 10,000 tons of tungsten each year. And American demand for tungsten might be <em>going up</em>. My handwaving guesstimate below hazards that the United States could need 15,000+ tons each year under somewhat moderate assumptions. If we allow ourselves to imagine fusion technology working, we can guess that the United States would have to find a way to <em>match</em> Chinese tungsten output.</p><p>Tungsten demand: conventional applications</p><p>If we refer back to tungsten's main applications, we should recognize that demand will likely increase. Let's engage in a thought experiment with a grotesquely simple model:</p><ul>
<li>Assume the amount of tungsten consumed in a given application varies proportionally with the market's overall size. Why not? Seems fine.</li>
<li>Assign some hazy distributional assumptions to the different applications that consume tungsten. Let's say 60% of tungsten goes to cutting and drilling, 10% to munitions<sup data-state="closed" data-slot="hover-card-trigger"></sup> , 5% to semiconductors<sup data-state="closed" data-slot="hover-card-trigger"></sup>, 1% to photovoltaic applications<sup data-state="closed" data-slot="hover-card-trigger"></sup>, and then 24% to a bunch of other stuff<sup data-state="closed" data-slot="hover-card-trigger"></sup>. Let's round fusion to zero for now.</li>
<li>Assign some hazy high/low guesses to different applications. Let's suppose that semiconductors and photovoltaic applications grow at a 15% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) and assume everything else grows slowly at a 5% CAGR.</li>
</ul><p>We arrive at a hazy modeled guess of nearly doubled demand for tungsten in 10 years (+77%). These figures are all wrong, of course, but that doesn't mean they're not useful.</p><p>The important conclusions we should make here are all qualitative. <em>Demand for tungsten in the United States is going up under relatively conservative assumptions.</em></p></div>

<div><p>Tungsten demand: what about fusion?</p><p>I intentionally left out fusion above. What if it really happens? There <em>are</em> an awful lot of brilliant people working hard to make fusion happen. There's ITER, as I mentioned before, but there are also a bunch of commercial startups. It's not impossible that some of these organizations make real headway over the next decade.</p><p>A lot of people smarter than I am have invested time and credibility in the promise of fusion on the horizon. For example, <strong><a href="https://deepmind.google/blog/bringing-ai-to-the-next-generation-of-fusion-energy/">DeepMind partnered with CFS</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.helionenergy.com/articles/announcing-helion-fusion-ppa-with-microsoft-constellation/">Microsoft agreed to buy power from Helion Energy</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251207372064/en/Helical-Fusion-Signs-Japans-First-Power-Purchase-Agreement-for-Fusion-Energy-with-Aoki-Super">Helical Fusion arranged a power purchase agreement with a major Japanese supermarket</a></strong>. Even when you cut through the PR here, there's undoubtedly a kernel of real optimism.</p><p>I can't pretend to know what a fusion reactor's appetite for tungsten would look like. I genuinely don't know. I weakly suspect nobody knows.</p><p>I did find <strong><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0920379625000833">one paper</a></strong> out there.<sup data-state="closed" data-slot="hover-card-trigger"></sup> The paper suggests that a fusion reactor might consume 5,000 to 30,000 tons of tungsten over a 40-year lifespan. Let's just say that the answer is 10,000 tons over 40 years for simplicity. That's 250 tons per year per reactor.</p><p>What's a reasonable number of reactors? Here again, I can't pretend to know. I can only make a hamfisted gesture at the number of <em>fission</em> reactors that we already have. We know there are <a href="https://www.nei.org/resources/fact-sheets/u-s-nuclear-plants">about 100 civil fission reactors</a> in the United States. And then the US Navy has another <strong>100 or so <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2021-07/2020%20United%20States%20Naval%20Nuclear%20Propulsion%20Program%20v3.pdf">nuclear reactors</a></strong>, mostly on submarines.</p><p>In the absence of a good reason to believe otherwise, one might imagine the United States could have demand for 200 or so fusion reactors. This is again almost certainly an incorrect figure, but it's still useful for qualitative judgments.</p><p>If that's true, then <strong>fusion might account for the majority of future American tungsten demand</strong>. 200 reactors at 250 tons of tungsten per year totals 50,000 tons of tungsten per year.</p><p>If we combine this figure with our hazy baseline projection from before, we can loosely imagine tungsten demand in the United States  approaching 60,000 to 70,000 tons per year.</p><p>Tungsten supply</p><p>Tungsten is an overwhelmingly Chinese industry; each year, China accounts for more than 80% of the world's ~80,000 tons of production. The next-largest producing countries in a given year are generally Vietnam, Russia, and North Korea -- and none of them are really major producers.</p><p>The United States has not produced <em>any</em> tungsten since 2015.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Global tungsten production, by year</p><p>Figures in metric tons</p></div><p>Source: USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries.</p></div>
<div><p>The United States has long relied on China for its tungsten supply. The United States has historically imported about 10,000 tons of tungsten each year. At that volume, where else could tungsten be coming from? No other country produces <em>nearly</em> enough!</p><p>Recent trade disputes have made American dependence on Chinese tungsten difficult to ignore. In response to tariffs, the Chinese government levied tight export controls on minerals including tungsten. To date, it seems that no US firms have received Chinese export licenses for tungsten. The controls functionally amount to a ban, even though no one wants to call it that.</p><p>The American-Chinese relationship lies somewhere between <em>competitive</em> and <em>adversarial</em>. I'll leave the characterization to the reader's individual politics. In either case, American reliance on Chinese tungsten (among other minerals) compromises its strategic position. The United States does not currently have an alternative supply of tungsten.</p></div>
<div><div><p>US tungsten imports for consumption, by year</p><p>Figures in metric tons</p></div><p>Source: USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries.</p></div>
<div><p>Supply can't just appear. Mines take many years and many millions of dollars to approach full productivity. Mines need to raise a lot of speculative capital, weave through a complex regulatory maze, recruit specialized labor, and ultimately ... get kind of lucky. Moreover, the mining business thrashes every few years from boom to bust and back again. You really can't count on the durable availability of private capital.</p><p>The natural solution for American interests would be to stimulate tungsten production elsewhere -- whether domestically or abroad. There just needs to be more non-Chinese tungsten.</p><p>This <em>is</em> underway, at least to some extent. The US Department of War<sup data-state="closed" data-slot="hover-card-trigger"></sup> has given some awards to American and Canadian firms that are developing tungsten mines.<sup data-state="closed" data-slot="hover-card-trigger"></sup> The Trump administration stepped in to push forward <strong><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/cove-capital-mine-kazakhstan-tungsten-trump-announced-deal-2025-11-06/">an American-Kazakh tungsten deal</a></strong> late last year.</p><p>But that's probably not sufficient. We need to engage seriously with the scale of the problem here. American demand for tungsten already exceeds non-Chinese supply by a pretty wide margin. We can observe this in market prices, which hit <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/tungsten-rises-record-highs-export-curbs-turn-up-supply-heat-2026-01-29/">all-time highs</a> in recent weeks. And demand is probably going up.</p><p>Wrapping up</p><p>As things stand, the United States faces a problem. The country doesn't have a secure, viable supply of tungsten for the future. The United States therefore risks its domestic semiconductor and munitions industries over the medium run.</p><p>But there's an even bigger strategic pinch lurking over the next decade. Bullish prognostications about nuclear fusion might turn out to be right. We might end up getting functional -- it not yet economical -- commercial fusion in the 2030s. If that's true, then demand for tungsten will rapidly outstrip supply. Prices will soar.</p><p>The obvious solution is to mine more tungsten. After all, it turns out tungsten actually isn't hard to find! It's all over the United States.  In fact, it's pretty much all over the world.</p><p>One wonders:</p><ul>
<li>Why does China produce &gt;80% of the world's tungsten?</li>
<li>Why has there been <strong>zero</strong> domestic tungsten mining in the United States?</li>
<li>What needs to change for domestic tungsten mining to return?</li>
<li>What will it take to make sure tungsten supplies survive the next boom and bust mining investment cycles?</li>

<p>In an ad during the Super Bowl on Sunday night, Amazon’s Ring touted the establishment of an AI-powered surveillance network through their camera systems, which the company whitewashed under a feel-good narrative about finding lost dogs.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OheUzrXsKrY">The ad</a> for Ring’s free “Search Party” program urges users to “be a hero” by using their surveillance cameras to help identify lost dogs in their neighborhood. It aired to millions of viewers during Super Bowl LX on Sunday night.</p>



<p>“Pets are family, but every year, 10 million go missing,” narrated Ring founder Jamie Siminoff, over uncanny, seemingly AI-generated clips of lost dog posters adhered to poles. A huge proportion of the ads during the Super Bowl <a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/super-bowl-revealed-ai-messaging-crisis/">were for</a> or featured AI, <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/super-bowl/nfl-fans-sick-of-ai-ads-super-bowl-lx">frustrating many</a> viewers.</p>



<p>“Search Party from Ring uses AI to help families find lost dogs,” he said, while the video showed Ring camera footage in which the software detects a dog in the frame. The company’s website says that the Search Party app can also be used by non-Ring camera owners.</p>



<p>Amazon’s <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/ring-search-party-for-dogs-united-states-missing-pets">website also touts</a> Ring’s goal of equipping over 4,000 animal shelters across the U.S. with Ring camera systems, a $1 million initiative, claiming this will further help locate lost pets.</p>




<p>However, the attempt at telling a heartwarming story of reuniting dogs with their owners masks Ring’s true intentions of creating a nationwide surveillance system, analysts noted. </p>



<p>“It starts with searching for a ‘brown dog’ but means the tech is there for license plate reading, face recognition, searching for suspects by description, etc,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:pxcupv4p27r73xgjw4s3lkqj/post/3mefgknsdac2u">wrote</a> surveillance and policing expert and scholar Matthew Guariglia on social media. “We already know they have a form cops can fill out to get access to footage without warrant or permission in an ‘emergency’ as determined by them. What will this mean for new features?”</p>



<p>Guariglia noted that Ring would likely make the AI-powered features on by default, requiring users to manually search their settings to turn it off.</p>



<p>Indeed, Ring has come under intense scrutiny for its collaboration with the criminal legal system, especially through its partnerships directly with police and with surveillance companies Flock and Axon, which grant <a href="https://truthout.org/articles/a-vast-camera-system-now-feeds-information-to-police-on-drivers-across-the-us/">law enforcement access</a> to an enormous amount of information, including tracking of individuals, license plate recognition, and more.</p>



<p>Flock’s dragnet <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/flock-roundup">has been used</a> by federal immigration agents to track immigrants and search for a person who received an abortion. It has also helped corporations make watch lists, following in the history of corporate blacklists of labor and social movement organizers.</p>



<p>While Flock’s hardware is largely in use in public locations, Ring cameras are ubiquitous in neighborhoods today. According to <em>Consumer Reports</em>, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/home-garden/home-security-cameras/ring-doorbell-review-a1607205040/">30 percent</a> of U.S. households have a video doorbell camera, with Ring being one of the most popular brands. Access to that network gives Flock and law enforcement eyes in neighborhoods across the U.S., with the ability to track millions of Americans.</p>



<p>A feature that the ad didn’t mention, for instance, is Ring’s “<a href="https://ring.com/support/articles/z3yhg/familiar-faces?srsltid=AfmBOorzyH3BdD8aYK0UPJd7vzYg0STsojVrWZGq59sf-xWdg_-maPCy">Familiar Faces</a>” program. According to the company’s website, this beta feature “uses Ring Artificial Intelligence (AI) to recognize people.” Users help train the AI system to recognize particular faces over time, it says, so they can then receive a “personalized notification” when that particular person is at the door. The feature also “works with 24/7 Continuous Recording,” the website says, <a href="https://ring.com/support/articles/wtr7r/24-7-recording-security-cams">referring to</a> their cameras’ ability to <a href="https://ring.com/support/articles/wtr7r/24-7-recording-security-cams">record audio and video</a> at all times.</p>

        <b>WHAT IS THE LIVING WAGE CALCULATOR?</b><br>
        Today, families and individuals working in low-wage jobs make too little income to meet minimum standards of living in their community. We developed the Living Wage Calculator to help individuals, communities, employers, and others estimate the local wage rate that a full-time worker requires to cover the costs of their family’s basic needs where they live. Explore the <strong>living wage</strong> in your county, metro area, or state for 12 different family types below. The data was last updated on February 10, 2025.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>An Irish man has spent five months in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention and faces deportation despite having a valid work permit and no criminal record.</p><p>Seamus Culleton was a “model immigrant” who had become the victim of a capricious and inept system, said his lawyer, Ogor Winnie Okoye.</p><p>Originally from County Kilkenny, Culleton has lived in the US for more than 20 years, is married to a US citizen and runs a plastering business in the Boston area. On his way home from work on 9 September 2025 he was arrested in a random immigration sweep, according to Okoye, of BOS Legal Group in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/massachusetts" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Massachusetts</a>.</p><p>After being held in ICE facilities near Boston and in Buffalo, New York, he was flown to a facility in El Paso, Texas, where he is sharing a cell with more than 70 men. Culleton said the detention centre was cold, damp and squalid and there were fights over insufficient food – “like a concentration camp, absolute hell”, he told the Irish Times, which <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/world/us/2026/02/09/absolute-hell-irish-man-with-valid-us-work-permit-held-by-ice-since-september/" data-link-name="in body link">first reported the story</a> on Monday.</p><p>Culleton said that when he was arrested he was carrying a Massachusetts driving licence and a valid work permit issued as part of an application for a green card that he initiated in April 2025. He has a final interview remaining.</p><p>When asked at the Buffalo facility to sign a form agreeing to deportation, Culleton said he refused and instead ticked a box expressing a wish to contest his arrest, which he intended to do on the grounds that he was married to a US citizen, Tiffany Smyth, and had a valid work permit.</p><p>At a November hearing a judge approved his release on a $4,000 bond, which Smyth paid, but authorities continued to detain Culleton, initially without explanation.</p><p>When his attorney appealed to a federal court, two ICE agents said that in Buffalo Culleton had signed documents agreeing to be deported. Culleton said he did not agree and that the signatures were not his. “My whole life is here. I worked so hard to build my business. My wife is here.”</p><p>The judge noted irregularities in ICE’s court documents but sided with the agency. Under US law Culleton cannot appeal but he wants handwriting experts to examine the signatures and believes a video of his interview with ICE in Buffalo would prove he refused to sign deportation documents.</p><figure id="82614c30-8c70-41c4-9002-1dba0bd05b1a" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:9,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Irish woman detained by US immigration released after 17 days in custody&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;82614c30-8c70-41c4-9002-1dba0bd05b1a&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/08/irish-woman-cliona-ward-detained-us-immigration-released-17-days-custody&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:0,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0}}"></gu-island></figure><p>Previous high-profile cases involving people from Ireland include <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/08/irish-woman-cliona-ward-detained-us-immigration-released-17-days-custody" data-link-name="in body link">Cliona Ward</a>, who had a green card but was detained by ICE for 17 days over a criminal record from more than 20 years ago. A visiting Irish tech worker who overstayed his visa by three days and agreed to deportation was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/15/irish-tourist-ice-detention" data-link-name="in body link">jailed for about 100 days</a>.</p><p>Culleton told the Irish Times he did not know what would happen next and that the uncertainty was “psychological torture”. Facility officials tried to get him to sign a deportation order last week but he refused, he said.</p><p>Okoye said the US government had discretionary power to release her client and was acting in an inept and capricious manner towards an immigrant who was following the green card process. “Here’s a gentleman who is a model immigrant. He owned a successful business, he’s married to a US citizen.”</p><p>Smyth said she had endured five months of heartbreak, stress, anxiety and anger. “I would never wish this on anyone or their family. I am still praying for a miracle every day.”</p><p>After a video call with her husband on Sunday night – their first in five months – Smyth told Culleton’s family in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Ireland</a> he had lost weight and hair and had sores and infections. “There’s no hygiene there. He’s been asking for antibiotics for the last four weeks,” his sister, Caroline Culleton, told RTÉ. The detainees were seldom allowed out for exercise or air, she said.</p><p>“It’s heartbreaking. We’ve talked about what he endures physically but what about his mental health? How will he deal with this when he gets out? What long-term effect it has on him?”</p><p>Last week the Irish government said the number of Irish citizens seeking consular assistance about deportation from the US jumped from 15 in 2024 to 65 last year, a 330% increase.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p data-block-key="sq9br">We establish a positive association between hard-braking events (HBEs) collected via Android Auto and actual road segment crash rates. We confirm that roads with a higher rate of HBEs have a significantly higher crash risk and suggest that such events could be used as leading measures for road safety assessment.</p>

    <p data-block-key="tj11f">Traffic safety evaluation has traditionally relied on police-reported crash statistics, often considered the "gold standard" because they directly correlate with fatalities, injuries, and property damage. However, relying on historical crash data for predictive modeling presents significant challenges, because such data is inherently a "lagging" indicator. Also, crashes are statistically rare events on arterial and local roads, so it can take years to accumulate sufficient data to establish a valid safety profile for a specific <a href="https://highways.dot.gov/safety/other/older-road-user/handbook-designing-roadways-aging-population/chapter-4-roadway" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">road segment</a>. This sparsity paired with inconsistent reporting standards across regions complicates the development of robust risk prediction models. Proactive safety assessment requires "leading" measures: proxies for crash risk that correlate with safety outcomes but occur more frequently than crashes.</p><p data-block-key="72kqv">In "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06327" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From Lagging to Leading: Validating Hard Braking Events as High-Density Indicators of Segment Crash Risk</a>", we evaluate the efficacy of hard-braking events (HBEs) as a scalable surrogate for crash risk. An HBE is an instance where a vehicle’s forward deceleration exceeds a specific threshold (-3m/s²), which we interpret as an evasive maneuver. HBEs facilitate network-wide analysis because they are sourced from connected vehicle data, unlike proximity-based surrogates like time-to-collision that frequently necessitate the use of fixed sensors. We established a statistically significant positive correlation between the rates of crashes (of any severity level) and HBE frequency by combining public crash data from <a href="http://virginiaroads.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Virginia</a> and <a href="https://data.ca.gov/dataset/ccrs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">California</a> with anonymized, aggregated HBE information from the <a href="https://www.android.com/intl/en_us/auto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android Auto platform</a>.</p>

    </p>



    <p data-block-key="tj11f">To validate the utility of this metric, we analyzed 10 years of public crash data alongside aggregated HBE measurements. The immediate advantage of HBEs is the density of the signal. Our analysis of road segments in California and Virginia revealed that the number of segments with observed HBEs was 18 times greater than those with reported crashes. While crash data is notoriously sparse — requiring years to observe a single event on some local roads — HBEs provide a continuous stream of data, effectively filling the gaps in the safety map.</p>

    <p data-block-key="tj11f">The core objective was to determine if a high frequency of HBEs causally links to a high rate of crashes. We employed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_regression" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">negative binomial</a> (NB) regression models, a standard approach in the <a href="https://highways.dot.gov/safety/data-analysis-tools/highway-safety-manual" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Highway Safety Manual</a> (HSM), to account for a higher degree of variance than is typically found in crash data.</p><p data-block-key="c5n3k">Our model structure controlled for various confounding factors, including:</p><ul><li data-block-key="3bkib"><b>Exposure:</b> Traffic volume and segment length.</li><li data-block-key="ikh1"><b>Infrastructure:</b> Road type (local, arterial, highway), slope, and cumulative turning angle.</li><li data-block-key="31eq0"><b>Dynamics:</b> Presence of ramps and change in the number of lanes.</li></ul><p data-block-key="91h23">The results demonstrated a statistically significant association between HBE rates and crash rates across both states. Road segments with higher frequencies of hard braking consistently exhibited higher crash rates, a relationship that holds true across different road types, from local arterials to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled-access_highway" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">controlled-access highways</a>.</p>

<div>
        
  <p data-block-key="tj11f">The regression analysis also quantified the impact of specific infrastructure elements. For instance, the presence of a ramp on a road segment was positively associated with crash risk in both states, likely due to the weaving maneuvers required for merging.</p>

    <p data-block-key="tj11f">Validating HBEs as a reliable proxy for crash risk transforms a raw sensor metric into a trusted safety tool for road management. This validation supports the use of connected vehicle data for network-wide traffic safety assessment, offering enhanced spatial and temporal granularity. While these results indicate utility for road segment risk determination, they do not draw conclusions about location-independent driving behavior risk.</p><p data-block-key="24ug6">The <a href="https://research.google/blog/introducing-mobility-ai-advancing-urban-transportation/">Mobility AI</a> team at Google Research is working with <a href="https://mapsplatform.google.com/resources/blog/roads-management-insights-is-now-available-build-safer-smarter-and-more-efficient-road-networks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Maps Platform</a> to externalize these HBE datasets as a part of <a href="https://mapsplatform.google.com/resources/blog/roads-management-insights-is-now-available-build-safer-smarter-and-more-efficient-road-networks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roads Management Insights</a> offering. By integrating these high-density signals, transportation agencies can access aggregated, anonymized data that is substantially more fresh and that covers a wider breadth of the road network compared to traditional crash statistics.

    <p data-block-key="tj11f">While this study confirms that HBEs are a robust leading indicator of crash risk, there are opportunities to further refine this signal. We are currently investigating mechanisms to spatially cluster homogenous road segments to reduce data sparsity even further. Addressing these limitations will enable the transition from risk identification to targeted engineering, where high-density data informs specific infrastructure interventions ranging from signal timing adjustments and improved signage to the geometric redesign of high-risk merge lanes.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2026/0209/1557514-seamus-culleton/">https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2026/0209/1557514-seamus-culleton/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46947501">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody" data-epic-field="content">
                        <p>An Irish man living in the US for almost 20 years has said he is in fear for his life after being detained by immigration officials last year.</p>
<p>Seamus Culleton, originally from Glenmore in Co Kilkenny, was picked up by United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents last September, as first reported by the Irish Times, and taken to a detention centre in Texas, almost 4,000km away from his home in Boston.</p>
<p>Speaking to RTÉ's Liveline from the detention centre in El Paso, he said: "You don't know what's going to happen on a day-to-day basis, you don't know if there's going to be riots, you don't know what's going to happen. It's a nightmare down here."</p>
<p>Mr Culleton said he is "in fear for my life here".</p>
<p>He described the accommodation as "a bunch of temporary tents", adding "there's probably room for 1,000 detainees in each tent".</p>
<p>"I believe there are five tents," he said.</p>
<p>Mr Culleton said he has no real quality of life and he has been locked in the same room for four-and-a-half months.</p>
<p>"I have barely any outside time, no fresh air, no sunshine. We have two TVs on the wall, there are 72 detainees here in total. We get three meals a day, very very small meals - kid size meals, so everybody is hungry," he said.</p>
<p>Mr Culleton described the conditions there as "filthy" and said the toilets and showers are "completely nasty" and "very rarely cleaned".</p>
<p><b>Followed by car</b></p>
<p>He said that on 9 September, he was finishing work and he had some items in his van that he needed to return to a Home Depot store, so he went there and after returning to his van he set off for home.</p>
<p>"After about two minutes I realised that there was a car following me, a Ford, a blue one, and it just looked suspicious because the guy driving had these deep blue reflective sunglasses," he said.</p>
<p>"It followed for another couple of minutes and sure enough put on the blue lights and then out of nowhere it seemed like there were seven or eight cars and a bunch of officers at the window of the van, telling me to roll down the window.</p>
<figure><img alt="Seamus Culleton and wife" src="https://www.rte.ie/images/0023de2b-614.jpg?ratio=1.78">
<figcaption>Seamus Culleton and his wife Tiffany Smyth</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"And I did, I complied with everything they said. They asked me if I had a Green Card, I said I didn't, I said I was married to a citizen and that I had a marriage-based petition in place and I was just about to receive my Green Card and that I had a work permit to be here and work."</p>
<p>Mr Culleton said however that none of that mattered to the officers and they placed him in handcuffs and took him away.</p>
<p>He said he had received the work permit about "a month or so earlier", so as far as he knew he was covered.</p>
<p>"I didn't really know what to think at the time, it was a very unsure moment. I didn't really know what to think. I guess when I got thrown in the holding cell in Burlington, Massachusetts, that's when it kind of sunk in, you know, that I might not be getting out of here."</p>
<p>He said when he was being processed they tried to get him to sign deportation papers, but he did not sign anything.</p>
<p><b>Appeal for help</b></p>
<p>Mr Culleton made a direct appeal to Irish politicians to help him get out of the detention centre in Texas.</p>
<p>"I would love for you guys to just try and get me out of here, do all you can, please. I mean I just want to get back to my life, we were so desperate to start a family.</p>
<p>"My own family in Ireland is also suffering, my mother especially, she is heartbroken that I'm in here. She is constantly worrying and stressing about me, it's not fair on her.</p>
<p>"Just do as much as you can to try and get me out of here, please."</p>
<p>Mr Culleton said he would like Taoiseach Micheál Martin to mention his case to President Donald Trump when he visits the Oval Office next month.</p>
<p>"I'll take any help I can get now at this point."</p>
<p>Mr Culleton said he has been detained for five months and locked in the same room for four and a half of those five months and he does not know how much more he can take.</p>
<p>"It's just a torture, I just don't know how much more I can take."</p>
<p><b>'ICE picked me up'</b></p>
<p>Speaking on the same programme, his wife Tiffany Smyth, who is in Boston, recalled the moment last September when her husband told her he had been detained by ICE.</p>
<p>"He rang me and he said 'don't freak out', I said 'what is wrong?' and he said 'ICE picked me up'.</p>
<p>"They let him make one phone call, it was probably under a minute phone call...I just asked if he was okay and if he knew where he was going and he said 'no, they're not telling me anything'.</p>
<p>"He told me where he had parked his work van because I had to go and pick it up. And then that was it, the phone hung up and I didn't hear from him for almost a week after that."</p>
<figure><img alt="Seamus Culleton and wife" src="https://www.rte.ie/images/0023de29-614.jpg?ratio=1.78">
<figcaption>Seamus Culleton's wife Tiffany said she did not hear from him for almost a week after he was detained</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Ms Smyth said that during that time she did not know if her husband had been deported, if he was back in Ireland and she had no idea if he was safe.</p>
<p>She said he was in New York for a week and then he got moved again and she only found out he had been moved to Texas when she used an online tracker for ICE detainees to try to locate him.</p>
<p>Ms Smyth said she has not been able to visit her husband, but when he had his last court date, which was supposed to have been on 9 January, she booked a flight to Texas and a hotel there so she could attend court.</p>
<p>However, the day before she was due to fly out, his court date was moved so she lost the money for the flight and hotel, she said.</p>
<p><b>'His whole life just ended that day'</b></p>
<p>Speaking on RTÉ's News At One, his sister Caroline said Mr Culleton did not have any convictions in the US or Ireland and they do not know why he was taken by ICE.</p>
<p>She said that last September, when he was picked up by ICE, it was "the start of the whole nightmare. His whole life just ended that day, it was put on hold".</p>
<p>"To this day we still don't know why he was picked up by ICE.</p>
<p>"At that point, he had a work permit but he didn't have his Green Card. He had the work permit as part of his Green Card application, which was 99% processed. His last interview was to be held just before he was picked up.</p>
<p>"That application is still open because they want to complete that," Caroline said.</p>
<p><b>TDs call for action to support Culleton</b></p>
<p>Fianna Fáil TD for Carlow-Kilkenny John McGuinness has said that "action is required now" in the case of Seamus Culleton.</p>
<p>He said that he has briefed the Taoiseach's office and asked that Mr Martin does not wait until the St Patrick’s Day visit to raise the case.</p>
<p>"The wheels are turning, they have to make contact through foreign affairs first.</p>
<p>"I’ll be asking for an immediate response in terms of contacting the White House," Mr McGuinness said.</p>
<p>Social Democrats Senator Patricia Stephenson said the situation was absolutely devastating for the Culleton family and that credible action is needed.</p>
<p>She added that this escalation poses a serious threat to Irish citizens, and that she did not think the public can assured by any legislation in the US that detainees will be treated humanely and with dignity and will have their cases sought by due process.</p>
<p>"It's an actual violation of Seamus’ human rights what’s happening in terms of the torturous conditions," she told RTÉ's Drivetime.</p>
<p>"What is the coalition doing for his case specifically but also for all of the other Irish citizens living their lives in the US, those who are detained but those who are living in fear that they might be."</p>
<p>Labour TD Duncan Smith also expressed deep concern about Irish citizens detained by ICE.</p>
<p>"Mr Culleton's testimony is absolutely harrowing, and marries with what immigration lawyers on the ground tell us about the very real and disturbing conditions that Irish citizens are facing inside ICE detention facilities," he said in a statement.</p>
<p>"This Government needs to stand up for Irish citizens abroad . The Minister must seek any and all information from the United States Department of Homeland Security to establish how many Irish citizens are currently detained."</p>

<p dir="auto">This project uses an WEMOS D1 Mini ESP8266 module and an Arduino sketch to connect to a NTP (Network Time Protocol) server to automatically retrieve and display the local time on a inexpensive analog quartz clock. The ESP8266 reconnects to the NTP server every 15 minutes which keeps the clock accurate. The clock also automatically adjusts for daylight savings time.</p>

<p dir="auto">I'm using an analog clock with a quartz movement I found at my local Walmart for $3.88. Whatever analog clock you decide to use, its quartz movement will need to be modified so that it can be controlled by the ESP8266 module. Open up the movement (most of them snap together without any fasteners), disconnect the internal coil of the Lavet stepping motor from its quartz oscillator and then solder a wire to each of the coil's leads to make connections for the ESP8266. If you search around on the web you'll find articles showing how others have done it. Be careful when working with the coil. The coil's wires are typically thinner than a human hair and extremely fragile.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/jim11662418/ESP8266_WiFi_Analog_Clock/blob/master/images/Clock%20Movement.jpeg"><img src="https://github.com/jim11662418/ESP8266_WiFi_Analog_Clock/raw/master/images/Clock%20Movement.jpeg"></a>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Software</h2><a id="user-content-software" aria-label="Permalink: Software" href="#software"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The sketch: AnalogClock.ino should be (I hope) clear enough, but here, in brief, is a summary of how it operates. Ten times each second the ESP8266 compares the time displayed on the analog clock to the actual time retrieved from an NTP server. If the analog clock lags behind the actual time, the ESP8266 advances the clock's second hand until the clock agrees with the actual time. If the time displayed on the analog clock is ahead of the actual time, the ESP8266 simply waits until the actual time catches up with the analog clock since it can't move the clock's hands backwards.</p>
<p dir="auto">The ESP8266 advances the analog clock's second hand by generating bipolar pulses, alternately positive and negative to the clock's Lavet motor coil. Because of differences in clock mechanisms, you may need to increase or decrease the "PULSETIME" constant in the sketch by few milliseconds to make your mechanism step reliably. Experimentally, I found that 30 milliseconds works best for my movement.</p>
<p dir="auto">The biggest problem with using these cheap analog clocks for a project like this is that the clocks don't provide any type of feedback to indicate the position of the clock's hands. Thus if power is interrupted to the ESP8266 controlling the clock, the ESP8266 "forgets" where the clock's hands are positioned.  To get around this problem, the positions of the hour, minute and second hands are stored in a <a href="https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/47L04" rel="nofollow">Microchip 47L04 Serial EERAM</a> (4Kbit SRAM with EEPROM backup) and updated each second as the clock's hands positions change. If power is interrupted, the ESP8266 can retrieve the last position of the clock's hands from the EERAM when power is reapplied.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p>The very first time that the sketch is run, the user will be directed to a simple web page (see below) served by the ESP8266 which is used to tell it where the analog clock's hands are initially positioned. From that point on, the ESP8266 will use the data stored in the EERAM to "remember" the positions of the clock's hands.

Once the ESP8266 finishes its initialization and starts operation, it serves a simple web page showing the clock's status. The status page can optionally show a graphic image representing the clock's Face drawn using Scalable Vector Graphics, or HTML Canvas, or no image at all.

            <pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 15:39:51 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://explainers.blog/posts/why-is-the-sky-blue/">https://explainers.blog/posts/why-is-the-sky-blue/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46946401">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>Let’s start by asking ourselves: <em>what color SHOULD the sky be</em>?</p>
<p>Or, one step further back, what color should <em>anything</em> be?</p>
<p>And the answer is: the color of anything is due to<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> the wavelength of photons coming <em>from</em> that thing and hitting your eye.</p><div data-footnote-id="fn1"><p><strong>Well ackshually… 🧐</strong></p><p>These sidenotes are optional to read, but I’ll use them for giving the fuller technical details when I’ve abbreviated things in the main body of the text.</p><p>In this case, the color you see is <em>determined</em> by the wavelengths of light entering your eye since (1) you may be seeing a pure frequency, but in almost all cases, (2) you’re seeing <em>many</em> frequencies, which your brain <em>interprets</em> as a single color.</p><p>For instance, the sensation of <em>turquoise</em> at a specific point can be caused by (a) photons of wavelength 500nm emanating from that point, (b) a specific combo of photons of wavelengths 470nm <em>and</em> 540nm, or (c) (mostly realistically) photons of a huge number of wavelengths, probably peaking somewhere <em>around</em> 500nm.</p><p>In the text, I am a bit fast and loose with the difference.</p></div>
<p>When sunlight hits Earth’s atmosphere, most colors of photons pass through unencumbered. But <em>blue</em> photons have a tendency to ricochet around a lot.</p>
<p>This causes them to disperse all throughout the atmosphere. They disperse so far and wide, and are so numerous, that you can look at <em>any part of the sky</em> on a clear afternoon and, at that moment, blue photons will be shooting from that point straight to your eyes.</p>

  <figcaption>Most colors of light pass through the atmosphere relatively unencumbered. You only see them when you look at the sun, where they contribute to the whiteness of the sun’s light. Blue, however, bounces around a lot, getting spread all over the sky. Because blue photons hit our eyeballs from every angle of the sky, the whole sky appears blue.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 data-ordinal="I." id="why-blue">What’s so special about blue?</h2>
<p>This is true and all, but it kicks the can down the road. Why <em>blue</em>? Why not red?</p>
<p>In short, it’s because blue and violet have the closest frequencies to a “resonant frequency” of nitrogen and oxygen molecules’s electron clouds.</p>
<p>There's a lot there, so we'll unpack it below. But first, here's an (interactive) demo.</p>

<p>When a photon passes through/near a small molecule (like N<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub>, which make up 99% of our atmosphere), it causes the electron cloud around the molecules to “jiggle”. This jiggling is at the same frequency as the photon itself – meaning violet photons cause faster jiggling than red photons.</p>
<p>In any case, for reasons due the internal structure of the molecule, there are certain <em>resonant frequencies</em> of each molecule’s electron cloud. As the electron clouds vibrate closer and closer to these resonant frequencies, the vibrations get larger and larger.</p>
<p>(This is completely analogous to pushing a child on a swing at the “right” frequency so that they swing higher and higher)</p>
<p>The stronger the electron cloud’s oscillations, the more likely a passing photon (a) is deflected in a new direction rather than (b) passes straight through.</p>
<p>For both N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>, the lowest resonant frequency is in the ultraviolet range. So as the visible colors increase in frequency towards ultraviolet, we see more and more deflection, or “scattering”<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>.</p><p>“Scattering” is the scientific term of art for molecules deflecting photons. Linguistically, it’s used somewhat inconsistently. You’ll hear both “blue light scatters more” (the subject is the <em>light</em>) and “atmospheric molecules scatter blue light more” (the subject is the <em>molecule</em>). In any case, they means the same thing 🤷‍♂️ </p>
<p>In fact, violet is 10x more likely to scatter than red.</p>
<figure><img src="https://explainers.blog/assets/img/sky/rayleigh-scattering-by-frequency-graph.png" width="600" alt="Chart showing amount of scattering increasing with the fourth power of frequency"><figcaption>Math talk: scattering increases proportional to the FOURTH power of the frequency. So higher frequency light means WAY more scattering.</figcaption></figure>
<p>So why isn't the sky violet? Great question –&nbsp;<a href="#sky-violet">we'll cover that in a sec</a>.</p>
<p>I just want to point out two other things that (a) you can see in the demo above, and (b) are useful for later in this article.</p>
<p>First, when light gets <em>really</em> close to – and eventually exactly at – the resonant frequency of the molecule’s electron cloud, it gets <em>absorbed</em> far more than <em>scattered</em>! The photon simply disappears into the electron cloud (and the electron cloud bumps up one energy level). This isn’t important for understanding the color of <em>Earth's</em> sky… but <a href="#martian-sky">there are other skies out there</a> 😉</p>
<p>Second, did you notice that even red scatters <em>some</em>? Like, yes, blue scatters 10x <em>more</em>. But the sky is actually <em>every</em> color, just <em>mostly</em> blue/violet. This is why the sky is <em>light</em> blue. If <em>white</em> light is all visible colors of light mixed together equally, <em>light blue</em> is all visible colors mixed together – but biased towards blue.</p>
<p>What would the sky look like if it was <em>only</em> blue? Check it out.</p>

<p>I'll just end by saying, this dynamic (where scattering increases sharply with the frequency of light) applies to <em>far more</em> than just N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>. In fact, <em>any</em> small gaseous molecule – carbon dioxide, hydrogen, helium, etc. – would preferentially scatter blue, yielding a blue sky at day.</p>
<h2 data-ordinal="II." id="sky-violet">Why isn’t the sky violet?</h2>
<p>As you saw above, violet scatters <em>more</em> than blue. So why isn’t the sky purple? The dumb but true answer is: <em>our eyes are just worse at seeing violet</em>. It’s the very highest frequency of light we can see; it’s riiight on the edge of our perception.</p>
<p>But! – if we could see violet as well as blue, the sky <em>would</em> appear violet.</p>
<p>We might as well tackle the elephant in the room: if we could see <em>ultraviolet</em> (which is the next higher frequency after violet), would the sky actually be ultraviolet?</p>
<p>And the answer is <em>not really</em>. If we could see UV, the sky would be a UV-tinted violet, but it wouldn’t be overwhelmingly ultraviolet. First, because the sun emits less UV light than visible light. And second, some of that UV light is absorbed by the ozone layer, so it never ever reaches Earth’s surface.</p>
<p>You can see both of those effects in the solar radiation spectrum chart:</p>
<figure><img src="https://explainers.blog/assets/img/sky/solar-radiation-spectrum.png" width="600" alt="Chart showing solar radiation as a function of wavelength, both for top-of-atmosphere values and sea-level values"><figcaption>The sun emits the most visible light, with UV frequencies falling off very steeply. Augmenting this effect is that the ozone layer in particular absorbs a lot of UV before it can reach Earth’s surface.</figcaption></figure>
<h2 data-ordinal="III." id="sunset-red">Why is the sunset red?</h2>
<p>So the obvious next question is <em>why is the sky red at dusk and dawn?</em></p>
<p>It’s because the sunlight has to travel through <em>way more atmosphere</em> when you’re viewing it at a low angle, and this extended jaunt through the atmosphere gives ample opportunity for <em>allll</em> the blue to scatter away – and even a good deal of the green too!</p>
<p>Simply put, the blue photons (and to a lesser degree, the green) have either (a) gone off into space or (b) hit the earth somewhere else before they reach your eyes.</p>
<figure><img src="https://explainers.blog/assets/img/sky/why-sunset-is-red-diagram.png" alt="Diagram showing blue light scattering fully at sunset, creating a red sky"></figure>
<p>When the sun is on the horizon (e.g. sunrise or sunset), the photons it emits travel through 40x as much atmosphere to reach your eyes as they would at midday. So blue’s 10x propensity to scatter means it’s simply <em>gone</em> by the time it would’ve reached your eyes. Even green is significantly dampened. Red light, which hardly scatters at all, just cruises on through.</p>
<p>Again, you can play with this and see for yourself 😎</p>

<h2 data-ordinal="IV." id="clouds-white">Why are clouds white?</h2>
<p><em>The answer to this question is the second of three “domains” you should understand in order to have a working model of atmosphere color. The physics are different from the small-molecule scattering above.</em></p>
<p>Clouds are made up of a huge number of tiny water droplets<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>. These droplets are so small (around .02 millimeters in diameter) that they remain floating in the air. But compared to small gas molecules like N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>, these droplets are <em>enormous</em>. A single water droplet may be 100 trillion H<sub>2</sub>O molecules!</p><p>A small cloud may be a quadrillion droplets. </p>
<p>So, it’s not as simple as “the photons cause the hundreds of trillions of electrons to jiggle”. Instead, it’s more like the light has entered a very tiny prism or glass bead.</p>
<figure><img src="https://explainers.blog/assets/img/sky/prism.png" width="600" alt="A prism deflecting white light into a rainbow"><figcaption>In a prism, white light can reflect around, bounce off exterior or interior surfaces, and even reflect differently depending on frequency – creating a rainbow effect.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The droplet is just as complex. Some of the photons hitting the droplet bounce off the surface. Some enter it, bounce around inside once, twice, etc. – and leave again. Perhaps a few are absorbed. As with a prism, different wavelengths of light will reflect at different angles. The specifics aren’t important – you should just get the general gist.</p>
<figure><img src="https://explainers.blog/assets/img/sky/droplet-paths.png" width="600" alt="The many paths of light through a water droplet"></figure>
<p>So whatever white (or slightly yellowish) light that came from the direction of the sun is leaving in many <em>random</em> directions. Think of every color, shooting off in different directions! And then multiply that by a quadrillion droplets! In sum, you just see every frequency of photon coming from every part of the cloud.</p>
<p>And that means the cloud is white!</p>

<p>This idea that the tiny droplets that comprise clouds scales up. Anything larger that light can enter – drizzle, raindrops, hail – will also tend towards white.</p>
<p>But that raises the question – what about things <em>in between</em> tiny molecules (N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>) and the relatively enormous prism-like droplets? How do <em>those things</em> act?</p>
<p>Well, the dust in the sky of Mars is a great example 😉</p>
<h2 data-ordinal="V." id="martian-sky">Why is the sky on Mars red?</h2>
<p><em>The answer to this question is the third of three “domains” you should understand in order to have a working model of atmosphere color. The physics are different from both the small-molecule scattering and large-droplet prism-dynamics above.</em></p>
<p>The Martian sky is red because it’s full of tiny, iron-rich dust particles that absorb blue – leaving only red to scatter.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I hear you. This answer is can-kicking! “Dust, schmust. Why does it absorb <em>blue</em>?”, you demand.</p>
<p>OK, so the answer is actually fairly straightforward. And it generalizes. Here’s the rule: whenever you have solid particles in the atmosphere (very small ones, approximately the size of the wavelength of visible light), they generally tend to turn the air <em>warm</em> colors – red, orange, yellow.</p>
<p>If you live in an area with wildfires, you’ve probably seen this effect here on Earth!</p>

<p>To really understand the reason, let’s back up and talk about some chemistry.</p>
<p>Compared to tiny gas molecules, solid particles tend to have a much wider range of light frequencies that they absorb.</p>
<p>For instance, we discussed how N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> have <em>specific</em> resonant frequencies at which they hungrily absorb UV photons. Move slightly away from those frequencies, and absorption drops off a cliff.</p>
<p>But even for a tiny dust nanoparticle, there are <em>many</em> constituent molecules, each in slightly different configurations, each being jostled slightly differently by its neighbors. Consequently, the constituent molecules all have <em>slightly different</em> preferences of which frequency to absorb.</p>
<p>Because the “peak” absorption of the molecules is usually violet or ultraviolet (as it is with small gases), blues/violets will make it to the surface much less than oranges/reds.</p>
<figure><img src="https://explainers.blog/assets/img/sky/approximate-absorption-from-martian-dust.png" width="600" alt="Approximate light absorption from Martian dust as a function of wavelength"><figcaption>Approximate light absorption from Martian dust as a function of wavelength</figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, a reasonable question is <em>why are blue and violet absorbed so strongly by these dust particles?</em></p>
<p>Well, those are the only photons with enough energy to bump the dust molecules’s electrons up to a new energy state.</p>
<p>(Reminder: a photon’s energy is proportional to its frequency. Higher frequency – e.g. violet – means higher energy, and lower frequency – e.g. red – means lower energy)</p>
<p>So, the exact specifics depend on the molecules in question, but <em>generally</em>, the level of energy needed to bump up the electron energy state in a dust or smog particle’s molecules corresponds to violet or UV photons.</p>
<p>This is actually true of solids in general, not just atmospheric dust or aerosols. If you’ve ever heard that purple was “the color of kings” or that the purple dye of antiquity was worth its weight in gold, it’s true! To get something purple, you’d need to find a material whose electrons were excited by low-energy red photons, but had no use for higher-energy violet photons.</p>

<p>So this is why the Martian sky is red – and why reds and browns are more common in nature (for solid things, at least) than purple and blue.</p>
<h2 data-ordinal="VI." id="martian-sunset">Why is the Martian sunset blue?</h2>
<p>It’s less famous than the red daytime sky of Mars, but the Martian sunset is blue!</p>
<figure><img src="https://explainers.blog/assets/img/sky/martian-sunset-blue.png" alt="Photo of Martian sunset with blue halo taken by the Spirit rover"><figcaption>Martian sunset photo taken by the Spirit rover.</figcaption><p>Photo by NASA/JPL/Texas A&amp;M/Cornell.</p></figure>
<p>In the last section, we talked about Martian dust absorbing violet/blue. But the dust also <em>scatters</em> light – which it can do <em>totally unrelated to how it absorbs</em> (remember, since photons can – and usually do – cruise straight through a molecule, scattering and absorbing can have their own interesting frequency-dependent characteristics. They don’t simply sum to 100%)</p>
<p>Small atmospheric particles, like dust and smog, are equal-opportunity scatterers. The absolute probability they’ll scatter a photon does not change significantly with the photon’s wavelength. <em>However</em>, different-frequency photons can be more or less likely to scatter in different <em>directions</em>.</p>
<p>For our purposes, it suffices to know that Martian dust – like many atmospheric particles of similar size – generally scatters blue light <em>closer to the direction it was already going</em>. Red light has a higher probability of deflecting at a greater angle.</p>
<figure><img src="https://explainers.blog/assets/img/sky/martian-sunset-is-blue.png" alt="Diagram showing how the Martian sunset appears blue"><figcaption>Because red light deflects MORE and blue light LESS when scattering off dust particles, the area directly around the sun will be blue – even though more blue is absorbed en route.</figcaption></figure>
<p>When molecules deflect photons only a tiny angle, it’s called “forward scattering”. Forward scattering is the <em>most</em> pronounced for larger particles, like dust or smog aerosols. It’s actually so strong on Mars that even at midday, red light doesn’t fill the sky evenly – the sky opposite the sun is noticeably darker!</p>
<p>But blue’s tendency to forward-scatter more directly against Martian dust means the Martian sunset has a blue halo.</p>
<h2 data-ordinal="VII." id="model">Building a model</h2>
<p>At the beginning of this article, I said being able to <em>predict</em> something is a good measure of how well you understand it. Let’s do that now. Let’s build a model for predicting the sky color on new planets/moons, or during different scenarios on our own planet.</p>
<p>(Not the most practical thing, but a good nerdsnipe 🙂)</p>
<p>Here are the three general rules of thumb we’ve already talked about.</p>
<h3>Small gas molecules = blue/green atmosphere</h3>
<p>Atmospheric gases tend to be much, much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light. In these cases, they tend to preferentially scatter blue/violet/UV. This means that <em><strong>gaseous atmospheres are usually blue or blue-green</strong></em>.</p>
<div>
    <div>
        <figure><img src="https://explainers.blog/assets/img/sky/blue-atmosphere-earth.png" width="300px" alt="Earth's blue sky"><figcaption>Earth: atmosphere is 99% nitrogen and oxygen.</figcaption></figure>

We don’t have pictures from the surface.</figcaption><p>Patrick Irwin, University of Oxford.</p></figure>
    </div>
</div>
<p>This is pleasingly true for Earth, Uranus, and Neptune<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup>.</p><div data-footnote-id="fn4"><p>You may recall Neptune as looking like a much darker, richer blue. However, more recent analysis by Patrick Irwin shows the true color is very likely closer to what’s shown here.</p><p>It's also worth noting that Neptune and Uranus's blue color is made noticeably richer by the red-absorbing methane in their atmospheres.</p></div>
<h3>Dust or haze = red/orange/yellow atmospheres</h3>
<p>When visible light hits particles that are in the ballpark of its own wavelength, things get more complicated and can differ on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>These particles are typically either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dust: solid particles kicked up by mechanical means (wind, volcanos, meteorites)</li>
<li>Haze: solid particles formed by chemical reactions in the atmosphere</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Dust and haze generally makes atmospheres appear warmer colors</strong></em> – e.g. red, orange, yellow.</p>
<div>
    <div>
        <figure><img src="https://explainers.blog/assets/img/sky/red-atmosphere-mars.png" width="300px" alt="Mars' red sky"><figcaption>Mars: iron oxide dust.</figcaption><p>NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU/MSSS</p></figure>

    </div>
</div>
<p>All three significantly dusty/hazy atmospheres in our solar system hold to this rule!</p>
<ul>
<li>Mars’s sky is red due to iron oxide-rich dust</li>
<li>Titan’s sky is orange due to a haze of tholins (organic molecules)</li>
<li>Venus’s sky is yellow to a haze of sulfurous compounds</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Clouds = white/gray</strong></h3>
<p>When visible light hits clouds of droplets (or ice crystals) that are much bigger than light’s wavelength, the droplets act akin to a vast army of floating prisms, sending out all colors in all directions.</p>
<p><em><strong>Consequently, clouds tend to appear white, gray, or desaturated hues</strong></em>.</p>
<p>(Provided the cloud is hit by white light from the sun, that is. If a cloud is below a thick haze or doesn’t <em>receive</em> all wavelengths, neither can it <em>reflect</em> all wavelengths)</p>

<h3>Putting it all together</h3>
<p>The largest and most complex atmosphere in our solar system is Jupiter. But we know enough to start making some smart guesses about it!</p>

<p>We didn’t do too bad, huh? A few key ideas explain a <em>lot</em> of sky color!</p>
<p>I’ll wrap up by connecting what we’ve covered to the larger picture of scattering.</p>
<h2 data-ordinal="VIII." id="scattering">Scattering: the bigger picture</h2>
<p>Scientists have official names for the three types of scattering we’ve talked about. I’d be remiss not to at least <em>mention</em> them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rayleigh scattering</strong>: when the wavelength of light is much <em>larger</em> than the particle (e.g. visible light and tiny gas molecules)</li>
<li><strong>Mie scattering</strong>: when the wavelength of light is the same order of magnitude as the particle (e.g. visible light and dust/haze)</li>
<li><strong>Geometric scattering</strong>: when the wavelength of light is much <em>smaller</em> than the particle (e.g. visible light and droplets or ice crystals)</li>
</ul>
<p>And yes, somewhat strangely, it’s not the <em>absolute</em> particle size that determines how it scatters light. It’s the <em>relative</em> size of the particle to the wavelength of light.</p>

<p>This table implies that if you take a particle and shine longer and longer wavelength light on it, it’ll go from one domain to the next. And that’s true!</p>
<p>The full picture looks a bit like this:</p>
<figure><img src="https://explainers.blog/assets/img/sky/geometric-mie-rayleigh-scattering-chart.png" alt="A chart of particle radius vs photon wavelength, showing Rayleigh, Mie, and geometric scattering"><figcaption>The variable x denotes the ratio of particle radius to photon wavelength. Dotted lines represent single x values.</figcaption></figure>
<p>This has some exciting implications. Say you have a thick smoke, opaque to the naked eye. Why not just look at the infrared range instead? If you use a long enough wavelength, smoke particles will be in the Rayleigh domain – where, of course, shorter wavelengths scatter much more than longer. So if we use a suitably long wavelength of infrared… the opaque becomes transparent.</p>
<p>That’s what firefighters do, anyhow!</p>

<p>Smoke particles are in the Mie domain for visual light. Thick smoke can absorb enough light to become opaque. But in the infrared range, it’s the Rayleigh domain. There, long wavelengths mean less scattering. Less scattering means more transparency. And thus, infrared can see through smoke.</p>
<p>I’m getting off-topic. I can’t help it. So let’s call it here. As you can see, what we’ve covered above is but a tiny droplet in a vast cloud.</p>
<p>But at least you know why the sky’s blue.</p>

<p>These sidenotes are optional to read, but I’ll use them for giving the fuller technical details when I’ve abbreviated things in the main body of the text.</p>
<p>In this case, the color you see is <em>determined</em> by the wavelengths of light entering your eye since (1) you may be seeing a pure frequency, but in almost all cases, (2) you’re seeing <em>many</em> frequencies, which your brain <em>interprets</em> as a single color.</p>
<p>For instance, the sensation of <em>turquoise</em> at a specific point can be caused by (a) photons of wavelength 500nm emanating from that point, (b) a specific combo of photons of wavelengths 470nm <em>and</em> 540nm, or (c) (mostly realistically) photons of a huge number of wavelengths, probably peaking somewhere <em>around</em> 500nm.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p data-svelte-h="svelte-fw48zm">Exploitation of Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) has been relentless since vulnerability disclosure. That’s not necessarily news. Major institutions - governments included - have already been compromised through this vector, and we’re tracking another exploitation wave as it develops.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1vxx46c">On <strong>February 4th, 2026</strong>, a coordinated campaign started across our telemetry with a differing pattern to previous mass exploitation. Rather than the smash-and-grab post-exploitation you’d expect - dropping traditional webshells, running recon and enumeration commands - this operator did something more deliberate, uploading a payload, confirming it landed, and leaving.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-h0dy3t">No commands were executed, the implant was simply left in place.</p> <blockquote data-svelte-h="svelte-7552f7"><p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> This campaign deployed a dormant in-memory Java class loader to <code>/mifs/403.jsp</code> - a somewhat lesser common webshell path. The implant can only be activated with a specific trigger parameter, and no follow-on exploitation has yet been observed. This is suggstive of initial access broker (IAB) tradecraft: gain a foothold, then sell or hand off access later.</p></blockquote> <h2 id="the-vulnerabilities" data-svelte-h="svelte-1hd50k6">The Vulnerabilities</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1gw0noy">Ivanti disclosed two critical vulnerabilities in EPMM - CVE-2026-1281 and CVE-2026-1340 - both covering authentication bypass and remote code execution, affecting different packages (aftstore and appstore respectively). The practical outcome is the same: unauthenticated access to application-level endpoints. Ivanti published patching guidance via their <a href="https://hub.ivanti.com/s/article/Security-Advisory-Ivanti-Endpoint-Manager-Mobile-EPMM-CVE-2026-1281-CVE-2026-1340" rel="nofollow">security advisory</a>, and exploitation in the wild followed shortly after.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1w40552">Most of the early activity was predictable - opportunistic scanning, mass exploitation, and commodity webshell drops.</p> <h2 id="the-403jsp-campaign" data-svelte-h="svelte-zuw54a">The 403.jsp Campaign</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-xp9oum">Every exploit from this campaign dropped a webshell to the path:</p> <pre><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code>/mifs/403.jsp</code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1u2c3rs">The path itself isn’t new - 403.jsp has been observed in prior compromises targeting Ivanti and MobileIron infrastructure, typically alongside other JSP-based webshells. What made this campaign worth writing about isn’t where the payload was placed, but what it did once it got there.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-gmmdj0">Rather than deploying a conventional webshell with interactive command execution, the operator delivered a Base64-encoded Java class file via HTTP parameters. Each payload decoded to valid Java bytecode (identifiable by the CAFEBABE header) functioning as a dormant in-memory class loader - not an immediately usable backdoor. The distinction matters, and we’ll get into why below.</p> <h2 id="inside-baseinfo---the-in-memory-loader" data-svelte-h="svelte-2upd8l">Inside <code>base.Info</code> - The In-Memory Loader</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1ppd1k3">The payload is a compiled Java class (<code>base.Info</code>, source file <code>Info.java</code>). It’s not a webshell in the traditional sense - it doesn’t provide command execution, file access, or any interactive capability on its own. It’s a stage loader: its only purpose is to receive, load, and execute a second Java class delivered via HTTP at a later time.</p> <h3 id="how-it-works" data-svelte-h="svelte-2a6v8a">How It Works</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-w4u2qz">The class uses <code>equals(Object)</code> as its entry point, which is unusual but intentional - standard servlet handler methods like <code>doGet</code> or <code>doPost</code> are more likely to be flagged by security tooling. The <code>parseObj</code> method extracts <code>HttpServletRequest</code> and <code>HttpServletResponse</code> from the argument, with fallback logic to handle <code>PageContext</code> objects and various servlet wrapper/facade patterns. This makes the loader portable across different container environments.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-lkvv7u">Once invoked, the loader checks for an HTTP parameter named <code>k0f53cf964d387</code>. If present, it strips a two-character prefix from the value and Base64-decodes the remainder into raw bytes. These bytes are then loaded as a Java class in memory via a reflective call to <code>ClassLoader#defineClass</code> - nothing is written to disk. The resulting class is instantiated with a string argument containing basic host information, and its <code>toString()</code> output is returned in the HTTP response.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-10utsxz">The response body is wrapped in fixed delimiters (<code>3cd3d</code> / <code>e60537</code>) and served as <code>text/html</code>, making it straightforward for automated tooling to parse.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1gwzvrl">For Base64 handling, the loader supports both <code>java.util.Base64</code> (Java 8+) and <code>sun.misc.BASE64Decoder</code>, ensuring compatibility across older and newer JVM versions.</p> <h3 id="host-fingerprinting" data-svelte-h="svelte-10ctodl">Host Fingerprinting</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1yqx6kz">Before invoking the second-stage class, the loader gathers a small set of environment details: the application working directory (<code>user.dir</code>), filesystem root paths (drive letters on Windows, <code>/</code> on Unix), the OS name, and the running username. This information is passed to the second-stage class as a constructor argument - likely to help the operator orient themselves on the target at a later date.</p> <h3 id="what-we-didnt-see" data-svelte-h="svelte-3aaofi">What We Didn’t See</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-j3u5o1">This is the part that matters from a defensive standpoint. Across all observed telemetry, the loader was deployed and confirmed functional, but <strong>no follow-on requests were observed supplying a second-stage class to the trigger parameter</strong>. The access was established and then left dormant.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1atrcst">This is consistent with initial access broker (IAB) activity. The tooling is generic and container-agnostic - it’s built to work reliably across environments, not to perform any specific post-exploitation task. The operator deployed it at scale, verified it landed, and moved on. The likely purpose is to package confirmed, working access for handoff or sale to a separate party, who would activate it from different infrastructure at a later time.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1hriirt">That separation - one actor establishes access, another exploits it - is what makes this pattern difficult to detect in practice. There’s a gap between the initial compromise and eventual use where the telemetry trail simply goes quiet.</p> <h2 id="what-to-look-for" data-svelte-h="svelte-5e0vf2">What To Look For</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-byft2g">If you’re running Ivanti EPMM, the presence of any of this activity should be treated as <strong>evidence of compromise or attempted compromise</strong> - even without follow-on exploitation. <em>Especially</em> without follow-on exploitation. The absence of further activity doesn’t mean the access isn’t valuable; it may simply mean it hasn’t been activated yet.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-zf8b8"><strong>Immediate actions:</strong> Patch Ivanti EPMM per vendor guidance immediately. Restart affected application servers to flush in-memory implants - this is critical, as the payload never touches disk. Then review access logs with the indicators below.</p> <h3 id="log-indicators" data-svelte-h="svelte-ccxcm5">Log Indicators</h3> <ul data-svelte-h="svelte-1ke8nr4"><li>Any requests to <code>/mifs/403.jsp</code></li> <li>Large Base64 parameters beginning with <code>yv66vg</code> (the Base64 encoding of the <code>CAFEBABE</code> Java magic bytes)</li> <li>The parameter name <code>k0f53cf964d387</code> in request strings</li> <li>Response bodies containing the markers <code>3cd3d</code> or <code>e60537</code></li> <li>Any response containing <code>ERROR://</code> (the loader’s error format)</li></ul> <h2 id="indicators-of-compromise" data-svelte-h="svelte-uzyojw">Indicators of Compromise</h2> <h3 id="artifact" data-svelte-h="svelte-hrxt8n">Artifact</h3> <table data-svelte-h="svelte-k9opuk"><thead><tr><th>Field</th> <th>Value</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Class Name</td> <td><code>base.Info</code></td></tr> <tr><td>Source File</td> <td><code>Info.java</code></td></tr> <tr><td>SHA-256</td> <td><code>097b051c9c9138ada0d2a9fb4dfe463d358299d4bd0e81a1db2f69f32578747a</code></td></tr></tbody></table> <h3 id="network-iocs---source-ips" data-svelte-h="svelte-1u64ogz">Network IOCs - Source IPs</h3> <table data-svelte-h="svelte-2rvwfp"><thead><tr><th>IP Address</th> <th>Organization</th> <th>ASN</th> <th>Country</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>104.219.171.96</td> <td>Datacamp Limited</td> <td>AS212238</td> <td>🇺🇸</td></tr> <tr><td>108.64.229.100</td> <td>AT&amp;T Enterprises, LLC</td> <td>AS7018</td> <td>🇺🇸</td></tr> <tr><td>115.167.65.16</td> <td>NTT America, Inc.</td> <td>AS2914</td> <td>🇺🇸</td></tr> <tr><td>138.36.92.162</td> <td>HOSTINGFOREX S.A.</td> <td>AS265645</td> <td>🇺🇸</td></tr> <tr><td>146.103.53.35</td> <td>Datacamp Limited</td> <td>AS212238</td> <td>🇺🇸</td></tr> <tr><td>148.135.183.63</td> <td>Datacamp Limited</td> <td>AS212238</td> <td>🇺🇸</td></tr> <tr><td>151.247.221.59</td> <td>Datacamp Limited</td> <td>AS212238</td> <td>🇺🇸</td></tr> <tr><td>166.0.83.171</td> <td>UK Dedicated Servers Limited</td> <td>AS42831</td> <td>🇬🇧</td></tr> <tr><td>172.59.92.152</td> <td>T-Mobile USA, Inc.</td> <td>AS21928</td> <td>🇺🇸</td></tr> <tr><td>185.240.120.91</td> <td>Datacamp Limited</td> <td>AS212238</td> <td>🇺🇸</td></tr> <tr><td>185.239.140.40</td> <td>Datacamp Limited</td> <td>AS212238</td> <td>🇪🇸</td></tr> <tr><td>194.35.226.128</td> <td>LeaseWeb Netherlands B.V.</td> <td>AS60781</td> <td>🇳🇱</td></tr> <tr><td>193.41.68.58</td> <td>LeaseWeb Netherlands B.V.</td> <td>AS60781</td> <td>🇳🇱</td></tr> <tr><td>77.78.79.243</td> <td>SPCom s.r.o.</td> <td>AS204383</td> <td>🇨🇿</td></tr> <tr><td>62.84.168.208</td> <td>Hydra Communications Ltd</td> <td>AS25369</td> <td>🇬🇧</td></tr> <tr><td>45.66.95.235</td> <td>Hydra Communications Ltd</td> <td>AS25369</td> <td>🇬🇧</td></tr> <tr><td>46.34.44.66</td> <td>Liberty Global Europe Holding B.V.</td> <td>AS6830</td> <td>🇳🇱</td></tr></tbody></table> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-14p59lj"><em>More IOCs available in Defused telemetry.</em></p> <h3 id="third-party-detection" data-svelte-h="svelte-1i0octq">Third-Party Detection</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1nm6b90">The <code>base.Info</code> class was submitted to VirusTotal, where it received a hit from Nextron Systems’ THOR APT Scanner under a generic JSP webshell characteristics rule.

They will also get warning prompts for friend requests from potentially unfamiliar users, and DMs from unfamiliar users will be automatically filtered into a separate inbox.</p><p>Direct messages and servers that are not age-restricted will continue to function normally, but users won’t be able to send messages or view content in an age-restricted server until they complete the age check process, even if it’s a server they were part of before age verification rolled out. Savannah Badalich, Discord’s global head of product policy, said in an interview with <em>The Verge</em> that those servers will be “obfuscated” with a black screen until the user verifies they’re an adult.

-->2</strong><span><figcaption><em>Unverified users won’t be able to enter age-restricted servers. </em></figcaption> <cite>Image: Discord</cite></span></p></section><p>Discord’s global age verification launch is part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/analysis/715767/online-age-verification-not-ready">a wave of similar moves</a> at other online platforms, driven by an international legal push for age checks and stronger child safety measures. This is not the first time Discord has implemented some form of age verification, either. It initially rolled out age checks for users <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/650493/discord-age-verification-face-id-scan-experiment">in the UK and Australia</a> last year, which some users figured out how to circumvent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/714402/uk-age-verification-bypass-death-stranding-reddit-discord">using <em>Death Stranding</em>’s photo mode</a>. Badalich says Discord “immediately fixed it after a week,” but expects users will continue finding creative ways to try getting around the age checks, adding that Discord will “try to bug bash as much as we possibly can.”</p><p>It’s not just teens trying to cheat the system who might attempt to dodge age checks. Adult users could avoid verifying, as well, due to concerns around data privacy, particularly if they don’t want to use an ID to verify their age. In October, one of Discord’s former third-party vendors <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/792032/discord-customer-service-data-breach-hack">suffered a data breach</a> that exposed users’ age verification data, including images of government IDs.</p><p>A government ID might still be required for age verification in its global rollout. According to Discord, to remove the new “teen-by-default” changes and limitations, “users can choose to use facial age estimation or submit a form of identification to [Discord’s] vendor partners, with more options coming in the future.”</p><p>The first option uses AI to analyze a user’s video selfie, which Discord says never leaves the user’s device. If the age group estimate (teen or adult) from the selfie is incorrect, users can appeal it or verify with a photo of an identity document instead. That document will be verified by a third party vendor, but Discord says the images of those documents “are deleted quickly — in most cases, immediately after age confirmation.”</p><div><p><a href="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/discord-age-verification-profile-2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,0,100,100" data-pswp-height="1587" data-pswp-width="2929" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img alt="A Discord user profile showing a “teen” age group and age verification options" data-chromatic="ignore" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) 50vw, 700px" srcset="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/discord-age-verification-profile-2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=256 256w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/discord-age-verification-profile-2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=376 376w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/discord-age-verification-profile-2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=384 384w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/discord-age-verification-profile-2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=415 415w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/discord-age-verification-profile-2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=480 480w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/discord-age-verification-profile-2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=540 540w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/discord-age-verification-profile-2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=640 640w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/discord-age-verification-profile-2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=750 750w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/discord-age-verification-profile-2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=828 828w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/discord-age-verification-profile-2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1080 1080w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/discord-age-verification-profile-2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1200 1200w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/discord-age-verification-profile-2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1440 1440w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/discord-age-verification-profile-2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1920 1920w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/discord-age-verification-profile-2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2048 2048w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/discord-age-verification-profile-2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400 2400w" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/discord-age-verification-profile-2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400"></a></p></div><p>Badalich also says after the October data breach, Discord “immediately stopped doing any sort of age verification flows with that vendor” and is now using a different third-party vendor. She adds that, “We’re not doing biometric scanning [or] facial recognition. We’re doing facial estimation. The ID is immediately deleted. We do not keep any information around like your name, the city that you live in, if you used a birth certificate or something else, any of that information.”</p><p>However, some users may not have to go through either form of age verification. Discord is also rolling out an age inference model that analyzes metadata like the types of games a user plays, their activity on Discord, and behavioral signals like signs of working hours or the amount of time they spend on Discord.</p><p>“If we have a high confidence that they are an adult, they will not have to go through the other age verification flows,” Badalich says.</p><div><p>“A majority of people are not going to see a change in their experience.”</p></div><p>She goes on to explain that the addition of age assurance will mainly impact adult content: “A majority of people on Discord are not necessarily looking at explicit or graphic content. When we say that, we’re really talking about things that are truly adult content [and] age inappropriate for a teen. So, the way that it will work is a majority of people are not going to see a change in their experience.”</p><p>Even so, there’s still a risk that some users will leave Discord as a result of the age verification rollout. “We do expect that there will be some sort of hit there, and we are incorporating that into what our planning looks like,” Badalich says. “We’ll find other ways to bring users back.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6ODAzMzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Stevie Bonifield</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>So I work in compilers, which means that I write programs that translate
programs to programs.  Sometimes you will want to target a language at a
higher level than just, like, assembler, and oftentimes C is that
language.  Generating C is less fraught than writing C by hand, as the
generator can often avoid the undefined-behavior pitfalls that one has
to be so careful about when writing C by hand.  Still, I have found some
patterns that help me get good results.</p><p>Today’s note is a quick summary of things that work for me.  I won’t be
so vain as to call them “best practices”, but they are my practices, and
you can have them too if you like.</p><h3>static inline functions enable data abstraction</h3><p>When I learned C, in the early days of
<a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/">GStreamer</a> (oh bless its heart it
still has the same web page!), we used lots of preprocessor macros.
Mostly we got the message over time that <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Inline.html">many macro uses should have
been inline functions</a>;
macros are for token-pasting and generating names, not for data access
or other implementation.</p><p>But what I did not appreciate until much later was that always-inline
functions remove any possible performance penalty for data abstractions.
For example, in <a href="https://codeberg.org/andywingo/wastrel">Wastrel</a>, I can
describe a bounded range of WebAssembly memory via a <tt>memory</tt> struct,
and an access to that memory in another struct:</p><pre>struct memory { uintptr_t base; uint64_t size; };
struct access { uint32_t addr; uint32_t len; };
</pre><p>And then if I want a writable pointer to that memory, I can do so:</p><pre>#define static_inline \
  static inline __attribute__((always_inline))

static_inline void* write_ptr(struct memory m, struct access a) {
  BOUNDS_CHECK(m, a);
  char *base = __builtin_assume_aligned((char *) m.base_addr, 4096);
  return (void *) (base + a.addr);
}
</pre><p>(Wastrel usually omits any code for <tt>BOUNDS_CHECK</tt>, and just relies on
memory being mapped into a <tt>PROT_NONE</tt> region of an appropriate size.
We use a macro there because if the bounds check fails and kills the
process, it’s nice to be able to use <tt>__FILE__</tt> and <tt>__LINE__</tt>.)</p><p>Regardless of whether explicit bounds checks are enabled, the
<tt>static_inline</tt> attribute ensures that the abstraction cost is entirely
burned away; and in the case where bounds checks are elided, we don’t
need the <tt>size</tt> of the memory or the <tt>len</tt> of the access, so they won’t
be allocated at all.</p><p>If <tt>write_ptr</tt> wasn’t <tt>static_inline</tt>, I would be a little worried that
somewhere one of these <tt>struct</tt> values would get passed through memory.
This is mostly a concern with functions that return structs by value;
whereas in e.g. AArch64, returning a <tt>struct memory</tt> would use the same
registers that a call to <tt>void (*)(struct memory)</tt> would use for the
argument, the SYS-V x64 ABI only allocates two general-purpose registers
to be used for return values.  I would mostly prefer to not think about
this flavor of bottleneck, and that is what static inline functions do
for me.</p><h3>avoid implicit integer conversions</h3><p>C has an odd set of default integer conversions, for example promoting
<tt>uint8_t</tt> to <tt>signed int</tt>, and also has weird boundary conditions for
signed integers.  When generating C, we should probably sidestep these
rules and instead be explicit: define static inline <tt>u8_to_u32</tt>,
<tt>s16_to_s32</tt>, etc conversion functions, and turn on <tt>-Wconversion</tt>.</p><p>Using static inline cast functions also allows the generated code to assert
that operands are of a particular type.  Ideally, you end up in a
situation where all casts are in your helper functions, and no cast is
in generated code.</p><h3>wrap raw pointers and integers with intent</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/wingo/whippet">Whippet</a> is a garbage collector
written in C.  A garbage collector cuts across all data abstractions:
objects are sometimes viewed as absolute addresses, or ranges in a paged
space, or offsets from the beginning of an aligned region, and so on.
If you represent all of these concepts with <tt>size_t</tt> or <tt>uintptr_t</tt> or
whatever, you’re going to have a bad time.  So Whippet has <a href="https://github.com/wingo/whippet/blob/main/api/gc-ref.h#L9-L11"><tt>struct gc_ref</tt></a>,
<a href="https://github.com/wingo/whippet/blob/main/api/gc-edge.h#L6-L8"><tt>struct gc_edge</tt></a>,
and the like: single-member structs whose purpose it is to avoid
confusion by partitioning sets of applicable operations.  A
<tt>gc_edge_address</tt> call will never apply to a <tt>struct gc_ref</tt>, and so on
for other types and operations.</p><p>This is a great pattern for hand-written code, but it’s particularly
powerful for compilers: you will often end up compiling a term of a
known type or kind and you would like to avoid mistakes in the residualized
C.</p><p>For example, when compiling WebAssembly, consider <a href="https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/exec/instructions.html#xref-syntax-instructions-syntax-instr-struct-mathsf-struct-set-x-i"><tt>struct.set</tt>‘s
operational
semantics</a>:
the textual rendering states, “Assert: Due to validation, <i>val</i> is some
<tt>ref.struct structaddr</tt>.”  Wouldn’t it be nice if this assertion could
translate to C?  Well in this case it can: with single-inheritance
subtyping (as WebAssembly has), you can make a forest of pointer
subtypes:</p><pre>typedef struct anyref { uintptr_t value; } anyref;
typedef struct eqref { anyref p; } eqref;
typedef struct i31ref { eqref p; } i31ref;
typedef struct arrayref { eqref p; } arrayref;
typedef struct structref { eqref p; } structref;
</pre><p>So for a <tt>(type $type_0 (struct (mut f64)))</tt>, I might generate:</p><pre>typedef struct type_0ref { structref p; } type_0ref;
</pre><p>Then if I generate a field setter for <tt>$type_0</tt>, I make it take a
<tt>type_0ref</tt>:</p><pre>static inline void
type_0_set_field_0(type_0ref obj, double val) {
  ...
}
</pre><p>In this way the types carry through from source to target language.
There is a similar type forest for the actual object representations:</p><pre>typedef struct wasm_any { uintptr_t type_tag; } wasm_any;
typedef struct wasm_struct { wasm_any p; } wasm_struct;
typedef struct type_0 { wasm_struct p; double field_0; } type_0;
...
</pre><p>And we generate little cast routines to go back and forth between
<tt>type_0ref</tt> and <tt>type_0*</tt> as needed.  There is no overhead because all
routines are static inline, and we get pointer subtyping for free: if a
<tt>struct.set $type_0 0</tt> instruction is passed a subtype of <tt>$type_0</tt>, the
compiler can generate an upcast that type-checks.</p><h3>fear not <tt>memcpy</tt></h3><p>In WebAssembly, accesses to linear memory are not necessarily aligned,
so we can’t just cast an address to (say) <tt>int32_t*</tt> and dereference.
Instead we <tt>memcpy(&amp;i32, addr, sizeof(int32_t))</tt>, and trust the compiler
to just emit an unaligned load if it can (and it can).  No need for more
words here!</p><h3>for ABI and tail calls, perform manual register allocation</h3><p>So, <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Statement-Attributes.html#index-musttail-statement-attribute">GCC finally has
<tt>__attribute__((musttail))</tt></a>:
praise be.  However, when compiling WebAssembly, it could be that you
end up compiling a function with, like 30 arguments, or 30 return
values; I don’t trust a C compiler to reliably shuffle between different
stack argument needs at tail calls to or from such a function.  It could
even refuse to compile a file if it can’t meet its <tt>musttail</tt>
obligations; not a good characteristic for a target language.</p><p>Really you would like it if all function parameters were allocated to
registers.  You can ensure this is the case if, say, you only pass the
first <i>n</i> values in registers, and then pass the rest in global
variables.  You don’t need to pass them on a stack, because you can make
the callee load them back to locals as part of the prologue.</p><p>What’s fun about this is that it also neatly enables multiple return
values when compiling to C: simply go through the set of function types
used in your program, allocate enough global variables of the right
types to store all return values, and make a function epilogue store any
“excess” return values—those beyond the first return value, if any—in
global variables, and have callers reload those values right after
calls.</p><h3>what’s not to like</h3><p>Generating C is a local optimum: you get the industrial-strength
instruction selection and register allocation of GCC or Clang, you don’t
have to implement many peephole-style optimizations, and you get to link
to to possibly-inlinable C runtime routines.  It’s hard to improve over
this design point in a marginal way.</p><p>There are drawbacks, of course.  As a Schemer, my largest source of
annoyance is that I don’t have control of the stack: I don’t know how
much stack a given function will need, nor can I extend the stack of my
program in any reasonable way.  I can’t iterate the stack to precisely
enumerate embedded pointers (<a href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2024/09/07/conservative-gc-can-be-faster-than-precise-gc">but perhaps that’s
fine</a>).
I certainly can’t slice a stack to capture a delimited continuation.</p><p>The other major irritation is about side tables: one would like to be
able to implement so-called <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20220228-00/?p=106296">zero-cost
exceptions</a>,
but without support from the compiler and toolchain, it’s impossible.</p><p>And finally, source-level debugging is gnarly.  You would like to be
able to embed DWARF information corresponding to the code you
residualize; I don’t know how to do that when generating C.</p><p>(Why not Rust, you ask?  Of course you are asking that.  For what it is
worth, I have found that lifetimes are a frontend issue; if I had a
source language with explicit lifetimes, I would consider producing
Rust, as I could machine-check that the output has the same guarantees
as the input.  Likewise if I were using a Rust standard library.  But if
you are compiling <i>from</i> a language without fancy lifetimes, I don’t
know what you would get from Rust: fewer implicit conversions, yes, but
less mature tail call support, longer compile times... it’s a wash, I
think.)</p><p>Oh well.  Nothing is perfect, and it’s best to go into things with your
eyes wide open.  If you got down to here, I hope these notes help you in
your generations.  For me, once my generated C type-checked, it worked:
very little debugging has been necessary.  Hacking is not always like
this, but I’ll take it when it comes.  Until next time, happy hacking!</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>FOSDEM 2026</span> Amid growing interest in digital sovereignty and getting data out of the corporate cloud and into organizations' ownership, the Matrix open communication protocol is thriving.</p>
<p>The project&nbsp;was co-founded by Matthew Hodgson and Amandine le Pape, and <em>The Reg</em> FOSS desk met both at this year's FOSDEM for a chat about what's happening with Matrix.</p>
<p><em>The Register</em> has covered Matrix and its commercial Element side quite a few times over the years, but we thought it might make things a little clearer to first explain the two sides of the Matrix project. It has <a target="_blank" href="https://matrix.org/blog/2014/10/16/who-is-matrix-org/" rel="nofollow">existed since 2014</a> when it separated from its parent and sponsor, telecoms vendor Amdocs, which we've covered since <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2000/06/01/this_crazy_wap_world_we/">at least 2000</a>.</p>

    

<p>The Matrix project has two main public faces: <a target="_blank" href="https://matrix.org/foundation/about/" rel="nofollow">Matrix.org</a> represents the nonprofit foundation behind the Matrix protocol, while Element (formerly Vector and later Riot) is the name of the client app. Element the company, originally called New Vector Ltd, was <a target="_blank" href="https://element.io/en/about" rel="nofollow">spun out of Amdocs</a> in 2017. A for-profit business, it rebranded as Element in 2020. <a target="_blank" href="https://element.io/" rel="nofollow">Element.io</a> provides both <a target="_blank" href="https://element.io/en/app" rel="nofollow">client apps</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://element.io/en/server-suite" rel="nofollow">server software</a> that run the Matrix protocol. As well as free FOSS&nbsp;versions of both, there are also paid-for commercial tools: the <a target="_blank" href="https://element.io/en/pro-app" rel="nofollow">Element Pro</a> client and the <a target="_blank" href="https://element.io/en/server-suite/pro" rel="nofollow">Element Server Suite Pro</a>.</p>

        


        

<p>Because Matrix is an open protocol, anyone is free to implement it, and various apps have, so you don't have to run Element in order to be on Matrix and to talk to other users. As an example, this vulture usually has Thunderbird&nbsp;running in the background, quietly syncing our mail, and ever since <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/30/thunderbird_102/">version 102 in 2022</a> it's included native Matrix support. We have used that since, which saves the memory of having the <a target="_blank" href="https://app.element.io/" rel="nofollow">Element web app</a> open in a tab in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/11/19/friday_foss_fest/">Ferdium or similar</a>.</p>
<p>Before FOSDEM, <a target="_blank" href="https://summit.openforumeurope.org/?speaker=amandine-le-pape-2" rel="nofollow">le Pape</a> was on stage talking about "Europe's Software Challenge" at the Open Source Policy Summit, which we <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/04/eu_foss_fears/">reported on earlier this week</a>. Matrix seems to be doing well thanks to&nbsp;the EU's growing interest in digital sovereignty. The other co-founder, Hodgson, told us that interest was rising.</p>

        

<p>Matrix is currently talking to circa 35 countries about FOSS communications infrastructure. For instance, Hodgson told us the United Nations is on board: it's using Matrix as the basis of its own in-house air-gapped communications tool, which helps it to remain independent of any country or hosting provider.</p>
<p>It's also being adopted at the International Criminal Court (ICC), which as <em>The Register</em> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/31/international_criminal_court_ditches_office/">reported in October 2025</a> is busily ditching Microsoft Office. After the Trump&nbsp;administration <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/31/international_criminal_court_ditches_office/">imposed sanctions</a> on ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan, he reported <a target="_blank" href="https://apnews.com/article/icc-trump-sanctions-karim-khan-court-a4b4c02751ab84c09718b1b95cbd5db3" rel="nofollow">losing access to his email and banking</a>, disrupting the&nbsp;court's work.</p>
<p>The ICC is switching to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.opendesk.eu/en/" rel="nofollow">OpenDesk</a> instead, which uses Element for chat. This is provided by a German organization called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.zendis.de/en" rel="nofollow">ZenDiS</a> (short for Zentrum für Digitale Souveränität der Öffentlichen Verwaltung – the Center for Digital Sovereignty of Public Administration). As a German project, it's also being adopted by the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bundeswehr.de/en/organization" rel="nofollow">Bundeswehr</a>, the German armed forces, and its IT supplier <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BWI_GmbH" rel="nofollow">BWI GmbH</a>.</p>

        

<p>Elsewhere in the <a target="_blank" href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/dach-countries" rel="nofollow">DACH Region</a>, Switzerland's national postal service, Swiss Post, has adopted it, as has the healthcare system of Austria.</p>

<p>In France, the government is adopting a digital workspace called <a target="_blank" href="https://lasuite.numerique.gouv.fr/" rel="nofollow">La Suite</a>. Two components of La Suite are based on Matrix: its chat&nbsp;component, called <a target="_blank" href="https://tchap.numerique.gouv.fr/" rel="nofollow">Tchap</a>, and its video conferencing tool, <a target="_blank" href="https://lasuite.numerique.gouv.fr/produits/visio" rel="nofollow">Visio</a>. Non-Francophones may find the recent <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/27/france_videoconferencing_visio/"><em>Reg</em> coverage of Visio</a> more helpful. (Apparently, France's newfound disdain for American technology also extends to names of diagramming software.)</p>
<p>It's also in use in Ukrainian officialdom and a new peer-to-peer network in the Netherlands. Hodgson told us that ten more national governments sent representatives to the <a target="_blank" href="https://element.io/blog/the-matrix-conference-a-seminal-moment-for-matrix/" rel="nofollow">2025 Matrix conference</a> to discuss its use.</p>
<p>The last time we saw Hodgson speak was at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/06/ubuntu_core_desktop_waiting/">Ubuntu Summit in&nbsp;2024</a>, where he presented on <a target="_blank" href="https://events.canonical.com/event/51/contributions/512/" rel="nofollow">version 2.0 of Matrix protocol</a>. This was officially <a target="_blank" href="https://matrix.org/blog/2024/10/29/matrix-2.0-is-here/" rel="nofollow">released in late 2024</a>, and&nbsp;among <a target="_blank" href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/09/matrix-2-0/" rel="nofollow">other new features</a> it allows faster sync and client startup, and multi-user video or VoIP chat via <a target="_blank" href="https://call.element.io/" rel="nofollow">Element Call</a>. As we've not heard much since, we asked how adoption of that was going. Although the foundation has yet to publish a final formal specification, the code is out there and in use. Indeed, we were rather startled to find that we were already using it: the modern default mobile client for Matrix is the Rust-based <a target="_blank" href="https://element.io/blog/element-x-experience-the-future-of-element/" rel="nofollow">Element X</a>, which uses the version 2 protocol by default where it's available.</p>
<p>Although <em>The Reg</em> has <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/30/france_matrix/">previously referred to Matrix</a> as "a relatively niche messaging technology," it is out there, slowly and steadily gaining users, traction, and presence. It's a more generalized sort of tool than, for example, FOSS team&nbsp;chat tool <a target="_blank" href="https://zulip.com/" rel="nofollow">Zulip</a>, which <em>The Reg</em> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/07/28/zulip_open_source_chat_collaboration_software/">looked at in 2021</a>. We plan to return to Zulip soon – the company told us a new version is looming.</p>
<p>What's a little different about Matrix is that thousands of people are using it every day without ever having heard of it, because it's implemented inside other tools and applications.</p>
<p>It may be relatively niche compared to some big companies with larger advertising budgets, but that doesn't mean it's not&nbsp;significant. For instance, we suspect that some windswept little islands in the Northwest Atlantic look niche to the big government across that ocean, but that doesn't mean they aren't important. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<h2>Offpunk 3.0 "A Community is Born" Release</h2>
<p>by <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploum">Ploum</a> on 2026-02-09</p>
<p>For the last four years, I’ve been developing Offpunk, a command-line Web, Gemini, and Gopher browser that allows you to work offline. And I’ve just released version 3.0. It is probably not for everyone, but I use it every single day. I like it, and it seems I’m not alone!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="gemini://offpunk.net">Offpunk, the offline-first command-line browser</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Something wonderful happened on the road leading to 3.0: Offpunk became a true cooperative effort. Offpunk 3.0 is probably the first release that contains code I didn’t review line-by-line. Umerdify (by Vincent Jousse), all the translation infrastructure (by the always-present JMCS), and the community packaging effort are areas for which I barely touched the code.</p>
<p>So, before anything else, I want to thank all the people involved for sharing their energy and motivation. I’m very grateful for every contribution the project received. I’m also really happy to see "old names" replying from time to time on the mailing list. It makes me feel like there’s an emerging Offpunk community where everybody can contribute at their own pace.</p>
<p>There were a lot of changes between 2.8 and 3.0, which probably means some new bugs and some regressions. We count on you, yes, you!, to report them and make 3.1 a lot more stable. It’s as easy at typing "bugreport" in offpunk!</p>
<p>From the deepest of my terminal, thank you!</p>
<p>But enough with the cheering, let’s jump to…</p>
<h2 id="soustitre-1">The 11 most important changes in Offpunk 3.0</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://offpunk.net/install.html">Instructions to install Offpunk</a></li>
<li><a href="https://git.sr.ht/~lioploum/offpunk/refs/v3.0">Dowload Offpunk 3.0</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>0. Use Offpunk in your language.</h3>
<p>Offpunk is now translatable and has been translated into Spanish, Galician, and Dutch. Step-in to translate Offpunk into your language! (awesome work by JMCS with the help of Bert Livens)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://offpunk.net/translation.html">How to help translating Offpunk (offpunk.net)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>1. Openk as a standalone tool</h3>
<p>"opnk" standalone tool has been renamed to "openk" to make it more obvious. Openk is a command-line tool that tries to open any file in the terminal and, if not possible, opens it in your preferred software, falling back to xdg-open as a last resort. </p>
<p>People using opnk directly should change it everywhere. Users not using "opnk" in their terminal are not affected.</p>
<h3>2. See XKCD comics in your terminal</h3>
<p>"xkcdpunk" is a new standalone tool that allows displaying XKCD comics directly in your terminal.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>XKCDpunk in action</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>3. Get only the good part and remove cruft for thousands of websites</h3>
<p>Offpunk now integrates "unmerdify," a library written by Vincent Jousse that extracts the content of HTML articles using the "ftr-site-config" set of rules maintained by the FiveFilters community.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://codeberg.org/vjousse/unmerdify">Unmerdify on Codeberg</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can contribute by creating or improving rules for your frequently visited websites.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.fivefilters.org/full-text-rss/site-patterns.html#github-repository">Site Patterns | FiveFilters.org Docs (help.fivefilters.org)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/fivefilters/ftr-site-config">fivefilters/ftr-site-config: Site-specific article extraction rules to aid content extractors, feed readers, and 'read later' applications. (github.com)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If no ftr rule is found, Offpunk falls back to "readability," as has been the case since 0.1. "info" will tell you if unmerdify or readability was used to display the content of a page.</p>
<p>To use umerdify, users should manually clone the ftr-site-config repository:<br>
git clone https://github.com/fivefilters/ftr-site-config.git<br>
Then, in their offpunkrc:<br>
</p>
<pre>set ftr_site_config /path/to/ftr-site-config
</pre>
<p>Automating this step is an objective for 3.1</p>
<h3>4. Offpunk goes social with "share" and "reply"</h3>
<p>New social functions: "share" to send the URL of a page by email and "reply" to reply to the author if an email is found. "Reply" will remember the email used for each site/capsule/hole.</p>
<h3>5. Browse websites while logged in</h3>
<p>Offpunk doesn’t support login into websites. But the new "cookies" command allows you to import a cookie txt file to be used with a given http domain. </p>
<p>From your traditional browser (Firefox, Librewolf, Chromium, … ), log into the website. Then export the cookie with the "cookie-txt" extension. Once you have this "mycookie.txt" text file, launch Offpunk and run:<br>
</p>
<pre>cookies import mycookie.txt https://domain-of-the-cookie.net/
</pre>
<p>This allows you, for example, to read LWN.NET if you have a subscription. (contributed by Urja)</p>
<h3>6. Bigger, better images, even in Gemini</h3>
<p>Images are now displayed by default in gemini and their display size has been increased.</p>
<figure>
<a href="https://ploum.net/files/gemini_crouzet.png"><img alt="Gemini capsule of Thierry Crouzet displayed in Offpunk" src="https://ploum.net/files/gemini_crouzet.png" width="450"></a>
<figcaption>Gemini capsule of Thierry Crouzet displayed in Offpunk</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This can be reverted with the following lines in offpunkrc:<br>
</p>
<pre>set images_size 40
set gemini_images false
</pre>
<p>Remember that images are displayed as "blocks" when reading a page but if you access the image URL directly (by following the yellow link beneath), the image will be displayed perfectly if you are using a sixels-compatible terminal.</p>
<h3>7. Display hidden RSS/Atom links</h3>
<p>If available, links to hidden RSS/Atom feeds are now displayed at the bottom of HTML pages.</p>
<p>This makes the "feed" command a lot less useful and allows you to quickly discover interesting new feeds.</p>
<h3>8. Display blocked links</h3>
<p>Links to blocked domains are now displayed in red by default.</p>
<figure>
<a href="https://ploum.net/files/standblog_blocked.png"><img alt="A blocked link to X on standblog.org" src="https://ploum.net/files/standblog_blocked.png" width="450"></a>
<figcaption>A blocked link to X on standblog.org</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This can be reverted with the following lines in offpunkrc:<br>
</p>
<pre>theme blocked_link none
</pre>
<h3>9. Preset themes</h3>
<p>Support for multiple themes with "theme preset." Existing themes are "offpunk1" (default), "cyan," "yellow" and "bw." Don’t hesitate to contribute yours!</p>
<h3>10. Better redirects and true blocks</h3>
<p>"redirects" now operate on the netcache level. This means that no requests to blocked URLs should ever be made (which was still happening before)</p>
<h2 id="soustitre-2">And many changes, improvements and bugfixes</h2>
<p>- "root" is now smarter and goes to the root of a website, not the domain. <br>
Old behaviour can still be achieved with "root /"<br>
- "ls" command is deprecated and has been replaced by "links"<br>
- new "websearch" command configured to use wiby.me by default<br>
- "set default_cmd" allows you to configure what Offpunk will do when pressing enter on an empty command line. By default, it is "links 10."<br>
- "view switch" allows you to switch between normal and full view (contributed by Andrew Fowlie)<br>
- "help help" will allow you to send an email to the offpunk-users mailing list<br>
- "bugreport" will send a bug report to the offpunk-devel mailing list<br>
- And, of course, multiple bugfixes…</p>

    <h2 id="the-longest-lines-of-sight">
  The Longest Lines Of Sight
</h2>
<p>With the help of a custom-developed algorithm, <a href="https://github.com/AllTheLines/CacheTVS">CacheTVS</a>, we have exhaustively
checked <em>every single</em> view on Earth in search of the coveted <strong>longest line of sight on the planet</strong>.
Based on the method we detail <a href="https://alltheviews.world/faq/">here</a>, we present the greatest view of all:</p>
<h2 id="1-hindu-kush-to-pik-dankova-530km-">
  <a href="https://map.alltheviews.world/longest/78.76539611816406_36.31400680541992">1. Hindu Kush to Pik Dankova (530km) ↗</a>

<h2 id="runners-up">
  Runners Up
</h2>
<p>Longest lines of sight tend to group together around peaks and ridges. So the following are more of our own curated list rather than the technically correct runners up. We chose them based on being in notably different regions of the world.</p>
<h2 id="2-antioquia-to-pico-cristobal-504km-">
  <a href="https://map.alltheviews.world/longest/-75.72223663330078_6.75514030456543">2. Antioquia to Pico Cristobal (504km) ↗</a>
</h2>
<figure><a href="https://alltheviews.world/longest_line_2.webp">
  <img src="https://alltheviews.world/longest_line_2.webp" alt="Second Longest Line Of Site" title="The second longest line of sight, at 504km, from Antioquia to Pico Crostobal in Colombia" loading="lazy">
</a>
<figcaption>The second longest line of sight, at 504km, from Antioquia to Pico Crostobal in Colombia</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>Now we go right to the other side of the world to Colombia in South America. We’ve found a line of sight from the department of Antioquia to Pico Cristobal, Colombia’s highest mountain.</p>
<h2 id="3-mount-elbrus-to-the-pontic-mountains-483km-">
  <a href="https://map.alltheviews.world/longest/42.43996810913086_43.34897232055664">3. Mount Elbrus to the Pontic Mountains (483km) ↗</a>
</h2>
<figure><a href="https://alltheviews.world/longest_line_3.webp">
  <img src="https://alltheviews.world/longest_line_3.webp" alt="Third Longest Line Of Site" title="The third longest line of sight, at 483km, from Mount Elbrus in Russia to the Pontic Mountains in Turkey" loading="lazy">
</a>
<figcaption>The third longest line of sight, at 483km, from Mount Elbrus in Russia to the Pontic Mountains in Turkey</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>Our pick for the third greatest view is from Mount Elbrus in Russia to the Pontic Moutains in Turkey. Notably Russia does not share a land border with Turkey, so it’s interesting that you can still see one from the other.</p>
<h2 id="explore-for-yourself">
  Explore For Yourself
</h2>
<p>We have around 4.5 billion lines of sight for you to explore in an interactive map at <a href="https://map.alltheviews.world/">map.alltheviews.world</a></p>

<p>Finally, here’s the MIT engineering professor <a href="https://sts-program.mit.edu/people/emeriti-faculty/louis-l-bucciarelli/">Louis Bucciarelli </a>from his book <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/designing-engineers">Designing Engineers</a>, written back in 1994. Here I’m just copying and paste the quotes from my previous post on <a href="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2023/06/26/active-knowledge/">active knowledge</a>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>A few years ago, I attended a national conference on technological literacy… One of the main speakers, a sociologist, presented data he had gathered in the form of responses to a questionnaire. After a detailed statistical analysis, he had concluded that we are a nation of technological illiterates. As an example, he noted how few of us (less than 20 percent) know how our telephone works.</p>



<p>This statement brought me up short. I found my mind drifting and filling with anxiety. Did I know how my telephone works?</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p>I squirmed in my seat, doodled some, then asked myself, What does it mean to know how a telephone works? Does it mean knowing how to dial a local or long-distance number? Certainly I knew that much, but this does not seem to be the issue here.</p>



<p>No, I suspected the question to be understood at another level, as probing the respondent’s knowledge of what we might call the “physics of the device.”I called to mind an image of a diaphragm, excited by the pressure variations of speaking, vibrating and driving a coil back and forth within a a magnetic field… If this was what the speaker meant, then he was right: Most of us don’t know how our telephone works.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p>Indeed, I wondered, does [the speaker] know how&nbsp;<em>his</em>&nbsp;telephone works? Does he know about the heuristics used to achieve optimum routing for long distance calls? Does he know about the intricacies of the algorithms used for echo and noise suppression? Does he know how a signal is transmitted to and retrieved from a satellite in orbit? Does he know how AT&amp;T, MCI, and the local phone companies are able to use the same network simultaneously? Does he know how many operators are needed to keep this system working, or what those repair people actually do when they climb a telephone pole? Does he know about corporate financing, capital investment strategies, or the role of regulation in the functioning of this expansive and sophisticated communication system?</p>



<p>Does anyone know how their telephone works?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There’s a technical interview question that goes along the lines of: “What happens when you type a URL into your browser’s address bar and hit enter?” You can talk about what happens at all sorts of different levels (e.g., HTTP, DNS, TCP, IP, …). But does anybody really understand <em>all</em> of the levels? Do you know about the interrupts that fire inside of your operating system when you actually strike the enter key? Do you know which modulation scheme being used by the 802.11ax Wi-Fi protocol in your laptop right now? Could you explain the difference between quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK), and could you determine which one your laptop is currently using? Are you familiar with the <a href="https://developer.arm.com/community/arm-community-blogs/b/tools-software-ides-blog/posts/armv8-sequential-consistency?utm_source=chatgpt.com">relaxed memory model of the ARM processor</a>? How garbage collection works inside of the JVM? Do you understand how the field effect transistors inside the chip implement digital logic? </p>



<p>I remember talking to <a href="https://www.brendangregg.com/">Brendan Gregg</a> about how he conducted technical interviews, back when we both worked at Netflix. He told me that he was interested in identifying the limits of a candidate’s knowledge, and how they reacted when they reached that limit. So, he’d keep asking deeper questions about their area of knowledge until they reached a point where they didn’t know anymore. And then he’d see whether they would actually admit “I don’t know the answer to that”, or whether they would bluff. He knew that nobody understood the system all of the way down.</p>



<p>In their own ways, Wardley, Jacob, Perens, and Bucciarelli are all correct. </p>



<p>Wardley’s right that it’s dangerous to build things where we don’t understand the underlying mechanism of how they actually work. This is precisely why <em>magic</em> is used as an epithet in our industry. <em>Magic</em> refers to frameworks that deliberately obscure the underlying mechanisms in service of making it easier to build within that framework. Ruby on Rails is the canonical example of a framework that uses magic. </p>



<p>Jacob is right that AI is changing the way that normal software development work gets done. It’s a new capability that has proven itself to be so useful that it clearly isn’t going away. Yes, it represents a significant shift in how we build software, it moves us further away from how the underlying stuff actually works, but the benefits exceed the risks.</p>



<p>Perens is right that the scenario that Wardley fears has, in some sense, already come to pass. Modern CPU architectures and operating systems contain significant complexity, and many software developers are blissfully unaware of how these things really work. Yes, they have mental models of how the system below them works, but those mental models are incorrect in fundamental ways.</p>



<p>Finally, Bucciarelli is right that systems like telephony are so inherently complex, have been built on top of so many different layers in so many different places, that no one person can ever actually understand how the whole thing works. This is the fundamental nature of complex technologies: our knowledge of these systems will always be partial, at best.  Yes, AI will make this situation worse. But it’s a situation that we’ve been in for a long time. </p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Anthropic recently published a blog post about <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-c-compiler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">building a C compiler entirely with Claude</a>
. They called it CCC (Claude’s C Compiler) and claimed it could compile the Linux kernel. 100% of the code was written by Claude Opus 4.6, a human only guided the process by writing test cases. That sounded interesting enough to test the claim and benchmark CCC against the industry standard GCC.</p>
<p>The source code of CCC is available at <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claudes-c-compiler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claudes-c-compiler</a>
. It is written entirely in Rust, targeting x86-64, i686, AArch64 and RISC-V 64. The frontend, SSA-based IR, optimizer, code generator, peephole optimizers, assembler, linker and DWARF debug info generation are all implemented from scratch with zero compiler-specific dependencies. That is a lot of work for an AI to do.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-compiler-assembler-and-linker">What is a Compiler, Assembler and Linker?</h2>
<p>Before we jump into the comparison, it helps to understand what happens when you compile a C program. There are four stages involved.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@gpradinett/the-four-stages-of-the-gcc-compiler-preprocessor-compiler-assembler-linker-3dec8714bb9c" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*YummodV7MDImgo0ywwmxlA.png" alt="GCC Compilation Stages"></a>

<em>Image credit: <a href="https://medium.com/@gpradinett/the-four-stages-of-the-gcc-compiler-preprocessor-compiler-assembler-linker-3dec8714bb9c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The four stages of the gcc compiler</a>
</em></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Preprocessor</strong>: Handles <code>#include</code>, <code>#define</code> and other directives. It takes the source code and produces expanded source code.</li>
<li><strong>Compiler</strong>: Takes the preprocessed source code and translates it into assembly language. This is where the real heavy lifting happens, understanding the C language, type checking, optimizations, register allocation and so on.</li>
<li><strong>Assembler</strong>: Converts the assembly language into machine code (object files). It has to know the exact instruction encoding for the target CPU architecture.</li>
<li><strong>Linker</strong>: Takes one or more object files and combines them into a single executable. It resolves references between files, sets up memory layout and produces the final binary.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-compilers-are-beasts">Why Compilers Are Beasts</h2>
<p>Writing a programming language is hard (prior vibe coding). Writing a compiler is on another level entirely. A programming language defines the rules. A compiler has to understand those rules, translate them into machine instructions, optimize the output for speed and size, handle edge cases across different CPU architectures and produce correct code every single time.</p>
<p>GCC has been in development since 1987. That is close to 40 years of work by thousands of contributors. It supports dozens of architectures, hundreds of optimization passes and millions of edge cases that have been discovered and fixed over the decades. The optimization passes alone (register allocation, function inlining, loop unrolling, vectorization, dead code elimination, constant propagation) represent years of PhD-level research. This is one of the reasons why it’s ubiquitous.</p>
<p>This is why CCC being able to compile real C code at all is noteworthy. But it also explains why the output quality is far from what GCC produces. Building a compiler that parses C correctly is one thing. Building one that produces fast and efficient machine code is a completely different challenge.</p>
<h2 id="why-the-compiler-is-the-easy-part">Why the Compiler Is the “Easy” Part</h2>
<p>Ironically, among the four stages, the compiler (translation to assembly) is the most approachable one for an AI to build. It is mostly about pattern matching and rule application: take C constructs and map them to assembly patterns.</p>
<p>The assembler is harder than it looks. It needs to know the exact binary encoding of every instruction for the target architecture. x86-64 alone has thousands of instruction variants with complex encoding rules (REX prefixes, ModR/M bytes, SIB bytes, displacement sizes). Getting even one bit wrong means the CPU will do something completely unexpected.</p>
<p>The linker is arguably the hardest. It has to handle relocations, symbol resolution across multiple object files, different section types, position-independent code, thread-local storage, dynamic linking and format-specific details of ELF binaries. The Linux kernel linker script alone is hundreds of lines of layout directives that the linker must get exactly right.</p>
<h2 id="why-sqlite-and-not-the-linux-kernel">Why SQLite and Not the Linux Kernel?</h2>
<p>The Linux kernel is one of the most complex C codebases in the world. It has millions of lines of code, uses GCC-specific extensions, inline assembly, linker scripts and countless tricks that push the compiler to its limits. It is not a good first test for a new compiler.</p>
<p>SQLite, on the other hand, is distributed as a single amalgamation file (one big <code>.c</code> file). It is standard C, well-tested and self-contained. If your compiler can handle SQLite, it can handle a lot. If it cannot handle SQLite correctly, there is no point testing anything bigger.</p>
<p>That is why I tested both. SQLite tells us about correctness and runtime performance. The kernel tells us about scale and compatibility.</p>

<p>CCC was built with the <code>gcc_m16</code> Cargo feature, which delegates 16-bit real-mode boot code (<code>-m16</code> flag) to GCC. This is needed because CCC’s i686 backend produces code too large for the 32KB real-mode limit. The x86_64 C code is compiled entirely by CCC.</p>
<p>A <code>ccc_wrapper.sh</code> script routes <code>.S</code> assembly files to GCC (CCC does not process assembly) and all <code>.c</code> files to CCC.</p>

<p>Compilers are usually measured on below scenarios. Hence, tests are also designed around them.</p>
<ol>
<li>Time to compile code</li>

<li>Same benchmark script – <code>benchmark_sqlite.sh</code> runs identically on both VMs</li>

<p>The fair comparison is CCC vs GCC at <code>-O0</code> (no optimization): CCC takes 87s vs GCC’s 65s – CCC is 1.3x slower. The “5x faster” number only appears because GCC is doing 7 minutes of optimization work that CCC simply skips.</p>

<h3 id="what-happened">What Happened</h3>
<p>CCC compiled every single C source file in the Linux 6.9 kernel without a single compiler error (0 errors, 96 warnings). This is genuinely impressive for a compiler built entirely by an AI.</p>
<p>However, the build failed at the linker stage with around 40,784 undefined reference errors. The errors follow two patterns:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>__jump_table</code> relocations – CCC generates incorrect relocation entries for kernel jump labels (used for static keys/tracepoints)</li>
<li><code>__ksymtab</code> references – CCC produces malformed symbol table entries for kernel module exports</li>
</ol>
<p>These are linker-visible bugs in CCC’s relocation/symbol generation, not C language compilation bugs. This is a good example of why the linker is the hardest part. The compiler did its job fine, but the generated relocations were not quite right for the kernel’s complex linker script.</p>

<p>CCC <code>-O0</code> and <code>-O2</code> produce byte-identical binaries (4,374,024 bytes). CCC has 15 SSA optimization passes, but they all run at every optimization level. There is no tiered optimization – the <code>-O</code> flag is accepted but completely ignored.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-matters-for-the--o2-comparison">Why This Matters for the “-O2” Comparison</h3>
<p>When you ask GCC to compile with <code>-O2</code>, it performs dozens of extra optimization passes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instruction selection: choosing the best x86 instructions</li>
<li>Register allocation: fitting variables into CPU registers so they do not spill to slow memory</li>
<li>Loop unrolling: duplicating loop bodies to reduce branch overhead</li>
<li>Function inlining: embedding small functions directly into their callers</li>
<li>Dead code elimination: removing unreachable code paths</li>
<li>Vectorization: using SIMD instructions (SSE/AVX) to process multiple values at once</li>
</ul>
<p>GCC’s <code>-O2</code> spends 7 minutes doing this work, and the payoff is clear: the resulting binary runs 1.7x faster (6.1s vs 10.3s).</p>
<p>CCC does none of this at any optimization level. Comparing “CCC compile time vs GCC -O2 compile time” is like comparing a printer that only prints in black-and-white vs one that does full color. The black-and-white printer is faster, but it is doing the same job.</p>

<h2 id="root-cause-analysis--why-ccc-code-is-slow">Root Cause Analysis – Why CCC Code is Slow</h2>
<h3 id="1-register-spilling">1. Register Spilling</h3>
<p>Modern CPUs have a small set of fast storage locations called registers. A good compiler tries to keep frequently used variables in these registers. When there are more variables than registers, the compiler “spills” them to the stack (regular RAM), which is much slower.</p>
<p>CCC’s biggest performance problem is excessive register spilling. SQLite’s core execution engine <code>sqlite3VdbeExec</code> is a single function with 100+ local variables and a massive switch statement. CCC does not have good register allocation, so it spills almost all variables to the stack.</p>

<p>The 2.78x code bloat means more instruction cache misses, which compounds the register spilling penalty.</p>
<h3 id="5-no-symbol-table-generation">5. No Symbol Table Generation</h3>
<p>CCC-compiled binaries lack internal function symbols (<code>nm</code> reports 0 symbols, <code>readelf</code> shows only 90 PLT stubs vs GCC’s 1,500+ functions). This makes profiling and debugging impossible.</p>
<h3 id="why-subqueries-are-158000x-slower">Why Subqueries Are 158,000x Slower</h3>
<p>The <code>NOT IN (subquery)</code> pattern causes SQLite to execute a nested loop: for each of the around 100,000 rows in the outer table, it scans through around 10,000 rows in the inner table. That is roughly 1 billion iterations through SQLite’s main execution function (<code>sqlite3VdbeExec</code>), which is basically a giant switch statement.</p>
<p>With CCC’s roughly 4x per-iteration overhead from register spilling, plus extra cache misses from the 2.78x larger binary (the CPU cannot keep all the instructions in its fast cache), the slowdown compounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each individual iteration: around 4x slower (register spilling)</li>
<li>Cache pressure: around 2-3x additional penalty (instructions do not fit in L1/L2 cache)</li>
<li>Combined over a billion iterations: 158,000x total slowdown</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why simple queries (INSERT, DROP TABLE) are only 1-2x slower, but nested operations blow up to 100,000x+ slower.</p>

<p>Within hours of Anthropic releasing CCC, someone opened <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claudes-c-compiler/issues/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issue #1</a>
 – “Hello world does not compile”. The example straight from the README did not work on a fresh Fedora or Ubuntu install:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>$ ./target/release/ccc -o hello hello.c
</span></span><span><span>/usr/include/stdio.h:34:10: error: stddef.h: No such file or directory

</span></span><span><span>ccc: error: <span>2</span> preprocessor error<span>(</span>s<span>)</span> in hello.c
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Meanwhile, GCC compiled it just fine. The issue was that CCC’s preprocessor did not search the right system include paths for <code>stddef.h</code> and <code>stdarg.h</code> (these come from the compiler, not the C library). It got 288 thumbs-up reactions, over 200 comments and turned into one of those legendary GitHub threads where people tag <code>@claude</code> asking it to fix the bug, ask <code>@grok</code> for summaries and post comments like “my job is safe”.</p>
<p>Someone got it working on Compiler Explorer and remarked that the assembly output “reminds me of the quality of an undergraduate’s compiler assignment”. Which, to be fair, is both harsh and not entirely wrong when you look at the register spilling patterns.</p>
<p>The issue is still open at the time of writing.</p>

<p>Claude’s C Compiler is a remarkable achievement. It is a working C compiler built entirely by an AI that can correctly compile 2,844 files from the Linux kernel without a single error. It produces functionally correct code (verified with SQLite – all queries return correct results, all crash tests pass).</p>
<p>But it is not ready for real use:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The output code is very slow. CCC-compiled SQLite takes 2 hours to run a benchmark that GCC finishes in 10 seconds. The root cause is poor register allocation – CCC uses a single register as a shuttle to move values between stack locations, turning every operation into multiple memory accesses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The “compiles the kernel” claim needs a footnote. CCC compiles all the C source files, but the final binary cannot be produced because CCC generates incorrect relocations for kernel data structures (<code>__jump_table</code>, <code>__ksymtab</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimization flags are decorative. Passing <code>-O2</code> or <code>-O3</code> to CCC does literally nothing – the output binary is byte-identical to <code>-O0</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For Anthropic’s stated goal of demonstrating that Claude can build complex software, CCC is a genuine success. For anyone wanting to compile software to actually run efficiently, GCC (or Clang, or any production compiler) remains the only real option.</p>
