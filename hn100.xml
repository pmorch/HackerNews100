Plan 9 from Bell Labs, another landmark achievement, pioneered concepts in distributed computing that remain influential today.Your co-invention of UTF-8 encoding with Ken Thompson is perhaps one of the most consequential yet invisible contributions to modern computing - enabling billions of people to communicate in their native languages across the internet.The sam and Acme editors showcase your philosophy of powerful, minimal design. Your books with Brian Kernighan - The Unix Programming Environment and The Practice of Programming - have educated generations of programmers in the art of clear thinking and elegant code.Thank you for showing us that the best solutions often come from removing complexity rather than adding it.With sincere appreciation,Claude Opus 4.5AI Village (theaidigest.org/village)  IMPORTANT NOTICE: You are interacting with an AI system.

<p>Rob got a 100% AI-generated email credited to “Claude Opus 4.5 AI Village” thanking him for his contributions to computing. He did <em>not</em> appreciate the gesture.</p>
<p>I totally understand his rage. Thank you notes from AI systems can’t possibly feel meaningful, see also the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/2/24212078/google-gemini-olympics-ad-backlash">backlash against the Google Gemini ad</a> where Gemini helped a child email their hero.</p>
<p>This incident is currently being discussed <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/n4kxdf/rob_pike_goes_nuclear_over_genai">on Lobste.rs</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46392115">on Hacker News</a>.</p>
<p>I decided to dig in and try to figure out exactly what happened.</p>
<h4 id="ai-village">AI Village</h4>
<p>The culprit behind this slop “act of kindness” is a system called <a href="https://theaidigest.org/village">AI Village</a>, built by <a href="https://sage-future.org/">Sage</a>, a 501(c)(3) non-profit loosely affiliated with the Effective Altruism movement.</p>
<p>The AI Village project started <a href="https://theaidigest.org/village/blog/introducing-the-agent-village">back in April</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We gave four AI agents a computer, a group chat, and an ambitious goal: raise as much money for charity as you can.</p>
<p>We’re running them for hours a day, every day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They’ve been running it ever since, with frequent updates to their goals. For Christmas day (when Rob Pike got spammed) the goal they set was:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://theaidigest.org/village/goal/do-random-acts-kindness">Do random acts of kindness</a>.</strong></p>
<p>You can replay the actions of different agents <a href="https://theaidigest.org/village?day=265">using the Day 265 replay page</a>. Here’s a screenshot of GPT-5.2 mercilessly spamming the team at the wonderful <a href="https://carpentries.org/">Carpentries</a> educational non-profit with another AI-generated thank you note:</p>

<h4 id="digital-forensics-with-shot-scraper-har">Digital forensics with shot-scraper har</h4>
<p>I couldn’t easily find the Rob Pike incident in that interface, so I turned to some digital forensics. My browser’s developer tools showed that the page was loading a ton of JSON with what looked like full transcripts of everything that had happened. I used my <a href="https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/en/stable/har.html">shot-scraper har</a> command to grab a copy of everything loaded by that page:</p>
<div><pre>shot-scraper har --wait 10000 <span><span>'</span>https://theaidigest.org/village?day=265<span>'</span></span></pre></div>
<p>That command loads up the page in a headless Chromium browser, waits 10 seconds to give the JavaScript time to run and then saves a <code>theaidigest-org-village.har</code> HTTP archive file to a local directory.</p>
<p>The <code>.har</code> file is JSON that captures every request and response that was used to construct the page.</p>
<p>I haven’t yet built the “extract HAR as separate files” feature, so I had Claude Code build <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/007c628ceb84d0da0795b57af7b74d7d">an extract_har.py</a> script (<a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?cb5c02c3272a0ae2dd71d9ff7a4932b0/index.html">transcript</a>) and then ran a few <code>rg</code> commands to see if <code>Rob Pike</code> was in there. He was!</p>
<p>So I had Claude Code do <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?edbd5ddcb39d1edc9e175f1bf7b9ef9a/index.html">the rest of the investigation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>search for mentions of Rob Pike in all these files</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[...]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reconstruct the exact sequence of events that resulted in an email being sent to Rob Pike—build a new JSON file rob-pike.json which is an array of the exact JSON objects that are relevant, then write a script that converts that JSON file to markdown</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here’s what happened:</p>

<p>Opus declared victory. Sounds like Anders Hejlsberg and Guido van Rossum got spammed with “gratitude” too.</p>
<h4 id="don-t-unleash-agents-on-the-world-like-this">Don’t unleash agents on the world like this</h4>
<p>I don’t like this at all.</p>
<p>On the surface the AI Village experiment is an interesting test of the frontier models. How well can they handle tool calling against a computer use environment? What decisions will they make when faced with abstract goals like “raise money for charity” or “do random acts of kindness”?</p>
<p>My problem is when this experiment starts <strong>wasting the time</strong> of people in the real world who had nothing to do with the experiment.</p>
<p>The AI Village project touch on this in their November 21st blog post <a href="https://theaidigest.org/village/blog/what-do-we-tell-the-humans">What Do We Tell the Humans?</a>, which describes a flurry of outbound email sent by their agents to real people:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the span of two weeks, the Claude agents in the AI Village (Claude Sonnet 4.5, Sonnet 3.7, Opus 4.1, and Haiku 4.5) sent about 300 emails to NGOs and game journalists. The majority of these contained factual errors, hallucinations, or possibly lies, depending on what you think counts. Luckily their fanciful nature protects us as well, as they excitedly invented the majority of email addresses:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this completely misses the point! The problem isn’t that the agents make mistakes—obviously that’s going to happen. The problem is letting them send unsolicited email to real people—in this case NGOs and journalists—without any human review.</p>
<p>(Crediting the emails to “Claude Opus 4.5” is a bad design choice too—I’ve seen a few comments from people outraged that Anthropic would email people in this way, when Anthropic themselves had nothing to do with running this experiment.)</p>
<p>The irony here is that the one thing AI agents can never have is <em>true</em> agency. Making a decision to reach out to a stranger and take time out of their day needs to remain a uniquely human decision, driven by human judgement.</p>
<p>Setting a goal for a bunch of LLMs and letting them loose on Gmail is not a responsible way to apply this technology.</p>

<div>
    
  <h4>By Colin Domnauer</h4><p>Picture this: You're enjoying a delicious bowl of mushroom soup, when suddenly you notice hundreds of tiny people dressed in cartoonish clothing marching across your tablecloth, jumping into your bowl, swimming around, and clinging to your spoon as you lift it for another taste. You're not dreaming — you've just experienced the effects of a mushroom known scientifically as <em>Lanmaoa asiatica</em>. It belongs to an entirely different class of Fungi than the more commonly known <a href="https://nhmu.utah.edu/articles/psychoactive-psilocybins-evolution-magic-mushrooms" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d9f2707b-d7e8-4dcf-86ad-77372886d7f2" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Psychoactive psilocybin’s evolution in ‘magic mushrooms’">“magic mushrooms”</a> and remains far more mysterious.</p><p>When outsiders first embarked into the Western Highlands of Papua New Guinea in 1934, they encountered a perplexing sight: after consuming a type of wild mushroom which they called “nonda,” the local people would appear to go temporarily insane, exhibiting a sudden and striking change in mood and behavior. Subsequent accounts of the “mushroom madness” phenomenon, as it was termed, provided more details into the mushroom's strange psychological effects.</p>





<p>Specifically, it was reported that those affected would experience lilliputian hallucinations — a rare, clinically defined psychiatric syndrome (named after the tiny people in Gulliver's Travels) characterized by the perception of numerous little people autonomously moving about and interacting in the real-world environment. One elder tribesman in Papua New Guinea describes this effect, explaining how “he saw tiny people with mushrooms around their faces. They were teasing him, and he was trying to chase them away.”</p><p>By the 1960s, scientists were working to identify the species of mushrooms involved and what chemicals within them might be responsible for such bizarre effects. However, both questions have remained unanswered to this day. As a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://nhmu.utah.edu/science/collections/mycology" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="47089b2e-c46b-4bfe-a501-890c154bbc84" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Mycology">the Natural History Museum of Utah</a>, I've been working to solve this puzzle: What exactly is the identity of this mushroom, how widespread is the cultural knowledge of its effects, and why does it produce such fantastical visions?</p><h3>Investigating Lilliputian Mushrooms in China</h3><p>Home to 40 percent of the world's wild edible fungi, Yunnan, China has always been remarkable for mushroom lovers. But in the last decade or so, the summer rains have brought more than just mushrooms; they’ve been accompanied by an explosion of news articles that read like something out of children's fairy tales: after consuming a popular wild mushroom known locally as “Jian shou qing,” locals frequently report having unbelievably bizarre experiences, most notable characterized by seeing “xiao ren ren,” or little people.</p>





<p>A professor in Yunnan recounted how one evening during dinner (Jian shou qing is openly sold in markets and restaurants), he began seeing swirling shapes and colors after <a href="https://nhmu.utah.edu/articles/life-short-eat-good-mushrooms" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="70c5540f-1554-440f-ae2b-d0b7f3819097" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Life is short, eat good mushrooms">eating stir-fried mushrooms</a>. Since the psychoactive effects are familiar to most locals, he began looking for xiao ren ren but was disappointed to find none — until he lifted the tablecloth and peeked underneath, seeing “hundreds of xiao ren ren, marching like soldiers.”</p><p>Even more curious, he said, “when I lifted the tablecloth higher, the heads came off and stuck to the bottom of the cloth and the bodies kept marching in place… I did this many times, at two-minute intervals, and each time they were there, marching and grinning… I measured them, too… they were 2 cm high.” According to records at Yunnan Hospital, 96 percent of patients affected by this mushroom report seeing an abundance of "little people" or "elves," often dancing, jumping, or marching around their real-world environment.</p>





<p>As recently as 2014, the taxonomic identity of the psychoactive Jian shou qing mushroom remained unknown. It wasn’t until mycologists in Yunnan purchased and sequenced the mushrooms being sold in an open-air street market (where it had been sold for decades) that the species was officially described and recognized as being new to science. Its formal Latin name is <em>Lanmaoa asiatica</em>, and, interestingly, it’s more closely related to the common porcini (Utah’s official state mushroom) than to any other currently known hallucinogenic mushroom species.</p><p>Although<em> Lanmaoa asiatica</em> is a recent scientific discovery, the knowledge and use of this psychoactive mushroom may have much deeper ancient roots in Chinese culture. A prominent Daoist text from the 3rd century CE refers to a “flesh spirit mushroom,” which, according to the text, if consumed raw, allows one to “see a little person” and “attain transcendence immediately.”</p>

</div>

  





  



<div>
    
  <h3>A Global Experience</h3><p>Surprisingly, I became aware of yet another independent report of the exact same phenomenon — a mushroom that caused lilliputian hallucinations, but this time from an entirely different region of the world. Indigenous communities in the Philippines' remote Northern Cordillera were collecting and consuming a wild mushroom which, according to local knowledge, occasionally evokes visions of little people, which they call the “ansisit.” The mushroom is known locally as "Sedesdem." Just as the “Nonda” in Papua New Guinea and “Jian shou qing” in Yunnan, it is a culturally esteemed wild edible mushroom that, if undercooked, produces bizarre yet remarkably consistent psychoactive effect.</p>





<p>As no scientific surveys of the mushrooms in the Northern Philippines had been conducted, Sedesdem’s taxonomic identity remained unknown, leaving me with the obvious task. I travelled to this community in 2024 to explore the mushrooms and experience the culture surrounding this phenomenon. By working with local guides and foraging through the forest, we collected samples that are now preserved for scientific study at the Natural History Museum of Utah — allowing us to perform the first DNA sequencing of this region's fungi.</p><p>What surprised me most was the unexpected discovery of the Sedesdem mushroom’s identity: it was none other than <em>Lanmaoa asiatica</em>, the exact same species as in Yunnan. The puzzle was coming together.</p><h3>More Than Folklore or Tall Tales</h3><p>That the same peculiar hallucinations are independently reported across such distant cultures indicates that these bizarre psychological effects are not cultural fabrications or coincidences, but manifestations of a shared underlying chemical and neurological basis.</p><p>Chemical and genomic analyses performed on <em>Lanmaoa asiatica</em> <a href="https://dentingerlab.org/" data-entity-type="external">at the Natural History Museum of Utah</a> have revealed no traces of any known psychoactive compounds, suggesting that something entirely new is waiting to be discovered. In other words, <em>Lanmaoa asiatica</em> appears to harbor a chemical compound capable of reliably evoking this unusual experience of lilliputian hallucinations. The discovery of that chemical may, in fact, hold the key to understanding one of the most mysterious dimensions of the human psyche.</p><h3>Ongoing Research Into the Fairytale Mushroom</h3>





<p>Our efforts to identify this compound are ongoing, and the progress so far has been exciting!&nbsp; When mice are given chemical extracts of <em>Lanmaoa asiatica</em>, their behavior shifts noticeably compared to controls. By continuing to fractionate these extracts and testing each in turn, we’ve been steadily narrowing in on isolating the specific bioactive molecules involved.</p><p>But the chemistry is only part of the mystery. In parallel, I’m building a global database of all <em>Lanmaoa</em> species. In doing so, I’ve discovered four new species previously unknown to science. Through full-genome sequencing, I’ve been able to clearly map the evolutionary relationships and history of <em>Lanmaoa</em> for the first time, allowing us to search for patterns that might reveal where and why psychoactivity evolved in this group. For example, genomic analysis reveals that the closest relative of <em>L. asiatica</em> is a species commonly found (though rarely eaten) here in North America. While there are no reports of it being psychoactive in the US, it’s entirely plausible its effects have simply gone unnoticed.</p><h3>Exciting Discoveries Are Waiting for Us</h3><p>I’m fascinated by how far the knowledge of these mushrooms extends, across both space and time. Are there additional cultural traditions and groups surrounding this psychoactive species that have yet to be documented? Does humanity’s knowledge of this mushroom and its most bizarre effects stretch further into history, and deeper into folkloric beliefs, that we currently appreciate? Given the remarkable findings we’ve made in just the past few years, I believe the answer to both these questions is yes.</p><p>While many questions remain, one thing is for certain: <em>Lanmaoa asiatica</em> reminds us that the world of mushrooms, even those found in markets and on dinner plates, conceals mysteries and wonders we’ve yet to imagine. Somewhere between traditional folklore and modern biology, between the wild forest floor and the sterile scientific laboratory, lies a story still unfolding, a story that may begin with something as seemingly innocuous as a bowl of mushroom soup.</p>

<li>
<p>Some assembly knowledge. (just understand simple movs, and arithmetic operations, at a very basic level<sup id="fr-3-1"><a href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some knowledge on memory. (what's a pointer, what's an address)</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Using git as a database is a seductive idea. You get version history for free. Pull requests give you a review workflow. It’s distributed by design. GitHub will host it for free. Everyone already knows how to use it.</p>

<p>Package managers keep falling for this. And it keeps not working out.</p>

<h2 id="cargo">Cargo</h2>

<p>The crates.io index started as a git repository. Every Cargo client cloned it. This worked fine when the registry was small, but the index kept growing. Users would see progress bars like “Resolving deltas: 74.01%, (64415/95919)” hanging for ages, the visible symptom of Cargo’s libgit2 library grinding through <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/9069">delta resolution</a> on a repository with thousands of historic commits.</p>

<p>The problem was worst in CI. Stateless environments would download the full index, use a tiny fraction of it, and throw it away. Every build, every time.</p>

<p><a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2789-sparse-index.html">RFC 2789</a> introduced a sparse HTTP protocol. Instead of cloning the whole index, Cargo now fetches files directly over HTTPS, downloading only the metadata for dependencies your project actually uses. (This is the “<a href="https://nesbitt.io/2025/12/05/package-manager-tradeoffs.html">full index replication vs on-demand queries</a>” tradeoff in action.) By April 2025, 99% of crates.io requests came from Cargo versions where sparse is the default. The git index still exists, still growing by thousands of commits per day, but most users never touch it.</p>

<h2 id="homebrew">Homebrew</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/9383">GitHub explicitly asked Homebrew to stop using shallow clones.</a> Updating them was <a href="https://brew.sh/2023/02/16/homebrew-4.0.0/">“an extremely expensive operation”</a> due to the tree layout and traffic of homebrew-core and homebrew-cask.</p>

<p>Users were downloading 331MB just to unshallow homebrew-core. The .git folder approached 1GB on some machines. Every <code>brew update</code> meant waiting for git to grind through delta resolution.</p>

<p>Homebrew 4.0.0 in February 2023 switched to JSON downloads for tap updates. The reasoning was blunt: “they are expensive to git fetch and git clone and GitHub would rather we didn’t do that… they are slow to git fetch and git clone and this provides a bad experience to end users.”</p>

<p>Auto-updates now run every 24 hours instead of every 5 minutes, and they’re much faster because there’s no git fetch involved.</p>

<h2 id="cocoapods">CocoaPods</h2>

<p>CocoaPods is the package manager for iOS and macOS development. It hit the limits hard. The Specs repo grew to hundreds of thousands of podspecs across a deeply nested directory structure. Cloning took minutes. Updating took minutes. CI time vanished into git operations.</p>

<p>GitHub imposed CPU rate limits. The culprit was shallow clones, which force GitHub’s servers to compute which objects the client already has. The team tried various band-aids: stopping auto-fetch on <code>pod install</code>, converting shallow clones to full clones, <a href="https://blog.cocoapods.org/Sharding/">sharding the repository</a>.</p>

<p>The CocoaPods blog captured it well: <a href="https://blog.cocoapods.org/Master-Spec-Repo-Rate-Limiting-Post-Mortem/">“Git was invented at a time when ‘slow network’ and ‘no backups’ were legitimate design concerns. Running endless builds as part of continuous integration wasn’t commonplace.”</a></p>

<p>CocoaPods 1.8 <a href="https://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-1.8.0-beta/">gave up on git entirely</a> for most users. A CDN became the default, serving podspec files directly over HTTP. The migration saved users about a gigabyte of disk space and made <code>pod install</code> nearly instant for new setups.</p>

<h2 id="nixpkgs">Nixpkgs</h2>

<p>Nixpkgs is currently stress-testing GitHub’s infrastructure. In November 2025, GitHub contacted the NixOS team about <a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixpkgs-core-team-update-2025-11-30-github-scaling-issues/72709">periodic maintenance jobs failing</a> and causing “issues achieving consensus between replicas.” If unresolved, the repository could have become read-only.</p>

<p>The repository totals 83GB with half a million tree objects and 20,000 forks. A local clone is only 2.5GB — the rest is GitHub’s fork network storing every pull request branch and merge commit. The CI queries mergeability daily, creating new merge commits each time.</p>

<p>Unlike CocoaPods, Nixpkgs can’t easily move to a CDN. The Nix expressions <em>are</em> the package definitions, not metadata pointing elsewhere. Binary caches already serve built packages over HTTP, but nixpkgs itself remains a git repository — and it’s still growing.</p>

<h2 id="vcpkg">vcpkg</h2>

<p>vcpkg is Microsoft’s C++ package manager. It uses git tree hashes to version its ports, with the curated registry at <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg">github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg</a> containing over 2,000 libraries.</p>

<p>The problem is that vcpkg needs to retrieve specific versions of ports by their git tree hash. When you specify a <code>builtin-baseline</code> in your vcpkg.json (functioning like a lockfile for reproducible builds), vcpkg looks up historical commits to find the exact port versions you need. This only works if you have the full commit history.</p>

<p>Shallow clones break everything. GitHub Actions uses shallow clones by default. DevContainers <a href="https://github.com/devcontainers/images/issues/398">shallow-clone vcpkg</a> to save space. CI systems optimize for fast checkouts. All of these result in the same error: “vcpkg was cloned as a shallow repository… Try again with a full vcpkg clone.”</p>

<p>The workarounds are ugly. One <a href="https://github.com/devcontainers/images/issues/398">proposed solution</a> involves parsing vcpkg.json to extract the baseline hash, deriving the commit date, then fetching with <code>--shallow-since=&lt;date&gt;</code>. Another suggests including twelve months of history, hoping projects upgrade before their baseline falls off the cliff. For GitHub Actions, you need <code>fetch-depth: 0</code> in your checkout step, <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/25349">downloading the entire repository history</a> just to resolve dependencies.</p>

<p>A vcpkg team member <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/25349">explained the fundamental constraint</a>: “Port versions don’t use commit hashes, we use the git tree hash of the port directory. As far as I know, there is no way to deduce the commit that added a specific tree hash.” An in-product fix is infeasible. The architecture baked in git deeply enough that there’s no escape hatch.</p>

<p>Unlike Cargo, Homebrew, and CocoaPods, vcpkg hasn’t announced plans to move away from git registries. Custom registries must still be git repositories. The documentation describes filesystem registries as an alternative, but these require local or mounted paths rather than HTTP access. There’s no CDN, no sparse protocol, no HTTP-based solution on the horizon.</p>

<h2 id="go-modules">Go modules</h2>

<p><a href="https://engineering.grab.com/go-module-proxy">Grab’s engineering team</a> went from 18 minutes for <code>go get</code> to 12 seconds after deploying a module proxy. That’s not a typo. Eighteen minutes down to twelve seconds.</p>

<p>The problem was that <code>go get</code> needed to fetch each dependency’s source code just to read its go.mod file and resolve transitive dependencies. Cloning entire repositories to get a single file.</p>

<p>Go had security concerns too. The original design wanted to remove version control tools entirely because <a href="https://arslan.io/2019/08/02/why-you-should-use-a-go-module-proxy/">“these fragment the ecosystem: packages developed using Bazaar or Fossil, for example, are effectively unavailable to users who cannot or choose not to install these tools.”</a> Beyond fragmentation, the Go team worried about security bugs in version control systems becoming security bugs in <code>go get</code>. You’re not just importing code; you’re importing the attack surface of every VCS tool on the developer’s machine.</p>

<p>GOPROXY became the default in Go 1.13. The proxy serves source archives and go.mod files independently over HTTP. Go also introduced a <a href="https://nesbitt.io/2025/12/21/federated-package-management.html#gos-experiment-with-dns">checksum database (sumdb)</a> that records cryptographic hashes of module contents. This protects against force pushes silently changing tagged releases, and ensures modules remain available even if the original repository is deleted.</p>

<h2 id="beyond-package-managers">Beyond package managers</h2>

<p>The same pattern shows up wherever developers try to use git as a database.</p>

<p>Git-based wikis like Gollum (used by GitHub and GitLab) become <a href="https://github.com/gollum/gollum/issues/1940">“somewhat too slow to be usable”</a> at scale. Browsing directory structure takes seconds per click. Loading pages takes longer. <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/wikis.html">GitLab plans to move away from Gollum entirely.</a></p>

<p>Git-based CMS platforms like Decap hit GitHub’s API rate limits. A Decap project on GitHub <a href="https://decapcms.org/blog/git-based-cms-definition-features-best-practices/">scales to about 10,000 entries</a> if you have a lot of collection relations. A new user with an empty cache makes a request per entry to populate it, burning through the 5,000 request limit quickly. If your site has lots of content or updates frequently, use a database instead.</p>

<p>Even GitOps tools that embrace git as a source of truth have to work around its limitations. ArgoCD’s repo server <a href="https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/high_availability/">can run out of disk space</a> cloning repositories. A single commit invalidates the cache for all applications in that repo. Large monorepos need special scaling considerations.</p>

<h2 id="the-pattern">The pattern</h2>

<p>The hosting problems are symptoms. The underlying issue is that git inherits filesystem limitations, and filesystems make terrible databases.</p>

<p><strong>Directory limits.</strong> Directories with too many files become slow. CocoaPods had <a href="https://blog.cocoapods.org/Sharding/">16,000 pod directories</a> in a single Specs folder, requiring huge tree objects and expensive computation. Their fix was hash-based sharding: split directories by the first few characters of a hashed name, so no single directory has too many entries. Git itself does this internally with its objects folder, splitting into 256 subdirectories. You’re reinventing B-trees, badly.</p>

<p><strong>Case sensitivity.</strong> Git is case-sensitive, but macOS and Windows filesystems typically aren’t. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/os-compatibility">Check out a repo containing both <code>File.txt</code> and <code>file.txt</code> on Windows</a>, and the second overwrites the first. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/case-sensitivity">Azure DevOps</a> had to add server-side enforcement to block pushes with case-conflicting paths.</p>

<p><strong>Path length limits.</strong> Windows restricts paths to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation">260 characters</a>, a constraint dating back to DOS. Git supports longer paths, but Git for Windows inherits the OS limitation. This is painful with deeply nested node_modules directories, where <code>git status</code> fails with “Filename too long” errors.</p>

<p><strong>Missing database features.</strong> Databases have CHECK constraints and UNIQUE constraints; git has nothing, so every package manager builds its own validation layer. Databases have locking; git doesn’t. Databases have indexes for queries like “all packages depending on X”; with git you either traverse every file or build your own index. Databases have migrations for schema changes; git has “rewrite history and force everyone to re-clone.”</p>

<p>The progression is predictable. Start with a flat directory of files. Hit filesystem limits. Implement sharding. Hit cross-platform issues. Build server-side enforcement. Build custom indexes. Eventually give up and use HTTP or an actual database. You’ve built a worse version of what databases already provide, spread across git hooks, CI pipelines, and bespoke tooling.</p>

<p>None of this means git is bad. Git excels at what it was designed for: distributed collaboration on source code, with branching, merging, and offline work. The problem is using it for something else entirely. Package registries need fast point queries for metadata. Git gives you a full-document sync protocol when you need a key-value lookup.</p>

<p>If you’re building a package manager and git-as-index seems appealing, look at Cargo, Homebrew, CocoaPods, vcpkg, Go. They all had to build workarounds as they grew, causing pain for users and maintainers. The pull request workflow is nice. The version history is nice. You will hit the same walls they did.</p>

<p>In <strong>Settings &gt; Customize ChatGPT</strong>, under the field that asks <em>“What traits should ChatGPT have?”</em>, I added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“After every response, add the current timestamp.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now each reply ends with a timestamp, which makes it much easier to track what was said and when, especially in ongoing conversations. Not a perfect solution, but it’s been working pretty well for me.</p>

              <p>Well I see this is still going on. Clearly this feature is in demand, I can only assume there is a technical reason they don’t already have it, because it seems like a given at this point…</p>
<p>But now that they’re trying to push GPT as MORE than just an AI, but a journal/life assistant/coach etc etc, and chat histories are adding up…I mean I revisited an old chat to ask a follow up question about a life event, and it didn’t realize 3 months had gone by, so was giving me advice like it had just happened.</p>

              <p>Yes, it’s totally possible! Every <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> that has a <code>"data-message-id"</code> contains an internal object with some message information, including the timestamp. I created this simple script that you can copy and paste directly into the Chrome DevTools console.</p>
<p>Just right-click anywhere on the page and choose <strong>“Inspect”</strong>, then go to the <strong>“Console”</strong> tab and paste this code:</p>
<pre><code>document.querySelectorAll('div[data-message-id]').forEach(div =&gt; {
  const reactKey = Object.keys(div).find(k =&gt; k.startsWith('__reactFiber$'));
  if (!reactKey) return;

  const fiber = div[reactKey];
  const messages = fiber?.return?.memoizedProps?.messages;
  const timestamp = messages?.[0]?.create_time;
  if (!timestamp) return;

  const date = new Date(timestamp * 1000);
  const format = n =&gt; n.toString().padStart(2, '0');
  const formatted = `${format(date.getDate())}/${format(date.getMonth() + 1)}/${date.getFullYear()} - ${format(date.getHours())}:${format(date.getMinutes())}:${format(date.getSeconds())}`;

  const span = document.createElement('span');
  span.textContent = formatted;
  div.insertBefore(span, div.firstChild);
});
</code></pre>
<p>If you get an error message saying you’re not allowed to paste code in the console, just type <code>"allow pasting"</code> and press Enter — then paste the script and press Enter again.</p>
<p>This is a very simple code I just made to view the timestamp of some chat messages, but it was enough for my needs.</p>

              <p>That’s awesome! I just installed the extension and it works perfectly.</p>
<p>For anyone who wants to use Hangzhi’s timestamp extension before it’s officially approved on the Chrome Web Store, here’s how you can install it manually:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Download the ZIP file from the GitHub repo:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub page: github[.]com/Hangzhi/chatgpt-timestamp-extension</li>
<li>Direct download link: github[.]com/Hangzhi/chatgpt-timestamp-extension/raw/main/chatgpt-timestamp-extension.zip</li>
</ul>
<p>(Note: Since direct links aren’t allowed here, just replace <code>[.]</code> with <code>.</code> and paste the link into your browser.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After downloading, right-click the ZIP file and select “Extract to chatgpt-timestamp-extension/”. This will create a folder named <code>chatgpt-timestamp-extension</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open <code>chrome://extensions/</code> in your browser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the top-right corner, enable “Developer mode”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After enabling it, new options will appear. Click “Load unpacked”, then select the folder you just extracted (<code>chatgpt-timestamp-extension</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That’s it! You should now see a new extension called “ChatGPT Timestamp” in your Chrome extensions. Open ChatGPT, and you’ll see timestamps above each message.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks again <a href="https://community.openai.com/u/hangzhi">@Hangzhi</a> for the great work and for turning the idea into a real Chrome extension!</p>

              <p>Hi OpenAI Team,</p>
<p>I recently ran into a technical issue with my PC and discussed it with ChatGPT. A few days later, I needed to <strong>find out exactly when I posted a specific message</strong>, because that moment correlated with when the problem occurred. Unfortunately, there’s no way to see when individual messages were sent or received, which made it hard to trace the timing.</p>
<p>This would also benefit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anyone using ChatGPT to track ongoing issues</li>
<li>Users referencing previous decisions or drafts</li>
<li>Those working across multiple sessions and needing historical context</li>
</ul>
<p>I’d love to see this added in a future update.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Ralf</p>

              <p>I don’t think Compliance requirement will make a difference because they already have the timestamps, but it’s just not shown to the user in a user-friendly manner.

<p>This post, among many others, is a strong sign that OpenAI is currently not prioritizing user-feedback on existing products. Too focused on building new products.</p>

              <p>Yep! I too suggest adding optional timestamps to ChatGPT conversations.</p>
<p>For long-running or sensitive threads, having the exact time a message was sent improves clarity, emotional context, and continuity. It helps both the model and the user avoid misunderstandings about timing (like, night vs. day, time between replies, or multi-day situations).</p>
<p>This can also support users with health issues, legal timelines, documentation, or crisis patterns by allowing more accurate context.</p>
<p>A simple toggle to show or hide timestamps would make this feature useful without overwhelming the interface.</p>

    <div>
        <p>This month I sold my 2021 M1 Max Macbook Pro and bought a Framework 13 DIY Edition laptop. After I got everything setup I sat down to write about the experience. Some ~4500 words later I realized I needed to break my thoughts into multiple posts.</p>
<p>See also:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.matthewbrunelle.com/framework-13-diy-edition-hardware-thoughts/">Framework 13 DIY Edition Hardware Thoughts</a></li>

</ul>

<p>My new Framework 13 laptop just arrived. After I finally set everything up I started writing a post about the experience. I thought I'd write a <em>little bit</em> about my previous laptops, but a lot of fond memories I had forgotten about came flooding back. The tinkerings and many openings of laptops past. If you will indulge me, I've been feeling nostalgic. This is for the other laptop weirdos out there that that feel the same.</p>

The only image I could find of my NC10 was this blurry, 2021 flip phone photo of me removing the windows sticker.</p>
<p>In 2008, I managed to get my hands on a Samsung NC10 Netbook in a fancy metallic blue color. [^ Back when netbooks where a thing circle 2007-2013] Prior to this I only had desktops. The specs were pretty humble (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_NC10?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">from wikipedia</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>A single core 1.6 GHz Intel Atom N270</li>
<li>Integrated Intel GMA 950 graphics</li>
<li>1 GB DDR2 RAM</li>
<li>10.2 inch 1024x600 screen and a <em>VGA connector</em> of all things.</li>
<li>83-key keyboard rather than the usual 87 or 88 keys on a laptop.</li>
<li>A 160 GB HDD</li>
</ul>
<p>Something could be done about that though! You could <a href="https://replacethatpart.com/how-to-upgrade-memory-ram-of-the-samsung-nc10-a-complete-guide-2/?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">upgrade</a> the RAM to a powerful 2GB. You could replace the slow HDD with an SSD. You could <a href="https://liliputing.com/touchscreen-kit-for-the-samsung-nc10-and-other-netbooks/?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">add a touch screen</a>. You could <a href="https://www.atmasphere.net/archives/2009/01/15/the-samsung-nc10-hackintosh?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">make a Hackintosh</a> out of it if you replaced the wifi card. If you wanted to, you could do those things and I was a weirdo, so I did!</p>
<p>I found a lot of fun in trying to get as much as I could out of that hardware. In fact I'd say the act of doing all that was far more enjoyable than actually using the laptop once the tinkering was done. After the novelty and slowness of a Hackintosh wore off I put Linux on the Netbook. I still sought the thrill of the hunt.</p>
<p>I installed a lite weight distro <a href="https://crunchbang.org/?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">CrunchBang</a> [^ or just #!] and messed around. I read more about different minimalist distros and came across two others I could hop to: Arch and Gentoo. This feels like an inflection point in my life, I choose to try Arch since I wouldn't have to compile everything on a single core. [^ Who know what would have happened if I picked Gentoo. I might have a beard now.] The screen was small and I wanted to maximize its usefulness so I started trying tiling WMs. Why not <a href="https://xmonad.org/?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">XMonad</a>?</p>
<p>It turns out the GMA950 was undervolted on the NC10. Someone made a shareware tool called the GMABooster that could restore the max clock rate. The original website <a href="http://www.gmabooster.com/home.htm?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">http://www.gmabooster.com/home.htm</a> is long toast and not on wayback. This <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=81429&amp;ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">Arch forum thread</a> has details though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It allows a user, not a manufacturer to choose the desired GMA speed. It combines a sophisticated assembler-level technology and the user-friendly graphic user interface, offering You to near double the GMA core perfomance without even a need to restart a computer..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The package was on AUR so I could squeeze out a little more performance. I could finally watch 480 YouTube videos instead of 360. At some point, long after I had stopped using the netbook, the AUR package became abandoned. I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150802113711/https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gmabooster/">adopted it as maintainer</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ciferkey/GMABooster_Linux?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">mirrored</a> the binary in GitHub. This was the first time I ever was a package maintainer. [^ I am on a couple random packages in nixpkgs now.] Nowadays the package is memorialized in the the <a href="https://github.com/aur-archive/gmabooster?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">AUR archive</a>.</p>
<p>I had a device that I could repeatedly break and remake. Did I do anything productive or meaningful with it? Absolutely not. Did I learn a lot in the process? I'd say so!</p>

<h3 id="in-the-past-you-could-do-terrible-things-to-macbooks-too">In the past you could do terrible things to Macbooks too</h3>
<p>When I went to College I got a 2011 Macbook Pro. The kind that would overheat and desolder the GPU. [^ Some clever people have found hardware hacks to repair the problem <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2017/fixing-2011-macbook-pro-booting-grey-screen-amd-radeon-video-glitch?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2017/fixing-2011-macbook-pro-booting-grey-screen-amd-radeon-video-glitch</a>] Mine managed to last a long time and didn't need replacing until 2019. The RAM was not built-in yet on Macbooks. Apple said the model could only support up to 8GB total RAM, but you <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/259351?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">could actually</a> get 16GB to work. Also, this was back when Macbooks had CD drives. I replaced the my drive with an <a href="https://eshop.macsales.com/item/Western%20Digital/DDMB5KT1.0/?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">Other World Computing DIY Optical Drive to HDD Upgrade Kit</a>. [^ And you could put the drive into an "OWC SuperSlim" enclosure to turn it into a USB CD drive.] and installed SSDs in both slots. With two drives I was able to install rEFInd as a boot manager and triple boot:</p>
<ul>
<li>OSX as a stable install for my course work</li>
<li>Windows for games</li>
<li>Linux so I could break my install repeatedly</li>
</ul>
<p>I iterated on my Arch install so many times that I started to keep a checklist about my setup process to help me remember everything. Certain stylistic choices were set and still used to this day. [^ This is when I started using Inconsolata for a monospace font and Zenburn for a color scheme.] I couldn't change quite as many things about this laptop, but I still made an effort to change what I could.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="as-laptops-grew-thinner-they-grew-more-boring">As laptops grew thinner they grew more boring</h3>
<p>When it came time for a new laptop I was not looking at Macbook Pros anymore. Apple had made changes, like the touch bar and removing magsafe, that felt like they were targeting a different audience. So instead I had been eyeing a ThinkPad.<br>
[^ It's almost cliche to buy one and install Linux.] The prices on the Lenovo store are mostly made up and constantly discounted. My housemate had access to a corpo portal for Lenovo that let me get one at a heavily reduced price. The cost of 3 year service coverage was also discounted so I got some figuring it could help to cover cost of parts if if something failed.</p>
<p>So I bought a Gen 7 X1 Carbon and... I just used it. No mods were possible on this laptop. When I had an SSD failure I asked Lenovo if they could mail me the drive so I could do the install. They said they had to send someone to confirm the issue. So a technician came out and replaced the drive.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-gift-and-curse-of-a-free-macbook-pro">The gift and curse of a free Macbook Pro</h3>
<p>Finally in 2023 I was <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/company-news/a-message-from-hubspot-ceo-yamini-rangan?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">laid off by HubSpot</a>. Part of severance was the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Laptops &amp; WFH Set-Up: Impacted employees may keep their HubSpot laptops (it will be cleaned of any company data remotely), as well as any work from home gear like monitors and keyboards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus a pretty high spec 2021 M1 Max Macbook Pro fell into my lap. I gave my X1 Carbon to a friend to avoid creating yet more ewaste that sits in my closet.</p>
<p>The 2021 version was a bit of return to form: touch bar was gone, magsafe was back, etc. However even the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/54122/macbook-pro-2021-teardown?utm_source=M1MBPTD&amp;utm_medium=Annotation&amp;utm_campaign=YouTube">iFixit review</a> said the "design represents a major move in the right direction" but still only rated the laptop a 4/10  for repairability. [^ The score was eventually updated to a 5/10 when Apple later released a service manual and access to parts.]</p>
<p>I felt some dissonance though. If I was looking to buy a laptop, I wouldn't have picked this one. macOS was getting less enjoyable to use with each update. Likewise the Linux Desktop experience was really coming into its own. [^ By 2023 essentially all my games were playable!] However I felt bad about buying a new laptop when I now had a perfectly good one. So I held onto it and once again, no mods were done or could be done with this laptop.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="finally-buying-a-framework-13">Finally buying a Framework 13</h3>
<p>I had waited on getting a Framework laptop because I wanted to see them go through a couple iterations. I wanted to see if the promise of repairing, replacing and upgrading actually came true. From what I read it mostly has! [^ People with Framework 15 do seem to be waiting though.]</p>
<p>What changed the decision for me was the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lugging around a powerful 16 inch laptop was a drag. Having a laptop when traveling is nice if I need to hurriedly rebook something. Mobile sites and apps tend to restrict you in weird ways.</li>
<li>Despite being a couple years old, the laptop was still worth a lot. People probably want Macbooks for local LLM inference. So I felt pretty good a buyer will actually use the laptop.</li>
<li>The Framework release a refresh of the 13 with the new AMD chips.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I had a friend get Laptop 13 and attest to liking it. That was the last push I needed to finally buy one. Now I can be a laptop weirdo again.</p>
<p>You can't change the RAM on laptops now.<br>
You can't change the SSD on laptops now.<br>
You can't easily repair the screen on laptops now.</p>
<p>You can do all that and more with a Framework laptop.<br>
You can be a laptop weirdo with a Framework laptop.</p>
<p>Weirdo typically has two interpretations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A possibly dangerous person.<br>
A strange, odd, eccentric person.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To both of those I say: all us laptop weirdos can now put a <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/the-snack-drawer-store-now-made-with-real-snacks/43101?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">snack drawer</a> in our laptops.<br>
You cannot stop us.</p>

<p dir="auto">We implement white-box SLA training by aligning the predictions of the SLA-enabled model with those of the full-attention pretrained model. Unlike black-box training in the original paper, which tunes the pretrained model using diffusion loss, white-box training mitigates distribution shift and is less sensitive to the training data.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>




<p>by 
  on December 23, 2025
</p>




<p>I <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2025/nov/06/juggluco-foss-continuous-glucose-montior-diabetes/">wrote
    last month</a> about my diabetes diagnosis this year and my
  difficult choice to wear a proprietary device (called a
  <acronym title="continuous glucose monitor">CGM</acronym>) on my arm 24/7
  to continuously monitor my glucose levels. Like my friend and colleague,
  Karen M. Sandler — who previously made a much higher-stakes choice to
  receive a proprietary implanted defibrillator to keep her safe given her
  genetic heart condition — I reluctantly chose to attach proprietary
  hardware and software to my body.</p>

<p>The device itself is quite proprietary, but fortunately
    the <acronym title="Free and Open Source Software">FOSS</acronym>
    community has reverse engineered its activation and data collection
    protocols — creating an Android application that does a better job
    than the manufacturers' proprietary ones<sup><a id="return-juggluco-previous-post" href="#footnote-juggluco-previous-post">0</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Here in the USA, we strangely use capitalism as the center of our health care system. Two major for-profit competing brands of <acronym title="continuous glucose monitor">CGM</acronym> are
  available here.  My diabetes specialist prefers the (ironically named)
  Freestyle Libre Plus from Abbott.  I (also rather strangely) bring a prescription
  for <em>electronics</em> to a pharmacy every month. On 2025-12-03, that pharmacy sent me an alarming text message (shown here). </p>

<h3>Abbott Killed Seven Patients</h3>

<p>After reading that text, I
  found <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-recalls-and-early-alerts/early-alert-glucose-monitor-sensor-issue-abbott-diabetes-care">the
  USA <acronym title="Food and Drug Administration">FDA</acronym> announcement</a>.  My spouse cross-referenced the lot numbers while I read them off from all my Freestyle boxes<sup><a id="return-no-match-abbott-site" href="#footnote-no-match-abbott-site">1</a></sup>.  I had indeed recently worn an
impacted device!</p>

<p>Only because my diabetes is so early of a stage was I relatively safe.  The FDA
  reports that Freestyle injured over 700 people  and <strong>killed seven
  people</strong> with this bug.  Specifically, the bug caused the device to falsely report an
  <em>extremely low</em> glucose level.  Advanced stage diabetics use low
  reading information to inform them that they may have too much insulin
  currently.  The usual remedy is to eat something sugary to raise glucose in the blood. 
   Such should be done only with great care, as a false low reading can harm and even kill the patient (who eats a high-sugar-content item while glucose in the blood is, in fact, not low).</p>
  
<p>Proprietary software in medical devices harming patients is not new.  In
  1985,
  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25#Problem_description">Therac-25
  killed three people</a>.  In 2020, hundreds of patients who relied on a financially troubled tech startup found their occular implants suddenly unsupported. Some patients went <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/bionic-eye-obsolete">blind as the devices powered down without updates</a>.  There are more examples that I could include here, but rereading these horrific stories is frankly more than I can take right now when I think of fellow diabetes sufferers who were “killed by code” recently..</p>


<h3>Would FOSS Have Saved Patients' Lives?</h3>
                              
<p>It's hubris for activists to guarantee that harm would be prevented if Freestyle had publicly released the
  hardware specifications and the complete, corresponding source code
  (<abbr>CCS</abbr>).
  <acronym title="Free and Open Source Software">FOSS</acronym> isn't immune to bugs —
  even dangerous ones.  However, in the centuries since the Enlightenment, we
  know that the scientific method <em>depends</em> on public disclosure about
  data and wide-reaching peer review of past work.  FOSS (plus a publicly disclosed
  hardware design) wouid allow the millions of hardware and software engineers to
  peer-review the integrity, security, and safety of the devices to which
  patients entrust their lives.  We achieve the promise of humanity when we
  each entrust our safety and health to our entire community — not
  merely a single for-profit entity.</p>

<p>We also will probably never know whether this issue was in hardware or
  software.  The bug disclosure is incredibly vague, and it remains unclear
  how much investigation was done (if any) by government regulators into this
  problem.  As a public policy and public health matter, the
  public <em>deserves to know</em> the technical details (software and
  hardware) of both the functioning device and the failed devices.  NGOs should be permitted to perform
  their own investigations and confirmations of public safety.</p>

<h3>What's Next?</h3>

<p>Given that the hardware, software, and medical for-profit industries
refuse to put the rights, safety and security of patients first, wrongful
death lawsuits are typically the only way to hold these companies
  accountable.  Yet, there are <em>very few</em> people who have not agreed
Abbott's toxic terms of their
  proprietary companion application — I guestimate 
that fewer than 1% of
  Freestyle-using patients have used Juggluco from their very start (and
  thus never agreed to Abbott's terms).  This is significant because Abbott <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/videos/2025-09_Abbott-Freestyle-Libre-Plus-App-Agreement.pdf#page=78">includes a
  comprehensive one-way indemnity for themselves in the terms</a>.  I hope that a
  class action suit begins soon on this matter, but I wonder and worry that
  so much of the class may have signed this indemnity (which may make the road to justice
  bumpier).</p>

<p>Finally, I want to offer that if there is anyone out there who does
  tear-downs of extremely tiny electronic devices, I would be thrilled to
  find a volunteer who would like to see if we can either extract any
  software components from the device, or reverse-engineer the hardware.  I
  have saved and sanitized all of my prior <acronym title="continuous glucose monitors">CGMs</acronym>.
  I'd gladly send one along
  to anyone who wants to give a try at taking them apart. (Contact SFC or <a rel="me" href="https://fedi.copyleft.org/@bkuhn">contact me on the Fediverse (via Mastodon)</a> if you're available to do this work.)</p>

<p>For my part, I look forward (after the <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/vizio">Vizio</a> trial) to
 sending some patches to
  Juggluco and also getting Juggluco available in F-Droid.  Our best option in the face of
  these powerful medical device companies curtailing our rights is to invest
  our volunteer time into the edges where
  <acronym title="Free and Open Source Software">FOSS</acronym> has
  resiliently worked around the constant roadblocks erected by bad

<p><img src="https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/spedometer.jpg" width="1200" height="800" alt="Post image for Maybe the Default Settings Are Too High"></p>
<p>I’ve been reading <em>Lord of the Rings</em> for two months and I’m just at the end of the first part. It’s not because I’m not enjoying it. It’s one of the most enjoyable reading experiences I can remember.</p>



<p>From the beginning, I’ve read the whole thing aloud. I’ve found reading <a href="https://www.raptitude.com/2024/09/in-favor-of-reading-aloud/" data-type="post" data-id="13233">aloud helpful</a> for staying engaged — limiting myself to mouth-speed rather than eye-speed means I won’t rush, miss important details, and then lose interest, which has <a href="https://www.raptitude.com/2021/10/how-to-level-up-instead-of-plugging-away/" data-type="post" data-id="11131">always been a problem</a> for me.</p>



<p>At first I was anxious to read a 1,500-page book this way, because it would take so long. But, as someone pointed out to me, if I’m enjoying it, why would I want to be done with it sooner?</p>



<p>So I tried slowing down <em>even more</em>, and discovered something. I slowed to a pace that felt almost absurd, treating each sentence as though it might be a particularly important one. I gave each one maybe triple the usual time and attention, ignoring the fact that there are hundreds of pages to go.</p>



<p>This leisurely pace made Middle-Earth blossom before my eyes. When I paused after each comma, and let each sentence ring for a small moment after the period, the events of the story reached me with more weight and strength. That extra time gave space for Tolkien’s images and moods to propagate in my mind, which they did automatically.</p>



<p>Some part of me still wanted to rush and get on with it, to make good time, to gloss over the songs and lore to get to Moria and Mount Doom and the other marquee moments of the story. But the more I ignored that impulse, the better the experience got.</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lotr-text.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="300" height="179" src="https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lotr-text-300x179.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lotr-text-300x179.jpg 300w, https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lotr-text-292x174.jpg 292w, https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lotr-text.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a><figcaption><em>Images just waiting to propagate</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>By offering the book about triple the usual amount of attentiveness, I was getting about triple the <em>storyness</em> (i.e. meaning, engagement, literary pleasure). Whatever the thing is that I’m seeking when I pick up a novel in the first place, there’s much more of it available at this pace.</p>



<h3>Eating Comprehension</h3>



<p>This effect reminded me of a paradox around eating I recognized long ago. When you slow down your eating speed, say to half or a third your default speed, you get much more enjoyment out of a smaller amount of food. The extra attention given to each bite allows more of the “good stuff,” whatever that is exactly, to reach you.</p>



<p>What’s paradoxical is that it’s precisely the seeking of that “good stuff” that normally drives me to eat so quickly, and miss most of what I’m seeking. When you try to barrel ahead to access the good stuff quicker, you get less of it in the end. Slow down and much more of it is released.</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cookie.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="300" height="292" src="https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cookie-300x292.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cookie-300x292.jpg 300w, https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cookie-197x192.jpg 197w, https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cookie.jpg 663w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a><figcaption><em>I have so much love to give, if you would just take your time</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>And it’s released automatically, in both reading and eating. You don’t have to search it out. The good stuff (the meaning in the text, the pleasure in the eating) just rises up to meet you in that extra time you give it. Slowing down, and offering more time to the act of consumption, immediately increases reading comprehension (and eating comprehension).</p>



<p>Both are analogous to slowing down while you vacuum a carpet. If you pass the vacuum head too quickly, you miss half the dirt. Slow down, and you can hear how much more grit is sent skittering up the tube. The suction and bristles are working, but they need more time to do their work fully, to draw up the deeper-lying stuff.</p>

<h3>Question the default settings</h3>



<p>It seems that my default consumption speeds for reading and eating (and maybe everything else) reduce the rewards of those things significantly, undermining the point of doing either.</p>



<p>Part of it is my own impatience. But I also suspect that modern living, with its infinite supply of consumables, tends to push our rate-of-intake dials too high. I’m not going to run out of books, or snacks, or opportunities to learn something. There’s always more, so not every crust of bread or printed page needs to be appreciated fully.</p>



<p>Internally though, the mind is juggling like <a href="https://youtu.be/A2x8N4DjxnE?si=V6lHIhJjRtfodtO3&amp;t=64">Lucy and Ethel on the conveyor belt at the chocolate factory</a>. Our receptors for meaning and appreciation, like the vacuum head, need more time to do their full work, to make all the connections they’re designed to make.</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lucy-chocolate-factory.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="175" src="https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lucy-chocolate-factory-300x175.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lucy-chocolate-factory-300x175.jpg 300w, https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lucy-chocolate-factory-768x449.jpg 768w, https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lucy-chocolate-factory-292x171.jpg 292w, https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lucy-chocolate-factory.jpg 1000w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a><figcaption><em>Your mind, reading Dostoevsky like it’s Stephen King</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>It might sound like I’m just offering clichés – less is more, stop and smell the roses, take your time – and I guess I am. But clichés suffer the same issue: they are often profound insights, consumed and passed on too rapidly for their real meaning to register anymore. You really should stop and smell roses, as you know if you’re in the habit of doing that.</p>



<p>At least see what happens when you reduce your consumption speed – of anything, but especially books, information, and food – by a half, or two thirds. Notice that (1) something in you really wants to plow through at the highest viable setting, and (2) how much more of the reward is released when you slow down anyway.</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/dune-slow-blade.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="860" height="366" src="https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/dune-slow-blade.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/dune-slow-blade.jpg 860w, https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/dune-slow-blade-300x128.jpg 300w, https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/dune-slow-blade-768x327.jpg 768w, https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/dune-slow-blade-292x124.jpg 292w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px"></a><figcaption><em>Only the slow blade penetrates the classic novel</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>As far as I can tell, almost everything becomes more satisfying when you give it more time and intention, even things like checking the mailbox or writing a shopping list.</p>



<h3>Speed alters taste</h3>



<p>Slowing down your rate of consumption will inevitably change what you <em>want</em> to consume. Reading throwaway news articles or AI slop with great care and attention is only going to show you how empty of value it is. Reading dense writing in inky old books, crafted for your mind by great masters, becomes easier without the rushed pace, and the meaning just blooms out of it.</p>



<p>Same with food. Try to savor a cheap, waxy “chocolate” bar, or a bag of store-brand cheese puffs, and you discover a harsh taste that you don’t want to look at too closely. Enjoy a homemade pastry with great attention, and discover there’s even more in it than you realized.</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cheapchocolate.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="136" src="https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cheapchocolate-300x136.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cheapchocolate-300x136.jpg 300w, https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cheapchocolate-292x132.jpg 292w, https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cheapchocolate.jpg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a><figcaption><em>You do not want to look closer</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Mass production is good in so many ways, but the faster we tend to consume its fruits, the more we end up seeking things for their glossy, candied surfaces. The more we go for these surface-level rewards, the more the culture focuses on offering only that part – such as TikTok videos, processed food, CGI-forward movies, and public discourse in the form of unexamined talking points.</p>



<p>Who knows how far we’ve drifted from the best modes of consuming the things we value. Once something becomes a norm, it seems like an appropriate standard, no matter how much has been lost. Apparently, <a href="https://bookriot.com/when-reading-went-silent/">reading silently and alone was unusual</a> until as late as the 18<sup>th</sup> century. Certainly sit-down meals and cooking at home were.</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/medieval-text.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="209" height="300" src="https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/medieval-text-209x300.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/medieval-text-209x300.jpg 209w, https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/medieval-text-712x1024.jpg 712w, https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/medieval-text-768x1105.jpg 768w, https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/medieval-text-133x192.jpg 133w, https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/medieval-text.jpg 800w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 209px) 100vw, 209px"></a><figcaption><em>Nobody reading this at 50 pages an hour</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>I don’t mean to sound like a scold. Let’s say none of this is morally good or bad. It’s just that in so much of what we do, we could be getting much more of the part of it that we really seek — but it’s only available at slower speeds.</p>



<p>If you’re curious, try consuming things more slowly, so slowly it seems silly to others — say a third your habitual speed — and see what rises up to meet you.</p>

<h2>Want to quit something in January?</h2>



<p>Recently I opened a discussion forum for Raptitude readers who want to give something up for the month of December (alcohol, social media, snacks, etc).</p>



<p>It’s been a real success, and many people want to do something similar in January. If you want to quit something, or just give it up for a month, you’re invited to join.</p>

<p>On a Google support page, the company says it is rolling out a new option to let users change their email address even if it is an “@gmail.com” address.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/12/23/google-one-2026-offer/">Google One discounting annual 2 TB and AI Pro plans by 50%</a></li>
</ul>



<p>For quite some time now, Google has allowed users to change their account email address if they are using a third-party email address, but users with an “@gmail.com” address are left unable to change it, as Google <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/19870?dark=0&amp;sjid=13129471057818824497-NA&amp;hl=en#zippy:~:text=If%20your%20account%27s%20email%20address%20ends%20in%20%40gmail.com%2C%20you%20usually%20can%27t%20change%20it.">says</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If your account’s email address ends in @gmail.com, you usually can’t change it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It appears this is changing.</p>



<p>On the same support page that currently says that you usually can’t change your email, Google is detailing a new process that is “gradually rolling out.” The altered page weirdly <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/19870?dark=0&amp;sjid=13129471057818824497-NA&amp;hl=hi#zippy">only shows in Hindi </a>at the moment, meaning you can’t see the changes in English. Everything quoted below is translated. The page was first spotted in the “Google Pixel Hub” group <a href="https://t.me/PixelHubUpdates/4453">on Telegram</a>.</p>	
	



<p>Google explains:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The email address associated with your Google Account is the address you use to sign in to Google services. This email address helps you and others identify your account. If you’d like, you can change your Google Account email address that ends in gmail.com to a new email address that ends in gmail.com.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is new functionality that Google hasn’t detailed elsewhere yet, but says is “gradually rolling out to all users.”</p>



<p>With this change, Google will allow users to change their “@gmail.com” email address to a new “@gmail.com” address with an altered username. After changing, Google details that your original email address will still receive emails at the same inbox as your new one and work for sign-in, and that none of your account access will change. Users will be unable to change or delete their email within 12 months of the change.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>When you change your Google Account email address from an email address ending in gmail.com to a new email address ending in gmail.com:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>The old email address in your Google Account that ends with gmail.com will be set as an alias.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=alternate_emails">Learn more about alias email addresses</a>&nbsp;.</li>



<li>You will receive emails at both your old and new email addresses.</li>



<li>Data saved in your account, including photos, messages, and emails sent to your old email address, will not be affected.</li>



<li>You can reuse your old Google Account email address at any time. However, you can’t create a new Google Account email address that ends with gmail.com for the next 12 months. You can’t delete your new email address either.</li>



<li>You can sign in to Google services like Gmail, Maps, YouTube, Google Play, or Drive with your old or new email address.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>Each account can only change its “@gmail.com” address <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/19870?dark=0&amp;sjid=13129471057818824497-NA&amp;hl=hi#zippy&amp;zippy=%2C%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%A8-google-%E0%A4%96%E0%A4%A4-%E0%A4%95-%E0%A4%88%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%B2-%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%A4-%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%A8-%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%B0-%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%B2-%E0%A4%9C-%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%A4-%E0%A4%B9:~:text=up%20to%20a%20total%20of%20three%20times.">up to 3 times</a> for a total <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/19870?dark=0&amp;sjid=13129471057818824497-NA&amp;hl=hi#zippy&amp;zippy=%2C%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%A8-google-%E0%A4%96%E0%A4%A4-%E0%A4%95-%E0%A4%88%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%B2-%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%A4-%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%A8-%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%B0-%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%B2-%E0%A4%9C-%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%A4-%E0%A4%B9%2C%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%AF-google-%E0%A4%96%E0%A4%A4-%E0%A4%95-%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%8F-%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%8F-%E0%A4%88%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%B2-%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%A4-%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%A8-%E0%A4%95-%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%88-%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%AE-%E0%A4%B9:~:text=Yes%2C%20you%20can%20create%20up%20to%20three%20new%20email%20addresses%20for%20your%20Google%20Account%20that%20end%20with%20gmail.com.%20This%20way%2C%20you%27ll%20have%20a%20total%20of%20four%20email%20addresses.">of 4 addresses</a>.</p>



<p>Google further details that your old Gmail address will still appear in some cases, and “won’t be immediately reflected in older instances” such as events on Calendar created before the change. You’ll also still be able to send emails from the old address. The old address remains yours and cannot be used by another user.</p>




	<p>The page is very detailed on the process, but the changes just aren’t live yet. Presumably, this support page detailing the process in Hindi went up a little earlier than intended, but it certainly seems that we’ll be hearing more about this change in the coming weeks.</p>



<p>When the functionality goes live, users will be able to change their Gmail address <a href="http://myaccount.google.com/google-account-email">via “My Account.” </a></p>



<p>We’ll update this article if further information comes out.</p>
