My parents are of hardscrabble rural West Virginia and rural North Carolina origins. They barely managed to claw their way to the bottom of the middle class by the time they ended up in Virginia. Unfortunately, due to the demons passed on to them by their parents, my father was an alcoholic and my mother participated in the drinking. She ended up divorcing my father when I was 16 years old. It was only after the divorce that my parents were able to heal themselves, heal their only child, and stop the drinking, which was so destructive to our family. If the divorce hadn't forced the issue, alcohol would have inevitably destroyed us all. </p><p>My parents may not have done everything right, but they both unconditionally loved me. <strong>They taught me how to fully, deeply receive love, and the profound joy of reflecting that love upon everyone around you. </strong></p></div><p>I went on to attend public school in Chesterfield County, Virginia. In 1992 I graduated from the University of Virginia, founded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson?ref=blog.codinghorror.com">Thomas Jefferson</a>.</p><p>During college, I worked at Safeway as a part-time cashier, earning the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/minimum-wage/history?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">federal minimum wage</a>, scraping together whatever money I could through government Pell grants, scholarships, and other part-time work to pay my college tuition. Even with <a href="https://www.salliemae.com/blog/in-state-vs-out-of-state-tuition/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">lower in-state tuition</a>, it was rocky. Sometimes I could barely manage tuition payments. And that was in 1992, when tuition was only $3,000 per year. It is now $23,000 per year. <a href="https://educationdata.org/average-cost-of-college-by-year?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">College tuition</a> at a state school increased by 8 times over the last 30 years. These <a href="https://uvaro.com/blog/college-costs-vs-inflation-1982-present?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">huge cost increases</a> for healthcare, education, and housing are not compatible with the American Dream.</p><figure><a href="https://uvaro.com/blog/college-costs-vs-inflation-1982-present?ref=blog.codinghorror.com"><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/01/image-6.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="675" height="700" srcset="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/01/image-6.png 600w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/01/image-6.png 675w"></a></figure><div><p>Programmers all over the world helped make an American Dream happen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080703183923/http://stackoverflow.com/" rel="noreferrer">in 2008</a> when we built <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">Stack Overflow</a>, a Q&amp;A website for programmers creating a shared <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">Creative Commons</a> knowledge base for the world. We did it democratically, because that's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_way?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">American way</a>. We voted to rank questions and answers, and held elections for community moderators using <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked-choice_voting_in_the_United_States?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">ranked choice voting</a>. We built a <strong>digital democracy</strong> – of the programmers, by the programmers, for the programmers. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/vijaygurbaxani/2021/06/08/the-18-billion-acquisition-of-stack-overflow-aims-to-turbocharge-the-worlds-software-knowhow/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">It worked</a>. </p><p>With the guidance of my co-founder <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Spolsky?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">Joel Spolsky</a>, I came to understand that the digital democracy of Stack Overflow was not enough. We must be brave enough to actively, openly share love with each other. That became the foundation for <a href="https://discourse.org/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com">Discourse</a>, a free, open source tool for constructive, empathetic community discussions that are also Creative Commons. We can disagree in those discussions because Discourse empowers communities to <a href="https://frameshiftconsulting.com/2017/09/10/the-intolerable-speech-rule-the-paradox-of-tolerance-for-tech-companies?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">set boundaries the community agrees on</a>, providing tools to democratically govern and strongly moderate by enforcing these boundaries. <strong>Digital democracy <em>and empathy</em>,</strong> for everyone.</p></div><p>In order for digital democracy to work, we need to see each other through our screens.</p><figure><a href="https://xkcd.com/438/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com"><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/01/xkcd438_condensed_b.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="382" height="253"></a></figure><p><a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/they-have-to-be-monsters/"><u>We often behave online in ways we never would in the real world</u></a> because we cannot see the person on the other side of the screen. But as our world becomes more digital, we must extend our kindness through that screen.</p><p>I've always felt Stack Overflow and Discourse are <a href="https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">projects for the public good</a> that happen to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">corporations</a>. I probably couldn't have accomplished this in any other country, and I was rewarded handsomely for a combination of hard work and good luck. That's what the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/American-Dream?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">American Dream</a> promises us. </p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mXBMqbWcqzg?start=165&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Field of Dreams (James Earl Jones Scene) | People Will Come in 4K HDR"></iframe></figure><p><a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-field-of-dreams-strategy/"><u>We built it, and<em> people came</em></u></a>. I earned millions of dollars. I thought that was the final part of the American Dream. But it wasn't.</p><p>I recently attended a theater performance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_(novel)?ref=blog.codinghorror.com">The Outsiders</a> at my son's public high school. All I really knew was the famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f46JMzVzSB4&amp;ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">"stay gold" line</a> from the 1983 movie adaptation. But as I sat there in the audience among my neighbors, watching the complete story acted out in front of me by these teenagers, I slowly realized what staying gold actually meant: <a href="http://blog.asjournal.org/the-american-dream-reconsidered-the-outsiders-1967/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer"><em>sharing</em> the American Dream</a>. </p><p>In the printed program, the director wrote:</p><blockquote>This play is a reminder that strength lies not just in overcoming hardships but in staying true to ourselves and lifting up those around us. <p>We hope you feel the raw emotions, sense the camaraderie, and <strong>connect with the enduring themes of resilience, empathy, and unity</strong>. Whether you've read this story recently, long ago, or not at all, I hope you are able to find inspiration in the strength and passion of youth. Thank you for being part of this journey with us.</p><p><a href="https://poets.org/poem/nothing-gold-can-stay?ref=blog.codinghorror.com">Stay gold</a>.</p></blockquote><p>I <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/im-loyal-to-nothing-except-the-dream/" rel="noreferrer">believe deeply</a> in sharing The American Dream. It is the foundation of our country, the second paragraph in our <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">Declaration of Independence</a>, written by the founder of the public university I attended:</p><blockquote>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</blockquote><p>But the American Dream is not always available to every American. Its meaning can be distorted. Jimi Hendrix <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/rewinding-jimi-hendrixs-national-anthem?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">captured this distortion</a> so eloquently in his rendition of our national anthem. </p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sjzZh6-h9fM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Jimi Hendrix - The Star Spangled Banner [ National Anthem ] ( Live at Woodstock 1969 )"></iframe></figure><p>We are still trying to live up to those ideals today. In November 2024, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">enough of us voted</a> for people who interpret the dream in a way that I don't understand.</p><figure><a href="https://election.lab.ufl.edu/2024-general-election-turnout/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfe_wqbzOe_elPxK-9TqRLDAxtI2Qrd8GHAtxqtJ8DvQ87d69tFasQnClpWuRYvDP-Iofd-PDkfpQU5RayMlyDo2rlVZWzfacm-kr1aM8fZprnh_1XXkpbr63MbGUpiNNaibPmxVQ?key=gIYEBDEiC9EgZC24CSOXGvAl" alt="" loading="lazy" width="661" height="573"></a></figure><p>34% of adults in America <a href="https://apnews.com/projects/election-2024-our-very-complicated-democracy/election-2024-why-americans-dont-vote-episode-6.html?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">did not exercise their right to vote</a>. Why? Is it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_suppression_in_the_United_States?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">voter suppression</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">gerrymandering</a> causing indifference, or people who felt their vote didn't matter? The 7.6% that are ineligible to vote are mostly adults living in America who have not managed to attain citizenship, or people <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/felon-voting-rights?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">convicted of a felony</a>. Whatever the reasons, 42% of adults living in America had no say in the 2024 election. The vote <a href="https://election.lab.ufl.edu/2024-general-election-turnout/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">failed to represent everyone</a>.</p><div><p>I think many of the Americans who did vote are telling us they no longer believe our government is effectively <em>keeping America fair for everyone</em>. Our status as the <a href="https://thefulcrum.us/ethics-leadership/democracy-index?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">world's leading democracy</a> is in question. We should make it easier for more eligible Americans to vote, such as <strong>making election day a </strong><a href="https://www.actforamerica.org/act-now/Make-Election-Day-a-National-Holiday?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer"><strong>national holiday</strong></a><strong>, universal </strong><a href="https://tracker.votingrightslab.org/issues/universal-mailed-ballots?ref=blog.codinghorror.com#issues_map" rel="noreferrer"><strong>mail in voting</strong></a><strong>, and adopting </strong><a href="https://fairvote.org/our-reforms/ranked-choice-voting/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer"><strong>ranked choice voting</strong></a> so all votes carry more weight. We should also strengthen institutions keeping democracy fair for everyone, such as state and local election boards, as well as the Federal Election Commission.</p><p>It was only after I attained the dream that I was able to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM&amp;ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">fully see how many Americans have so very little</a>. This much wealth starts to unintentionally distance my family from other Americans. I no longer bother to look at how much items cost, because <em>I don't have to</em>. We don't have to think about all these things that are challenging or unreachable for so many others. The more wealth you attain, the more unmistakably clear it becomes how unequal life is for so many of us.</p><p>Even with the wealth I have, I can't imagine what it would feel like <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/11/democrats-harris-billionaire-mistake/680779/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">to be a billionaire</a><em>.</em> <strong>It is, for lack of a better word, </strong><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/01/09/trends-in-income-and-wealth-inequality/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer"><strong>unamerican</strong></a><strong>. </strong></p></div><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPKKQnijnsM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Wealth Inequality in America"></iframe></figure><div><p>In 2012, the top 1% of Americans held 24% of our country's wealth. By 2021, the top 1% of Americans held 30%.  So many have so little, while a tiny few have massive, wildly disproportionate wealth, which keeps growing. Now the global top 1% hold nearly twice as much wealth <a href="https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/richest-1-bag-nearly-twice-much-wealth-rest-world-put-together-over-past-two-years?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">as the rest of the world combined</a>.</p><p>I grew up poor in America, inspired by the promise of the American Dream that I could better myself and my family by building things <a href="https://credo.library.umass.edu/view/full/mums312-b203-i031?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">that <em>mattered</em></a>:</p></div><blockquote>Work is service, not gain. The object of work is life, not income. The reward of production is plenty, not private fortune.

My partner and I gladly paid our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_States?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">full taxes</a>, and we always planned to give most of our remaining wealth to charities when we pass, following the <a href="https://givingpledge.org/pledger?pledgerId=177&amp;ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">Warren Buffet Philanthropic Pledge</a>:</p><blockquote>More than 99% of my wealth will go to philanthropy during my lifetime or at death.</blockquote><p>I admire Buffett, but even having only a tiny fraction of his $325 billion fortune, to me this pledge was incomplete.

I am only holding back enough wealth for my children so they can afford college educations and buy a home.

<p>Here are some starting points for longer term efforts:</p><ul><li>We can support organizations making it easier for Americans to vote for a new Congress in two years and a new president in four years. My concern is damage to our democratic institutions may happen so quickly that our votes could matter even less within the coming years.</li><li>We could fund nonprofits that have a <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/about-us/our-methodology/ratings/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">proven track record</a> of protecting democratic institutions.</li><li>We could found a new organization loosely based on the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAND_Corporation?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">RAND Corporation</a>, but modernized like <a href="https://www.leverforchange.org/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">Lever for Change</a>. We can empower the best and brightest to determine a realistic, achievable path toward preserving the American Dream for <em>everyone,</em> working within the current system or outside it.</li><li>All states are shades of purple, not fully red or blue. We have <a href="https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/50343-national-policy-proposals-with-bipartisan-support?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">more in common on specific policies</a> than we realize. It would be very difficult to draw borders if we split. I know what divorce feels like, and we don't want this. Let's come together <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/09/polarization-democracy-and-political-violence-in-the-united-states-what-the-research-says?lang=en&amp;ref=blog.codinghorror.com">through our shared American Dream</a>. </li><li>We can start with change in our local communities. Vote in your own city, county, and state elections. Support local independent journalism and media. Find a local organization doing work you admire, ask what they need, and help them meet those needs. Listen to the stories of fellow volunteers, listen to the stories of the people you’re serving – that is the heart of Democracy.</li></ul><p>We've already completed the eight $1 million donations <a href="#" rel="noreferrer">listed above</a> to help those most immediately in need. Within the next five years, half of our family wealth will support longer term efforts. There is no single solution, so let's work together.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Factorio Blueprint Visualizer</h2><a id="user-content-factorio-blueprint-visualizer" aria-label="Permalink: Factorio Blueprint Visualizer" href="#factorio-blueprint-visualizer"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I love the game Factorio and I really like the look of factories after growing for many hours or blueprints after tweaking them for perfection. That's way I created a <a href="https://piebro.github.io/factorio-blueprint-visualizer/" rel="nofollow">website</a> to artfully visualize Factorio blueprints.</p>
<p dir="auto">
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/piebro/factorio-blueprint-visualizer/blob/master/examples/Rocket_Ship_1.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/piebro/factorio-blueprint-visualizer/raw/master/examples/Rocket_Ship_1.jpg" width="58%"></a>

</p>
<p dir="auto">With the website you can import Factorio blueprints as text and visualize them. You can tweak the drawing settings or create random ones.</p>
<p dir="auto">All buildings and tiles with their bounding boxes and belt, pipe, rail, inserter, wire and electricity connections can be visualized. Everything is drawn in vector graphics (SVG) to be able to view it in any resolution.</p>
<p dir="auto">With the latest update, Blueprints from Factorio before version 2.0 might not work correctly. You can import older blueprints to factorio and export them again to update them.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Open Factorio and create a blueprint.</li>
<li>Export the blueprint as text (in the upper left corner, next to the "Delete" button).</li>
<li>Go the the <a href="https://piebro.github.io/factorio-blueprint-visualizer/" rel="nofollow">website</a>.</li>
<li>Click the "Upload Blueprint" button and paste the text into the text area.</li>
<li>Now you can test new random drawing settings (using the buttons or the arrow keys) or edit the current drawing settings.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Documentation of the drawing settings can be found <a href="https://github.com/piebro/factorio-blueprint-visualizer/blob/master/drawing_settings_documentation.md">here</a>.</p>

<li>Factorio 2.0 and Factorio: Space Age are supported (Blueprints from earlier version might only work partially)</li>

<p id="speakable-summary">VLC media player, the popular open-source software developed by nonprofit VideoLAN, has topped 6 billion downloads worldwide and teased an AI-powered subtitle system.</p>

<p>The new feature automatically generates real-time subtitles — which can then also be translated in many languages — for any video using open-source AI models that run locally on users’ devices, eliminating the need for internet connectivity or cloud services, VideoLAN demoed at CES.</p>







<p>The firm didn’t say when it planned to rollout the feature.</p>

<p>VideoLAN started in 1996 as a project by students at Ecole Centrale Paris trying to stream videos across campus. Unlike many open-source projects that have struggled to survive on donations alone, VLC has maintained its free, ad-free model while expanding across multiple operating systems. The media player continues to operate without advertising, data collection, or commercial revenue streams.</p>

<p>“The number of active users of VLC is actually growing, even in this age of streaming services,” VideoLAN president Jean-Baptiste Kempf <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7282533937812258816/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote</a> in a LinkedIn post.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Exchange" rel="">Stack Exchange</a><span> is a large online crowd sourced content provider for questions and answers. The Stack Exchange network of sites includes everything from </span><a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/" rel="">cooking</a><span>, to </span><a href="https://politics.stackexchange.com/" rel="">politics</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://judaism.stackexchange.com/" rel="">Judaism</a><span> and </span><a href="https://islam.stackexchange.com/" rel="">Islam</a><span>.  In 2021, it was sold to a private equity company </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosus" rel="">Prosus</a><span> for 1.8 billion USD. Its largest asset is </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow" rel="">Stack Overflow</a><span>, a site tailored to programmers. The Stack Overflow site is a vital resource for software developers. Ideally, it makes it easy and free to ask questions and get professional assistance.</span></p><p><span>On Stack Exchange, all of the contributions on the site are contributed under a license maintained by a third party called </span><a href="https://creativecommons.org/" rel="">Creative Commons</a><span>; Creative Commons provides a license which states that licensed content must be perpetually shareable for any purpose including modification and by anyone including for-profit ventures, so long as the work remains properly attributed. This incentivizes content creation because every contributor is working on a corpus of work which is free from royalties and modification restrictions: everyone is bettering and growing the commons by using the site. The only “payment” we get out for our work is recognition: the right granted under the Attribution Clause. The Stack Exchange network is further “gameified” with rankings and reputation (a quantifiable standing) to encourage active membership and community while keeping things fun. Work hard, have a larger contribution to the commons and be recognized as such.</span></p><p><span>Alas, this minimal obligation of attribution is too much for some companies which have sought to erode this right. Right now, on Stack Overflow, </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/4616250/user4616250" rel="">Luigi Magione’s account has been renamed</a><span>. Despite having fruitfully contributed to the network he is stripped of his name and his account is now known as “</span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/4616250/user4616250" rel="">user4616250</a><span>”. As reported by one of the </span><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/332043/zoe-save-the-data-dump" rel="">moderators, Zoe, on Stack Overflow.</a></p><blockquote><p><span>I can confirm SE, Inc. were the ones to clear his name. A reason was not specified anywhere obvious. Mods have been given explicit instructions not to touch that profile. While this particular incident may be limited to SO, the implications of this affect the entire network – </span><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/332043/zoe-save-the-data-dump" rel="">Zoe - Save the data dump</a></p></blockquote><p><span>Though I’m not a lawyer, even with a guilty verdict I don’t believe Stack Exchange is freed from their contractual obligation of attribution under the Creative Commons license. However, in the spirit of the site I put the </span><a href="https://law.stackexchange.com/q/106594/218" rel="">preliminary legal question about the Creative Commons license to the experts on law.stackexchange.com</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>In order to get more information about the justification and reasoning for the unattribution, </span><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/405208/157251" rel="">I asked a question on the “meta” site that helps run the network called meta.stackexchange</a><span>. I have not received an official answer from the company.</span></p><p><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/405208/removing-attribution-because-someone-was-charged-but-not-convicted-with-a-crime#comment1350698_405208" rel="">As pointed out in a comment</a><span>, this kind of treatment is specific to Mangione,</span></p><blockquote><p><span>This situation has a very direct precedent: </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/15445285/1114" rel="">"Frosty" (Ross Ulbricht) is still attributed under his chosen pseudonym and gets to keep the 500 not-very-organic upvotes on the question he asked </a><em><strong><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/15445285/1114" rel="">in furtherance of the crime</a></strong></em><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/15445285/1114" rel=""> for which he was sentenced to life in prison and fined hundreds of millions of dollars</a><span>. – </span><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/134300/jeremy" rel="">Jeremy</a></p></blockquote><p><span>The </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Ulbricht" rel="">Ross Ulbricht</a><span> case is even more egregious because he was convicted and his old pseudonym remains with his attribution as Ulbricht desired.</span></p><p><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/405210/157251" rel="">One user hypothesizes Stack Exchange is invoking a second seldom-mentioned license that contributors grant</a><span>, many probably unknowingly. In this explanation you grant two licenses to Stack Exchange, one under the CC BY-SA, and one under an unnamed explicit license provided by the terms of use. However, even the suggestion of this “dual-license” theory being used in this case invoked tremendous push-back from users, and it was eventually subsequently deleted and hidden,</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26afb96d-ad68-4300-943f-5d5537e8d3ca_1097x400.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26afb96d-ad68-4300-943f-5d5537e8d3ca_1097x400.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26afb96d-ad68-4300-943f-5d5537e8d3ca_1097x400.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26afb96d-ad68-4300-943f-5d5537e8d3ca_1097x400.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26afb96d-ad68-4300-943f-5d5537e8d3ca_1097x400.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26afb96d-ad68-4300-943f-5d5537e8d3ca_1097x400.png" width="1097" height="400" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/26afb96d-ad68-4300-943f-5d5537e8d3ca_1097x400.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:400,&quot;width&quot;:1097,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:71460,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26afb96d-ad68-4300-943f-5d5537e8d3ca_1097x400.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26afb96d-ad68-4300-943f-5d5537e8d3ca_1097x400.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26afb96d-ad68-4300-943f-5d5537e8d3ca_1097x400.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26afb96d-ad68-4300-943f-5d5537e8d3ca_1097x400.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>This license mentioned is provided by the </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/legal/terms-of-service/public#licensing" rel="">Terms of Service</a><span> which currently reads,</span></p><blockquote><p>you grant Stack Overflow the perpetual and irrevocable right and license to access, use, process, copy, distribute, export, display and to commercially exploit such Subscriber Content, even if such Subscriber Content has been contributed and subsequently removed by you as reasonably necessary to, for example (without limitation):</p><ul><li><p>Provide, maintain, and update the public Network</p></li><li><p>Process lawful requests from law enforcement agencies and government agencies</p></li><li><p>Prevent and address security incidents and data security features, support features, and to provide technical assistance as it may be required</p></li><li><p>Aggregate data to provide product optimization</p></li></ul><p>This means that you cannot revoke permission for Stack Overflow to publish, distribute, store and use such content and to allow others to have derivative rights to publish, distribute, store and use such content.</p></blockquote><p><span>It would seem this would allow them to do whatever they want, and to relicense the content under any name under the CC BY-SA.

I got a one-year suspension today for bounties provided and revoked weeks ago? This feels like retribution for the question I asked today. https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/405208/157251  Can we look at this and come out to some more equitable arrangement? A one year suspension for giving away the fruits of my own hard earned work to encourage the use of the site seems extremely harsh.  This appears particularly egregious, because you kept doing it over a period of days, even upvoting multiple posts more than once after your prior votes had been invalidated.  If I did that my apologies, I never knew my prior votes were being invalidated. I never knew that could happen. If you wish for me not to up vote someone, please just inform me and I'll oblige. Again, where is upvoting a user against the rules? I know we have algorithmic mechanisms in place to stop botting, but I wasn't botting. I was rewarding what I felt were good contributions." srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb37ce4e-9118-4bcc-a5de-caedb4350a43_811x549.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb37ce4e-9118-4bcc-a5de-caedb4350a43_811x549.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb37ce4e-9118-4bcc-a5de-caedb4350a43_811x549.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb37ce4e-9118-4bcc-a5de-caedb4350a43_811x549.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>The policy on </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/bounty" rel="">providing a bounty</a><span> is in their user’s help documents.

Had you not posted that question and we became aware of the voting fraud situation, which we, eventually, would have, the response and suspension would have been the same.</span></p></blockquote><p>That reads to me like “yes, it was retribution.” My response to this was simple,</p><blockquote><p><span>Had I have not posted that question, you may have never been made aware of my transgressions though.

I did find all the contributions from the profile page, and I did reward all the bounties to a specific user who I felt was trying to be productive (and oblivious to any celebrity he currently has).

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.consumer.org.nz/articles/you-don-t-have-to-pay-the-microsoft-365-price-increase">https://www.consumer.org.nz/articles/you-don-t-have-to-pay-the-microsoft-365-price-increase</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42640180">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>Microsoft 365 is an all-in-one cloud service. It includes office software like Word and Excel, the storage service OneDrive and a few other miscellaneous bits and pieces. </p>

<p>Until November 2024, Microsoft 365 Personal cost $129 a year, or $12 a month. </p>

<p>Now, the price has risen to $179 annually, or $17 a month – an increase of about 40%.</p>

<p>The 365 Family plan, which includes up to six user accounts, has also risen in cost by $50 a year. </p>

<figure><img alt="Website promo image 1290 x 860  27 " srcset="https://d3c7odttnp7a2d.cloudfront.net/assets/13123/Website_Promo_Image_1290_x_860__27__medium.jpg 416w, https://d3c7odttnp7a2d.cloudfront.net/assets/13123/Website_Promo_Image_1290_x_860__27__medium%402x.jpg 832w, https://d3c7odttnp7a2d.cloudfront.net/assets/13123/Website_Promo_Image_1290_x_860__27__full_width.jpg 1010w, https://d3c7odttnp7a2d.cloudfront.net/assets/13123/Website_Promo_Image_1290_x_860__27__full_width%402x.jpg 2020w" sizes="(min-width: 38em) 830px, 100vw" src="https://d3c7odttnp7a2d.cloudfront.net/assets/13123/Website_Promo_Image_1290_x_860__27__full_width%402x.jpg"></figure>

<p>Customers have been told the price jump comes with integration of Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.consumer.org.nz/articles/generative-ai-how-it-works-and-what-it-s-good-for">generative AI</a> chatbot, Copilot, into office apps. (Think AI-generated images for PowerPoint slides or Word docs condensed into shorter summaries.) </p>

<p>But crucially, 365 plans don’t provide unlimited access to Copilot – that requires an extra $37/month subscription called Copilot Pro. Instead, the plans provide a bank of 60 credits per month, where each credit pays for one action that makes use of Copilot.  </p>

<p>Credits don’t carry over if you don’t use them – the first day of each month wipes the slate clean and resets to 60 again. On a Family plan, the credits can only be used by the primary account, not the others in the household. </p>

<p>On face value, a price hike of around 30–40% for a half-hearted implementation of an AI tool seems like a bad deal – at least for some of the tens of thousands of 365 subscribers in Aotearoa.</p>
<h2 id="article-opting-out-of-the-increase" data-sidebar-menu-item="true">Opting out of the increase</h2>
<p>There’s one way to stay on your existing plan, but it’s extremely well hidden and requires calling Microsoft’s bluff. </p>

<p>You have to pretend to cancel your plan! </p>

<p>Log into your Microsoft account at account.microsoft.com. Find your 365 subscription and select “Manage”. Then select “Cancel subscription”. </p>

<p>That’s when a new option will miraculously appear – Microsoft 365 Classic, which has no price increase or Copilot AI. In other words, it’s your old plan. </p>

<figure><img alt="Customers are presented with three subscription options – their current plan, the cheaper “Classic” plan and a “Basic” OneDrive-only plan." srcset="https://d3c7odttnp7a2d.cloudfront.net/assets/13113/Website_Promo_Image_1290_x_860__1__medium.png 416w, https://d3c7odttnp7a2d.cloudfront.net/assets/13113/Website_Promo_Image_1290_x_860__1__medium%402x.png 832w, https://d3c7odttnp7a2d.cloudfront.net/assets/13113/Website_Promo_Image_1290_x_860__1__full_width.png 1010w, https://d3c7odttnp7a2d.cloudfront.net/assets/13113/Website_Promo_Image_1290_x_860__1__full_width%402x.png 2020w" sizes="(min-width: 38em) 830px, 100vw" src="https://d3c7odttnp7a2d.cloudfront.net/assets/13113/Website_Promo_Image_1290_x_860__1__full_width%402x.png"><figcaption>Customers are presented with three subscription options – their current plan, the cheaper “Classic” plan and a “Basic” OneDrive-only plan.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Customers aren’t told about this option anywhere else. It isn’t mentioned in the official post announcing Copilot integration, the email notifying customers of the price rise or on Microsoft’s marketing website. In all three situations, only the new AI-studded versions of 365 are listed. </p>

<p>We strongly encourage all Microsoft 365 customers to consider whether they want to pay a premium for Copilot integration or would prefer to keep the service they know. As it stands, customers aren’t being given that choice. </p>

<p>We’d like to thank Consumer NZ member Rob, who tipped us off about this change and how to get around it.</p>
<h2 id="article-you-can-also-get-the-cheaper-plan-as-a-new-customer" data-sidebar-menu-item="true">You can also get the cheaper plan as a new customer</h2>
<p>To test whether 365 Classic was only available to existing customers at the time of the announcement, we signed up to one month’s worth of 365 Personal, then immediately went to cancel it.  </p>

<p>To our surprise, we were also able to access the classic plan at the old price – we just had to pay for one month at the new, higher price first. </p>

<p>So, anyone who isn’t currently on a 365 plan but might want to access Office apps or OneDrive storage in the future also needs to know about this “secret” tier to be able to make an informed decision about the best option for them.</p>
<h2 id="article-what-this-says-about-microsoft" data-sidebar-menu-item="true">What this says about Microsoft</h2>
<p>Frankly, we feel this is a flagrant breach of goodwill and trust for Microsoft’s customers. </p>

<p>It’s unethical for a company to automatically upgrade all its customers to a more expensive product they didn’t ask for – especially when customers aren’t even informed they have the ability to opt out. It’s also potentially misleading and a breach of the Fair Trading Act.  </p>

<p>It reflects the powerful market position Microsoft enjoys in this space. As long as Word remains the default word processor that everyone uses, Microsoft has consumers over a barrel and can charge what it likes for office apps. We don’t think that’s fair and would encourage consumers to consider free alternatives, like LibreOffice and WPS Office. </p>

<p>This issue also highlights how tech companies are having to smuggle recent innovations into consumers’ lives because many consumers aren’t willing to pay for new features upfront. Microsoft, in particular, has invested many billions of dollars toward its Copilot product and needs to recoup that cost somehow. </p>

<p>Rather than sneaking an extra $5 a month, perhaps Microsoft should focus its efforts on making Copilot valuable enough that its customers will actually be willing to pay for it.</p>
<h2 id="article-the-wider-issue" data-sidebar-menu-item="true">The wider issue</h2>
<p>Hiding the ability to opt out of a change to a pricier plan is a textbook example of a “dark pattern”. </p>

<p>A dark pattern is when a user interface is designed to trick users into making choices they wouldn’t otherwise make.  </p>

<p>Other instances include preselected tick boxes for extras like extended warranties when shopping online or services such as gyms that can be joined online but only cancelled in person. This particular practice is <a href="https://www.consumer.org.nz/articles/you-don-t-have-to-go-to-the-gym-to-cancel-your-membership">likely in breach of our country’s consumer law</a>, but most dark patterns are legal. </p>

<p>The Australian federal government is currently consulting on <a href="https://www.consumer.org.nz/articles/australia-is-banning-dynamic-pricing-should-aotearoa-do-the-same">a ban of unfair trading practices</a>, which will prohibit many dark patterns, including subscription traps, dynamic pricing and hidden fees. There’s no immediate plan for a similar piece of legislation in Aotearoa, but we’d like to see the same protections introduced here. </p>

<p>Dark patterns have become a particularly pressing consumer issue in the wake of subscription models taking over many industries, including the “software-as-a-service” trend that Microsoft 365 is a part of. </p>

<p>We don’t think a business should have to use deceptive designs to sell its products. Using dark patterns, like Microsoft is doing in this instance, suggests a company that doesn’t believe its products are good enough to stand on their own in the market. </p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://sidhion.com/blog/28h_days_update_1/">https://sidhion.com/blog/28h_days_update_1/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42639779">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-bvzihdzo=""> <!-- Note: `max-w` determined empirically. The `0` in the font used for body text is too wide, so I had to figure out a number that fit 2.6 alphabets in a single line. --> <article>     <p>It’s been a little over a year since I started living <a href="https://sidhion.com/blog/28h_days" target="_self" data-astro-cid-zbkkag4h=""> 28h days  </a> .
I figured it might be a good idea to write an yearly update, and doing it at the beginning of the year feels appropriate, so here we are.</p>
<p>The one-sentence summary is that moving to a 28h-day schedule is the second best thing I’ve done for my health, with the first one being to regularly exercise.
Keep reading for details, what I had to change, some important things I discovered, and some funny realisations.</p>
<p>It took me around 2 months to adapt to this new schedule.
Those 2 months were hard, trying to get my body used to the new cycle while I got super sleepy after 10 or 11 hours into the day, but also with the SO complaining that I wasn’t available to reply to messages sometimes (because I was sleeping when she was awake), which was no encouragement to keep going.</p>
<p>Things improved after I made an adjustment: if I got too sleepy before the 10- or 11-hour mark, I’d take a nap shorter than 1 hour.
I realised that on certain days, especially when I exercised during my morning, it was almost impossible to stay up the full 18h, so the nap helped me keep going while sticking to the weekly sleep schedule.
I still deploy the <em>strategic nap</em> when needed.</p>
<p>When I travel and visit friends, or friends visit me, or I make plans with people to do things over many days, it's useful to be on a 24h schedule.
This happened a few times so far, and after each one I got better at moving between both schedules.
Since they “match” during weekends, that's when I move from one schedule to another.
I discovered that it's important to stay on the same schedule for the entire week until the next opportunity to move back to the other schedule (i.e. weekends).
Napping is the key to smoothly shift my sleep schedule, and by now I'm able to effortlessly go to 24h when needed, which isn't more than 4 or 5 times distributed over an year.</p>
<p>A consequence of the shifting schedule is that words like “daily”, “day”, “night”, “morning”, “breakfast”, “lunch”, “dinner” get a different meaning and sometimes end up confusing other people.
For example, on Wednesdays I eat my breakfast around 22:00, and my lunch for that “day” falls on Thursdays around 04:00.
People have a hard time following these things, and I haven’t found an easier way to convey this kind of information to them, so I avoid talking about this with others.</p>
<p>In fact, I avoid talking about the schedule at all with others.
I’ve experienced wildly different reactions to my 28h schedule.
Some people find it amusing or a curiosity, others seem interested and end up asking a few questions, but there are those who get offended or think I’m crazy or being unhealthy and try to lecture me or get me to stop.
I’m lucky when the latter kind decide to stop talking to me or change subjects instead.
Because of these reactions, I only comment about this schedule when I need to make plans involving other people <em>and</em> they need to know why I’m not available on certain days.</p>
<p>The internal benefits more than make up for the slightly trickier external interactions.
My sleep has been the most consistent throughout the year when compared to any other year (I don’t keep track of this in any scientific way, only mental notes that I make along the way).
I feel like I have a lot of time every day, and at the end of the day I usually feel like I got a lot of things done.
My workouts got more regular, and I increased the amount of workouts I get every week.</p>
<p>Since my schedule shifts compared to the 24h one, there’s always at least one day in the week when I’m online at the same time as friends that live all over the world.
This means I can chat with people in Australia when they’re going through their day at least once a week, for example.
This is useful for meetings and/or video calls.</p>
<p>I also get to go to the gym between 05:30 and 06:00, which means way fewer people working out at the same time as me, so I never have to wait to use any equipment and the environment isn’t as noisy.
As a result, I get my workouts done faster and feel less drained after them, which is why I increased the amount of workouts per week: they became a more pleasant experience.
I still have to force myself to exercise, but there are hardly any negative experiences since I don’t need to interact with other people anymore.</p>
<p>Even small things became more pleasant.
For example, now I can open my window to let fresh air in when everyone else’s sleeping and there’s almost no noise on the street (I’m in Canada, and it’s essentially impossible to keep windows open for too long for a good part of the year since it’s too cold outside, so I can't leave them unattended).
I’ve had a lot of opportunities to watch the sun rise without forcing myself to wake up earlier.
Since my weekdays only partially overlap normal business hours, there’s less noise on average on my day.
It seems silly, but noise makes a noticeable effect on my mood, so I’m more often on better mood now.</p>
<p>Early on, one of the most important realisations I made was that I had to change my meal plans.
Since I had 6 days on my week, if I kept following the meal plan I had made for a 7-day week it would mean I'd essentially skip an entire day worth of nutrition.
As a result, I increased my daily calorie intake to compensate for the longer days.</p>
<p>Since I now live 6-day weeks, I also do certain things less often, like showering or brushing my teeth.
Brazilians <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/bathing-habits-by-country" target="_blank" data-astro-cid-zbkkag4h=""> take the most showers <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" data-astro-cid-zbkkag4h=""> <path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M12 6H7a1 1 0 0 0-1 1v10a1 1 0 0 0 1 1h10a1 1 0 0 0 1-1v-5m-6 0 7.5-7.5M15 3h6v6" data-astro-cid-zbkkag4h=""></path> </svg> </a>  out of any other people in the world, so by showering less often I'm also moving closer to the global average.</p>
<p>I still have enough opportunities throughout the week to do things that need to happen at “normal people schedule”, like getting groceries, getting the occasional meal with someone, going to the dentist, and so on.</p>
<p>In summary, 28h days have been a successful experiment for me, and I can’t see myself willingly going back to a 24h schedule again.
It’s only been a year, but I feel like I already found 95% of the “short-term changes” between both schedules.
There might be some longer-term changes, mostly associated with my health, but if these exist, they’ll likely start showing up in the next few years.
We’ll see what the future holds.</p>
<p>Until then, I’ll enjoy as much as possible this freedom that I discovered.</p>   </article> </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Salesforce will not be hiring any more software engineers in 2025 amid significant productivity boosts from AI, Marc Benioff has revealed.</p><p>The CEO and founder of Salesforce told the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xgsxi7IGMEU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">20VC with Harry Stebbings</a> podcast that the cloud giant was in the midst of doing its business plan for next year, and Agentforce – the company’s flagship artificial intelligence product – was the “only thing that really matters today”.</p> <h2 id="h-30-productivity-boost-from-ai">“30% Productivity Boost” from AI</h2><p>In a long-ranging conversation with the venture capitalist, Marc outlined the reasons why his company decided to implement the hiring freeze.</p><p>When asked if Salesforce would have more or fewer employees in five years’ time, he said he thinks the company will “probably be larger”.</p><p>But he went on to say: <strong>“We’re not adding any more software engineers next year because we have increased the productivity this year with Agentforce and with other AI technology that we’re using for engineering teams by more than 30% – to the point where our engineering velocity is incredible. I can’t believe what we’re achieving in engineering.”</strong></p><p><strong>“And then, we will have less support engineers next year because we have an agentic layer. We will have more salespeople next year because we really need to explain to people exactly the value that we can achieve with AI. So, we will probably add another 1,000 to 2,000 salespeople in the short term.”</strong></p><p>He also confirmed a focus shift in the company which many in the ecosystem have been commenting on for some time:</p><blockquote><p>“Everything needs to become about Agentforce at Salesforce – this is the only thing that really matters today.” <cite></cite></p></blockquote><p>Marc and Salesforce rarely miss an opportunity to talk up Agentforce, with the AI platform clearly becoming the company’s primary focus in recent months.</p><p>We at Salesforce Ben tested it out ourselves in early <a href="https://www.salesforceben.com/agentforce-is-now-available-on-salesforce-help-but-is-it-actually-helpful/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">December</a> when the AI became available on the cloud giant’s help portal. Our reviewer reported mixed results, finding that experienced Salesforce professionals who provided clear and detailed instructions could find use in it, while more entry-level people might make poor choices and accumulate technical debt from following an agent’s instructions.</p><h2 id="h-winter-is-coming">Winter Is Coming…</h2><p>While December is a time of celebration for many, it may be slightly less so for people working at Salesforce – which has been known to let staff go at the start of the year.</p><p>In January 2024, <a href="https://www.salesforceben.com/salesforce-announces-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we reported</a> how the ‘mothership’ was laying off 700 workers – roughly 1% of its 70,000-strong global workforce. This was no doubt heartbreaking news for many of those affected, but it was a drop in the bucket compared to the previous year’s lay-offs. In January 2023, <a href="https://www.salesforceben.com/salesforce-to-lay-off-10-of-workforce-what-does-this-mean/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Salesforce Ben reported</a> how the cloud giant was letting go of 7,000 people – roughly 10% of the entire company.</p><p>At the time, CEO Marc Benioff sent a letter to employees saying that they had “hired too many people” during the coronavirus pandemic. Tech giants like Salesforce saw huge demand for their services throughout the COVID-19 outbreak, with cloud services providing much-needed remote working options for businesses amid stay-at-home orders.</p><p>As Marc himself wrote in his letter to employees: <strong>“As our revenue accelerated through the pandemic, we hired too many people leading into this economic downturn we’re now facing, and I take responsibility for that.”</strong></p><h2 id="h-final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2><p>It remains to be seen whether Salesforce’s campaign of staff cutting following the COVID pandemic has well and truly come to an end, though nervous Salesforce staff might take solace in Marc Benioff’s words that the company will “probably be larger” in five years.</p><p>Still, with January approaching, no doubt some ‘mothership’ team members will be anxious that 2025 will see a repeat of the layoffs of the previous two years. And if the Agentforce productivity bump means no further software engineers, what else might it mean?</p> </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>With several major wildfires raging out of control in Los Angeles County, fire crews are risking their lives to protect people, homes, and a key NASA facility.</p>
<p>At the time of the writing, about 70,000 people were told to evacuate their homes as the fires erupted after a dry winter, and hurricane-force winds howling across Southern California spread the flames <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/california-wildfires/map-la-county-wildfires-palisades-eaton-hurst/3597500/">over thousands of acres</a>. Some 400,000 residents are without power, and water pressure needed to fight the blazes is reportedly failing, with hydrants said to be running dry.</p>
<p>Two people so far are reported dead, more than 1,000 structures have been destroyed, and California Governor Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency. The National Guard - along with thousands of firefighters (many of them prisoners <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.davispoliticalreview.com/article/the-use-of-inmate-firefighters-and-its-injustices">working</a> for $10 a day or less) - have been deployed to help tackle the conflagration.</p>

    

<p>"This is a highly dangerous windstorm that’s creating extreme fire risk – and we’re not out of the woods. We’re already seeing the destructive impacts with this fire in Pacific Palisades that grew rapidly in a matter of minutes," Newsom <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/01/07/governor-newsom-proclaims-state-of-emergency-meets-with-first-responders-in-pacific-palisades-amid-dangerous-fire-weather/">said</a>.</p>

        


        

<p>"Our deepest thanks go to our expert firefighters and first responders who jumped quickly into fighting this dangerous fire."</p>
<p>A crew has been deployed to protect NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which houses top science talent - not to mention the primary control stations for the agency's Mars and outer space hardware. The site is on emergency lockdown and several staff report losing their homes to wildfire.</p>

        

<p>"JPL is closed except for emergency personnel," <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/LaurieofMars/status/1877033688539468061">tweeted</a> the site's director Laurie Leshin. "No fire damage so far (some wind damage) but it is very close to the lab. Hundreds of JPLers have been evacuated from their homes &amp; many have lost homes. Special thx to our emergency crews. Pls keep us in your thoughts &amp; stay safe."</p>

</ul>
<p>"My heart goes out to those affected by the Palisades Fire in Southern California," <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/SenBillNelson/status/1877023652501151950">said</a> NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. "Many in our NASA family, including our teams at Armstrong and JPL, are affected. Grace and I are praying for their safety and the safety of the first responders battling the blaze."</p>
<p>Should the worst happen to JPL, NASA has backup plans in place. Control of the Mars rovers and spacecraft will be shifted to the Goldstone Deep Space Network just north of Barstow, California. But generations of scientific data and hardware could be lost.</p>
<p>With the fires <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/los-angeles-pacific-palisades-eaton-wildfires-01-08-25/index.html">still largely unconfined</a>, and no sign of letup from the winds spreading the blazes, the loss of JPL is looking increasingly likely. ®</p>

  <p dir="ltr" data-test-id="main-feed-activity-card__commentary">Welp, looks I might be getting expelled from the University of Washington.
&nbsp;
As many of you know, last quarter I built an initial version of HuskySwap for a class project. It was a simple app designed to help students find partners to trade spots in critical classes after they filled up. I’m sure other people have pursued this kind of thing before, but there’s no go-to solution at UW and I wanted to contribute something cool for everyone.
&nbsp;
At first it was a fun project to catch up to the latest versions of .NET and Angular with some practice implementing features around database abstraction, real-time chat, and the full stack challenges associated with things like role-based permissions. I was probably going to build it anyway, so it was great that I could actually get course credit for CSE 403.
&nbsp;
I was really proud of the MVP and excited that the people I demoed it for actually wanted to use it. So I set aside some time in my winter quarter schedule to start hardening it so I could launch ahead of spring quarter registration.
&nbsp;
Then I came across the swagger docs for integrating with the registration system. The site says:
&nbsp;
“The Student Web Service gives your application access to information in the Student database such as course data, registration data, section data, person data, and term data (general academic data).”
&nbsp;
I got excited because it sounded like they were supportive of scenarios like mine. After all, UW aspires to be top ranked in both CS and business. Of course they would F/foster :P an entrepreneurial spirit!
&nbsp;
I reached out to request an access token. I wasn’t too ambitious up front; all I wanted was read-only access to automate the course catalog import instead of having to manually enter every class. But if things went well it would be awesome to automate the process further or even find other gaps I could fill to improve the community experience.
&nbsp;
Several hours later I received an unambiguous response: a “Notice of Violation of Registration Tampering Abuse Policy”. I was instructed to take down my demo site (and its handful of fake demo classes) or else they would begin the process that would culminate with my expulsion. I had originally reached out hoping to make the school experience better for everyone and they immediately went nuclear.
&nbsp;
I’m not too worried about the threat since taking down the demo site is no big deal. But I’m a little heartbroken to see how the school views me. I thought they’d be excited about what I was pursuing—or at least that I was pursuing anything—but instead they’d rather have me simply leave.
&nbsp;
I’m scheduled to graduate in a few months and am eager to move on to projects that don’t need to be cleared with the UW Registrar. If you know of anyone looking for a full-time software engineer with a knack for getting the attention of senior leadership, please send them my way! I can start full-time in June.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://jerf.org/iri/post/2025/programming_language_ideas/">https://jerf.org/iri/post/2025/programming_language_ideas/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42637304">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Programming languages seem to have somewhat stagnated to me. A lot of
shuffling around ideas that already exist, not a lot of new ones.</p>
<p>This is not necessarily bad. Shuffling around ideas that already exist
is a natural part of refining them. Shuffling around ideas that
already exist is safer than a radical rewrite of existing
convention. Even taking a language that already exists and giving it a
new standard library can be worthwhile.</p>
<p>However, I occasionally have some ideas that may then trigger other
ideas in people, and in the interests of getting them out of my head,
I’m posting them here.</p>
<h2 id="disclaimers">Disclaimers</h2>
<p>None of these ideas are fleshed out to a specification level. Some of
these are little more than goals with no idea how to manifest
them in a real language.</p>
<p>While I mostly don’t know of languages that do these things, that
doesn’t mean I’m claiming they don’t exist, just that I don’t know of
them, because <em>of course</em> I am not intimately familiar with every
language that has every been written.</p>
<p>Some of these ideas are probably bad, even outright crazy. At least
one of them is something that I would put in the <em>known</em> bad category,
and the idea is mostly just “but what if someone could figure out a
way to fix it?”</p>
<p>Some of these are mutually contradictory and can’t live in one language.</p>
<p>In general, while I can’t control how people react to this list,
should this end up on, say, Hacker News, I’m looking more for replies
of the form “that’s interesting and it makes me think of this
other interesting idea” and less “that’s stupid and could never
work because X, Y, and Z so <a href="https://radio-weblogs.com/0107584/stories/2002/05/05/stopEnergyByDaveWiner.html">everyone stop talking about new
ideas</a>” or “why
hasn’t jerf heard of this other obscure language that tried that 30
years ago”. (Because, again, <em>of course</em> I don’t know everything that
has been tried.)</p>
<h2 id="loosen-up-the-functions">Loosen Up The Functions</h2>
<p>This idea comes from Erlang, though it doesn’t quite follow through on
it to the extent I’m talking about here.</p>
<p>A function call is a very strong primitive. There is no possibility a
function call can fail. This is so deeply ingrained into our
understanding of function calls that we can’t even see it. Note this
is not a matter of the “function returning an error” or
“throwing an exception”, this is
“the code reached for <code>strlen</code> and it <em>wasn’t there</em>”. Or in the case
of dynamic languages, not that it couldn’t “find” a particular
function but the code to <em>locate</em> it suddenly is gone.</p>
<p>The closest we get is “I ran out of memory trying to make this call”
and most of us, most of the time, just ignore that possibility.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30831309">I wrote a comment on Hacker News a while back about how network RPC
failed in the 90s when it tried to pretend to <em>be</em> a native local
function</a>. It isn’t,
and it can’t pretend to be a native local function. RPC functions have
errors that can happen that a normal function can’t have. And it’s not
just a matter of returning an error value; sometimes the error is
“this call should have taken 250 nanoseconds but it froze for a minute
before timing out”. While it’s no problem for a computer to wait for a
minute, trying to build a program on operations that may take
“somewhere in this range of 9 orders of magnitude to execute” is not a
very useful primitive.</p>
<p>Well, what if you loosen up the concept of a function until all
function calls are “looser” and <em>can</em> express all the failure cases
that also arise with RPC? This would include things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pervasively include a concept of timing out for all functions.</li>
<li>Pervasively make functions easy to wait on or skip past; in “async”
terms, solve the problem by making <em>all</em> function calls async.</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>Then, once you’ve done that, you will find that it is annoying to call
a single function and do all the error handling you need to do, so you
make that easier, with maybe scoped error handling declarations or
some more defaults or something.</p>
<p>Then, RPC really <em>can</em> be as easy as calling a function in your
program, because you lowered what a function promises.</p>
<p>Erlang implements this to some degree in its various gen_* services,
but still has a conventional concept of function call overall.</p>
<p>The downside of this is that it is questionable whether a function
call’s simplicity can be recovered to the point that programmers are
willing to use this. Ultimately, <code>strlen</code> isn’t going to fail to be
available and I probably want to just wait for it regardless, and
somehow the syntax is going to need to make that reasonably easy, even
if it’s as simple as prefixing such calls with a symbol that means
“just pretend this is local” or perhaps embedding
“yeah, this is actually a local call” into the type system.</p>
<p>Or possibly it can all be left alone and the compiler can simply
optimize local function calls when possible, which is a lot of the time.</p>
<h2 id="capabilities">Capabilities</h2>
<p>This is not a new idea, so I won’t go deeply into what it is, and I
have been told some languages are playing with it, but it is something
I’d like to see more of.</p>
<p>There’s a language called E that tried to bring this about, but my
impression is that it was built on top of Java, and that’s probably
too great a change to try to build on Java. It really needs it own
language from top to bottom.</p>
<p>The time was probably not ripe. Consider this not a claim to novelty,
but the observation that <em>maybe</em> the time is right for this now.</p>
<p>A possible hazard here is trying to make capabilities <em>too</em> much,
e.g., also trying to write Rust-style mutation controls into them. Or
perhaps that would work like gangbusters, I dunno.</p>
<p>We keep trying to half-ass bodge capabilities on the side of existing
programs, and it honestly just keeps not working that well. Maybe
instead of writing conventional code and then trying to work out
exactly what capabilities that capability-oblivious code and
programmers ended up calling for, it’s time to put this into languages
themselves.</p>
<h2 id="production-level-releases">Production-Level Releases</h2>
<p>We’ve learned a lot about production-quality releases in the past
several years. Little of this has made it back into the
languages. This has probably been a good thing, because we’ve needed
the freedom to experiment, but I think it’s time for languages to
start embedding solution to these problems into themselves so we can
harvest the benefits of solutions.</p>
<p>We really ought to be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a fully standardized logging interface now, such that external
libraries can just provide configurable logging output.</li>
<li>Built-in metrics from day one, so third-party libraries can just
provide metrics gathering and processing.</li>
<li>Build in some sort of “request context” usable for request tracing
and stuff.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an example of something that isn’t even a
“language feature”. It’s not like we need custom syntax constructs for
metrics. (Although if you’re going for a very “pure” language, maybe
some way of having some ability to ping metrics reliably without that
“counting” as impure would be helpful.) Just getting good-enough
versions of this stuff into the standard library would be enough.</p>
<p>There’s a number of these capabilities that are getting fairly mature
and could be lifted up into a new language directly, e.g. I think
“structured logging” has probably matured to this point.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of lifting into the language is that anything so
lifted becomes difficult to change once 1.0 hits. The advantage is
that the rest of the standard library and third party libraries can
integrate with it. It’s great that language X has 7 viable logging
libraries but it becomes more difficult for other libraries to build
on an assumption of what “logging” looks like.</p>
<p>This is an example of where a new language that is otherwise “just”
shuffling around older ideas could still get a leg up on its
competition. It takes a <em>lot</em> of maturity to write these interfaces,
though. For each of the things I mentioned, you really need to get a
lot of experienced devs together and make sure you’re pulling in the
best tested versions of the capability. This is, for better or worse,
not a place for some 19-year-old who has never worked with any of
these things to just splat out some off-the-cuff interface
specification that gets cast in stone. We already have that.</p>
<h2 id="semi-dynamic-language">Semi-Dynamic Language</h2>
<p>Many programmers like the convenience of dynamic languages. I spent
the first ~15 years of my career about 100% dynamic, and I’m not sure
I include myself in that set. Still, they’re pretty popular.</p>
<p>The problem is that they seem to be fundamentally slow. Some people
still discuss their performance as if it’s the year 2000 and maybe
someday we’ll get “sufficiently smart compilers”, but the reality is
that <em>immense</em> effort has been poured into speeding these things up
and it is no longer appropriate to “hope” for what may happen
someday. And the result has been… some success. Mixed success. You
can get dynamic languages to go faster, but it costs you a <em>lot</em> of
RAM and you still tend to cap out at 10x slower than C. It’s a lot of
work for a fairly marginal reward, worth it only because they’re so
popular that a 4x speedup multiplied across
“all the dynamic code in the world” is still well worth fighting for.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can go the LuaJIT route and just hack out bits of
the language that don’t JIT well. But this seems to be only minimally
popular. Other than that it’s a good idea, though.</p>
<p>But the thing about “dynamicness” is that if you look, the vast, vast
majority of it takes place at startup, or at very defined times such
as “I’m loading in a new user plugin”. Almost no code is constantly
sitting there and dynamically modifying this and that as it runs. Yet
you <em>pay</em> for this dynamicness all the time. Every attribute lookup
needs to run a whole bunch of code to correctly look up an attribute,
in case someone has modified the lookup procedure since the last time
the value was looked up, or, in the case of a JIT, the JIT’s
procedures still need to be correct <em>as if</em> this can happen all the
time, which is inevitably slower than code that can’t do that.</p>
<p>What about a language where for any given bit of code, the dynamicness
is only a <em>phase of compilation</em>? The code can do whatever during
initialization, load database tables to dynamically construct classes
or whatever, but once it’s done, there’s a point where it locks down,
becomes nearly statically-typed (not necessarily fully, you could look
at this as an incremental typing situation), and being dynamic is no
longer possible?</p>
<p>I’m not sure what all this would look like. It’s a sketch of an
idea. Partially because I’m pretty satisfied in my own programming
world with static languages.</p>
<p>But if there was a phase where everything locked down, then a JIT
would have vastly more power to optimize the code safely. JITs have to
do so much work to deal with “well <em>what if</em> someone passes in
something really pathological to this function later?” and it seems
like they could go a lot faster if they could be rigidly guaranteed by
the types in the final compiled code that couldn’t happen.</p>
<p>You may also be able to create a sort of hybrid compile phase, where
the code is not “compiled”, but you can still run something like a
“check” that verifies the locked-down program is coherent according to
whatever rules the runtime or the user want to implement.</p>
<p>While I’m not aware of anything that works exactly like what I have in
mind, it is clearly a position on a well-explored continuum of
“exactly when does compilation happen?” and not some brand-new idea. I
reiterate that I’m not making a claim that any of this is brand
new. The Common Language Runtime’s ILR and subsequent compilation on a
target system is reasonably close to this, but focused on something
different. Some Lisps may be able to do all this, although I don’t
know if they quite do what I’m talking about here; I’m talking about
there being a very distinct point where the programmer says “OK, I’m
done being dynamic” for any given piece of code. Shader compilation
for video games may have a component of this, especially including the
ability to cache compilation outputs.</p>
<p>Another view on this idea is, “Isn’t it about time someone wrote a
dynamic scripting language that was designed from <em>day one</em> to be easy
to JIT?” What we have out in the world right now is either dynamic
scripting languages where the JITs came along literally a decade or
two after the language was created, and the JIT basically had to be
instantly 100% compatible with a language that was never designed for
JIT’ing right out of the gate to be even remotely useful, or we have
LuaJIT where an existing language got bits and pieces sliced out of
it, but we don’t have anything that I know of where the language was
designed from the start to be dynamic, but still easy to JIT.</p>
<p>While you’re at it, you’ll naturally also create a dynamic scripting
language that handles threading properly from the beginning, rather
than trying to retrofit it on to a decades-old code base. A dynamic
scripting language with perhaps a 2-3x slowdown over C (or, to put it
another way, basically the same speed as Go) that is also
natively capable of near-static-language threading speeds could raise
a lot of eyebrows.</p>
<h2 id="value-database">Value Database</h2>
<p>Smalltalk and another esoteric programming environment I used for a
while called Frontier had an idea of a persistent data store
environment. Basically, you could set <code>global.x = 1</code>, shut your
program down, and start it up again, and it would still be there.
And by that I mean, storing a value persistently was literally that
easy; no opening a file and dumping JSON and loading it later, no
fussing with SQLite and having to interact with a foreign SQL
interface (which, no matter how nice that may be, is not your
language’s native paradigm), none of that. Just
“set this value and keep it forever”.</p>
<p>This… is a superficially appealing but bad idea, unfortunately.
It’s on the list of Things I See People Angrily Claim Programming
Needs To Do To Level Up, right there along with Everything Should Be
Visual Programming and the recent “Low Code” burst that seems to have
died down again. It’s an entrant that doesn’t show up often, but I’ve
seen it enough that it’s on my list.</p>
<p>But it carries some significant disadvantages,
most notably that entropy tends to attack this shared store pretty
badly. The developer sets a value in their store, then sends the code
out to production, but whoops, it turns out the code absolutely
depends on that value being set and it fails everywhere else. It’s
takes a lot of work to set up a scenario in which twiddling a <em>run-time</em>
variable for debugging in your staging environment can propagate
straight into a bug on production because of accidental dependencies
on that value, but persistent stores are up for the challenge!</p>
<p>So, my own experience certainly attests to the fact that this is far
from a magic solution to all our problems.</p>
<p>However, I still wonder if this can’t be fetched from the dustbin of
history somehow, with some sort of better controls on what goes into
these stores. Base it on event streaming? Access controls? Some sort
of structural typing system that ensures that a “table” is of some
shape directly, before trying to use values of it and failing? Just
plain typing these things?</p>
<p>Because, my gosh, what a mess you could make on the one hand… but on
the other, I can’t tell you how nice it is to just say <code>myval.x = 5</code>
and it’s just <em>there</em> as <code>myval.x</code> tomorrow, with no queries, no
mappings, no ORMs, no files, no failures… just <em>boom</em>, there.</p>
<h2 id="a-truly-relational-language">A Truly Relational Language</h2>
<p>Although, on the note of “no fussing with SQLite”, how about a
language whose fundamental data type is a relational DB table?</p>
<p>You wouldn’t actually want SQL; you’d want to go back to relational
principles and build something that works as a programming language
rather than banging SQL together. The many, <em>many</em> technologies in the
world like LINQ in the .Net world or SQLAlchemy show at least a
possibility of what that would look like, although being able to sit
down at the language grammar level to integrate this even more deeply
opens up even more interesting possibilities than LINQ.</p>
<p>(Being able to emit SQL from the language for when you really do want
to talk to an SQL database is probably a good idea. This is harder
than it looks at first glance. You definitely want to study LINQ, and consider how you
allow the user to use things like <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/select.html"><code>SQL_NO_CACHE</code> or
<code>SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS</code></a>,
because you need to be <em>able</em> to do those sorts of things to SQL even
if you don’t need them in every query.)</p>
<p>Relational databases are clearly a tech that is here to stay, yet most
modern languages still treat them as an exotic thing to be dipped into
every once in a while at great cost. Maybe there’s a special “table”
data type as the data programmers have with their “data frames”, or
you get something nice like LINQ, but the language is still ultimately
either product or sum type data structures as its native
representation and there’s always this foreign conversion step to go
from the relational data to the “real” data.</p>
<p>You know you’d have something like this when you could query across
three different data types in your code, and get the results in the
form of some ad-hoc data type specifically for that query, which could
then be natively passed around and perhaps even have methods added to
it directly.</p>
<p>In the type theory world this is heavily related to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/4f7fyn/what_are_row_types_exactly/">row
types</a>. I
am not aware of a language that uses them natively. (Although as is
often the case, if you squint hard enough at a dynamically-typed
language it can “look like” row types, but that’s again because by
punting on types entirely it can “look like” a lot of things, but in
the end if you violate the types you just get an exception thrown.)
Although there is more work to be done to make this idea work, row
types is just where I’d start. You’d still want to examine things like
“can I put methods on some sort of row type in such a way that the
method doesn’t care <em>how</em> the row type is constructed?”</p>
<p>That is, suppose you had a user ID and a username in one table, that
linked to an identity that contained their human name. By querying
across these two things you could end up with a User ID/Username/Human
Name tuple, even though that doesn’t literally exist as a data type in
your system… could you work out a way to put a method on this anyhow
that might do something like a debug dump of those three things? A
method on a datatype that never concretely exists as a declared data
type? There’s some interesting possibilities here.</p>
<p>(This also may harmonize with the JIT idea above. This would tend to
create a proliferation of possible types that some code somewhere
could use; conceivably even an infinite number of them depending on
how you implement it. Conventional generics-based precompilation may
not really be possible. But in practice there would be a finite and
generally relatively small set of those types actually used and a JIT
that could determine what those are and JIT them to native-ish speeds
could potentially recover a lot of performance out of this by not
compiling all of the myriad possible types that <em>could</em> have a
UserID/Username/HumanName in them with their static struct offsets
until the type is actually used.)</p>
<h2 id="a-language-to-encourage-modular-monoliths">A Language To Encourage Modular Monoliths</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-a-modular-monolith/">modular
monolith</a>
has been a structure that has been flying under the radar lately, but
I feel like it’s coming up more and more often. Personally, everything
I write large enough to need architecture is now a modular monolith,
and I find it a fantastic way to program at at least medium scales. I
have to admit I have not yet tried it on a truly large project. My
guess it is that it should continue to scale, albeit possibly
requiring more discipline to maintain, but it doesn’t seem to be
gassing out in my own uses yet.</p>
<p>To have a modular monolith, you need to use dependency injection and
interfaces. You write as much code as possible in terms of “Hey, this
is what I need; I need a way to turn DNS addresses into IP address,
and I need a way to turn email addresses into user accounts, and I
need this and that and the other thing”, and then you construct each
component of the modular monolith by providing each of them components
with all the services it needs.</p>
<p>I think “modular monolith” is arguably what should be the “default”
architecture for any non-trivial project.</p>
<p>However, modern languages tend to fight you on that.</p>
<p>Static languages require extensive declaration of interfaces of some
sort to do this, and as such, it requires much more discipline than
hard-wiring together everything with concrete types. As such, in real
code, lots of things end up hardwired together just due to the sheer
hassle of interfaces, even in the languages where they are the easiest.</p>
<p>Dynamic languages are nominally easier, once again because they pretty
much punt on everything, but the trade off is no compile-time guarantee
that all the services you are getting passed actually do the things
you want them to do. In practice this becomes scarier and scarier to
do as you scale up, because now every time you call a new method on
some passed-in parameter you are changing the interface for all things
passed in to that method, and there is effectively no way to notify
the callers of that method. After all this may even be a library and
you may have no human connection whatsoever to the caller.</p>
<p>I’d be interested in something that strikes a middle ground; a static
language with compile time guarantees, but one where <em>all</em> function
parameters are <em>automatically</em> interfaces, even if they are given an
“exemplar” type in their type signature. If I declare something as a
“string”, and what I do with that string is concatenate it with
another string and iterate on Unicode codepoints, what if the compiler
just automatically was able to take anything that could “concatenate
itself to a string” and “iterate on Unicode codepoints” and accept it
by treating it as if there was an interface declaration right there already?</p>
<p>(It would be interesting to see if you can get type inference to the
point that “exemplar types” are no longer necessary but working out if
that is the case is well beyond the level of work I’m doing here.)</p>
<p>Every parameter coming in to a function could have an interface
automatically extracted out of it just by what the user does to that
value. Integration through a language server could do something like
extract that interface out automatically. I don’t know if it should be
implicit and checked at compile time, or if you might want to do
something like “on save, automatically reify all interfaces into
actual declarations the human can see”. If it is left implicit we
definitely want the language server to have a command that returns
“this is the actual interface for this parameter”.</p>
<p>(On that note, not worth its own section, but I think that there’s a
lot of interesting “write a static language that assumes you’re
writing it with the language server and provides very rich querying
capabilities” like that that could be done. You see a lot of good
ideas in the best IDEs for that sort of thing but the ideas always end
up detached from the languages and eventually stranded when the IDE
line comes to an end. Collecting those capabilities up into the
language project itself and integrating the language serve right into
the design of the language at all phases should probably have some
interesting effects.)</p>
<p>I think I’d want to see something like the Python module system, where
technically, libraries themselves are objects, which means that entire
libraries could be swapped out by providing a different one.</p>
<p>You could in principle merge this with another interesting idea, which
is more extensive use of <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/static-and-dynamic-scoping/">dynamic
scopes</a> to
do something like provide a built-in service registry of things that
look like a fancy dependency-injection library, so some code can do
something like “fork my current registry, change the UserProvider to
this other object, and run this test code”. Or change the definition
of a “transaction”. Or whatever.</p>
<p>In theory, if you successfully made sure there aren’t any back doors
to this system (like “primitive types like ints are just ints and they
can’t be shimmed”), this would almost automatically make <em>any</em> system
written in it a modular monolith. Of course, it might be a super
<em>messy</em> modular monolith, but in principle any function in the system,
even though the whole thing is statically typed, could be executed in
such a way that everything it depends on, regardless of whether it was
written for being swappable, is swappable, with enough work. You could
do things like have literally <em>any</em> code that reads &amp; writes to a
filesystem be executed in a context that provides a fake file system
for testing, without the code itself having to do any explicit
declaration of that fact.</p>
<p>You’d want to block truly global variables entirely, although if you
combine them with the dynamic scope idea, you can put things in the
dynamic scope for similar uses.</p>
<p>There’s probably also some interesting synergies with structured
concurrency, and having these dynamic scopes attached to execution
contexts. Make sure your dynamic scopes also have the capabilities
that the Go contexts do and you’d end up with some interesting
possibilities.</p>
<h2 id="modular-linting">Modular Linting</h2>
<p>This is another place where I absolutely make no claims about what may
be happening in the many dozens of language communities in the
world. I’m just making an observation from one of the ones I’m deeply
into and suggesting it’s a good pattern, not that it’s the only place
it happens. Plus I’m going to say it isn’t happening enough anyhow
even where it is happening.</p>
<p>With that throat clearing, the Go world happened to end up with a lot
of various linters over the years. Eventually they were combined into
a project called
<a href="https://golangci-lint.run/usage/linters/">golangci-lint</a>, which has
become the <em>de facto</em> linter for the community. I linked to the list
of linters built in so you can see what’s in there.</p>
<p>What’s interesting about golangci-lint, though, is that the various
linters are largely independent from each other, each independent
projects written by various developers to scratch a particular
itch. They were later merged together technically, but are in
principle still just a big pile of community linters with a nice
modular interface on top.</p>
<p>This isn’t about the language at all, but it would be interesting for
a language <em>project</em> to reify that. golangci-lint eventually shared an
AST view among a lot of its linters; a project could copy that idea
and write it in early. Let linters be fully modular, perhaps even by
mentioning them by github project through a fully standardized
interface that doesn’t require them to even be “integrated” into a
single executable from a third-party project.</p>
<p>What’s neat about this approach is that if it was made a part of the
language design process, a lot of things that aren’t necessarily
<em>important</em> could be kicked to optional linting. For instance, Go was
especially a bit notorious when it first came out for mandating that
all imported packages were used, and all declared variables were
used. Complaints about that over the years have quieted down, but
that’s a good example of something that could have been taken out of
the compiler and shuffled off into a linter provided by the main
project.</p>
<p>There’s definitely some downsides too… you end up with “dialects” of
the language, but, the truth is, you end up with that
anyhow. Generally developers learn pretty quickly not to fire their
own bespoke linting configuration at other people’s libraries.</p>
<p>But it would be interesting to see how much could be kicked out to
linters, like, do you want to insist that all values of an enumeration
(whether a classic int or the later trend towards using that term for
what I think of as “sum types”) are checked in switch statements or
not? Do you want to validate your printf parameters are correct?
Do you want a linter flagging every time you use an external program
to pass your arguments through some check routine? Perhaps things like
HTML template libraries could even ship with their own linters to flag
suspicious constructs for injection, formally as part of the library.</p>
<p>This pairs in an interesting way with the parenthetical about leaning
on a Language Server more; taking the Language Server as a core part
of the project makes the language task bigger, but allowing for
community linters and kicking non-essential aspects of the language
out to the linters shrinks what the core of the language project has
to worry about.</p>
<p>This is also one of the only ideas in this list that doesn’t need to
be in the language from the very, very beginning, and could be added
either by a young language design team or even just a motivated
external developer to an existing project. Things like Python or C#
have too much inertia for a dedicated dev, but you might be able to
get the momentum in something still young like Nim or Zig.</p>

<p>In early December I got the kind of tip we’ve been getting a lot over the past year. A reader had noticed a post from someone on Reddit complaining about a very graphic sexual ad appearing in their Instagram Reels. I’ve seen a lot of ads for scams or shady dating sites recently, and some of them were pretty suggestive, to put it mildly, but the ad the person on Reddit complained about was straight up a close up image of a vagina.&nbsp;</p><p>The reader who tipped 404 Media did exactly what I would have done, which is look up the advertiser in Facebook’s Ad Library, and found that the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=all&amp;country=ALL&amp;is_targeted_country=false&amp;media_type=all&amp;search_type=page&amp;view_all_page_id=450572341476695"><u>same advertiser</u></a> was running around 800 ads across all of Meta’s platforms in November, the vast majority of which are just different close-up images of vaginas. When clicked, the ad takes users to a variety of sites for "confidential dating” or “hot dates” in your area. Facebook started to remove some of these ads on December 13, but at the time of writing, most of them were still undetected by its moderators according to the Ad Library.</p><p>Like I said, we get a lot of tips like this these days. We get so many, in fact, that we don’t write stories about them unless there’s something novel or that our readers need to know about them. Facebook taking money to put explicit porn in its ads despite it being a clear violation of its own policies is not new, but definitely a new low for the company and a clear indicator of <a href="https://www.404media.co/has-facebook-stopped-trying/"><u>Facebook’s “fuck it” approach</u></a> to content moderation, and moderation of its ads specifically.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
